	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the town of Halton Hills continues to develop with new subdivisions, making sure that trees are planted to sustain the urban forest is important. Today I would like to congratulate Halton Hills on being recognized as a Green Streets Canada Community for 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halton Hills has recognized the importance that urban forests play in the economic, social and environmental well-being of the community and will plant trees around the town. It will incorporate trees into its Earth Day events and work with the Georgetown Agricultural Society.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today in the progressive western town of Okotoks, Alberta, a group of parents and concerned citizens will do something  that the government refuses to do: their part to protect children from pedophiles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late last year Okotoks residents were stunned that two pedophiles were being released into their community.  They know what we know, that pedophiles are always dangerous and cannot be treated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Switzerland a law has just been passed mandating life sentences for pedophiles because that is the only way to truly protect children. But  this is not Switzerland, it is Canada, where a Liberal government has put protecting children permanently on a back  burner, where true democracy remains unfulfilled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okotoks residents will be collecting children's shoes to send to Ottawa in the hope that they can wake up a government that thinks the rights of pedophiles trump the rights of children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud this group.  I call on all Canadians from coast to coast to join this movement and to force the government to act.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Heart and Stroke Foundation published its  Annual Report Card on Canadians' Health. The findings of this report are very disturbing and the public should be made aware of them immediately. The foundation tells us that obesity rates are rising in our country and, together with the incidence of  diabetes, obesity is becoming a major risk factor for heart disease in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, adults are not the only ones at risk, since obesity affects a high percentage of our young people. The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada confirms that excess weight is now one of the largest public health problems we have ever faced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to see that our government has already begun to attack this new threat, for instance, by creating a major campaign to promote a more active lifestyle among all Canadians. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Eid ul-Adha is one of the major festivals in the Islamic faith during the lunar month of Zul-Hijja.  Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca to fulfill the requirement of the pilgrimage referred to as the hajj.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from being one of the five pillars of Islam, the hajj represents a significant opportunity for social and cultural dialogue by enabling Muslims from many countries to interact and better develop by understanding each other's heritage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Eid ul-Adha award by the Progressive Association of Muslims will honour the late prime minister, the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, for his lifetime devotion in the pursuit of justice and  for  creating opportunities for people from all around the world to come to Canada, the model today for a truly multicultural society. Mr. Justin Trudeau will be in attendance to accept the award on behalf of his father.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to extend an invitation to you, Mr. Speaker, and all  colleagues in the House as well as in the other place to attend the ninth annual Eid ul-Adha ceremony tonight on Parliament Hill in Room 200,  West Block from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report, as scathing and damning as it is, is not the only alarming report issued lately that condemns this corrupt Liberal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another alarming report points out Canada's agriculture industry collectively lost money last year.  That is right;  one of the industries whose back this nation was built on is in a sea of Liberal created red ink. This is a glaring condemnation of the Liberal government's failed policies and highlights the Liberals' inability to negotiate effective change on the world stage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our producers and businesses on and off the farm do not have the ability to run up a flag of convenience to protect them from the government's mismanagement.  They can only watch as their hard-earned tax dollars are ripped out of their hands and used and abused by this Liberal culture of corruption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipal governments have shown leadership.  Provincial governments have stepped to the plate. However, it has become obvious that the Liberal government is incapable of dealing with the issues facing rural Canada.  It has driven the entire agriculture industry into the red.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His passion for the beautiful Donalda, who would become the wife of Séraphin, was the topic of many conversations in our homes, and the charming and handsome Alexis was a real heartthrob for many romantic women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to having played alongside Maria Casarès, Philippe Noiret and Gérard Philippe, in France, Guy Provost was, for over 60 years, a major figure on Quebec's theatrical scene.  Among others, he played the role of Antoine Jacquemin in <i>Terre humaine</i>, Léon Tanguay in <i>Sous un ciel variable</i>, and Father Alexandre in  <i>La Famille Plouffe</i>.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this talented actor. Mr. Provost began with the Compagnons de Saint-Laurent, almost 60 years ago, and then moved to France to work under, among others, Jean Vilar, at the Théâtre national populaire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming back home, he became part of the collective imagination of our country. Whether it was in the theatre, where he was as  comfortable playing John Steinbeck's as Michel Tremblay's plays, or on television, where he played in many series, Mr. Provost's passion for what he did never wavered.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today and acknowledge a remarkable Nova Scotian, Portia White.  She was a black woman who defied the stereotypes of the time to become an internationally renowned soloist and music teacher in the 1940s.  Her interpretations of black spirituals were audience favourites wherever she performed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A singer in her father's church since she was six, Portia White trained at the Halifax Conservatory in her twenties.  There she met Ernesto Vinci, who would help Portia develop the amazing voice that took her to stages in Toronto and New York.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dartmouth's Eastern  Front Theatre, in honour of Black History Month, will premiere a new musical play, <i>Portia White--First You Dream</i>, by playwright Lance Woolaver.  The title comes from a story about the singer.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked by an American reporter how does a young woman from Nova Scotia become so famous, Portia replied, “First, you dream”. Her dream ended too soon, especially for us, since there are no recordings of her wonderful voice, but her example of hard work and determination continues to inspire us all.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having applied a code of secrecy to an incorrect response by his government, according to which his companies had obtained only $137,000 in government contracts, when he knew the contracts were worth in excess of $161 million, and having  hidden a few lines in more than 400 pages of legislation to exempt his shipping company from paying more than $100 million in taxes, the Prime Minister would now have us believe that he did not know, when everyone else knew for years, that his government managed the sponsorship program in violation of all the rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In feigning ignorance, the Prime Minister is condoning corruption. The Bloc Quebecois  will be there during the next election campaign to make sure that the public inquiry is not used as a smoke screen for the former finance minister's irresponsibility.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, with the generous support of CIDA, it used the BioSand water filter to bring clean drinking water to over 77,000 people in Cambodia for only $600,000.  That is cost efficiency. CIDA and Samaritan's Purse have also partnered to bring the same technology to Nicaragua and Ethiopia.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all busy, but we should never be too busy to see how cooperation and Canadian innovation are saving lives around the world.  I invite members to see the BioSand water filter turn river water into drinking water tonight from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Room 112N, Centre Block.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Liberal culture of corruption is alive and well.  Taxpayers' funds poured through Liberal friendly firms in Quebec.  This was a money laundering scheme hatched by the Liberal Party for the Liberal Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the Prime Minister.  Will the public inquiry be allowed to look right into the heart of the problem, the Liberal Party of Canada?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the trouble with that is that the Liberal Party is at the bottom of this problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General said that this goes much higher than she could investigate.  She was restricted to going after bureaucrats.  She could not go after the Liberal bagmen and backroom boys who are the problem here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a second question for the Prime Minister.  Will the public inquiry be able to go right into the Liberal Party and look at those individuals, those bandits, who stole from Canadian taxpayers?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way was the public accounts committee.  We wanted to ensure that there was no stone unturned, and that is why we asked for a commission of inquiry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenger jets, RCMP ponies, shady ad contracts, and five crown corporations are implicated in this huge scam.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they broke those laws and rules, they did not come to cabinet and ask to break those rules.  What they did was engage in a very sophisticated way of camouflaging what they were doing.  As a result of that, the government did not know.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister likes to pride himself on his business acumen.  If he ran CSL the way he ran his department, CSL would be a bankrupt company.  Now we are talking about a morally bankrupt government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Prime Minister not stand up and say something?  Was that stoney silence a result of the fact that he was so anxious to be the Prime Minister that he turned a blind eye to all the corruption that the government was involved in?</p>

What they did do was, for a couple of years, basically put this by; however, as soon as the rumours began there was an internal study done. </p>

She had doubts about that.  This is what she said, and the minister heard her as well as I did.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Auditor General once again exposed how the Liberals have broken trust and plundered the public treasury.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was forced to admit that his government broke the rules when it blew a hundred million dollars, money taxed from struggling Canadian taxpayers, so top Liberals could ride around in luxury jets.  Fairness to the public was trumped by Liberal greed.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General makes it clear that the normal process was not followed in this case because it was toward the end of the fiscal year and there was not time for proper analysis.  It did not go through the normal processes even though it was strictly within the rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government accepts that it should go through the normal processes. Whether it is within the rules or outside the rules or not, adequate time needs to be taken for proper analysis.  That will be the process that we will follow in the future.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has admitted that was not true, yet he appointed the very man who made this misleading statement as the nation's finance minister.</p>

Stan Keyes (Minister of National Revenue and Minister of State (Sport), Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I consider it a great privilege to stand in the House today for the first time as a minister of the Crown, and I am here to express the Government of Canada's best wishes to the people of Vancouver and Whistler as they prepare to celebrate the six year countdown tomorrow toward the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to use this opportunity to reaffirm the federal government's collaborative approach and commitment to sport and physical activity in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go any further, I would like to take a moment to recognize the hard-working and professional public servants who make up the Department of Canadian Heritage.  I am fortunate to have such a committed group of dedicated people who ensure that the government's role in sport and physical activity in Canada is focused, efficient and delivers results.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only with their continued support will the government be able to deliver on its commitments to sport and physical activity. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw to the attention of all my hon. colleagues that in only a few short years from now Canada will have a chance to showcase our commitment to excellence when we host the world at the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver and Whistler.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the throne speech said, the 2010 Winter Games are “an opportunity to reinforce participation in sport by Canadians, at the highest level and in our communities”.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sport is about teamwork and only through teamwork can we ensure that Canada wins gold in 2010.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is not alone in this.  Canada's sports system is based on partnerships and its sustainability relies upon the full support of governments at all levels, sport organizations, the private sector, communities and volunteers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosting the 2010 winter games will bring tangible benefit for Canada's developing and high performance athletes and to the country as a whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment to creating a lasting legacy will mean more than facilities.  It will be the expertise that is developed among officials and volunteers.  It will be the pride Canadians will feel in themselves, their communities and their country.  There will be the stories we will share as a nation for generations to come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The games will also give Canada an opportunity to showcase the world, not only our sport excellence, but also our innovation, culture and values. Values like inclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural component of these games, which will include a strong emphasis on the culture of our first nations, is already shaping up to be nothing short of spectacular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next six years, the 2010 winter games undoubtedly will heighten the interest of Canadians in sport and physical activity.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my overriding goal as Minister of State for Sport. I want to get more Canadians participating in sport and physical activity.  I want to ensure that the barriers to participation are reduced.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means creating opportunities in sport for more new Canadians, young people, economically disadvantaged people, persons with a disability, aboriginal people and especially aboriginal children and youth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the father of two soccer playing daughters, I can see firsthand the effect of sport on young people.  It improves their health and fitness, teaches them important life lessons, bolsters their confidence and self-esteem, and builds friendships and social skills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As member of Parliament for Hamilton West I have seen how sport can improve the lives of people whose circumstances have put them on the margins of society.</p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to work hard to remove the barriers to participation faced by specific groups, such as persons with disabilities, youth at risk, and young and teenage women. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am operating from the deep belief that sport has the ability to transform lives.  I know this belief is shared by many of my colleagues in this place.  It is my duty to ensure it is understood by all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point was hit home to me just a couple of weeks ago when I was travelling in western Canada.  While in Edmonton, I met with members of the aboriginal community there.  As members may know, Canada hosted the 2002 North American Indigenous Games.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that in the months leading up to and following that event, when many aboriginal young people were in training, there was a notable decline in the number of young aboriginals who take their lives. That is the power of sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ties in directly with our government's priorities as announced recently in the Speech from the Throne, strengthening Canada's social foundations. Sport has a unique and important role to play.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our communities come to life on their soccer and baseball fields, in their hockey rinks and on their tennis courts, and in their sailing and rowing clubs. People of all ages and all walks of life come together in activities that help them lead more healthier and productive lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Canadians involve themselves in sport, encourage the volunteerism encompassed in sport, ensure we have an ethically based sport system, and give our top athletes the support they need, we make Canada a leading sport nation. In doing all this, we reap the benefits of a healthier population, stronger communities and a broader base of participants for future excellence in sport.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do all these things by building on the commitments already laid out in the historic <i>Canadian Sport Policy</i>, the blueprint of the future of sport in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada invests $90 million a year toward initiatives both to get Canadians involved in sport and to support our high performance athletes. This investment is leveraged by our partnerships throughout the provinces and in communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians understand the value of sport and physical activity in our society. The Government of Canada, along with our partners, will work hard to ensure that more Canadians, regardless of circumstance, can realize the benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look ahead to Athens this summer and further down the road to Vancouver and Whistler in 2010, we should remember to cheer on our athletes who make us so proud as they serve as our ambassadors to the world. Their path to excellence has been made with great personal sacrifices in time and in money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we need to acknowledge the importance of coaches to the success of Canadian athletes and how they enjoy their sport, and ensure that we have world class coaching to back up our world class athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this work is going toward making Canada a leading sport nation. I am appealing to all of my colleagues in the House and to all of my fellow Canadians to help me spread the message to get active and by doing so build better communities through sport.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to offer my sincere congratulations to the minister on his appointment to cabinet.  I look forward to working with the minister in this important area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the hon. minister for taking time to address the House this afternoon.  However, at this particular time, I think we are hearing from the wrong minister. Sport is a very important portfolio, to be sure.  I played a lot of sports in my day and I still feel if it was slow pitch, I could get back to it again.  I do not run the bases quite as fast as I used to, but it has been great. I have always been a team player. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering recent events transpiring outside the House, we should be hearing from a minister in response to the serious problems raised in the Auditor General's report that was tabled yesterday.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt the people of Vancouver and Whistler appreciate the kind words and best wishes as offered by the minister. In fact, I too, on behalf of the people of Perth—Middlesex and the Conservative Party of Canada, want to let all Canadians know how proud we are of the folks out in Vancouver and Whistler.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have every confidence that the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Winter Games will be some of the most successful ever and will serve to showcase Canada in all its magnificent splendour. I somehow think, however, that the good folks in the Vancouver-Whistler area would appreciate if the government would be  accountable, not misappropriate funds, and spend responsibly. One of the keys in sport is to play by the rules.  The government should set a good example and play by the rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also nice to recognize the great work done by the vast majority of the country's civil servants. Sadly, because of the actions on the part of the government, many hard-working professional civil servants will see the reputation of their professions tarnished. I bet they would rather see the government conduct itself in a proper fashion and would gladly forgo the occasional pat on the back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sport is about teamwork.  The minister is right about that, though one could make the same observation about government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the government not want to work with all the hon. members?  From BSE to softwood lumber, from the state of Canada's underfunded military to the awful treatment of our veterans, why will the government not take this attitude concerning the importance of teamwork to these areas?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to help and the people of Perth—Middlesex want to help. I can assure the House that my colleagues in the Conservative Party of Canada want to help.  When will the government start acting as partners in the House so that we can help and work toward policies that will benefit Canadians?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the minister's stated desire to involve more aboriginals, new Canadians, young people, economically disadvantaged people and persons with disabilities is a sentiment that he is serious about. These are excellent objectives indeed.  I will be most pleased if we can achieve success on these fronts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do not understand is how huge payments, false receipts, false invoices and untendered contracts handed out to friends of the Liberal Party of Canada with Canadians  receiving little or no value possibly moves Canada any closer to achieving these noble goals?  We are mired in a culture of corruption.  As more evidence comes to light regarding this matter, it is becoming evident this type of irresponsible and scandalous behaviour is rampant throughout the day to day operations of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts are reporting this to be arguably the greatest scandal in Canadian history.  I must admit that in reading through the Auditor General's report last night I found cause for great concern.  When Canadians are bombarded with one scandal after another, with mismanagement--</p>

In the absence of this,  I will hold the government's feet to the fire.  It is wrong to give people false hope.  Let us make things happen.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak about the countdown to the Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2010 to be held in Vancouver and Whistler. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all my Bloc Quebecois colleagues, I would like to extend my best wishes to all those who will, directly or indirectly,  work very hard, with force and determination, to make this sports event hugely successful and show that success rests not merely on individual athletes, but on a large team in which each individual contribution is specific and significant.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of State for Sport said previously, sport is a team effort.  I agree entirely with that premise. Let me take  this opportunity to salute some members of that team who ultimately will reach the podium of excellence, those who will give us huge emotions:  the athletes themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of Parliament, but also as the Bloc Quebecois critic for amateur sports, I often meet athletes and speak with them about their training, the humongous sacrifices they have to make and the strong spirit they must have to become  elite athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no idea of the daily discipline required by athletes who hope one day to stand on the winners' podium. Every time I meet them, I am profoundly impressed by their determination and their desire to keep improving. Every time, however, the same issue crops up: the crying need for funding for top level athletes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have spoken about this situation. Many athletes and organizations have spoken out many times. Just recently, the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association has been criticized on many fronts. A number of athletes have reported that they received only tiny amounts, if anything at all, from their association to help defray their expenses for training and travel, even though the association receives over $2 million in funding from Sport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did this situation come about? Is it a problem with this association's management of public funds? Or is there simply not enough money to meet the athletes' needs? The situation is totally unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written to the new Minister of State for Sport about this situation, asking him to intervene with the management of the Canadian Freestyle Skiing Association to have them open their books and be accountable. I am still waiting for the minister's reply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, given the urgency of the situation and the fact that freestyle skiing will be a very important discipline at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, now is the time to invest and give our athletes the financial and material resources they need, in order to help them as best we can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not wait for 2010 to realize that we should have done something. It will be too late. It is very important that our athletes be able to train in adequate conditions and that they do not have to bear the entire financial burden of training, or travel, which, after all, is necessary to participate in competitions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see scandals like the sponsorship affair come to light and be confirmed by an Auditor General's report, we realize that millions of dollars are wasted shamefully, and the whole community suffers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the athletes of Quebec and Canada would have loved to receive that wasted $100 million. It is simply scandalous. Imagine: $100 million for the friends of the party in power, while our athletes live below the poverty line. It is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we picture what $100 million represents? It is almost the total amount the government spends on sport. It is exactly twice the amount requested annually by the athletes and sports organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Minister of State for Sport said that athletes should be provided with the high level of support they need to succeed  in order for Canada to become a world leader in sports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will he put his money where his mouth is? The government better not try to tell us there is no money. What with surpluses estimated at more than $4 billion, amateur sport has every right to ask for a substantial budget increase, and the minister must act now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of the next budget, I call on the Minister of State for Sport to get assurances from the Minister of Finance that the money will be available for this year's competitions, so that our athletes are ready for the 2010 Olympic Games.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by telling the very sad story of Karine Sergerie. This young woman could have gone to the top of the podium at the next Olympic Games in Athens, but her dream was shattered because of technicalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young Quebecker was denied a place on the Canadian team by Taekwondo Canada despite the fact that she is ranked second in the world. It is hard to imagine that one of the world's top Taekwondo athletes will not be going to the Olympics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words cannot describe my indignation. Yet, the Minister of State for Sport was just talking about the federal government's commitment to creating more opportunities for athletes. He also talked about inclusion. I wonder what those words mean to the minister and his government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best I can hope for is that this sad incident will never happen again and that all those who aspire to go to the 2010 Winter Games will be able to train in dignity and with all the respect we owe our athletes, who bring us pride and honour.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I too wish to begin by congratulating the minister on his portfolio. It is something that those of us who have been here for a little while know he has been interested in for many years.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I wish to acknowledge his predecessors, the member for Bourassa, now President of the Treasury Board, and the member for Simcoe North, both of whom have also worked hard to develop sports in Canada. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate about priorities for sports funding always seems to me a debate about more money to develop the elite athletes and the coaches who train them, or more money to build facilities for the masses.  Therefore I want to congratulate the minister for stating his overriding goal in his statement earlier this afternoon to have more Canadians participating in sport and  physical activity and to ensure that the barriers to participation are reduced, although we in this caucus note no reference at all to seniors in this discussion. There is lots of reference to young people, and we recognize the importance of the association of youth and sports, but we recognize that we also have to get our seniors more engaged in physical activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this debate about priorities even today.  The minister is using the countdown six years from now to the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver-Whistler to inform Canadians that his overriding goal is indeed mass participation.  On this point he talked about the marginal and the disadvantaged.  I would encourage the minister to look carefully at  private member's Bill C-210 by the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore which would offer tax relief for people who help offset rising costs of participating in sports for young people by giving them a tax deduction similar to what Canadians currently are allowed for charitable donations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of  Grantland Rice, the great American sportswriter who said, “When the one great scorer comes to write against your name, he will ask not if you won or lost but how you played the game”. Too many of our younger people, and the minister to his credit referenced it, are not participating because they do not have the wherewithal to participate. They do not have the facilities.  They do not have the equipment.  We need to recognize that and do something about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the minister's opening remarks on this topic, he said that he was fortunate to have such an amazing group of dedicated  people at Sports Canada.  In agreeing fully with that assessment, I want  to pay tribute to an important individual who no longer is with us but who made a significant contribution to sport in Canada. That is the late Jim Thompson who was the  chief executive officer and secretary general of the Canadian Olympic Association. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House may recall, Jim died very suddenly and unexpectedly in Vancouver 18 months ago. He was there to help the Vancouver-Whistler committee prepare what turned out to be an eventually successful bid.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years earlier I had the good fortune to work with Jim Thompson when he was a young production assistant and later on a very young producer at CBC network sports.  He went on to become eventually the president of The Sports Network before taking early retirement. He was persuaded to come out of retirement and assume responsibility for the Canadian Olympic Association and the Vancouver-Whistler bid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our paths had crossed very infrequently over the years, I happened to meet with him at the Toronto airport as he was leaving to go to Vancouver in August 2002, less than two days before his untimely death.  We talked about the chances of the Vancouver bid and his views on where Sports Canada emphasis should be in the debate about funding elite athletes versus the general funding for participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Thompson was an integral part of sports development in Canada over several decades. He certainly deserves to be recognized on this occasion because it is not just the athletes and the coaches who make immense sacrifices.  In  this instance Jim Thompson made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his country, Sports Canada and the Canadian Olympic Association.  To his wife and children we thank them for allowing Jim Thompson to work for something he truly believed in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in  this caucus congratulate the Vancouver-Whistler committee for its successful Olympic bid.  We look forward to a well run Olympic Winter Games six years from now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look forward to more Canadians availing themselves of the opportunity to join in the fun of participating in sports and the health benefits they will derive from such activity. In wishing our elite athletes every success  in their international competitions, we in the NDP caucus also recognize that involving millions more Canadians in sports, physical activity and reviving the Participaction program will also be worthy of a gold medal for this country.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners are calling upon the government to look at the moral values of our society. They believe that the defence of traditional marriage as the bond between one man and one woman is a serious moral good. They also believe that marriage, as a lasting union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of others, cannot and should not be modified by a legislative act or a court of law.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the second petition is from petitioners who draw  to the attention of the House and  all Canadians that the Auditor General's report submitted to Parliament on December 3, 2002, determined that the cost of the federal firearms registry for long guns at that time was perceived to have exceeded $1 billion; and a recent administrative review verified that the gun registry would cost another $541 million before it was fully implemented; and the fact that eight provinces, three territories, police associations, police chiefs and police officers across Canada have withdrawn their support of the firearms registry for long guns; and that recent public opinion polls have demonstrated that a majority of Canadian taxpayers support the abolition of the firearms registry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They therefore call upon Parliament to abolish the national firearms registry for long guns and to redirect those taxes to programs in support of health care and law enforcement. </p>

Whereas a recent court decision has redefined marriage as the union of one man and one woman,  whereas we regard it as a dangerous precedent for democracy in Canada when appointed judges rather than elected members of Parliament create law for our land, they ask Parliament to reaffirm now, as it did in 1999, its commitment to preserve marriage as specifically the union of one man and one woman only.</p>

	<h5 align="center"><i>[The Address]</i></h5>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The House resumed from February 5 consideration of the motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the opening of the session, and of the amendment.

</p>


	<A NAME="Int-807354"></A><a HREF="#Int-807364"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—L'Érable, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on the occasion of the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With yesterday's disclosure by the Auditor General of the sponsorship scandal, we can see that there is a huge contradiction between the PM's desire to spend tax dollars wisely and reality.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my speech therefore is to focus on these contradictions, in order to show the public in Quebec and in Canada that the present government is nothing more than a carbon copy of the Chrétien government.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 5 of the printed Speech from the Throne, we read the following statement:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>To this end, the Government is launching an ongoing process of expenditure review, overseen by a new Committee of Cabinet. This will ensure that spending reflects priorities and that every tax dollar is invested with care to achieve results for Canadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to tell you that, as a longstanding member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I find this statement by the Prime Minister particularly offensive.  The specific purpose of that committee is to  scrutinize government spending in order to ensure that the taxpayers' dollars are properly invested, within a democratic process in which all official parties of this House are represented.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the committee works in close cooperation with the Office of the Auditor General of Canada to, once again, ensure that the government does not get away with wasting taxpayers' money, as was the case, among others, in the infamous sponsorship scandal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I should point out that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. He will, of course, support the numerous points that I am raising regarding this throne speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister wants to eliminate the democratic deficit in this House and give more powers to MPs. Yet, he intends to set up a very partisan cabinet committee, without  any opposition members sitting on it. This is some contradiction. Where is the democracy in this process? Where is the transparency in this new committee? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have yet to see  whether the new Liberal cross-bencher, the member for Châteauguay, who made some interesting discoveries in the government's extravagant spending, particularly in the sponsorship scandal, will expose other financial scandals. I doubt it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to read in the throne speech that Canadians expect the government to use their taxes wisely and want to have the assurance that public funds, which means their money, will be used properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is any indication of the future, Quebeckers and Canadians are justified in not trusting the new Prime Minister to make proper use of their taxes. Let me explain why.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as regards the sponsorship scandal, which is probably one of the worst cases of corruption and waste in the history of Canadian politics, the new Prime Minister has the nerve to tell us that he did not know anything about it. Let me point out some facts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Prime Minister was the Minister of Finance and Vice-President of the Treasury Board for most of the time that the sponsorship program   was in existence. He is the one who signed the cheques that were used to increase the federal government's visibility all across Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, he never condemned this abuse of public funds for the sake of Canadian unity and for the benefit of the Liberal Party of Canada and its friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister now  has the nerve to tell the public that he did not know about it, particularly now that these same Liberals are taking cover behind a public inquiry to try to save face  before the upcoming election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the current Prime Minister had really wanted to act quickly, he would have arranged for the Auditor General's report to be tabled in November, as scheduled, and not during the February session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without waiting for the report of the Auditor General, he could have called a public inquiry two months ago, right after he took office. But no, he preferred to buy time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that he is calling a public inquiry at the last minute is evidence that he is putting the election first, and transparency second.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the trademark of the federal Liberals ever since I was elected here, in 1997. The rest of my colleagues have witnessed what has happened since 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers will probably be voting in three  months time without realizing the scope of the scam created by the government. They have the fortitude to tell us that each tax dollar will be carefully reinvested, when the Prime Minister and some of his ministers are neck deep in financial scandals like the sponsorship program. It is absolute hypocrisy. Where the Prime Minister is concerned, what we have seen is what we will get.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another good example of bad faith that can be found in the throne speech. My political party, the Bloc Quebecois, set up a special committee, the Léonard Committee, to examine federal programs. The committee has decided to review the expenditures of federal departments since 1997-1998, a reference year for the last two mandates of the former finance minister, now Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have found out is that the government has completely lost control over government expenditures for the entire period ending in 2002-2003. Over a five-year period, expenditures have gone up by 39%, compared to 9.6% for the inflation rate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what you would call making good use of taxpayers' money? In comparison, spending in Quebec and Ontario increased by 20% and 19.7%  respectively. While the provinces were tightening their belts, the federal government was living it up in Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer look at federal spending reveals multiple cases of excessive spending on the part of the government during the time when the administration of our country's finances was the responsibility of the current Prime Minister. For example, the government payroll increased by 41%; that of legal services by 141%; that of the federal Department of Health, which   does not deliver any services to the public, by 78%; and that of CIDA by 132%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As finance minister, the new Prime Minister acted deliberately in favouring federal administrative spending over services to the public. And he is the one who just told us, in the Speech from the Throne, that the money of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers must be put to good use. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, had Ottawa increased its spending at the same rate as Quebec and Ontario did, the federal government would have extra fiscal manoeuvrability that would total, and listen carefully to this figure, $5.7 billion a year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fiscal effort that the Prime Minister refused to make when he was finance minister, preferring to spend freely while making drastic cuts in transfer payments to Quebec and the provinces, particularly in the areas of health and education. Now he wants to call the shots in these two areas that are strictly under provincial jurisdiction by giving out money while controlling its use through national standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the current Prime Minister was not competent as finance minister, believe me, the past will be an indication of what the future holds. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bloc Quebecois committee is not the only one that has discovered  this explosion in government spending. During the same period, the Office of the Auditor General gave repeated warnings about the fact that spending was getting out of control. As member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I have seen numerous examples of expenditures that were both unjustified and unjustifiable to the public. Our friends opposite can hardly accuse the Bloc Quebecois of producing a partisan document when the Auditor General has come to practically the same conclusions as we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to this famous committee. What will this new cabinet committee on government spending be all about? Just like the foundations, it will escape all parliamentary control. This committee will not give a real picture of government spending.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of trusting democratic institutions like the Standing Committee on Public Accounts or the office of the Auditor General, which reports to Parliament, the Prime Minister would rather trust a partisan committee to make sure every tax dollar is wisely spent. Is this a way to erase the democratic deficit? I have my doubts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a word on the throne speech. Besides broad philosophical statements, there is hardly anything concrete, and certainly nothing on rural and regional development. Not a word either on the two big crises affecting the regions: softwood lumber and mad cow disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have much more to say, but my time is running out. To conclude, let me say that tomorrow, I am going back to work on the public accounts standing committee. Together with my colleagues in the opposition,  I will do everything I can to demonstrate beyond any doubt that the Liberal Party of Canada, the Prime Minister included, is responsible for the sponsorship scandal.</p>

     </h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the opening of the session, and of the amendment. 

 
</p>


	<A NAME="Int-807368"></A><a HREF="#Int-807370"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807484"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to the Bloc member's speech. It  was very interesting to see that, according to his statements, the Bloc Quebecois is even in a position of perhaps becoming the Auditor General's substitute. I find it interesting that, as a consequence of their talks in committee, the Bloc members have come to the same conclusion as the Auditor General.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask the member is simply this. Does he not believe in the system that exists here to find out what happened?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of trying to find partisan  motives to perhaps score some political points, would he not come to the conclusion that, even if there are issues raised by the Auditor General, he will have the opportunity, as early as tomorrow, without any delay, to contribute to finding the answers that are very necessary, not only for Quebecers, but also for all Canadians?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-807370"></A><a HREF="#Int-807373"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807368"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—L'Érable, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, of course I will be asking the Auditor General some questions. She will certainly provide answers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will remind the member opposite that we, on this side, have asked 441 questions on the sponsorship scam. We did not get any answer. All we saw was a cover-up. Ministers have been passing the buck back and forth. We saw their faces turn red—which is the right colour for a Liberal, I guess—as they learned about the whole sponsorship issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we will do everything we can in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. We will be the first ones to welcome the Auditor General. We will be authorized to identify witnesses who will be able to confirm what we already suspect, which will help us carry out our duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just point out to my hon. colleague opposite that I remember the sad scenario that was the Groupaction inquiry, where the Liberals decided that our sittings would be in camera. We heard from Chuck Guité and Pierre Tremblay. I respected the secrecy surrounding those in camera sittings, others did not. Without getting into what was said, I can tell you that the answers they provided matched exactly what the Auditor General said yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Auditor General, when I asked her if it was the worst report or the worst situation she has seen since she has been appointed Auditor General, do you know what she told me? She said, “I do not dare say it is the worst because each time I do an audit, each time I examine similar issues, I am always surprised.” In her mind, this is not over.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can therefore imagine all the work that awaits the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the famous public inquiry. I do hope that the Liberals opposite, who are asking us to cooperate, will also cooperate by postponing the election so that the truth can come out and Canadians can get to the bottom of this scandal.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the debate on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reaction, as I listened to the throne speech, was to wonder what kind of a bubble we are living in here in Ottawa. The speech was completely unreal. We came back from the parliamentary break having worked hard in our constituencies, where people told us about their real problems, such as the softwood lumber crisis, for example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of jobs in Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario have disappeared. Both the workers and the industry representatives were expecting that there would be new measures announced in the Speech from the Throne that would give them the means to get through the crisis and hang on until the final judgment. We won one case yesterday, but it will probably be 6 to 9 months before we are done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no mention of all this in the throne speech, no offer to extend the transitional measures to deal with the softwood lumber crisis, for example. These measures expire on March 31 and it is impossible to extend the deadline for the cases that are under consideration but could not be finally settled. We need a second phase. There is nothing in the throne speech about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another real-life problem people back home have been talking about is the mad cow crisis. Milk producers used to sell their cull cows—cows that no longer produce milk—for their meat. Later, they found themselves in a strange situation, where, because one sick cow was found in western Canada and another in the United States, the market was completely paralyzed. On this matter the federal government has remained completely inflexible and has offered clearly inadequate programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis is not over, and today  producers are saddled with heavy debt.  They have been urged on numerous occasions to invest in their businesses, told that attractive market opportunities would be created.  Then, when the mad cow crisis struck, the federal government was unable to implement a tracking system in time to avoid a Canada-wide crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of allowing the former Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food to say that he was going to treat all animals in Canada the same, there could have been a tracking system in place in order to know whether the problem was in Alberta or Saskatchewan.   As a  result, exports from there could have been banned.  During the European mad cow crisis, the entire European market was not closed.   Only those actually involved were affected, and their geographical area targeted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were expecting some measures for the producers to be included in the throne speech.  This is a concrete problem in all of our ridings.  But no, the same great desire for maintaining a high profile, for visibility achieved through interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction, was evident.   Reference was made, for instance, to day care, an area in which Quebec is in the lead role.  The federal government wants to interfere in this, as well as in the community sector, which is not its place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have a throne speech that is so far divorced from reality?  Because we have a federal system in which the federal government is after a degree of visibility that its areas of jurisdiction do not lend to it, yet it does not shoulder its responsibilities.  It puts visibility before responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is far from funny, when we are hearing that the Canadian army is under-equipped, that our military personnel do not have what they need. That is a federal jurisdiction.  Still, they are announcing piecemeal funding yet again.  Today we hear there is another $5 billion surplus this year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bafflegab that propels this government also fuelled the Speech from the Throne. Last fall, we were told there no longer was surpluses, that it would take great pains to provide the  provinces with the $2 billion  for health and that it would be impossible to provide more. Today, the papers reported that $5 billion is being put on the table. Is this supposed to go unnoticed and unexplained amidst the sponsorship scandal? People are not blind. The reality is very clear to see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Speech from the Throne, I feel like bursting the bubble, so that the people who make decisions in government and write these speeches know what is really going on and see the real problems that need to be resolved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors are another group that has been making representations to us on a regular basis. They are going through a difficult situation. For the past few years, their old age pension has been only partially indexed. That means that over a three-year period, they were denied a quarter, a half, or a full per cent. Now these people who receive small incomes have lost their purchasing power.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what would happen if we, in this House, did not receive indexation. Or imagine this happening in an entirely different sector. We would rise to say this is unacceptable. Senior citizens have not been given a voice. There should have been something in the throne speech about fully indexing pensions and providing retroactive indexation to those who have lost their purchasing power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of drugs has increased in the past few years. Seniors have such specific needs that their shopping carts are quite different from the average citizen's. The price increase for some products has exceeded inflation. There should be something about that in the throne speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not have said there was going to be retroactive indexing of the guaranteed income supplement? Some 270,000  Canadians have been left in the cold for many years by not being paid what they are owed. All hon. members must have heard of such cases in  their ridings in recent months because the Bloc Quebecois kicked up such a fuss that the department responded. I can give more examples of these situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, three weeks ago I learned that someone had sent the form three months ago, but had not yet heard anything. We checked and got this person registered. However, the payments are not retroactive.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is strange, because companies that have their head offices in Barbados got a tax break, as we discussed recently. The ships, the companies that belong to the Prime Minister, to his family, were able to benefit from a retroactive measure to save taxes. It is strange to see that such benefit is provided to the current Prime Minister, to his family, to an industry through tax havens, but not to the elderly who would really need a break. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about surplus or excess money. We are talking about money that people absolutely need. Why is the throne speech  silent on this issue? Why does the federal government only propose measures that have no real impact, that do not reflect the daily concerns of people, that have nothing to do with  the challenges that the public expects the government to meet? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, not to mention what we are finding out about the sponsorship scandal these days, generates cynicism in our society. The Bloc Quebecois has asked 441 questions on this issue. We are not talking about one, two, ten or a hundred questions, but about 441 questions to finally get the government to say that, in light of the Auditor General's report, something will have to be done.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that no minister, no Liberal member has stood up in this House or in public and said, “We must thoroughly examine these files. We must clean things up. We must put things back in order”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government even delayed the tabling of the Auditor General's report, which was scheduled for November. The government postponed it to early February 2004 to make sure that the election will be so close that things will quickly move on; also, the announcement of a public inquiry will obviate the need to provide explanations. It is fine to have an independent public inquiry, but we must ensure that it is truly independent. We must also ensure that the inquiry can be conducted quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, there will be a political price to pay. The public simply cannot still feel that this government can continue to lead Canada. The public will have to pass a very harsh judgment. There are often cases where concrete involvement is not obvious, but here it is very clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a radio interview a little while ago with people from my riding. The host and I were saying that the $100 million that flowed to the buddies with the advertising agencies, for sponsorships, would have made a heck of a big investment in route 185, a highway in my riding that has killed 100 people in 10 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have been proud to make an investment like that. Instead, the money was deliberately poured out. The inquiry will have to make things very clear, because those people did not do that for nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  was a Minister of Public Works who was also responsible for political organizing. There were at least five federal agencies involved in this operation and there were many people, members of Parliament, ministers in this very government, who are still deeply involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this is a throne speech that has nothing to do with the type of reality we would like to see in a throne speech. The general public is seriously fed up and thinks the politicians are not serious at all. We need to tell them that within the broad class known as politicians, there is the Liberal government that has done these deeds and there are members who rose in this House, including the Bloc Quebecois, 441 times, to ask for a public inquiry, and to ask for details about this affair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we hope that the government has received the message because, if it has not, I predict that the public will be sending the message very directly in the next election.</p>

Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to make some comments on the statements made by the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. Of course, we worked together on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Consequently, I have a lot of respect for him. I know that he is dedicated and thoughtful, particularly in the area of competition. I also invite him to continue the great battle started a few months ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in his comments concerning a lack of response to the elderly and to pensioners. He even used the word “drug”. I find this interesting because, in the same context, he also used the word “cynicism”. He said that the government's program  is cynical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this interesting because he linked the throne speech to the sponsorship issue, with the intention of really showing his constituents and people who are listening that there is a $100 million problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he knows quite well that, when it comes to  drug patents, the position of the Bloc Quebecois would cost $428 million a year, because there is a flaw in the drug system that was created by the previous Conservative government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to change the situation to save $428 million a year for a pill and the member simply said, “No. We will leave this flaw with regard to automatic injunctions”. How can he focus on $100 million that were lost, and when it comes to the poor and the elderly in his riding, in Quebec or in Canada, he forgets the billions of dollars that are wasted because of a flaw in the bill on drug patents. I find this cynical. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. This reminded me that there is something which should have been included in the throne speech, namely the recommendation that the hon. member himself supported to set up a petroleum monitoring agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about parliamentary reform. We are told that the opinion of a larger number of MPs will be taken into consideration. However, a majority of committee members, including government members, made a recommendation, but the throne speech makes no mention of it. Yet, every day, people can see the yo-yo effect, in the economy, caused by the sudden increases and decreases in the price of gas. Why does the throne speech not address a concrete issue such as this one?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pharmaceutical products, it is obviously a very complex issue. We must look at the overall  impact of the decisions. It goes without saying that this issue needs to be thoroughly reviewed. That was done by the committee. But there is nothing on this subject in the throne speech.  The hon. member's own government did not deem necessary to deal with this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bill on pharmaceuticals to provide, as soon as possible, third world countries with the proper drugs to deal with some diseases like AIDS. I think we do indeed need to find ways to deal with the problem. The same thing goes for drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to strike a balance and come up with proposals to ensure that we have efficient research programs to develop new products and that we also have the capacity to manufacture generic products to keep the price down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has been able yet to convince me that eliminating the middlemen would solve the problem. To pretend that such a well-thought position could lead to the unavailability of some pharmaceuticals is somewhat demagogic. Our position is thoughtful. We want reasonable costs for the elderly and for the rest of the people. Let us put this issue to rest. Let us give the committee a strong mandate and the authority to make recommendations to the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, like my hon. colleague, I think it is unfortunate that the throne speech is silent on this issue. It just goes to show that the throne speech was drafted in a bubble, here in Ottawa, by people totally disconnected from what is really going in our country and from the problems our constituents are facing.</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister of Western Economic Diversification, as the member of Parliament for Winnipeg North--St. Paul, and as a Canadian, I am proud to be part of an agenda that respects and responds to the concerns of western Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne demonstrates the government's commitment to a new way of working, built as it is on partnership, opportunity, achievement, and the engagement of all Canadians at the local level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The directions and priorities outlined in the speech are good news for the west and for all of Canada.  Our Prime Minister has pledged to open the doors in Ottawa to the voice of all of our regions and to adopt new ways of working together on behalf of all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to help make that happen. At Western Economic Diversification Canada--or WD for brevity--we have the networks and the programs to find local solutions for local problems.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have it in the recently renewed economic partnership agreements that WD signed with each of the western provinces, agreements that will invest $200 million in strategic economic and community development projects based on regionally identified needs and priorities. Previous agreements leveraged an additional $458 million from the private sector and we expect this positive collaboration to continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne also correctly targets the health of communities as key to our social goals, to our economic competitiveness, and to our environmental concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commitment of the west to these goals comes through loud and clear with initiatives such as the Vancouver agreement and the Winnipeg urban development agreement, which is in the final stages of negotiation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovative agreements bring together all three levels of government, with the private sector, the voluntary sector and community partners, to address social, economic and environmental challenges unique to each city.  These agreements demonstrate the importance of the Speech from the Throne's clear commitment to municipalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care, homelessness, new infrastructure, security and the full participation of aboriginal people and new immigrants in our new economy are issues that figure strongly as national concerns. We must remember that these issues are lived out and best understood at the local level.  Hence, municipalities, both rural and urban, as well as other local actors, must have the resources to be effective partners in designing and implementing solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many Canadian cities, aboriginal people experience far worse conditions than their non-aboriginal counterparts.  About 70% of Canada's aboriginal people live in the west,  a growing number of whom live in urban areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WD therefore plays a strong role in Canada's urban aboriginal strategy, a partnership that brings all levels of government together with aboriginal groups, community organizations and the private sector. Our approach is one of coordinated effort to provide better access to a variety of targeted programs and services. The expansion of this program will improve conditions for many of our disadvantaged citizens. Clearly this is the right thing to do, not only for aboriginal people but for our nation as a whole.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west alone, it is estimated that over 200,000 jobs are needed within the next 15 years.  By addressing the underlying barriers to full economic participation of disadvantaged communities and citizens, we will foster talent, creativity and determination, which will combine to form a tremendous new force to meet the challenges ahead. Indeed, our success as a nation depends on the contributions made by individual Canadians working together in their communities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, too, the west shows its commitment through entrepreneurship, which has created a region with 40% more small businesses than elsewhere in Canada. The WD's business service network provides over 100 points of service to assist new and existing small businesses and to foster community capacity building. I am particularly pleased that the Speech from the Throne reinforces the importance of these initiatives, which do so much to enhance the vitality and quality of life in our communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one of the millions of immigrants who have come to this country and have chosen Canada to be our home.  Myself, I emigrated from the Philippines 36 years ago as a young medical doctor. I am gratified, therefore, at the reference to ensuring the successful integration of new Canadians into our economy and our communities.  One way is to have in Canada an orderly process for the accreditation of foreign obtained credentials in the fields of trades and the professions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  am grateful that the Prime Minister has made this issue one key message in the Speech from the Throne, and he recently raised this issue with the premiers.  I look forward to being part of the effort to ensure that others have the kind of access and the chance to fulfill their full potential and make a contribution to this great nation that were so generously extended to me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When foreign obtained credentials of new Canadians and immigrants are not recognized, their dreams remain unfulfilled.  More sad is that the dreams of Canada remain unfulfilled, for a nation always wants the best for all her citizens. By ensuring that all Canadians can fully participate in and contribute to this country's productivity and prosperity, we are ensuring a 21st century economy that is open to the world, a nation with the strong social foundations that are the envy of the international community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps nowhere is that potential more evident than in the area of environmental technologies. Indeed, we in the west are transforming what we have learned from our resource based history and applying it to innovative new ventures that will help build a sustainable future for the generations to come.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia has become a global hot spot for the development and commercialization of fuel cells.  Forecast to be a $145 billion worldwide market by 2020 and to create 15,000  jobs for every billion  in demand, fuel cells have the potential to be a huge driver of our social, environmental and economic progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alberta is implementing, through Petroleum Technology Alliance Canada, an eco-efficient and greenhouse technologies program that will support the efforts of the hydrocarbon energy industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan's canola biodiesel is being explored as an alternative renewable fuel for diesel engines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Manitoba, WD is supporting innovative enterprises at the University of Manitoba's engineering labs to help create key industry clusters such as biotechnology and information technology.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a pan-western note, I am pleased to say that WD, following extensive consultations, recently has funded the Canada West Health Innovation Council to champion the significant contribution health research and innovation can make to future economic growth and quality health care.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By acting now, Canada can get ahead of the curve and create a sustainable competitive advantage for the future, an advantage that will bring economic and social benefits to all Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in renewing in the Speech from the Throne its commitment to regional development, the Government of Canada is recognizing Canada's dynamic diversity: geographic, linguistic and cultural, as well as the unique experience, knowledge and skills that exist in each region.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-807443"></A><a HREF="#Int-807448"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to focus briefly on two aspects of the minister's speech.  I would indicate to him that I appreciated his remarks with respect to the Winnipeg community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus on his statement about strength from diversity and the celebration of our ethnocultural heritage, something that obviously we have in common in our Winnipeg constituencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on that, my first question is, is the minister prepared to give support to Bill C-436, which is before the House now and which has been sponsored by my colleague, the member for Vancouver East.  It is about allowing every Canadian a chance once in a lifetime to sponsor a relative who now would not be eligible under the family class category?  That is my first question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question has to do with the need for urban renewal and for a new deal for a city like Winnipeg.  Nowhere is that more apparent than in the north end of Winnipeg, where we have had a recreation facility sitting empty for over a decade and for which the community has actively sought federal funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written the minister myself on a couple of occasions and have yet to receive a response.  I would like to know and the people of north Winnipeg like to know if once and for all the wellness centre in the north end of Winnipeg, which has a large aboriginal population and is a high needs area, will receive funding through western diversification?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in answer to the first question with reference to  a bill  on immigration, we should make it easier for families, for Canadians, who are here to nominate and sponsor members of their family  who want to come to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration to Canada is based on criteria acceptable to all Canadians.  If a potential immigrant is not eligible, it could be based on many reasons.  Unless we know the reasons for the disapproval or for non-ability of a particular potential immigrant to come to the country, it would be very difficult.  I think it would be unwise to make a blanket bill that would allow, once for a lifetime, a non-eligible immigrant to come to Canada because the reasons for non-eligibility could be based on many reasons, and I have no time to debate that at this time.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Manitoba has a Canada--Manitoba provincial nominee program.  If it is deemed by Manitobans and by the provincial government that it could facilitate the entry of immigrants to Manitoba, then all the provincial government would have to do is indicate its intention, and I am sure it would be given due consideration by my colleague, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point about the facility that needs help.  I again would like the member to see the full proposal for this facility.  I assure her that the Department of Western Economic Diversification will give it due diligence and prompt attention.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I understand this is a new portfolio and a new department.  I would like to know a little about it.  The minister will have four prairie provinces for which he will have a budget. How will he decide these budgets and who  will make the decisions on what gets money from the budget?  Is it divided evenly among the provinces? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to ask the member a bit about the guidelines of his new portfolio.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is certainly a very valid question.  It was the first question I asked of my department in the debriefing I received  from it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in this portfolio will be Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.  They are provinces of different population size and population size is one criterion for the disbursement of funds  to be fair and equitable to all the provinces. Of course the rate of unemployment varies from province to province.  This is an additional criterion.  Again, because we would like to develop the fullest potential of any of the four provinces, this too is a valid criterion.  On these three criteria, we will try to distribute the funds equitably.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to who makes the decisions, the department will make the decisions.  The officials will study all submitted projects and due diligence will be made as long as the projects fulfill our strategic thrust and themes of  innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainable communities.  They will be assessed on those bases.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I recognize it is a new portfolio for my colleague from Manitoba, but I am curious.  In light of the revelations in regard to the sponsorship program with Public Works Canada, is there any kind of a booking fee that happens to work within western diversification in, say, its community futures projects?   If dollars flow from western diversification to anyone of the numerous community futures offices, does money go directly through or is there a funneling agent for the cheques or the money to flow?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the department is very conscious that every single taxpayer dollar disbursed by the department is done with the greatest prudence and with the greatest of integrity.  When we deal with the community futures groups, agreements are made between the department and the community futures groups, and that  ensures that no single penny is wasted.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the minister will be familiar with this because he was the secretary of state for science and technology. As he knows, Western Economic Diversification partly funds the synchrotron at the University of Saskatchewan, something my two colleagues have supported very strongly. It is a very good project. It is $174 million. It is about to come on stream. It has an $18 million operating budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how does the Government of Canada intend to support the operating budget?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I posed this question to him before. Does he agree with the Auditor General and many scientists, including at the University of Saskatchewan, who say that the Government of Canada must change the way it funds big science projects, that it needs to fund it though one funnel, in a much simpler fashion, rather than funding it through the NRC, through Western Economic Diversification and through Industry Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he agree that it is about time for the Government of Canada to show some leadership and fund these big science projects through one funnel rather than make these scientists go to five or six government departments to get their funding?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-807471"></A><a HREF="#Int-807474"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807468"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rey Pagtakhan: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, certainly the question is very timely and critical. It is timely because we have a new administration, and in fact a science adviser has been engaged by the Prime Minister.  Therefore, science is a very important policy issue to which the government is attending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of funding the big ticket items, the budget for big science facilities, through one agency of course it is under consideration.  I am sure that in due time when the government has a definitive answer it will be given as well. However, it is important to maintain the regional agencies because if one would like to kick-start a project, one could do it through the regional development agencies. However, no doubt I  agree with the member.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently visited the facility and talked with the officials, and when thinking of the big support, I am convinced we need to have support from Ottawa.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an honour to rise in reply to the Speech from the Throne and represent the constituents from Saanich--Gulf Islands.   I read the Speech from the Throne and I am going to comment on a few specific areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne is full of nice warm fuzzy statements but it is completely diametrically at odds with the actions of the government. I will give specific details. It states:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are titles “Restoring trust and accountability”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the facts.  Anyone who has read the Auditor General's report will know that the government is off to a pretty bad start on this promise.  We have seen a quarter billion dollar vote buying scheme.  One hundred million dollars went straight to Liberal communication firms.  It is absolutely outrageous.  Some that money found its way back to the Liberal Party of Canada as donations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a money laundering  scheme that is worthy of a sophisticated Mafia style attempt to take money.  People who ran the program reported directly to the deputy minister.  This is not, as the government or the Prime Minister proclaims, a problem in the department and those people are being dealt with. This is at the very top echelon of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General's report states that there is no paperwork, no contracts and fictitious invoices.  The current Prime Minister, at the time all this was happening, was the CFO of the country.  He was the caretaker of the public purse.  He was  entrusted to look after taxpayers' dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he do? I just outlined it. If he was a CFO of a public company, he not only would be fired instantly on the spot, I submit that he would put in jail. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that time, the Prime Minister chose to remain silent. Silence is consent.  He consented to these activities through his silence.  He never questioned; he had to know what was going on.  This is not something that happened for one week.  This went on for years and years.  It was talked about at the cabinet table.  It is not acceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path that the Prime Minister chose was a path of scandal. The path of the yellow brick road was paved in gold by none other than the taxpayer.  Like every single other Canadian we are absolutely disgusted and horrified.  None of those words can do justice to this.  We are in absolute disbelief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear members on the opposite side saying that we are hurting Parliament's reputation.  It is the government that is destroying the reputation of elected people across the country.  It is our duty to stand up against the theft of this tax money. Someone has to come clean. What does the government want to do? It wants to bury it in another report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the facts. The Prime Minister stood up and all Canadians can see this.  It is the government's duty to take responsibility and show leadership.  No.  We are going to get a  public inquiry and the government plans to bury this until after the next election. The Speech from the Throne states:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is word for word from the Speech from the Throne.  That is only going to happen if we get a chip embedded in our brain to become a member of the Liberal Party that the government can control. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the actions of the Prime Minister and his team of people. Let is look at what he is doing to his own members who sit beside him--forget about everybody else, including the taxpayers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the member for Davenport, the dean of this House, is one of the most honourable members I know. I will say that because I have worked with him many times. We may have different politics, but he is a very honourable member. He told me yesterday that he is not seeking the Liberal nomination, but running as an independent. Why? Because the Prime Minister's henchmen are trying to oust him from his seat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal   Party  says that its members can have free votes if they get here, but first of all they will have to submit to surgery. They will have to have a computer chip implanted in their brain so the Liberal Party can control them. It will not allow them here unless they sign their life away outright. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the member for Davenport not seeking the Liberal nomination? Because he does not want to sign a pledge that he cannot run as an independent if he loses. He knows the Liberal Party is out to get him. It is not just the member for Davenport, it is the member for Parkdale--High Park. I have personally spoken to her. Those members will not speak in public for fear of what would happen to them. It is the member for Hamilton East who is receiving the press. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is going after his own. How can we possibly expect him to treat Parliament with any kind of respect? How can we expect him to treat taxpayers' money after what we have seen over the last five years?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's words are meaningless. He has only been in office a few months and look at his actions. They are deplorable, shameful and disgraceful. Then he comes out with this nice warm fuzzy throne speech. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would hon. members like some more quotes? I wish I had unlimited time. I could stay here until about next week some time. The Speech from the Throne states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This will include an enhanced role for Members to shape laws.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we seen? I have not seen any new laws, have hon. members? I have seen a lot of Mr. Chrétien's bills, the former Prime Minister's bills, tabled word for word. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. He is trying to portray this as a new government. That is ridiculous. Half the cabinet faces are the same.  The minister who was charged in the advertising scandal is now the Minister of Finance. Imagine that. The guy who is out there looking after the public purse or looking after these contracts is now the caretaker of taxpayers' dollars. The minister responsible for the Treasury Board got a standing ovation in Parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of the Liberals are absolutely inconsistent and diametrically 180 degrees opposite to the words of the throne speech. I ask every single Canadian to look at this scandal. This is not a few thousand dollars. This is hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine having somebody buy a Rolex watch because the Liberals needed some for the department. First they sent a contract out and they skimmed $15,000 or $20,000 off the top. That was not good enough. The person who got the contract then sends his son, who gets another $15,000. The Auditor General's report is full of this. Imagine transferring money from one department to another department and paying half a million dollars in commissions. It is outrageous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, who was the CFO of the public purse and entrusted to look after those dollars, remained silent. Silence is consent. He did not speak up; he did not question. He did not look at the concerns out there. We were raising questions. The Liberals absolutely blew them off and now they are asking us to trust them. I do not think so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to some more points here. This is an amazing one:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that. The ethics commissioner's bill  is still not independent as once promised.  He does not report to Parliament and is not answerable to Parliament as  a whole. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is being fraudulent. It is defrauding the people of Canada. It is defrauding Parliament when the Liberals say they want to bring in a new ethics commissioner.  He is the same guy who is in charge of all of this. He is telling the Prime Minister that it is okay because he is in a blind trust, that he could have briefings on Canada Steamship Lines, and that it is okay that he received hundreds of millions in government contracts.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pictures becomes pretty clear when we start putting all the pieces together. The Prime Minister has been in power a few months. We have been in Parliament a few weeks. We have to appoint a new independent inquiry. We are getting a new inquiry almost once a week. What does that say?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new administration. This is the same old administration. We are seeing the same old standards and Canadians deserve better.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would ask the member, has he read the Speech from the Throne, and has he followed the deliberations in the House and the activities of the government and the Prime Minister? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to the question of restoring trust. When we look at the Auditor General's report, we must look at the actions of the government and the Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said the activities were unacceptable. He did not hide behind any definitions. He cancelled the sponsorship program on the day that he was sworn in. He has called for a judicial inquiry as recommended by the Auditor General. He has referred the matter to the public accounts committee, appointed an independent counsellor and recalled the ambassador. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know that one could say that he has been hiding. Everything he has done is to ensure integrity.   I believe, as does the rest of the House, that the Minister of Finance, like the member for Davenport, are members with impeccable integrity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member, what other actions would he have asked for? How can he define that as hiding and not as restoring trust?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-807494"></A><a HREF="#Int-807508"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-807487"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Lunn: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will start with the last question first. We talk about integrity and specifically about the member for Davenport who is the dean of this House. The Prime Minister has his henchmen out after him. That is a known fact. That member is not even seeking the Liberal nomination because he does not have a chance against the Prime Minister's machine and is running as an independent. Those are the facts. Those are the actions. How is that showing any kind of ethics? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the government cancelled the sponsorship program after it had its hands in the cookie jar--it might as well have crawled right inside the cookie jar. It is great after it had been caught and exposed; however, the Prime Minister had this report for months. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that this scandal did not happen yesterday. It did not happen six months ago. This has been going on for five years while the Prime Minister was the CFO of the government. Did he do anything then?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot just blow off millions of dollars and not notice it. Where is the accountability? If he did not know, then we must ask the question, is he competent? It is a fair question. Who is doing the checks and balances? Are cheques written out willy-nilly? There is not even a paper trail quite often, but it is okay to just send out the cheques. Those are the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he has called for an inquiry. We seem to be getting a new inquiry every single week. When are we going to get an inquiry for the recent scandals in British Columbia? Oh, I forgot. That is on the other side of the Rocky Mountains so it does not matter. We can forget about British Columbia because we do not really care about those people out there. When that scandal broke, the Prime Minister responded that it had nothing to do with him. The police had not asked him any questions about it and he did not feel that he needed to respond.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of top lieutenants in British Columbia who are legislative assistants in the legislature earning $60,000 a year and flew to the Prime Minister's coronation in Toronto on private jets at a cost of $65,000 paid for by the Liberal Party of Canada. Where is the inquiry into that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the tens of thousands of memberships that David Basi, one of the Prime Minister's top henchmen, signed up? CTV cameramen went door to door asking if people in my riding belonged to the Liberal Party of Canada.  People were shocked to find out they were on the list. A few had been called but had not paid for memberships. These are the indisputable facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can talk about what is in print but what is in print is diametrically 180 degrees opposite to the actions of the government.  Liberals do not deserve one seat in the House of Commons. I remind them to look back at what happened in the last British Columbia election when we saw a government which spent half a billion dollars on fast ferries. They had no respect for taxpayers' dollars. They were reduced to two seats because they did not deserve to represent the people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither does this government.  It is time that Canadians look up. I look forward to the election when Canadians will have an opportunity to express their thoughts of this government on the ballot.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat down to prepare my speech for today, I was full of different title ideas. It got to be kind of a joke in the office because we looked at the Prime Minister and we thought about the titles he could have used on the front of his throne speech. He could have used, “We have made these promises before. You believed we would do it and voted for us, now we will try it again”. Or it could have been something like, “I was a senior cabinet minister for nine years but I do not want to talk about that”, or “I know I was Chrétien's right-hand man and in charge of the public purse, but let us pretend I was not”. Or should I call it  what it was, “Promises, promises, promises, all guaranteed to be broken again”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party is expecting the general public to ignore its culture of corruption and to re-elect the Liberals  again. There is a limit to how many times Canadians will fall for the same old dirty tricks. A quick review of the nation's media shows the wheels are starting to fall off the  tired, corrupt Liberal government. Canadians were hoping for a new Prime Minister who would bring in a throne speech with new ideas but were sorely disappointed to hear the same old Liberal promises, almost down to the word.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1994 throne speech, the former prime minister said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The government has made a number of commitments to the people of Canada.  They  will be implemented.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the lies began, just four paragraphs into the throne speech. The only reason the current Prime Minister can make the same promises the Liberals made a decade ago is that  they broke almost all of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the former prime minister poured on the deception even more when he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right">
</td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies and more lies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General has exposed the culture of corruption and deceit within the Liberal Party; the theft of public money by Liberals for Liberals. There were promises of an independent ethics counsellor. We are still waiting. There were promises to reduce the regulatory and paper burden on small business and streamline the delivery of programs, promises to eliminate the GST, promises to fix the health care system, promises to implement aboriginal self-government, promises to resolve aboriginal land claims, promises to be active and influential in the global arena. All of these have proven to be corrupt lies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the latest throne speech promises to do the same. I am sure members can understand our skepticism in the Liberals' sincerity. We have heard this all before. They will not deceive the Canadian voter again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For almost a decade the current Prime Minister willingly and eagerly defended this abysmal record. Why? Because he was an integral part of making it happen. The Prime Minister slashed health funding, slashed education funding, increased taxes, lowered our standard of living, slashed our military and peacekeeping budgets, kept the GST, failed our aboriginal people, watched homeless shelters overflow and child poverty rates increase. Why he would want to campaign on that record is beyond me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the part of the throne speech that disappointed me most was the lack of attention to farm families. The entire agriculture sector, farm families, BSE affected farmers, drought affected grain farmers, all of them received just two measly sentences of attention. There were just two sentences for farm families. Even Flat Mark got more attention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister promised to address the concerns of western Canadians. Little did we expect that the promise would be broken before he even started. The Prime Minister promised a new standard of integrity and honesty, just like Jean Chrétien's promise. That promise went out the window too.</p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister wants us to trust him with our precious tax dollars but he cannot be honest about how much  will end up in the pockets of his family and the Liberal Party. This corruption has to stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it would not have looked that favourably on the Liberals had the truth come out during the leadership campaign.  The Prime Minister and his sons received $161 million. The entire health care system received a mere $2 billion.  Just think, $161 million for mom, dad and their three boys and $2 billion for 31 million other Canadians.  Our vision of a responsible, accountable government is obviously not the same as the Prime Minister's. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did I want to see in the throne speech?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our farm families made a priority.  How much more do they have to suffer to get three sentences in the Prime Minister's next speech?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our rural communities given the tools they need to thrive.  Rural folks from coast to coast have a history of survival but the government has put them to the test.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our health system functioning under sustainable, predictable federal funding. I wanted to end the travelling federal-provincial funding circus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our inner city neighbourhoods and their low income residents rise from under the burden of overtaxation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our environment protected through real action plans, not just rhetoric delivered through idling ministerial limousines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see  pride and effectiveness returned to our military.  I want to see our men and women wearing the right colour of clothing and having the right equipment for the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see Canada push forward to take its rightful place on the world stage.  I have had enough of playing second fiddle to our allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our aboriginal people removed from the cycle of dependence the Liberals have put them in.  They are a proud people and unshackled they will succeed, especially our aboriginal women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see our children made a priority.  I want a government that promotes education and community, not the use of marijuana.  We need a young offenders act that protects children, not one that makes it easier for the bullies to rule the schoolyard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see a national sex offender registry.  How many more victims do we need before the Liberal government pays attention?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see a clear family policy that makes raising our next generation easier for struggling young parents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see all our emergency personnel get the tools and funding they need to protect us.  They put their lives on the line for us every day and the least we can do is equip and fund them properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see an end to corporate welfare, a marketplace where the firms with the best products and people stand a chance against Liberal donors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see victims' rights made a priority.  Canada too often sees its victims forced to go public calling for justice.  That is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see tough penalties for parole violations and tough penalties for the use of firearms in the commission of an offence.  We have tried the Liberal method of gun control and it has failed.  We just need to ask the citizens of Toronto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see fixed election dates. Fixed dates would end the uncertainty and paralyzing of government that  occurs every one out of four years in a glaring display of partisan political manipulation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to see a commitment to defend the supremacy of Parliament.  If the Liberal-appointed courts continue to make the laws of this land, we will ensure the irrelevancy of the House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was so much I was hoping to see with a change in the Prime Minister's office. Unfortunately, it appears that the only thing that has changed is the name on the door.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will likely get an opportunity to register their opinions in one of those politically timed elections this spring.  I am not sure that current polls truly reflect the growing fatigue Canadians have of the Liberal Party.  Canadians from coast to coast have become the victims of the Liberal government's failure to govern.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So bad have these problems become that one need only refer to them in a few words. They are softwood lumber, the BSE crisis, Sydney tar ponds, gun crime, victims' rights, Shawinigate, Quebec advertising, provincial jurisdiction, health care funding, waiting lists, education funding, military funding, homelessness, urban decay, self-government, political financing, the GST, gas taxes, airline taxes.  The list goes on and on but   unfortunately, time dictates that I cannot.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a pleasure to voice the concerns of the millions of Canadians who were ignored by the throne speech.  It has been a pleasure to provide Canadians with a real alternative to the tired, old, corrupt government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  the hon. member talked about the lack of mention of the agriculture industry in the throne speech. Does  she think the government realizes how important that industry is to Canada? Also does she think the government  understands the seriousness of what is happening out there to  the industry?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our ridings, provinces and regions  the BSE problem and border shutdown are serious. It is coast to coast. It goes much  beyond just saving the family farm.  This is about an industry that is going down and we are very concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched the take note debate and heard the stories of members from the Liberal ridings as well as throughout the Ontario and Quebec ridings. All parties  have been  affected, as have their constituents.  I am wondering, do they realize they are the people who are to make decisions? I would like her comments.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it was very interesting the other day when our senior agriculture critic asked a question about the agricultural problems and  BSE.  A member from the opposite side said that agriculture does not have problems, that it has lots of money.  I asked him across the aisle during our mini debate that was going on how he knew.  He said that he did farmers' books.  I asked if they were from rural Saskatchewan and he said no, but  that the weekend before a report had come out about prairie agriculture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time income dropped was in 1929 in the Great Depression.  It is lower.  Our farm families are on the verge of complete collapse.  People in Canada must realize that the free food policy that all members have in the cities will  be gone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge problem out there.  We are losing farm families. There were six farm families lined up for social welfare in Saskatchewan. They are so desperate that they are going for welfare because there is no funding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Agriculture talks about opening borders, travelling and talking to people.  I want to say through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Liberal caucus today that does not help farm families.  Farm families do not have access to any money. This is right across Canada.  We need help for agriculture. If we want to have a livestock industry in this country, the Liberal government must step forward immediately to help these people and try to solve this problem. Platitudes will not save agriculture in  Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member raised  the issue  of BSE which is a scourge across the country.  It is hurting all areas, whether people are ranchers or dairy farmers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she not agree with the work that has been done by the minister and the previous minister to make sure that we take the science based approach and that we work with our partners?  The results we have had so far have been pretty good.  We are the  country to have its  border reopened the quickest, although it is only partially opened and we want to see it go further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she not agree that the answer to it is the trade question?  It is a question of making sure the border is opened.  Would she not agree that all communities are thankful for the amount of funding that has come forward for farm families?  It does not make up for closed borders, but it assists those families.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised  an excellent question. We see it right across the whole livestock industry. The cervid industry, the sheep industry and the bison industry have  been brought into it, not because they have no disease but because the borders are closed to livestock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because western Canada does not have a lot of meat packing plants, we cannot move our livestock cross-border. We cannot go anywhere.  Animals from western Canada cannot travel to eastern Canada to be slaughtered. I heard of a bison farmer who gave away 100 cows because there was nothing he could do about it.  There is no place to take them and no one will take them because we do not have slaughter plants.</p>

Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to give notice that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for West Nova.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand here proudly to support the Speech from the Throne.  It is a speech that has given a clear vision and a commitment to put in place the building blocks that will in fact bring this country into the 21st century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something unique about this Speech from the Throne that no one has noticed.  They have said that it is more of the same.  This Speech from the Throne does something very important.  It has joined the linkages between economic development and social development.  It has created that circle that most of us who like to be policy wonks have understood.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that if we do not have a stable economy we cannot build social development.  If we do not have good social development where people are healthy, where they have skills, where they have training where they work and where those who have been left out we remove the barriers so they can get in, then we will not have increased productivity, increased economic development or competitiveness.  Therefore we will not have that circle being formed. It goes around.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we bring those linkages together  we would be looking at policy in a completely different way.  It means that the government will look at the same old problems and find different processes by which to deal with them.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will be looking at short and long term strategies; looking at how we work horizontally with   other departments within the federal government;  looking at how we work and form partnerships with communities and  other levels of government, such as provincial governments and municipalities; looking at  how we build partnerships with the private sector; and looking at unique new ways of doing things together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has decided that we cannot  just  throw money at problems.  In 20 years from now we do not want to be sitting around asking what we will do about the same old problems.  We have to change the way we deal with those problems now.  That is what makes me very excited about this particular Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech has drawn the linkages between the fact that we need to invest in people.  However  to do that we need a stable economy.  If we have  money and  we invest in people, then those people will continue to produce and continue to increase the economic status and  competitiveness of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, members will see that there was also a door open to ensure that those people who have been left out, who have  not been able to fully participate in the economic and social life of the country, will now have an opportunity to do so in a real and meaningful way that will make change happen.  We are back to process again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the aboriginal peoples, new Canadians and immigrants who have not been able to participate and work.  They have been underemployed and unemployed.  We are looking at persons with disabilities.  We are talking about the cities that are facing insurmountable problems at the moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we work together to make those changes occur?  That is what the Speech from the Throne is about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I would love to speak for two hours on all   the things that excite me about the Speech from the Throne, l want  to focus on one for which  I have been given special responsibility by the Prime Minister:   to look at the issue of foreign credentials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at some very interesting statistics.  Currently  Canada has a falling birth rate and  an increasing aging population.  Within 10 years we will have an increase of 50% of people who are between the ages of 55 and 65.  That is very important for us.  We do not have a birth rate that will  replace those people.  Baby boomers will  reach that age in 20 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country has always depended on immigration for its labour force and it population growth.  Currently  50% of our growth in population is dependent on immigration.  In another 10 years we will be dependent on immigration for 100% of our population growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently we depend on immigration for 70% of our labour force growth.  In another eight years we will be depending on immigrants for 100% of our labour force growth.  Because of the aging population and the drop in birth rate we do not have the people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not alone in any of this.  We are seeing that most of the developed countries in Europe and in other parts of the world are facing the same problems:  low birth rate, aging population.  Who will do the work?  Those countries are out there competing with us for a new labour force, for people to come in and work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has to do a couple of things.  This is why this has become a priority for the Prime Minister.</p>


	<A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister recognizes that   currently about 540,000 people   in Canada   do  not have work or are underemployed with regard to their own training.  The House should know that about 70% of new  immigrants to  Canada have degrees and diplomas and 45% of our new immigrants have a university degree, and yet they are underemployed. This is a loss of about $5.5 billion currently to our GDP.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is  a social integration issue, not allowing everyone to participate fully in Canada, but it  is also a productivity issue as we can see from our labour force needs.  It is also an economic issue in terms of our GDP.  It is a competitive issue because other countries are in the same boat and are looking for the same pool within which to get their  labour force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an urgent issue but in the new way we are doing things we want to deal immediately with the problems.  We are facing critical shortages, for instance, of doctors, nurses, health technicians and pharmacists.  We have to do work on that immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the long term prospect, not only of persons who  we will need over the next 10 year period  for our labour force, but how, as we bring new people into the country, we integrate them as speedily as possible. Recognition of foreign credentials, training and skills is one of the first steps.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However those are not the only barriers.  We need to look at language proficiency.  Many people, even if we recognize their degree as a physician, they will not  be able to work with people if they do not have a proficiency for practising medicine in English and French.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at Canadian experience. Most employers are asking for Canadian experience.  How do we go about getting our new immigrants and our citizens the kind of experience that they need in order   to work effectively in the labour market?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though credentials are provincial,  we need to set up joint strategies.  We have begun to work on this.  We need to provide  in the resources, which we have already begun to do in the 2003 Speech from the Throne.  We have started to work with doctors, and with provinces that are our partners, to develop a new labour force of doctors  to meet the critical needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working horizontally with six departments in the federal government and  building on  those partnerships is what is in our long term strategic plan.  I look forward to the government making sure that  comes to pass.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: As a result of procedural circumstances, I am once again in a position where I have to initiate debate on Motion No. 382. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the unexpected events of last December, when Her Excellency signed a royal proclamation creating a  National Acadian Day commemorating the deportation of Acadians, I pondered for a long what should become of this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked about the issue with several individuals and I must say that not everyone was of the same opinion about this.  However, I have to recognize that the fate of this motion does not rest with  me alone, but with all the members of this House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have launched a series of consultations with colleagues to settle the issue, because clearly, the problem is now quite different from what it was when we first wrote the motion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These consultations are continuing and will, I am absolutely certain, enable us to reach consensus before the motion is put to a vote.  Perhaps we will be able to finally write an ending to this troubling chapter of our collective history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you probably aware, right before the holiday period, December 9 of last year to be precise, the previous government unexpectedly made public a royal proclamation.  It established July 28 each year as “A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proclamation is to take effect on September 6, 2004,  and the day will be commemorated for the first time on July 28, 2005.  I was totally amazed to learn that the former heritage minister and the former intergovernmental  affairs minister had taken this initiative  with their colleagues in order to achieve this reversal.  It was as unexpected as it was spectacular. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable that so much time and energy was required to get my Liberal colleagues to finally take the necessary steps to achieve formal acknowledgment of these tragic events.  These are the same people who, not so long ago, were fighting tooth and nail to defend their categorical refusal to do such a thing. They spared no sarcasm in their remarks to me, claiming that looking back into the past was futile and the Acadians would gain nothing from it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that I have always known, deep down in my heart, that the time would come when truth and justice would prevail.  This action by my Liberal colleagues was all the more remarkable and praiseworthy.   Although the date of July 28 is not unanimously accepted by the community of historians and specialists in Acadian history, I am still extremely pleased that the federal government has finally decided to have a day to commemorate the deportation of the Acadians.  In this way, the Governor General, on behalf of the Crown of Canada, henceforth recognizes the suffering inflicted upon the Acadians by the Great Upheaval.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt whatsoever that such a gesture of major historical significance has a symbolic value that cannot be denied or downplayed.  From now on, the Great Upheaval can no longer be considered a non-event or a myth, believed by some never to have occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in the history of Canada, we have official acknowledgment that the Acadians were the victims of a great tragedy which changed the face of Acadia and Canada forever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deportation is now acknowledged to be an undeniable historical fact, as stated in the Royal Proclamation, which reads:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss in not mentioning the enormous amount of  work done by  the Société Nationale de l'Acadie, which took on this cause and unflaggingly sought recognition by the British Crown of the wrongs done to the Acadian people during the Great Upheaval. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the clear, frank, direct and uncompromising wording of the proclamation's preamble. When I first heard vague rumours that such a proclamation was being secretly prepared in the back rooms of government, I suspected trickery, bad faith and machinations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the acrimonious tenor of the debate to that point, I feared that they would try to cloud the issue by resorting to the convenient euphemism of the Great Upheaval, and limit themselves to sickeningly inoffensive generalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the case, indeed it is quite the opposite. The text of the proclamation spells out the story of the deportation and the considerable suffering caused to the Acadian people. The proclamation even goes so far as to recognize that the decision to deport the Acadians was not made by the colonial authorities in Nova Scotia, Massachusetts and Maine alone, as some have claimed even in this House, but in fact by the Crown itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for that reason alone, we must recognize that this is an unprecedented gesture. Still, the reasons for rejoicing and satisfaction end there. While it is undoubtedly a significant step forward, the proclamation does not deal with the root of the problem, which remains untouched, because this is the Crown of Canada recognizing the facts of the deportation. The British Crown, which ought at least to assume moral responsibility for these tragic events, has not yet officially recognized them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may seem like a subtle distinction, but it is not. The fact that the Crown of Canada, like that of Australia or even New Zealand, followed suit and did what the legislative assemblies in Louisiana and Maine have done, is certainly very comforting and nice, but nothing can replace recognition directly from the British Crown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crown of Canada should not have to recognize  wrongs for which it bears no responsibility, and should certainly not have to do instead of an entity that still exists, namely the British Crown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear to me, and I believe I have demonstrated this many times in this House, that the Crown was not only well aware of what was afoot in Acadia, but was at the heart of the operation that had been brewing for a number of years to allow British and American settlers to occupy fertile Acadian lands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Acadians were allowed to stay on their land so that they would not pack up their belongings and livestock and increase the ranks of the French settled on Ile Royale, further strengthening the influence of the Fortress of Louisbourg in the region. That is why Acadian neutrality suited the British so well. But then again, they took exception to it many times and in the end they used it as an excuse to justify the Deportation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in 1720, the Governor-in-chief of Nova Scotia, Colonel Philipps, taking into consideration these military and economic imperatives, expressed a wish in a letter to London:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—a plan needs to be made in the motherland to populate this land with people from Great Britain... Until then, the inhabitants will not even think about leaving, ...until I have received your new instructions. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of that year, Philipps received a response from the Bureau des colonies:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—The French in Nova Scotia will never become good subjects of His Majesty... That is why they should be expelled as soon as the forces we plan to send you arrive in Nova Scotia...Do not yourself undertake such an expulsion without a specific order from His Majesty to that effect. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, in 1747 to be more precise, the governor of Massachusetts, William Shirley, assured Acadians that they could remain peacefully on their own land, while he was negotiating with London to have them deported. In response to a proposal from him to that effect, the Secretary of State said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Although the removal of these inhabitants from the province is desirable, His Majesty has decided that it would be better to postpone this project. However, His Majesty requests that you examine how such a project could be carried out at a suitable time.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in 1753, Charles Lawrence was appointed governor of Nova Scotia. A year later, he would send a letter to London about Acadians, in which he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Their land holdings are the largest and the richest in the province. As long as that situation remains, no settlement would be successful--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after Vice-Admiral Boscawen arrived from England, on July 8, 1755, with “secret instructions signed by His Majesty”, the decision was finally made, and on the 28th of the same month, the removal of Acadians was carried out.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no longer any doubt in my mind about the direct involvement of the British Crown in this upheaval, there is a questionable and quite surprising substitution in the proclamation issued in December. To follow up on a point the Liberals have used recently to criticize my initiative, the proclamation stipulates that Canada is a sovereign state and that, with regard to Canada, the Crown in right of Canada and of the provinces succeeded to the powers and prerogatives of the Crown in right of the United Kingdom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I remind the House that the Crown in right of Canada and Canada itself, as we know it today, did not exist in 1775.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as Université de Moncton professor Kamel Khiari pointed out, in crimes such as this great upheaval that could be compared to the ethnic cleansing  occurring these days, responsibility cannot be transferred to the successor state but remains in perpetuity with the predecessor state. If the predecessor state still exists, it is responsible for those crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Canadian royal proclamation only affects, so to speak, Acadians in Canada. Although it is not trivial, this action has officially no effect on Acadians in Louisiana or in Belle-Île-en-Mer, for example. Indeed, it is not the federal government, or the Société nationale de l'Acadie, or even this Bloc member that started this whole saga to seek official recognition of the wrongs done to the Acadian people during the deportation, but a lawyer from Louisiana, Warren Perrin, to whom I want to pay tribute today.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the argument that it was incumbent upon the Canadian government, and not the British Crown, to take formal action to recognize the facts surrounding the deportation was only a legal and constitutional manoeuvre to set the process in motion for what appears to several people as a rather surprising flip flop by a faction that was heretofore vehemently opposed to such an action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that, under the circumstances, this was a fair political manoeuvre and the government now had to oppose the very mechanism provided in the wording of the motion. In this regard, I want to say that the motion was initially written with the cooperation of the clerk of the House and his staff, following thorough research on relevant precedents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian government understood well the limits of the action that it took, since it announced at the same time that an “unofficial” invitation had been extended to Her Majesty so that she could personally read this proclamation in Grand-Pré, a highly symbolic place for the Acadian people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be very sad to try to lead the Acadian people to believe that, by this proclamation, the page has definitely been turned and this saga is finally over. I sincerely believe that this royal proclamation would only be truly meaningful if Her Majesty herself would read it. The Canadian government even provided for this possibility in the proclamation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This historic event could take place next September 5, during the celebrations surrounding the 400th  anniversary of the foundation of Acadia, or on July 28, 2005, which will be the first Day of the Commemoration of the Great Upheaval. The reading of the proclamation by Her Majesty would have the effect, to paraphrase the president of the Société Nationale de l'Acadie, of  “crowning” the representations made to seek official recognition of the wrongs done to the Acadian people during the deportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action by Her Majesty, who embodies the authority of the two Crowns, could then be interpreted as a de facto recognition, by the British Crown, of the terms of the proclamation signed by the Canadian Crown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the House of Commons must support the December 9 royal proclamation and formally invite Her Majesty to come and read this proclamation in Canada, preferably in Acadia, in a place and at a time to be determined by Buckingham Palace, the Canadian government and the Société Nationale de l'Acadie.  We could then put closure on the parliamentary aspect of this saga, which has already had a very positive impact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that, this time, we will leave partisanship aside and think about the best interests of the Acadian people, and that all of us will gather here in this House to salute and applaud the action taken by the government in December, and will join our voices to that of the government to formally invite Her Majesty to come to read the proclamation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion M-382.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to say that the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes takes to heart this issue that he is raising in the House of Commons for the third time. He never gave up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, the Liberal government was saying that this was partisanship, that he was doing this because of his party. However, on several occasions, I had the opportunity to say that it was not the case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, at the beginning of the Acadians' history, the Bergerons were from the Rivière-Saint-Jean. Mrs. Bergeron, who had met Jean-Baptiste Godin and had married him, had moved to Caraquet. This is why, when the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes and I meet, we say we are distant cousins. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois. This has to do with a long history. He has shown this and hopefully people here in the House of Commons and outside the House have come to understand that this history goes back to his roots and this is why this motion is so dear to his heart. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am proud to see that the government has made some progress. It has, in fact, recognized the deportation. It did not want to use the words “wrongs done to Acadians”. It did not want to speak of the “apology” that should be made, but it has recognized that there was a deportation. Nevertheless, everything the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes has asked for has been diluted, from beginning to end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something else I find interesting in all this. In the House of Commons, the Liberals voted against an apology by the British Crown. They also voted against recognition of the harm done to Acadians. But, when it came time to recognize the deportation, they were all in place for the family portrait. I was at home watching television. I tuned in to RDI and saw the hon. member for Hamilton East making the declaration here in Ottawa, with the representatives of the SANB. You could see the family portrait of the Liberals who wanted to take the credit for all of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just had to mention that. I thought it was amusing. They are not able to vote in favour of a motion but when it is time to recognize the deportation and look for the credit, they are right there in the family photo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to go back to the history of the Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deportation of the Acadians took place between 1755 and 1763. The Acadians speak of the Great Upheaval. I think that is a greatly understated way to describe the tragedy the Acadian people experienced and that, in itself, is something that shows their great strength of spirit. Longfellow's epic poem, <i>Évangéline</i>, describes the painful historic reality of the Acadians and paints a picture of a brutal and cruel deportation. And that is pretty much what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the British army arrived, Acadia was a region that included today's New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. It consisted of a long string of rural and seafaring communities living by trade, fishing, farming and forestry. The families of Acadia were the first European families to settle in Canada, 400 years ago. These communities lived in perfect harmony with the indigenous peoples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British army came to Acadia, it acted like an army of occupation and tried to force the Acadians to swear allegiance to the Queen, without exception and without any respect for their cultural or religious differences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Acadians refused, the British army reacted with brutality, burning down homes, taking control of fertile lands, and splitting up families by making men, women and children board different ships to be deported to Louisiana—these are today's Cajuns—and all over the coast of what is now the eastern United States. Others ended up in jails in England or were forced to go back to France.</p>


	<A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can imagine, the hardships and injustice continued long after the journey ended. The hardships and intolerance are akin to what was experienced by the first nations, the Métis and all our aboriginal peoples, something that, in many instances, they continue to live with the consequences of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still today, we can see human rights being trampled in many countries. Around the world, religious, linguistic or cultural minorities are being persecuted and see their rights trampled, often very violently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada itself is far from perfect. It seems to be hard for us, in Canada, to make amends for denying the rights of native Canadians, who are still living in deplorable conditions. We often have trouble maintaining a democratic, open and egalitarian society. Nothing can be taken for granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the good news is that modern Canada, born from this terrible tragedy, was built on a solid foundation of linguistic duality, tolerance and openness to differences. The key to modern Canada, as found in section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, relies on the principle of equal rights and on our refusal to impose our will on a minority, where human rights are concerned. It is on such a positive attitude that modern Canada was built. Refusing to let the might makes right principle prevail has made Canada a showplace of unity with diversity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why today we are free to debate this motion which reflects the will not only of the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes but of the Acadian people that still bears deep scars as a result of this cruel attempt to eradicate them and trample over their dignity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acadian Canadians are proud to  have survived the challenge of le Grand Dérangement. Today they are strong and proud members of the Canadian family. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Acadian, I support this motion.  The exclusion of Acadians was a senseless act.  For those who think that this is the way they used to do business in those days, may I remind them of a more recent event: the 1923 Chinese  exclusion act, which  also separated families by making it impossible for a wife to join her husband. Parliament rescinded the outrageous Chinese exclusion act and issued a formal apology to the Chinese Canadian community. </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last December 9, the royal proclamation had a serious impact on the initiatives seeking official recognition of the wrongs done to the Acadian people during the great upheaval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a little watered down, the December royal proclamation was a step in the right direction. The Acadian people is now officially recognized and its turbulent past is no longer just a legend, it is a recognized historical fact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the proclamation to have a real impact on Acadian people, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II should do what the Acadian people expect of her and read the royal proclamation in Acadie, and more specifically in Grand-Pré, where the great upheaval occurred. Such a symbolic gesture would, in my mind, be the best way to recognize the wrongs done to the Acadian people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me point out that Her Majesty the Queen has ample opportunities to come to Acadia and read the proclamation. She could do it this year, when Acadia is celebrating its 400th anniversary, or even in 2005, which will be the 250th anniversary of the great upheaval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the hon. member for Hamilton-East says that it is only a matter of extending an invitation to Her Majesty, who would be more than pleased to come and read the proclamation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge all members to consider the motion and ask Parliament to invite Her Majesty to Acadia to recognize the important role played by the Acadian people, who helped build our great country. And she could also take the opportunity to celebrate with us.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think  there is one member of Parliament in the House, or in fact one Canadian, who is not touched by these historical facts.  The Acadian deportation is sad and unsavoury.  What our Acadian ancestors withstood cannot and must not be forgotten.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our collective memory is full of stories and explanations about why it happened, about the reasons behind such actions.  Historians try to understand the thinking of our forefathers, of those from another time and era who behaved differently, thought differently, and reacted differently than we would today.  It cannot be understood.  It cannot be explained.  In my mind, it was ethnic cleansing.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to change history. The deportation of the Acadians, no matter how we look at it, is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that today's Acadians understand this. Far from being simply a folklore element that only our elderly are dwelling upon, their history is now and forever a tragic episode in a reality that cannot be changed. Our children and our grandchildren will remember this. We may go back in times and wish that some incidents never happened or would have been dealt with differently, attempts to change the past will only be  wishful thinking. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us come back to Motion No. 382. Why are we still debating this motion? It seems to me that, in December, when the Government of Canada announced the signing of a royal proclamation designating July 28 of each year as A Day of Commemoration of the Great Upheaval, the issue had a happy ending. I say happy since at that time the Acadians themselves, through the president of the Société nationale de l'Acadie, said they were “very happy with the positive outcome of this issue”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president also said that the proclamation “will also serve as official recognition of the historical facts surrounding the deportation that occurred between 1755 and 1763”. That seems fine to me. If Acadians themselves are satisfied with the results, on what grounds can the member for  Verchères—Les-Patriotes say that it is not enough?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's values are rooted in the lessons taught by history and in our common past. During the installation ceremony of Governor General Roméo LeBlanc, on February 8, 1995, the Right Honourable Primer Minister Jean Chrétien said: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lessons shape what Canadians are today: respected and respectful, open-minded and tolerant, dynamic and vibrant.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us put aside the past for a moment. Today we are faced with a number of priorities that have been clearly defined by official language minority communities in Canada, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, of which I was a member, the Société Nationale de l'Acadie, of which I was a member, and the Fédération acadienne de la Nouvelle-Écosse, of which I was president.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the priorities in question include job creation, health services in French, legal services in French and  early childhood development. I think we should focus on issues that will advance  official language minority communities in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians would probably all agree that this is where the federal government should invest its energy and resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 12, 2003, the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien announced to Canadians new initiatives that would provide $750 million over five years to the action plan for official languages: “Thirty years after the adoption of the Official Languages Act, I am pleased to announce that the Government is giving new momentum to our country’s linguistic duality, as called for by Canadians”, the Prime Minister stated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan, praised by official language minority communities, addresses the urgent problems facing French Canadian communities outside Quebec, including Acadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes a framework for accountability and coordination, and three primary objectives: education, community development and federal public services.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Acadians and francophones want. They want us to invest in their communities to encourage them, help them prosper and grow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be consulted throughout the implementation of the action plan, over a period of five years. We want to hear their comments and wishes. We urge them to get involved and take ownership of this plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these official ministerial consultations took place in Ottawa on October 6, 2003. Seven federal ministers who are involved in the action plan took note of the comments of the communities on the steps  we have taken and explained the progress made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that will not be all. Serious consultations will go on throughout this process.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acadians are tenacious and the spirit of  Acadian entrepreneurs is reflected in the strength of their institutions, commercial enterprises and teaching establishments. They are part of what makes Canada successful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes this dynamism and vital contribution to Canadian society. They are among the seven million people in Canada who speak, sing, write, work and live in French. These francophones are proof of the vitality and extraordinary determination to grow and expand on a  continent with an anglophone majority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's responsibility is to support the growth of the Acadians, to recognize their value as Canadians and their contribution to Canada. Let us face the facts. My colleagues and I are looking to the future as are all Acadians and Canadians. We are the future of Canada and we intend to make the best of it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I cannot understand why the Bloc Quebecois continues to believe that the issue did not have a happy ending. Let us turn to the future. We should focus our energy on the challenges of the future, on the history we are living today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for Lanark—Carleton could not be present  today, so he has asked me to deliver the speech that he has researched and written. On behalf of the member for Lanark—Carleton, I begin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I will be voting against Motion No. 382. My reasons for doing so are twofold. First, I feel that this motion is based on a faulty premise, that being that guilt can be collective and can be passed on from one generation to the next. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, despite the good intentions of those who drafted it, the motion seems to attribute alternate responsibilities for the expulsion of the Acadians to the crown which is not an accurate reading of the events of 1755. A more historically accurate reading would lay blame with the colonial governors of New England and the pioneers they represented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the  historical argument and come back later to the philosophical one. Many of the facts surrounding the deportation of the Acadians are unchallenged. In 1755 the colonial authorities began a process of uprooting and deporting the part of the Acadian population which had settled on British lands beginning with the centre of the Acadian colony along the east shore of the Bay of Fundy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia's Governor Lawrence and Governor Shirley, commander in chief of the British forces in New England, began by seizing colonists' firearms to prevent them from using force to resist. Then they took a large number of adult males hostage in order to guarantee the docility of their families at the time of deportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years which followed, approximately three-quarters of the total Acadian population, or 13,000 people, were deported. Some of these people were sent to England, others to Louisiana and still others were returned to France. Although we know with certainty the degree of suffering caused by the deportations between the years 1755 and 1763, it is much more difficult to pin down historic responsibility for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is certain and that is the governors Lawrence and Shirley were at the heart of the decision making and must bear ultimate responsibility. But nothing proves that they acted with the approval of the Parliament of Westminster. According to the most commonly accepted version of events, Lawrence acted with the authorization of the local council in Nova Scotia and parliament and King George did not take part in the planning of the deportations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will discuss momentarily, I emphasize that I will not support the notion of a collective or hereditary guilt, but even if I did support it, I think that the first collective excuses that should be conveyed to the Acadian people should come from the government of Maine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Queen recently chose to address this issue, deferring a decision on any apology to the Canadian cabinet. As we are all aware, cabinet recently dealt with this issue and this past December, the Governor General signed a royal proclamation regarding this issue. Excerpts from the proclamation read  as follows:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the decision of the government to issue this proclamation, one which seems entirely appropriate to me.</p>


	<A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is a legitimate expectation that all participants in the public life of a civilized society should adopt a moral attitude toward the past.  A moral attitude involves recognizing and embracing those past actions which are regarded as good and just and rejecting those which are regarded as unjust or monstrous.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acknowledgement of the trials and suffering experienced by the Acadian people and the designation of an annual day to commemorate this unfortunate chapter in our history is an appropriate way to address this unfortunate episode.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the proclamation issued by the Crown, however, the motion before the House explicitly requests an apology for this historical wrong.  This is quite a different concept.  It rests on the idea that actual guilt for past injustice can be passed on institutionally and collectively in precisely the same way that the residual effects of that wrong continue to have some impact on the descendants of those who suffered the initial wrong.  This is simply untrue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not accept the notion that an institution can maintain a heritage or a collective guilt that is imposed upon successive generations of those who become members of that institution or who fall under its protection.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attitude of collective guilt or responsibility, or worse yet, of expecting others to accept a mantle of guilt, or responsibility for acts in which they themselves did not take part strikes me as being of no utility at all.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A debate similar to the one taking place today took place in the House 20 years ago on Pierre Trudeau's last day as prime minister. He was asked by Brian Mulroney in question period to issue an apology for the war time internment of Canadians of Japanese descent.  Trudeau's response reveals a subtle grasp to the distinction that I am attempting to draw here today.  He said:</p>


	<p>

<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I do not see how I can apologize for some historic event to which we... were not a party.  We can regret that it happened.  But why...say that an apology is much better than an expression or regret?</small></td>

	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I do not think that it is the purpose of a Government to right the past.  It cannot re-write history.  It is our purpose to be just in our time...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the reasoning of this statement.  In the case of the great upheaval, the wronged parties are long dead.  Those who committed the wrong are long dead.  The British Empire, by whose power the wrongs were perpetrated, no longer exists and the principle of mercantilism on which it was founded has been firmly and absolutely rejected by the present British Crown and state.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, perhaps, the British colonies of New England, in whose interest the wrongs were committed, ceased to exist as political entities over two centuries ago, with the coming of American independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no individual is left, nor even any corporate entity, which can truthfully and honestly accept guilt in its own name, or serve as the justified target of the indignation of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not excuse us from a responsibility to adopt a moral attitude of condemnation toward this great wrong any more than we can adopt an attitude of moral neutrality toward the monstrous evils of more recent times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moral actors, we need to recognize the existence of these past wrongs, to identify them to our fellow citizens and to do all we can to ensure that no modern version of this wrong can occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to applaud the sincere efforts of the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes to ensure that this episode in our history  is not forgotten. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I believe that the recent proclamation, which acknowledges this issue without extending an official apology, is sufficient to express our sorrow for this past wrong.  It allows us, without condemning others, to indicate our determination that no such future wrong will ever be tolerated on Canadian soil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I disagree on both historical and philosophical grounds with the fundamental assumption on which Motion No. 382 rests, that the Crown bears a further responsibility.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I take issue with the historical claim that the British Crown, past or present, bears the ultimate responsibility for the great upheaval.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I disagree with the philosophical claim that we can inherit a collective guilt which places on us a responsibility to apologize for events which took place over two centuries ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I must vote against this motion and encourage others to do so as well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with an attitude of solemnity and respect for history that I take part in this debate initiated by our colleague, the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes.  I realize this is the fourth time this matter is brought before the House, but I am convinced that the hon. member introduced this motion because he wanted us to remember the important contribution of Acadians to the French reality in North America. He has no  vengeful intention of any kind, nor does he have a negative or even pessimistic purpose.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes has spoken with Acadians many times and that he has seen first hand how dynamic a community they form and how much faith in the future that nation has. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that potential for optimism must not keep us from understanding the considerable importance of the deportation, the Great Upheaval, the historical event which took place from 1755 to 1763.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I do not know as well as the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes the events that lead to the deportation, but I have found part of the edict,  order or proclamation by which individual citizens and entire communities were deported from what used to be known as Acadia in the 18th century, that is, the whole region of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to  get into that to provide a clear understanding of what those experiencing this event must have gone through. </p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days, churches played a key role in rallying the community, a tradition that remained for some time.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, here we are in September 1755.  The Acadian community receives a message.  These are francophones, people with roots, with a history, with a love for the area.  They have announced to them by John Winslow, on behalf of George II, the following  words on that September 5, 1755: </p>

It is ordered that your lands and tenements, cattle of all kinds and livestock of all sorts, be forfeited to the British Crown, along with all other effects, saving your money and household goods and you, yourselves, be removed from this Province...    The peremptory orders of His Majesty are that all the inhabitants of this district be deported—</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine an entire community, a founding community moreover, at this midpoint in the 18th century, being uprooted and having to rebuild their lives.  That community was to be scattered to all four corners of the empire, and not always in  the most kindly of ways, often even with the potential of violence and suffering, to say the least.  This was to be recounted in the many writings and historical accounts of this phenomenon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes has been wise, in my opinion, to call upon parliamentarians to remember this event, out of respect for history and for the sake of the future of this community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a movement afoot to rehabilitate historical memory.  Was it not here, in this very House, that former Prime Minister Mulroney presented an apology, on behalf of his government and the people of Canada, to the Japanese Canadian community. They had, as we know, been unjustly imprisoned in concentration camps during World War II? </p>


	<A NAME="T1845"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1845)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did His Holiness Pope John Paul II not also present an apology on behalf of the church and the state, out of respect for history? We know that,  under the Lateran treaties, the Vatican is a state, just as Canada is, just like any of  the 200 states around the world. His Holiness apologized to the Jewish people for the cruel treatment they had suffered throughout history, especially in the 20th century.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, former Premier Bouchard presented, on behalf of his government and of the people of Quebec, an apology to the Duplessis orphans who were mistreated in the orphanages of Quebec in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes was extremely wise to want to restore the memory of history. I understand that one reason behind his motion is to say how much the French fact—the presence of the Acadians in this part of North America that is now New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island—is something that deserves to be commemorated. He wants to invite us to understand that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine what it means for their survival that they are still present among us, with energy, with confidence, with entrepreneurship and, indeed, having made a truly extraordinary contribution to building the Francophonie and helping it expand its influence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes had two objectives. History sometimes casts a cruel light on the past, which nonetheless is important for understanding the future. As we know, in our constitutional history, two Crowns have ruled over Canada. There was the French Crown, New France, from the discovery of the Americas to the proclamation of 1760, and the British Crown, of course,  through to the Statute of Westminster. We now know that the British Crown schemed, gave orders and committed acts in order to make deportation possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jesuit once said that a text taken out of context becomes a pretext. Our colleague from the Conservative Party of Canada was right to remind the House that history cannot be rewritten. It is certainly not the purpose of the motion from the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes to rewrite, reinterpret or change history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion calls on us to recognize the troubled past of the Acadian community that resulted from British Crown policies, because we are grateful to be part of this French reality in North America. I could quote John Kennedy, who said about Canada and the United States, “Geography made us neighbours, history made us friends”. Tonight, I think the people of Quebec could say to Acadians that geography made us neighbours, and history made us friends. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes is attached, as are we, to the French fact in North America, its past and its future, and that is why he has introduced this motion before us this evening on four different occasions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the purpose of his motion is not to demand an apology in a spirit of revenge and negativity.  I believe his actions echo the feelings of a number of his, and our, Acadian compatriots, who will be marking two major events in coming months and weeks.  I am, of course, thinking of the 400th anniversary of the founding of Acadia and the 250th anniversary of the deportation of the Acadians, in September 2005, if I remember correctly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes would like to receive Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on this occasion.  I think it would be impossible for her not to understand the point of this motion, since she must surely have a sense of history, as a member of the House of Windsor, a family that has made a great contribution to history. </p>


	<A NAME="T1850"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1850)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes wants Her Majesty, who should be coming to Canada for one of these events, to read the royal proclamation as a symbolic and positive gesture. The Crown of Canada recognizes the ill treatment and upheavals inflicted on the Acadian people. Unfortunately, our work will not be completely done until we truly understand what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in a genuine gesture of reconciliation, which has involved various government leaders at various times, Her Majesty would agree to read the proclamation, we would come to realize that she shares the suffering inflicted upon the Acadian people, a forward looking and highly vibrant community in whose future we truly believe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the motion put forward by the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes is all about. To conclude, I think all members of Parliament should commend him for his interest in history, his sense of fairness and his incredible support for French-speaking communities throughout North America. </p>
