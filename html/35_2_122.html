	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
three petitions today.
<P>
	The first petition comes from Whitehorse, Yukon. The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that our 
police and firefighters place their lives at risk on a daily basis as 
they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians. They also state 
that in many cases the families of officers who lose their lives in 
the line of duty are often left without sufficient financial means to 
meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of families of police officers and 
firefighters who are killed in the line of duty.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value 
to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families that choose to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

final petition comes from Kanata, Ontario. The petitioners would 
like to draw to the attention of the House that the consumption of 
alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or impair one's 
ability, and specifically, that fetal alcohol syndrome or other 
alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

<P>
	We now move on to debate on Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure today to speak at the report stage of Bill C-23.
<P>
	First of all, to appreciate the amendments the Bloc Quebecois 
wished to propose, we must understand the purpose of Bill C-23.
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-23, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, was 
introduced in this House to replace existing legislation that goes 
back more than 50 years. As a member of the Standing Committee 
on Natural Resources, I engaged in debate and listened to many 
submissions on the changes that should be made in the existing 
legislation, to adapt it for the next millennium.
<P>
	Most of the testimony by witnesses appearing before the Natural 
Resources Committee fell into one of two categories. Basically, 
some said it was necessary to change the existing legislation, which 
was really obsolete, and that the bill as introduced was not a bad 
substitute.
<P>
	There was another group which agreed the legislation was 
obsolete and had to be changed, but since the old legislation had 
been around for 50 years, we could have taken a few more months 
to make changes in the present bill that would have made it even 
better.
<P>
	We should realize that the initial legislation was drafted after 
World War II, when, people will recall, atomic energy was 
associated with the nuclear bombs that fell on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. When the Parliament of Canada discussed the matter, it 
was felt it would be useful to have legislation to control this energy 
which was, of course, synonymous with destruction.
<P>
	After 1950, and especially between 1960 and 1970, nuclear 
energy was touted as a safe and cheap source of energy to which all 
Canadians would have ready access. However, after 1970, after 
Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, and the many problems, even 
with the Candu systems in Europe, one may well wonder how safe 
our nuclear facilities are.
<P>
	That is why the new bill should reflect the public's concern for 
greater transparency. They want a bill that would give them some 
say, the right to oversee actions of the atomic commission such as 
giving powers to a business or an agency or other actions that might 
put the safety or health of Canadians and Quebecers at risk.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc's first amendment to the bill in Motion No. 1 proposes 
that the Department of the Environment and not the Department of 
Natural Resources oversee the legislation.
<P>
	Why? Canadians feel much safer under the umbrella of the 
Department of the Environment than under that of the Department 
of Natural Resources. Clearly, the Department of Natural 
Resources wants natural resources to be developed to their fullest 
for Canadians, whether it be uranium mines or energy. At the same 
time, however, we are told that nuclear energy is hard to control, 
that it takes a lot of research and monitoring. The Department of 
the Environment would be much more capable of giving Canadians 
transparency. To this end, amendment No. 1 would be a fine 
addition to the bill.
<P>
	Therefore, I recommend that all my colleagues vote for this 
amendment, which would permit greater transparency and give 
Canadians even more reasons to trust their institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are several points 
that need to be made here.
<P>
	First, the existing wording specifies the Minister of Natural 
Resources but also specifies ``or such member of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada as the governor in council may designate as the 
minister''. This gives the Prime Minister full discretion when he or 
she appoints a minister through whom the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission will report to Parliament. The existing wording 
therefore contains the flexibility that the NSCA should have.
<P>
	I would point out to members of this House that both the 
Minister of Natural Resources and Dr. Bishop, president of the 
Atomic Energy Control Board, took the opportunity when appear-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7622"> 7622 </A></B>
<P>
ing before the committee to stress the independence of the AECB 
in regulatory matters. There was no disagreement on this important 
principle.
<P>
	I would also note that while the commission will report to 
Parliament through the minister and the minister will be 
responsible for answering questions regarding the commission in 
this House, the minister does not and will not get involved in 
regulatory decision making.
<P>
	The government must reconcile regulation with promotion at 
some level. This is done currently by having the AECB and the 
AECL report to the Minister of Natural Resources. This 
amendment would merely transfer the level at which regulatory 
and promotional interests are reconciled to the cabinet level and 
hence to the Prime Minister. Why not let ministers exercise the 
responsibilities that come with their portfolios?
<P>
	As to whether the Minister of the Environment should be the 
responsible minister, while environmental protection is an object of 
this bill, it is not the only or even the primary object, which is the 
health and safety of workers and the public.
<P>
	This motion is not acceptable to the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, for clarification are we on Motion 
No. 1 or Motion No. 2?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Motion No. 1.
<P>
	Colleagues, in view of the earlier unanimous motion, pursuant to 
the order made, the question on Group No. 1 is deemed put, a 
recorded division demanded and deferred.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to debate on motions in GroupNo. 2. I hope this is clear.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-23 and the report stage 
motions before us for consideration.
<P>
	In addressing the motions put forward by my colleague, the 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, I note the emphasis that has 
been placed on providing the public with information. The motions 
should be viewed with some enthusiasm as they attempt to 
heighten the public awareness about what goes on in Canada's 
nuclear industry.
<P>
	All too often the activities at facilities such as those under the 
administration of AECL are shrouded in secrecy. Granted, the 
public's right to know must be tempered with the considerations of 
national security. However all too often this has meant that the 
government is given a ready made excuse which it can use to limit 
Canadians' access to information where matters of atomic energy 
are concerned.
<P>
	The stated goal of my colleague's motion is specifically 
designed to provide information to educate the Canadian public on 
nuclear activity in Canada. Further, the motions expressly target 
and entrust the Nuclear Safety Commission with the task of 
providing that information to the Canadian public.
<P>
	These measures alone will not guarantee that the nuclear 
industry will function in a more open manner, but it should mark 
the beginning of a much needed step in the right direction. In doing 
so, the government could begin to redress some of the public 
apprehension and misunderstanding which has plagued activity 
within the nuclear industry for the past 50 years.
<P>
	Again I submit to all members that there is a need to inform the 
public on issues where nuclear safety and energy are concerned. 
Given what has been going on at AECL facilities across Canada in 
recent months, public openness by the government is sorely 
needed.
<P>
	For example, Canadians should be told about the closure of the 
Chalk River facility. Canadians should know that their research 
facility was closed down and effectively destroyed by this Liberal 
government on January 31, 1997 at 11 a.m. It did not matter that 
719 scientists, including three Nobel laureates, had pleaded with 
the natural resources minister in October to keep this world class 
research and development facility open.
<P>
	The government had spent $70 million on building the facility 
and now that it has been turned off, it is worth nothing. Many of the 
scientists who worked at that facility are preparing to move to the 
United States where evidently R and D in this field is taken 
seriously.
<P>
	In addition, staff inside TASCC have indicated that equipment 
from Chalk River may find its way into the Brookhaven Institute 
which is also south of the border. Think of the message that is being 
sent out of here by the Canadian government.
<P>
	Reformers and Canadians can speculate on the myopic vision of 
the government's commitment to R and D initiatives in Canada. 
However, the question still remains: Why was this facility closed? 
The Liberals will tell us it was due to financial constraints, yet for 
want of $3 million in operating costs the government has thrown 
away $70 million. In fact, companies like SPAR Aerospace of 
Canada had been financing much of the research effort at TASCC 
with private funds. This trend could have eventually seen the 
facility function independent of tax dollars.
<P>
	Let us look at the government's priority and commitment to 
spending in general. The TASCC facility needed $3 million in 
operating grants which would allow it to continue its experiments. 
The government claimed it did not have the money. Yet, this is the 
same government that piddled away $20 million on a Canadian flag 
giveaway, $100 million toward its unmandated propaganda office 
in Montreal, $87 million  in a loan to the financially sound and 
profitable Bombardier of Montreal. The Liberals also had $2 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7623"> 7623 </A></B>
<P>
million, they found $2 million, to apologize to former Prime 
Minister Mulroney and pay his lawyers.
<P>
	Perhaps highlighting those expenses is not fair to my colleagues 
across the way. After all, as my Liberal colleagues will quickly 
point out, those expenses are extraneous and unrelated to the 
workings of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and nuclear energy 
in general. The members across the way will dutifully bleat that 
their commitments to R and D is well in line with the red ink book 
promises. Really?
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	In much the same fashion Liberal spin doctors can refer to a $25 
billion deficit as commendable. Liberals will no doubt see the loss 
of hundreds of jobs in Chalk River as enhanced R and D. No 
wonder many Canadians have changed the title of the red ink book 
to ``Creative Opportunism''.
<P>
	But does anyone know what the real blow to the Canadian 
taxpayer is? It comes in the area of prioritized R and D spending at 
AECL.
<P>
	Just before Christmas the government announced the sale of 
CANDU technology to the Chinese government. In order to get that 
deal signed the government of Canada committed to lend the 
Chinese government $1.5 billion, financed-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, it is my 
understanding that we are speaking to Motions Nos. 3 and 6, which 
were grouped.
<P>
	Just for clarification, I would like to know which motion the hon. 
member is speaking to. Is it Motion No. 2 or is it the grouping of 
Motions Nos. 3 and 6?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, Motions Nos. 3 and 6. This is 
absolutely not a problem. I can understand why the member would 
be a little embarrassed that we gave the Chinese government $1.5 
billion of Canadian taxpayer money, financed off their backs. They 
do not like that. They do not like to be reminded of that. But the 
people remember. Think what that means.
<P>
	The government was willing to gamble over a $1.5 billion but 
could not come up with a fraction, a tiny fraction of about $3 
million in order that the valuable research work could continue at 
Chalk River. Not even a fraction could it come up with.
<P>
	The auditor general reported in November 1996 that the cost of 
cleaning up contaminated sites at federal facilities was estimated at 
$2 billion. But this does not show up in the government's official 
accounting of its financial position. It is not there.
<P>
	The auditor general's report stated that the $2 billion estimate for 
the federal government's share of the clean-up excludes those costs 
associated with the clean-up of the radioactive waste and that it 
constitutes an unrecognized expenditure that could materially 
affect the government's reported financial condition.
<P>
	On its own, the example just given highlights the lack of proper 
accounting procedure by the federal Liberals and represents one 
more example of mismanagement and lack of accountability to the 
taxpaying public.
<P>
	However, when we place that alongside recent efforts by the 
Minister of Natural Resources to delay and possibly renege on her 
government's promise to dispose of low level radioactive waste 
near the town of Deep River, we get the feeling that this 
government is not serious about conducting such needed research 
in the area of nuclear waste disposal. This is a schizophrenic 
government. There is absolutely no doubt about it.
<P>
	To recap, the government will not recognize the environmental 
disaster in its own back yard or the potential costs associated with 
its clean-up. It is scaling back on its promise to the people of Deep 
River and closing R and D facilities all because it claims it does not 
have funds needed to pay for services in these areas. However, it 
has found $1.5 billion of Canadian taxpayers money to lend to the 
Chinese government.
<P>
	Sadly, I must conclude my remarks on this matter. In doing so, I 
would like to remind members on both sides of the House that Bill 
C-23 is the first such effort in 50 plus years at redefining the 
relationship between the public and the nuclear industry within 
Canada.
<P>
	As such, there is the expectation among Canadians that the 
government will put measures in place which will open up the 
nuclear industry to greater public scrutiny. On the other side, it is 
hoped that the Nuclear Safety Commission tasked with providing 
information to the public would be more transparent in its dealings.
<P>
	By supporting these amendments I believe the government 
would be taking the first tentative steps in this direction and I 
encourage members on both sides of the House to support the 
motions before us now.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to Motion 
No. 3, the nuclear regulator must be and must be seen to be 
unbiased and neutral in its dealings with or support for the nuclear 
industry.
<P>
	The nuclear regulator should be clearly seen by the public as 
avoiding the role of an advocate for the industry. This amendment 
has the potential to compromise the public's faith in the objectivity 
and neutrality of the AECB because it does not limit the scope of 
the regulatory information.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 uses the word educate. Rightly or wrongly, the 
word educate is perceived to have a more proactive connotation 
than the word inform. It raises the possibility that this mandate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7624"> 7624 </A></B>
<P>
could be interpreted to include the possibility of advocacy for or 
against nuclear activities.
<P>
	Providing the commission with a mandate to educate the public 
on non-regulatory nuclear issues would be inconsistent with its 
regulatory role.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 6, it is the government's belief that 
clause 9(b) is the appropriate mandate for the commission on this 
matter. It specifies as one of the commission's objectives the 
dissemination of objective scientific, technical and regulatory 
information to the public on the effects of nuclear activities on 
health, safety and the environment. In fact, the AECB does this 
now through its office for public information. This is what is 
needed, no more and no less.
<P>
	If the proposed amendment is intended to restate the intent of 
clause 9(b) in different words, it is redundant and unnecessary. If it 
is intended to go beyond 9(b), it goes too far. The proposed 
amendments are not acceptable to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in 
my opening remarks, the importance of this bill is in promoting 
greater transparency in Canada's nuclear energy sector. Mon hon. 
colleague from the Liberal Party suggested that providing 
information and education to Canadians in that respect would 
amount to propaganda or promotion of some sort. I completely 
disagree with her because, in my opinion, it is extremely important 
that Canadians make their own choice regarding nuclear energy.
<P>
	If we want them to be able to make a choice, they need 
information. How can one be expected to decide whether there 
should be more or fewer nuclear plants in Canada without 
appropriate information on their impact on the environment, 
including the human environment?
<P>
	The committee heard from stakeholders. People living in the 
vicinity of the Pickering plant came before us saying that they are 
excluded from the decision-making process. They said that surveys 
and polls are conducted but that, when the time comes to make a 
decision, the board ignores the views of the Pickering area citizens' 
committee.
<P>
	I support all the motions moved by our colleague from the 
Reform Party and, therefore, think one of the purposes of this bill 
should be to inform and educate, because there is a difference 
between information and education.
<P>
	Who do you think would be in a position to provide this 
information and education, if not the atomic energy board? This is 
not the kind of information you can get through the education 
system. The board being the primary nuclear energy regulatory 
authority in Canada, it is up to its members, who are familiar with 
the various studies on the public impact of atomic energy, to 
provide clear information to the public, depending on what their 
objective is, so that Canadians can make an informed decision.
<P>
	For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will support these two 
motions, which, in my opinion, improve the bill.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since no one else seems interested in 
talking to this group of motions, pursuant to the agreement reached 
earlier today, all motions in Group No. 2 are deemed to have been 
put and recorded divisions are deemed to have been requested and 
deferred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House will now proceed to debate on the motions in group 
No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased on behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus to rise 
and give our position with respect to Bill C-23, an act to establish 
the Canadian nuclear safety commission and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts and, in particular, motion No. 4 and 
motion No. 5.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 basically calls for the deletion of clause 6, which 
exempts nuclear submarines. We feel that any vessel, whether it is 
fixed or moving in the water, should be very stringently subjected 
to regulations under the Canadian nuclear safety commission and 
that is what motion No. 4 calls for.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 would in effect delete clause 7. Clause 7 gives the 
commission the power to exempt certain nuclear substances. It is 
our view that no nuclear substances should be exempt under the 
provisions of this act, the Canadian nuclear safety and control act.
<P>
	This bill is an update and replacement of the Atomic Energy 
Control Act. It is supposed to modernize the statute to provide for 
more explicit and effective regulation of nuclear energy. It deals 
with regulatory and development aspects of nuclear safety. It 
establishes a basis for implementing Canadian policy and for 
fulfilling Canada's obligations with respect to the non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons. It increases the number of members of the 
commission from five to seven. The commission is more powerful, 
with the ability to hear witnesses, to gather evidence and to control 
its proceedings as well as to call witnesses to hearings.
<P>
	We are very concerned, since we have an obligation as a country 
with respect to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, that 
submarines are included, that they are not exempt under this bill, 
and we are asking for support from other members with respect to 
that.
<P>
	We are concerned about the harmonizing of the federal and 
provincial regulations in the private sector. The bill decentralizes 
nuclear regulations and in some  cases provides more powers to the 
provinces, which in the case of the major uranium mining province 
of Saskatchewan is probably good news. This bill provides 
minimum levels of protection for workers and minimum 
requirements 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7625"> 7625 </A></B>
<P>
with respect to how nuclear fuels and uranium are handled. In 
Saskatchewan's view, we have always maintained that uranium 
mining is a beneficial livelihood. It is beneficial to those who work 
in the industry, but only if there are very stringent, high level health 
and worker protection laws, which we have in Saskatchewan. Ours 
are very stringent. We hope that a bill like this will raise the level of 
health and worker safety. However, Saskatchewan has a higher 
level than this bill calls for.
<P>
	We are also very concerned about the impact on the environment 
with respect to uranium mining. Saskatchewan has been able to 
establish and prove over the long haul that its environmental 
regulations with respect to uranium mining are the toughest 
anywhere in the world. We are very proud of that.
<P>
	This bill provides the province of Saskatchewan with the 
flexibility to continue to lead with respect to worker and health 
safety in this country and also in the world. It provides us with the 
flexibility and the opportunity to continue to have the highest 
environmental standards with respect to the mining of uranium.
<P>
	I would ask all members of the House to consider these two very 
important amendments, not exempting nuclear submarines from 
the provisions of this bill and not providing any exemptions of any 
nuclear substances which the bill, without amendment, is 
suggesting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, motions Nos. 4 and 5 
are not acceptable to the government. Both motions deal with 
deletions from the bill.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 would delete clause 6. Clause 6 exempts nuclear 
capable vessels of a foreign state invited into Canada by the 
government from the application of the act.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	Clause 6 has been included in Bill C-23 to make the bill 
consistent with a court decision, that is, Vancouver Island Peace 
Society <I>v.</I> the Queen, having to do with the royal prerogative of 
foreign relations.
<P>
	The power to approve visits by foreign naval vessels to Canadian 
ports is a manifestation of the royal prerogative as related to the 
power of the crown to act in regard to the strategic objectives of the 
armed forces, foreign policy and military commitments, such as 
NATO. This power has been confirmed by the courts. It is critical 
that clause 6 remain in the bill.
<P>
	With respect to motion No. 5 to delete clause 7, the bill creates 
general broad prohibitions preventing the conduct of nuclear 
activities or possessions of nuclear materials, unless licensed. 
There must be a mechanism in the act to exempt activities, persons 
or materials where the activity, person or the quantity poses no risk 
to the public, or where the risk is accepted as a part of the job.
<P>
	Deletion of this clause from the bill would require that every 
activity using nuclear technology or nuclear material, every person 
who might come into possession of nuclear materials as a part of 
their normal duties and their quantity of nuclear material, no matter 
how small, be licensed. This would impose a prohibitive and 
unnecessary regulatory burden on Canadians.
<P>
	Some of the exemptions contemplated include exempting peace 
officers, including customs officers-and if the member from the 
New Democratic Party would listen, he may well understand why 
this is not acceptable to the government-and commission 
inspectors appointed under this bill who may come into possession 
of nuclear substances in the course of exercising their duties.
<P>
	This provision would also allow for the exemptions for 
possession of manufactured items that contains small amounts of a 
nuclear substance to make them work, such as smoke detectors, 
some time pieces and illuminated signs activated by tritium. Clause 
7 must remain in this bill in order to make it workable.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 4 and 5 are unacceptable to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say a few words on the two NDP motions. Motion No. 4 
proposes that a specific policy apply to foreign vessels, in that they 
should comply with Canadian laws as regards atomic energy.
<P>
	It is very difficult to have such laws apply to foreign vessels, 
particularly when these vessels are invited to Canada for purposes 
of representations or for commercial operations.
<P>
	Therefore, I have to disagree with the NDP member. His motion 
seeks to have only one law apply in Canada but, unfortunately, we 
cannot enforce our laws in other countries.
<P>
	In fact, this is precisely what the Helms-Burton bill sought to do 
regarding international trade. We must keep an open mind and hope 
that foreign visitors will comply with basic legislation.
<P>
	As for Motion No. 5, I am in partial disagreement with my 
colleagues. It is in the public interest to have some flexibility when 
dealing with specific situations, for example smoke detectors that 
contain only minute amounts of radioactive material. While it may 
seem ridiculous to try to regulate everything, there are 
circumstances where regulations may be necessary.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7626"> 7626 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	It would be inappropriate to let the commission make these 
decisions alone. As I said earlier, even in the new bill, the 
commission does not have the transparency required to make all 
Canadians believe that, regardless of the situation, the 
commission's decision would be, if not impartial, at least as 
informed as possible.
<P>
	We will support the amendment proposed by the NDP, because it 
should be up to the minister and the House of Commons to pass 
general regulations. I am not talking about specific cases, such as 
smoke detectors, but since atomic energy is a very important aspect 
of public safety we should be responsible for this issue. Any 
exemption should be subject to a vote in this House, so as to have a 
framework in which all Canadian stakeholders can have a say.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the agreement made earlier, 
all motions in Group No. 3 are deemed put, recorded divisions 
deemed requested and deemed deferred.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The House will now deal with motions in Group No. 4.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that I 
get to speak again rather quickly.
<P>
	Group No. 4 contains two motions, Motions Nos. 7 and 8, which 
are designed to respond to the witnesses that appeared before the 
natural resources committee. They once again pointed to the lack 
of transparency, which should no longer exist 50 years after the 
creation of the Atomic Energy Control Board. To ensure 
transparency, these people have suggested that the number of 
members sitting on the commission should not increase from 3 to 
5, as in the bill before us, but rather from 5 to 7.
<P>
	Why? So that a representative of the environmental community 
and a representative of the industry can sit on the commission to 
express the views of those who are concerned by our environment 
and of the industry, which is considered one of the economic 
development tools of Canada.
<P>
	Of course, these two new appointments could be voted upon 
here, in the House of Commons. Basically, these two members 
could among other things really tell the people or the industry 
whether regulations are justified or not. Right now, the commission 
is made of 3 to 5 members. These people, I am sure, would protect 
the interests of the people or industry, but their main task would be 
mostly to protect the interest of the commission itself.
<P>
	We will see later on in another motion that the industry is 
concerned about unilateral decisions by the commission forcing the 
industry to bear the costs related to nuclear energy. I think the 
industry as a whole must be responsible and pay for these costs. 
However, if the industry had a representative on the commission 
who were in a position to take part in the decision making process, 
I believe it could accept these decisions or regulations even more 
easily.
<P>
	Having a representative from the environmental community on 
the commission would also make it easier to explain to the public at 
large that the commission's decision is justified and in the public 
interest.
<P>
	It is essential in the interest of all Canadians that the Canadian 
Nuclear Safety Commission established under this bill give this 
image of transparency, which will be easier to develop if a member 
of the public sits on the commission.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The government knows that all the necessary tools are in place 
for the very purpose of ensuring that transparency. But ask the 
average Canadian, ask those who live near a nuclear facility, and I 
am sure the vast majority of them will tell you they are worried 
because they are not sure that everything is being done.
<P>
	On this subject, during the sittings of the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources, I proposed an amendment to change the notion 
of danger in the acceptable standards and in the minimal standards. 
My amendment was negatived on division because the government 
thought that it would be difficult to reach a minimal level from an 
environmental point of view.
<P>
	If the government is sure that the commission can respect the 
desire of Canadians to live in safety, all the more reason to have 
somebody who will act as a watchdog and who will even have the 
opportunity to endorse certain decisions in order to prove that the 
decisions made by the Atomic Energy Control Board are good for 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of Motion No. 7 which the Bloc has put forward. 
This amendment would include more people in making the 
decisions that affect their lives.
<P>
	We in this House often forget when governing this country that 
we have to be more inclusive. We have to include people who are 
affected by decisions taken by government. We have to include 
more people whose environment is affected by decisions of either 
the provincial or federal government, for example, to establish a 
nuclear facility or to have a nuclear mine in their communities. We 
have to include these people because they are the ones who live 
nearby; they are the ones who have experience with the impact of 
these facilities on their environment.
<P>
	Therefore, Motion No. 7, put forward by the Bloc, will provide 
some transparency in the commission's activities. It will also 
protect those who are affected on the front lines. The NDP will 
support this and I hope the government will consider this kind of 
amendment favourably. I know it is always open to suggestions that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7627"> 7627 </A></B>
<P>
are positive in nature, and this is one that is very positive. It has a 
lot of support across the country.
<P>
	Saskatchewan's environmental review system is very 
transparent when it comes to reviewing the environmental 
implications of mining. It works very well in Saskatchewan as it 
includes those people who would otherwise be excluded. If the bill 
is passed unamended, in respect of motion No. 7, it will continue to 
exclude a lot of Canadians whose lives are very severely impacted 
by nuclear development.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, neither motion No. 7 
nor motion No. 8 is acceptable.
<P>
	I have this statement on motion No. 7. Many years ago it was the 
practice to include a representative from industry on the board. The 
government, as a matter of policy, abandoned that practice years 
ago. It is critical that members of the AECD or its successor, the 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, be unbiased. It is equally 
important that it be seen to be unbiased by both the public and the 
industry being regulated. Furthermore, in order for good decisions 
to be made by members of the commission, it is extremely 
important that the commission be made up of members appointed 
for their expertise.
<P>
	This amendment, if accepted, would risk having poor regulatory 
decisions made because of lack of expertise or bias toward one 
agenda or another. It would also raise doubts about the objectivity 
of the regulator.
<P>
	There may also be significant problems with interpreting or 
applying this amendment. It is not clear who the representative 
should be. It could be a member of an environmental group or a 
company employee, but it could also be a person simply appointed 
to speak for the environmental group or the industry. Nor is it clear 
how the terms, generally recognized, or work in environmental 
protection, would be interpreted.
<P>
	The order in council process envisioned for this bill provides 
complete flexibility. Representatives of environmental groups or 
industry could be appointed if that is what is desired.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	As for Motion No. 8, requiring approval of Parliament for 
appointments to the commission, there have been times when a 
new member had to be appointed to the board due to the death or 
illness of a member. Order in council appointments allow the 
government to fill vacancies speedily. Requiring candidates to be 
approved by Parliament could lead to situations where the 
decisions of the commission are delayed until new members are 
appointed.
<P>
	I would suggest that hon. members consider what would need to 
be done if a vacancy had to be filled during the summer months in 
order for the commission to carry out its normal regulatory 
decision making. Should Parliament be reconvened during summer 
recess in order to confirm appointments to the commission simply 
so the commission could continue to operate over the summer?
<P>
	However, if this amendment passes we would have to be 
prepared to do that or to tell the industry that it will simply have to 
wait for its regulatory decisions. This could lead to lapsed licences 
through no fault of the licensees, requiring companies to suspend 
operations in order to comply with this act.
<P>
	As a final comment, members of the commission are appointed 
for their expertise. It is not the practice of this House to review 
such appointments. In only rare cases, such as where the person 
acts as an ombudsman, is this necessary.
<P>
	These amendments are unnecessary and could impede the 
efficient operations of the commission. For these reasons they are 
not acceptable to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, pursuant to the agreement 
reached earlier today, all motions in Group No. 4 are deemed to 
have been put to the House, and any divisions are deemed to have 
been requested and deferred.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to consideration of Group No. 5.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of Motion No. 9, which will amend Bill C-23 in 
clause 33 by replacing lines 15 to 17 on page 19 with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While exercising any authority under the act, an inspector shall make all 
reasonable efforts to be accompanied by a member of a health and safety committee 
or an environment committee whose sphere of activity is affected by the authority 
exercised by the inspector, and the inspector may also be accompanied by any other 
person chosen by the inspector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I guess this is very self-explanatory. What we are calling for is 
that when the inspection of a facility or a site is underway by the 
commission that somebody from the health and safety committee 
or the environmental committee of the working people on site be 
allowed whenever possible to accompany the inspector to provide 
the inspector with perhaps insight which the inspector would not 
have.
<P>
	Obviously when someone is working full time in a workplace 
they have a great deal of knowledge of who they are working with 
and a great deal of knowledge about some of the problems they are 
working under, some of the opportunities the company has and as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7628"> 7628 </A></B>
<P>
well as  some of the areas that may not be looked at by an inspector 
who may have other commitments and may be rushing through it. 
At least somebody will be there to accompany this person. I am not 
saying he or she should be instructing or advising the inspector but 
at least provide a balance which is what we need. We need a 
balance to this kind of system in Canada.
<P>
	We are very supportive of this amendment and are asking 
members to consider that because it is very important to the safety 
of workers on the sites. We have had support from the workers in 
the nuclear industry on this issue. We have had the support of the 
trade union movement across Canada with respect to this 
amendment. Therefore we are asking the government to favourably 
consider this amendment which would, in effect, make the 
inspection system more efficient, safer and obviously more 
productive and helpful to those concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an unworkable 
amendment. With regard to inspections, there are some points to 
make. First, there are occasions when inspections are and must be 
unannounced, as in many regulatory regimes, in order to permit an 
accurate evaluation of compliance with regulations and licence 
conditions.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Second, in many cases, particularly in the case of nuclear power 
plants, this amendment would be inefficient in that it would place 
an unworkable burden on inspectors as well as on the industry. The 
AECB has inspectors at each plant and on site inspection of a plant 
is a part of their daily routine.
<P>
	To require those inspectors to be accompanied on their daily 
rounds would be unduly disruptive to the performance of their 
duties in addition to creating an unnecessary demand on the 
licensees.
<P>
	This amendment may also compromise the regulator's ability to 
meet Canada's international obligations regarding 
non-proliferation of nuclear materials for non-peaceful purposes.
<P>
	To satisfy new requirements currently being developed by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency to strengthen nuclear 
safeguards, the commission will need the capacity to inspect any 
facility where it believes unregulated nuclear activities are carried 
out. This amendment does not provide an exemption for this 
situation.
<P>
	While this amendment is intended to apply to inspections, the 
wording of this amendment does not restrict the requirement to be 
accompanied by a member of the health and safety committee to 
that function. It would apply to all activities of inspectors.
<P>
	The amendment is too broad in its scope for objectivity and 
efficiency. This amendment is unworkable and not acceptable to 
the government.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under the agreement made earlier, all 
motions in Group No. 5 are deemed put, the recorded division is 
deemed requested and deemed deferred. The House can now 
proceed with the motions in Group No. 6.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the group of 
motions we are now considering includes Motions No. 10, 11, 12 
and 13. These motions suggest that industry be consulted so as to 
ensure that the costs it is required to bear are not prohibitive, so that 
it has an opportunity to suggest solutions to problems, rather than 
have solutions imposed by the commission.
<P>
	Industries have, for many years, had to adjust to international 
competition in order to stay competitive. They have had to find 
simpler procedures, with less infrastructure, that allow them to 
reach the same objectives, while cutting costs by one half or one 
third.
<P>
	If these amendments are included in the bill, it will give 
Canada's nuclear industry greater flexibility and improve its 
competitiveness on foreign markets, with which it will henceforth 
be on an equal footing. I propose that Motions Nos. 10 and 11 be 
approved.
<P>
	This same group also includes Motion No. 13, which is based on 
a different philosophy. We think that the public should have better 
access to information. To this end, public information should 
appear not just in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> but also in the newspapers.
<P>
	We were told in committee that this method could be very 
expensive. That may be so, if the intention is to use the mass media 
to disseminate the commission's decisions. But today there are 
some very economical means of dissemination, such as the 
Internet. It is therefore possible to spend less to attain this objective 
and thus serve Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to talk about Group No. 6 which includes Motions 10 to 15.
<P>
	First I want to talk about Motions Nos. 13 and 14 which the New 
Democratic Party has put forward. In my critic area I feel these are 
very important.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 refers to Motion No. 5, which we discussed 
earlier, calling for exempting no nuclear substances, or at least 
those which would be harmful to the environment or harmful to 
Canadians in the current situation. This basically refers to some of 
the exemptions and outlines some of the concerns that the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7629"> 7629 </A></B>
<P>
ment had about the almost untraceable amounts of nuclear  product 
in home smoke detectors or in wrist watches. Obviously these are 
not things that we want to totally regulate. Certainly we have to 
establish some minimum requirements regarding safe levels of 
nuclear fuel or safe levels of nuclear product, uranium product, that 
shall be provided to Canadians with respect to the products that 
they consume, purchase or have around their homes or offices.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 is supportive of Motion No. 5 which the 
government opposed because it did not want to get into protecting 
Canadians. It wants to make sure that Canadians are subjected to 
very loose environmental and health regulations with respect to 
various nuclear products.
<P>
	Motion No. 14 basically provides for Parliament to be given the 
final word with respect to the regulations. Regulations are usually 
made by order in council but they have to have some reflection of 
the changes in society in this country electorally and 
governmentally reflected through elections.
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons are elected from time to 
time from different regions, from different occupations, from 
different mindsets as well as different political parties. They should 
have the final word with respect to what the regulations are when it 
comes to nuclear safety in this country.
<P>
	Nuclear safety is something that is paramount in people's minds 
and in particular those workers who operate in the industry. It is 
also a very important issue as technology improves and as more 
information becomes available to Canadians with respect to the 
impacts of this particular product in our society and in the lives of 
the people who live Canada.
<P>
	Basically we are saying give Parliament the authority to deem 
which regulations shall be good, bad or indifferent. Give 
Parliament, the representatives of the people of this country, the 
democratically elected people of this country, some authority into 
whether these regulations are satisfactory.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motions Nos. 10 to 14 
all deal with clause 44, the regulation-making powers, and for 
various different reasons each of these proposed amendments is not 
acceptable in its present form. Furthermore, some of them could 
create problems. However, for Motions Nos. 11 and 12 the 
government wishes to propose an alternative amendment that 
would achieve the proposed objective.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 10, the inclusion of cost benefit 
analysis in this legislation is something that the government has 
discussed with industry representatives on several occasions. There 
was a consensus that there is a role for cost benefit analysis in the 
regulatory process, but that it is premature to include cost benefit 
analysis in  this legislation. Most important, there is no consensus 
on the role that cost benefit analysis would or should play in the 
regulatory decision making process.
<P>
	For example, should economic considerations be given more, 
less or equal weight as safety considerations? There are also 
significant differences of opinion with respect to the application of 
cost benefit analysis. For example, how do you value a human life 
or place a value on environmental protection? What cost and what 
benefits are to be included in the analysis? Until these issues are 
addressed the government believes strongly that it would be unwise 
to include a mandatory requirement for cost benefit analysis in this 
legislation, as this amendment would do.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	The government does recognize the importance of this issue and 
is working with industry to draft a policy for the application of cost 
benefit analysis to regulatory decision making. That policy will 
attempt to address how and when cost benefit analysis is to be used 
in the regulator's decision making process.
<P>
	With respect to Motions Nos. 11 and 12, the government 
recognizes the importance of consultation on regulations, 
particularly on fees. Treasury Board policy requires that all 
regulations under this act, including regulation regarding fees for 
services and licences, be published in part I of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> 
and interested parties be given an opportunity to comment. The 
AECB often consults with industry before publication in the 
<I>Gazette</I>. Therefore, the consultation process already exists.
<P>
	The proposals from the opposition do not specify the manner of 
consultation. There is no requirement that it be made public nor is 
there any requirement for a reasonable opportunity to comment. 
Any consultation process should address these issues.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 is not acceptable and as I explained when 
speaking to Motion No. 5, the power to create exemptions must 
stay in the bill.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 14, clause 44(5) assigns to the 
governor in council the power to make regulations on matters not 
otherwise assigned to the commission but which may be necessary 
to carry out the purposes of the act.
<P>
	The proposed amendment is counter to normal regulatory 
practice. It would in essence defeat the intention of the provision, 
which is to assign the residual regulation making power to the 
governor in council. It would also be inefficient from a regulatory 
point of view in that it may lead to unnecessary delays and 
additional costs associated with having the regulations reviewed 
and approved by Parliament. For these reasons the government 
does not find this amendment acceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7630"> 7630 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to Motions Nos. 11 and 12 concerning consultations 
on fee regulations, we would like to propose the following. I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-23 in clause 44 be amended by adding after line 20 on page 32 the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(12) A copy of each regulation that the commission proposes to make under 
paragraphs 1(i) or (j) shall be published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and a reasonable 
opportunity shall be given to persons to make representations to the commission 
with respect thereto.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is in order. Is there further 
debate with respect to the amendment?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Colleagues, the order that was made earlier did not cover this 
particular amendment which has just been put to the House. It 
leaves the Chair in a difficult position because members may not 
wish to give unanimous consent to include this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I would entertain 
this motion being included with the other motions in Group No. 6. I 
believe that would be a great idea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden is certainly in agreement to having this the 
subject of the earlier order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As agreed earlier today, all the motions in Group No. 6, 
including the amendment just proposed, are deemed to have been 
voted on, and recorded divisions are deemed to have been 
requested and deferred.
<P>
	The House will now consider the motions in Group No. 7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak 
briefly to Group No. 7, which comprises Motions Nos. 16 and 17. 
In essence, the bill contained something of a technical defect, with 
no provision for particular situations. I will read the clause in 
question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>51.1 No person shall be found guilty of an offence under this Act or a regulation 
made thereunder if the person establishes that he or she exercised all due diligence to 
prevent its commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The notion of due diligence already exists in jurisprudence. It is 
even found in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, from 
which Bill C-23 is drawn. I believe all members of the House of 
Commons should approve this amendment.
<P>
	The government itself recognized this flaw and proposed Motion 
No. 17, which is essentially identical, except that it takes into 
account section 50, which excludes people who might voluntarily 
go around with a miniature nuclear bomb, for example, so they 
cannot go to court and be exonerated for this oversight.
<P>
	So I imagine we will not have to debate this bill at length and we 
will all agree that it should be corrected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the due diligence 
defence is available in law for regulatory offences under the charter 
of rights and freedoms, even if not specified in an act. Therefore, it 
is not necessary to explicitly provide for this defence in this bill. 
However, there are instances where due diligence is explicitly 
found as a defence in other acts. Therefore, the government is 
agreeable to this amendment.
<P>
	Having said that, we must exempt offences under section 50, 
which deals with offences regarding nuclear weapons, from having 
recourse to this defence. This is because the penalty for this 
offence, which is up to 10 years imprisonment, indicates that this is 
more in the nature of a crime than a regulatory offence, making a 
due diligence defence inappropriate.
<P>
	We agree with the intent of this motion so long as a due diligence 
defence is not available for the offence associated with nuclear 
weapons. We therefore propose an alternative amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-23 be amended by adding after line 12 on page 36 the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>51(1). A person shall not be found to have contravened any provision of this act, 
other than section 50, if it is established the person exercised all due diligence to 
prevent its commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleague, I think the same 
amendment has already been put forward. Would you please 
withdraw the motion? I think this would be the easiest way to go.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you very much. That seems to be 
the simplest solution.
<P>
	Pursuant to the agreement made earlier, all motions in Group No. 
7 are deemed put, recorded divisions are deemed requested and 
deemed deferred.
<P>
	The House will now proceed with the motions in Group No. 8.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Group No. 
8 contains the last two motions, namely Motions Nos. 18 and 19. 
Every board dealing with the government is normally required to 
submit reports to the House. It would be appropriate for the bill 
before us, Bill C-23, to provide for the commission to submit a 
report to the minister at the end of each fiscal year and for this 
report to be tabled in the House.
<P>
	For an organization as important as the Atomic Energy Control 
Board, the fact that reports will be tabled  in the House would foster 
transparency. Not only would its weaknesses and improvements 
become apparent, but public confidence in our institutions would 
be enhanced as a result.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7631"> 7631 </A></B>
<P>
	In that sense, Motions Nos. 18 and 19, which are identical except 
for a few technical details, tend to foster the notion that the House 
should exercise a tight control on the commission's activities and 
the commission should be made accountable to the public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, neither Motion No. 18 
nor 19 is acceptable. The motions deal generally with the affairs 
and management of the commission and how the commission is 
kept accountable to Canadians.
<P>
	Motion No. 18 appears to be intended to provide for some form 
of oversight on the commission's activities in order to promote 
efficiencies in the commission's internal operations. However the 
way it is worded would require the commission to publish any 
comment made to the commission at any time during the year and 
the commission's response to those comments and to publish those 
comments in its annual report regardless of whether those 
comments are reasonable or not. This is an unreasonable burden 
and would impede the efficient operations of the regulator.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I would like to point out that both the auditor general and 
Treasury Board provide oversight on the commission's activities: 
the auditor general, in his intermittent review of the AECB's 
operations, and Treasury Board when it reviews and approves the 
AECB's annual estimates.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the minister, under clause 
12(4), has the right to request the board to provide reports on its 
general administration and management and to have the results 
published in the annual report if  the minister wishes. Therefore 
mechanisms are already in place which provide for oversight over 
the operations of the commission, as this amendment proposes to 
do. It is unnecessary.
<P>
	The requirement in Motion No. 19 to hold a public hearing on 
the internal management, operations and business practices of the 
commission would impose a significant administrative burden on 
the commission and a significant cost as well.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 18 and 19 would both establish a precedent 
regarding the public scrutiny of the internal operations of the 
regulatory bodies. There are broad policy implications involved 
and it would be unwise to do this until the government assesses the 
implications. For these reasons, the amendments are not acceptable 
to the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the agreement reached earlier 
today, the questions on all the motions in Group No. 8 are deemed
<P>
to have been put and recorded divisions deemed requested and 
deferred.
<P>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7632"> 7632 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill proposes amendments to the Prisons and Reformatories 
Act that will strengthen and modernize the statutory framework 
governing temporary absence programs for offenders in provincial 
and territorial custody.
<P>
	This bill is a global answer to the concerns expressed by the 
provinces and territories, which feel that the current legislative 
framework is not flexible enough to meet their specific needs.
<P>
	The bill is also a very good example of 
federal-provincial-territorial co-operation on an issue of mutual 
interest. These provisions were developed in consultation with our 
provincial and territorial partners, and they were approved by the 
ministers responsible for justice in all the jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	As hon. members will know, the Prisons and Reformatories Act 
is a federal statute which governs how sentences will be 
administered by provincial institutions. This stems from the federal 
responsibility for criminal law. However, it is our provincial and 
territorial partners who must implement this legislation. It is 
therefore incumbent upon us to ensure that there is adequate 
flexibility for them to meet their own unique circumstances. This is 
precisely what this bill does.
<P>
	Here is how the bill will modernize and strengthen the statutory 
framework that governs provincial and territorial temporary 
absence programs. First, the bill adds a statement of purpose and 
principles. This is a new element, modelled on the statement of 
purpose and principles created in 1992 in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, which applies to parole and temporary 
absence programs for offenders under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Federal correctional authorities see it as an extremely useful tool 
for policy makers. It adds uniformity to temporary absence and 
conditional release programs. This is very important, given the 
close scrutiny to which our agencies are constantly subject. I would 
hasten to add that these are not federal principles imposed on the 
provinces and territories, but principles that all governments have 
agreed to implement together.
<P>
	Second, the amendments would allow the provinces and 
territories to increase the maximum duration of temporary 
absences from 15 to 60 days. This change will reflect the current 
practice of granting consecutive temporary absences. Increasing 
the duration of temporary absences will make it possible to 
improve parole planning and to reduce the frequency of renewals of 
temporary absence certificates. These amendments, however, will 
require tighter monitoring of renewals, for  an authority wishing to 
renew a temporary absence will first have to reassess the whole 
case.
<P>
	Third, the bill will give governments the power to create 
additional types of temporary absences, beyond those granted for 
medical, humanitarian or rehabilitative reasons, so long as they are 
consistent with the statement of purpose and principles for 
temporary absence programs as stated in the bill.
<P>
	There are two objectives to this amendment: first, to give 
administrations the necessary flexibility to adapt the temporary 
absence program to their own requirements; and second, to 
establish parameters that must be complied with in order to ensure 
a certain uniformity across the country.
<P>
	Fourth, the reforms will give administrations the power to 
restrict the concurrent eligibility of prisoners for some types of 
temporary absences and parole. This will enable provincial and 
territorial corrections authorities to limit the opportunities for 
prisoners to make simultaneous use of the parole and the temporary 
absence systems, and to play both ends against the middle.
<P>
	Finally, the bill will add other important measures for public 
protection. The importance of the principle of public protection 
was the subject of lengthy debate during second reading of the bill 
and during its study by the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs.
<P>
	It is important to point out that, when these amendments were 
being drafted, the administrations agreed there must be no 
dissociation of the principles of protecting society and of 
rehabilitating offenders, and that these principles were neither 
contradictory nor in competition. In fact, all administrations agree 
that these two principles are totally compatible, since rehabilitation 
of an offender is the best means of protecting society, in the long 
term.
<P>
	May I, however, add that the fundamental importance of 
protecting society is reflected throughout Bill C-53.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	This important concept informs the purpose and principles of the 
bill, and I am referring to clause 7: ``The purpose of a temporary 
absence program is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful and safe society-'' and a number of other provisions.
<P>
	Clause 7.5 provides specific grounds for suspending, cancelling 
or revoking a temporary absence. Clause 7.6, paragraphs 1 and 2, 
provides for issuing an arrest warrant and for its electronic 
transmission and execution in any place in Canada.
<P>
	Another clause authorizes a peace officer, who believes on 
reasonable grounds that a warrant has been issued in respect of an 
offender on temporary absence, to arrest the offender without a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7633"> 7633 </A></B>
<P>
warrant and remand him int  custody for up to 48 hours until the 
warrant is transmitted and executed.
<P>
	These measures are quite clear about the authority to 
reincarcerate certain offenders when necessary.
<P>
	I may point out that Bill C-53 is one of several initiatives 
introduced by the present government. The safe home and safe 
streets program described in the red book favours a balanced 
approach to public safety, an approach that emphasizes the need to 
take a tough line with violent, high risk offenders who represent an 
immediate and ongoing threat to the public.
<P>
	This program, however, recognizes the need to engage in crime 
prevention and rehabilitation. This means intervening at an early 
stage to turn minor offenders away from crime.
<P>
	In the last throne speech it was announced that to support this 
objective, ``the government will focus corrections resources on 
high-risk offenders while increasing efforts to lower the number of 
young people who come into contact with the justice system. The 
government will develop innovative alternatives to incarceration 
for low-risk offenders''.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is in line with this commitment and will help the 
provinces and territories to adjust temporary absence programs to 
the needs of their own prison population.
<P>
	The government is also pursuing other initiatives in close 
co-operation with its many partners in the penal justice system. I 
would, more particularly, like to talk to you about a document 
presented at the May 1996 meeting of the justice ministers of the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments.
<P>
	The document, entitled <I>Corrections Population Growth</I>, was 
drafted by the federal, provincial and territorial deputy ministers 
and correctional services officials. It puts forward a number of 
recommendations, which were accepted by all ministers, as well as 
a series of principles, which will provide a basis for future policy.
<P>
	This undertaking deserves mention because it reflects agreement 
among administrations and points out the importance of having all 
components of the criminal justice system united in their efforts so 
as to ensure a fair, peaceful and safe society efficiently and 
effectively.
<P>
	One of the principles in this document, which is reflected in the 
bill, is that the primary objective of the criminal justice system is to 
contribute to maintaining a fair, peaceful and safe environment. To 
this end, we must focus our efforts on the front line of the criminal 
justice system and promote more crime prevention initiatives.
<P>
	We all know that prevention of criminal behaviour is more 
effective than its punishment. Habitually, sanctions are applied 
much too late and are not aimed at the cause of the problem.
<P>
	One of the greatest challenges facing us is to continue to develop 
community based sanctions that are safe, effective and credible for 
Canadians who are most likely to have run-ins with the law. This is 
why the government created the national crime prevention council 
and is inviting all departments in a position to do so to participate 
by developing crime prevention strategies.
<P>
	Many police departments, including the RCMP, are now 
developing and implementing community police programs which 
will help communities come up with their own crime prevention 
strategies, suited to their particular needs.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	As the police are an integral part of community life, they can 
help in problem resolution and social planning aimed at preventing 
criminal behaviour, so that the community has less need of them to 
enforce the law.
<P>
	Another principle the federal, provincial and territorial justice 
ministers agreed on is that incarceration should be limited to cases 
where public safety may be threatened and that alternate solutions 
should be applied when more effective community based sanctions 
are available. While we recognize the usefulness of incarceration, 
we also know that, when applied in the right circumstances, 
community based sanctions protect society better over the long 
term than incarceration. So, the government is going to intensify its 
efforts to implement the recent reforms on sentencing, more 
specifically, part XXIII of the Criminal Code, which offers the 
courts other options besides incarceration.
<P>
	For many years now, we have been advocating measures to 
divert low-risk offenders out of the court system as much as 
possible or to subject them to less monitoring, when this does not 
interfere with the goals of the criminal justice system, mainly 
public protection. Early intervention, that is to say, acting before 
crime patterns are set, is considered by many an effective means of 
preventing criminal behaviour. Residential programs as well as 
drug rehabilitation, mental health, restitution, occupational 
training and other similar programs provide offenders with the kind 
of support and guidance they need in the community.
<P>
	In order to support alternatives to incarceration and ensure their 
success, the necessary programs and resources must be made 
available to the community. The various elements of the criminal 
justice system must come together to design, develop and 
implement community corrections programs. While this is no 
small task, it is encouraging to note that a strong consensus exists 
among the various levels of government to work together at 
developing efficient community corrections measures.
<P>
	Clearly, the necessary reform of the criminal justice system is 
too great a task for a single government or sector. To bring about 
meaningful changes, criminal justice, police, sentencing, 
corrections and parole officials must work closely together. The 
fact that governments agree on a number of initiatives shows a will 
to co-operate and contribute in a positive way to better public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7634"> 7634 </A></B>
<P>
protection, as well as to adjust our resources to the level of risk 
posed by offenders.
<P>
	These past few years, we have worked hard at making our 
society safe, fair and peaceful. The initiatives I described this 
morning, combined with the bill before us today, will further this 
objective.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is an excellent example of federal, provincial and 
territorial collaboration, which, I hope, all members of this House 
will support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government member really stressed that Bill C-53 was 
an example of good co-operation and showed that the federal, 
provincial and territorial jurisdictions work well together, but I 
think this bill is a prime example of the complexity of Canada: a 
federal act that is implemented by the provinces. In order to reach 
agreements, the provincial, federal and territorial authorities must 
negotiate. They must discuss the issue of costs. The federal 
government is throwing the ball to the provinces and asking them 
to implement the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I did not want to talk about this because we basically agree with 
Bill C-53. However, the hon. member just provided me with an 
opportunity to point out that this is a striking example of how 
cumbersome the administration of this country called Canada 
really is. This is why Bloc Quebecois members are telling 
Canadians that the current system just does not make any sense.
<P>
	Bill C-53, a simple piece of legislation on which everyone in this 
House agrees, is a striking example. Do not use Bill C-53 as an 
example of how well things work in Canada. This bill is just the 
opposite: it is a frightening example of how money is being wasted.
<P>
	Everyone can agree on temporary absences to facilitate 
reintegration into the community, to make the system more 
humane, and so on. Everyone can agree on that. But it took years 
before an agreement was reached, because the provincial, federal 
and territorial jurisdictions had to negotiate.
<P>
	The hon. member also had the nerve to claim that his 
government deserves the credit for this agreement. In 1993, the 
Conservatives were in office. It is the Conservatives who started 
looking at this bill. This government takes credit for a lot of things, 
but this time it is going too far. In May of 1993, the Liberals were 
not in office. They were only elected in October of that year.
<P>
	I did not want to get upset, because this is an ordinary bill. 
However, I think that it is a good thing if the truth is told, to set the 
record straight, but it hurts to hear it.
<P>
	As for Bill C-53, yes, we are in agreement. One thing that we 
agree with, in light of the remarks I have just made, is that it will be 
up to the Quebec National Assembly to determine how the 
legislation will be implemented. If there is anything good about 
this bill, it is the flexibility Quebec and the other provinces will 
have in implementing it.
<P>
	I also have a very brief comment on the bill, because we are in 
agreement with almost everything. The statement of principles 
says that the purpose of the program is to contribute to the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by facilitating the 
rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into the 
community. If there is one place where people have been working 
on such matters for years, it is surely Quebec.
<P>
	We have looked at various bills, and Quebec's programs are 
often held up as models of successful rehabilitation and 
reintegration. You will therefore understand that we are in 
agreement with a statement of purpose and principles such as that 
contained in Bill C-53. It is consistent with Quebec's way of 
thinking.
<P>
	Since protection is needed, this is mentioned in the bill. Quebec 
has always said that, while offenders can be given certain rights, 
they also have obligations. If there is to be good supervision, all 
this must be carefully monitored, and the bill also covers this.
<P>
	The bill says that, yes, we want to give flexibility to those who 
will be applying it, and yes, details can be included, such as why 
offenders can obtain passes for durations of up to 60 days. Certain 
criteria are given, but the bill also says that a temporary absence 
may be suspended, cancelled or revoked for humanitarian, family 
or other reasons given in the bill.
<P>
	This protection is found in clause 7.5.
<P>
	It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.5 A designated authority may suspend, cancel or revoke a temporary absence, 
before or after it begins, if</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) it is considered necessary and justified to prevent a breach of a condition of the 
absence or where a breach has occurred;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the grounds for authorizing the absence have changed or no longer exist; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
Because some things can change during the 60 day period, and 
protection of the public could require revocation or cancellation of 
the offender's right.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the case has been reassessed, based on information that could not reasonably 
have been provided when the absence was authorized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 7.5 contains the elements aimed at protecting the public 
when this act is implemented. This is all very well and we have no 
complaiants. Everything is done under the aegis of the provinces 
and territories. In the present system, this is a matter under federal 
jurisdiction, but provincial and territorial administration. 
Therefore, the provinces and territories will apply this act. They 
will be able to determine the eligibility criteria very precisely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7635"> 7635 </A></B>
<P>
	There were reservations on the extension of temporary absences 
from 15 to 60 days. After questioning certain witnesses who came 
before the committee, we realized this was not a problem. It was 
understood that there were often special requests requiring an 
additional 15 days, and that this period could be extended. There 
does not seem to be any problem with absences of 60 days. Our 
concerns were allayed during examination by the committee.
<P>
	In short, we agree with Bill C-53. What must not be lost sight of 
is the important element, with which we are in agreement for as 
long as we are part of the present system: the respect of areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The provinces and territories were given full responsibility for 
this area. The bill gives them all the flexibility they need to put in 
place their own rules for parole.
<P>
	Since Quebec's approach to parole, re-entry into the community 
and rehabilitation differs from that of Ontario or western Canada as 
well as its experience in the matter, it will be able to adjust the rules 
accordingly.
<P>
	I only want to warn the government against doing what it did in 
the case of the Young Offenders Act. When the Young Offenders 
Act was passed, it allowed the provinces to implement the 
legislation and establish certain services according to need. Quebec 
is 25 years ahead of nearly all other provinces on the 
implementation of this type of legislation. Everybody says so. 
Once Quebec got its system up and running, put in place all its 
institutions and established its philosophy of the Young Offenders 
Act and its implementation, the federal government started to 
tinker with the legislation.
<P>
	The Liberal government makes a habit of changing the rules of 
the game after the game has started. Why? Because it caved in to 
pressure from the western Canadian right wing. They are distorting 
the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This morning, we agree on how Bill C-53 should be 
implemented, and I would urge the government not to make the 
same mistake. I hope that later on there will be no interference 
from federalists who want to change the rules of the game in this 
bill. It is high time the Liberal government showed respect for the 
bills it introduces, never mind how Quebec implements them, with 
its flexible approach or how Ontario or the other provinces will do 
it.
<P>
	The official opposition agrees with Bill C-53, and that is why we 
did not propose any amendments. This bill was developed by a task 
force that was appointed well before the Liberals came to power. 
This task force managed to establish a consensus, although it was 
far from easy, among the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments regarding the administration of a federal act by the 
provinces. That is why we agree with Bill C-53.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to debate what I consider to be a significant 
bill. It is a matter which should be debated. However, I believe 
there is a lot missing in the intent of the bill that should be 
addressed.
<P>
	This country has a rising cost of crime that the victims as well as 
others have to share. They have to share in the cost of the release of 
prisoners, the lack of rehabilitation and the repeat nature of 
criminals. Most criminals repeat their crimes. That drives up the 
costs of crime in society. It is now at the point where it is no longer 
acceptable. Most people do not realize how much or what they are 
paying for.
<P>
	The government states that the bill would authorize the 
provinces to create additional types of temporary absence 
programs. In other words, offenders at the provincial level will be 
put out on the street at a much higher rate than they are right now. 
The rate is already high. The government says it is a cost effective 
measure to cut down the costs of incarceration and so-called 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not support this bill. It falls far short of 
what it should address. It is tinkering with the justice system. It is 
downloading some of those costs not so much on the provinces, but 
on the communities where the offenders are going to be dumped. I 
say ``dumped'' because there is no indication that there will be 
solid programs put in place to pick up the influx of offenders who 
will be returned to the community.
<P>
	The bill also deals with the extension of temporary absences 
granted to inmates, up to a maximum period of 60 days.
<P>
	The government argues that the bill is minor in scope, that it is 
merely a reflection of what the provinces have requested of the 
federal government. My question to the federal government is this. 
Who in the Department of Justice has analysed the true cost of 
crime in the country? What studies justify the action taken by the 
provisions in this bill? What studies on repeat offenders have been 
put forward so opposition members can evaluate them?
<P>
	Seventy per cent of inmates in institutions have been previously 
incarcerated. What studies show how these costs are going to be 
reduced when we consider the impact on communities? The police 
will have to shore up their already very meagre resources to detect 
and arrest repeat offenders. The courts will have to hear and re-hear 
the same offenders coming before them. The victims of property 
crime will have to pay the deductible on their insurance policies, 
while their insurance rates will continue to rise. People will have to 
be hospitalized after being assaulted by repeat offenders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7636"> 7636 </A></B>
<P>
	I have seen nothing from the government or the justice 
department which addresses those issues. However, studies have 
been attempted by other institutions in the country. I will name 
one and reflect on it from time to time as I speak this morning. 
The Fraser Institute sought information from the government. It 
was looking for studies that the government could put forward to 
justify its legislation. Nothing has come out of the justice 
department.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	In fact, it has been always the opposite. The government looks at 
the bottom line, what it is costing a particular department and it 
says, that is our cost. We are reducing them. That is the message the 
government is attempting to sell to the electorate but it is not 
telling the truth.
<P>
	The truth of the matter is that as more offenders are released the 
cost to the community is increasing, because of shattered lives, 
because of the pain and anguish from an assault, a sexual assault or 
a robbery. Shattered lives are never factored into anything that the 
government does when it comes to criminal justice legislation. The 
government ignores it. It does not want to know about it. It wants 
them to go away. It does not want to listen to the victims and the 
taxpayers when they cry out for protection or a change in 
legislation. The government just does not want to deal with that 
matter.
<P>
	The government also argues that the proposed legislation is part 
of an overall program to make our streets safer by gradually 
reintegrating offenders back into the community. How many more 
times can we address this whole issue of parole and temporary 
absences given the fact that most people desire the opposite?
<P>
	The studies and information that the Reform Party has received 
reflect the opposite. People want to see the offenders locked away. 
They want to see them punished to some degree. Yet the 
government does not want to address any of that. It knows better 
and it says so. It tells the electorate: ``You elected us because we 
know better than you on how to handle this whole affair''.
<P>
	The government talks about reintegrating offenders back into the 
community. If 70 per cent, give or take 5 or 10 per cent of the 
prison population, have been imprisoned before, what does that tell 
us about the so-called rehabilitation programming structure that the 
federal or provincial government has established? Some of it has 
been imposed on the provincial governments through legislation.
<P>
	If this is not working, why are we passing more legislation to 
deal with the same program and the same failed rate that already 
exists? Why are we compounding the problem? That is what is 
proposed in Bill C-53. When the Liberal government puts to 
people, the electorate and the taxpayer, that it is trying to make our 
streets safer, that is false information. It will be doing the opposite. 
Already the temporary absence program and parole have been a 
dismal failure.
<P>
	Let us talk about the parole board for a moment. It deals almost 
with the same form of release. I am speaking about the violent 
offender more than any others when I talk about the parole board. 
The violent offender still plays a significant role if the attitudes of 
people are looked at when discussing criminal justice matters and 
certainly release matters.
<P>
	Let us face it. The parole board's decisions really are not all that 
beneficial to the safety of the community. If those offenders have to 
serve their full time we would not need a parole board at quite a 
substantial cost to taxpayers. The matter could easily be handled by 
those within the correctional system.
<P>
	The probationary aspect or early release, I do not care if it is 
provincial or federal, reflects the same thing. I see the 
parliamentary secretary to the justice minister shaking his head. 
Imagine, the most recent study to come forward with regard to 
crime statistics shows that the Canadian rates for property crimes 
are equal to or higher in some areas than those rates across the 
border. These property crimes include motor vehicle thefts, break 
and enters and vandalism.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The crime rate has gone down in the last four 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> The American crime rate has also dropped. It has 
dipped a little. The parliamentary secretary said our crime rate is 
going down. I say big deal. Property crime rates between 1962 and 
now have increased by 500 per cent. He ignores that statistic which 
speaks very clearly for itself.
<P>
	Violent crime to this day, 1997, has increased by 400 per cent. 
The parliamentary secretary and the justice minister like to tell 
people to feel safe because the crime rate is dropping. They say 
they are doing a good job. The truth is it is a temporary blip. The 
crime rate makes these little adjustments from time to time but 
overall it has increased over the years.
<P>
	The youth violent crime rate is rising which should be a concern 
for everyone in the House. But the Liberals have made it a partisan 
issue. They look at rehabilitation as the answer to all the crime 
problems. There is no talk about punishment, no talk about keeping 
people safe. Although the Liberals like to reiterate those words 
often, in effect that is not really what is happening.
<P>
	That is the early release portion which the government is telling 
people it is going to grant to the provinces to make them feel safer.
<P>
	The government also argues that the program for extended 
temporary absence for certain inmates will actually save money by 
lowering the prison population. That is the crux of the matter. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7637"> 7637 </A></B>
<P>
is what this bill is all about. It is not about keeping people safe. It is 
not about dealing with the crime problem and repeat offenders. It is 
not about cutting down on the actual cost of crime which is what 
impacts on each person who may suffer from a break-in or an 
assault.
<P>
	The crux of this bill is to empty the prisons. Get them out earlier. 
Bounce them out so government members will look good. They can 
tell the taxpayers they are doing something. They are addressing 
not only the problem of crime but they are cutting down on 
spending. Wow. That is the problem here. The government is 
cutting down on the cost of corrections and imposing it on the 
provinces at the cost of the safety of the taxpayers and the victims. 
That is what is happening. The government will never admit to 
that. But I believe if we go through the streets and the rural areas of 
this country, we will get a clear picture.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary likes to support all government 
legislation. I do not think there is really any debate behind closed 
doors on that side of the House. It is all an attitude of ``let's just 
follow along here with those at the top. They say this is the best 
way to go''. The best way to go is to develop all this legislation, 
kick it down into the caucus and tell the caucus what will happen. 
Then it goes off to committee. Again, this is a top down process. 
There is no debate in the committee about these bills. It is a joke.
<P>
	A whole flock of witnesses come forward, some of them with 
their own agenda, others with a concern about what may be 
happening in their communities. Nobody listens because the 
decision has already been made. The decision has already been 
made on Bills C-53, C-68 and C-55, the so-called high risk 
offender legislation which is coming up for a vote too.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The decisions have been made, the bills have been formulated, 
drafted and are going to be discussed in committee. Where are they 
going to go? They are going to the floor of the House and they are 
going to be passed because of the greater numbers on the 
government side of the House.
<P>
	Here is another example with respect to the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Solicitor General who is looking after corrections 
and our prisons. This is the message being delivered, and again the 
same kind of an attitude: ``I know best. I know better than the 
people in this country. I can make you feel safe even though you are 
not''.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General is chiding 
me because I took a recent trip to Bowden. I stepped inside that 
prison to see what was going on and it is interesting. I encourage 
every member of this House to go inside and really have a close 
look at what is happening in our prisons. It is a joke.
<P>
	Most of the prisoners have an attitude and it has been drawn, 
drafted and supported by this government and one or two previous 
governments that they can challenge authority at every turn. That is 
the attitude of the prisoners, that they can challenge authority at 
every turn. If there is some disciplinary action to be taken on the 
inside and the prisoner does not like it, what do they do? They 
appeal to the warden, the commissioner or the deputy 
commissioner and it goes up the ladder as if it were some sort of a 
union. They can say ``I do not like you doing that to the authority of 
this country''. That is what is happening in our prisons.
<P>
	When that attitude prevails and is supported by the Liberals and 
those before them under Conservatives we have a problem on our 
hands. The prisoner, the violator of the law, does not know his 
place in society. He does not understand what is wrong. It is not 
called corrections, it is called support services for those who break 
the law. That is what we have in this nation. Now they are trying to 
impose the same type of thing on the provinces by bringing in Bill 
C-53 which allows them to kick offenders back out on to the street 
early.
<P>
	In reality this is just another bill in a long line of bills brought 
before the committee. Everybody has debated them. I can think 
back to some earlier bills, although I was not privy to the debate on 
some of those, but it would not have made much difference because 
they are already decided beforehand; a long list of bills that weaken 
further this system that we call the justice system. Unfortunately 
there is less and less justice in the system.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General says he has 
been in the prisons before. He must condone everything that goes 
on in those prisons. I do not know. It is strange that he would want 
to support such a system and he will fight tooth and nail to maintain 
such a system. Even the prisoners complain substantially about it.
<P>
	I can remember one prison I walked into. There was a fellow by 
the name of Austin. He was a very vicious murderer. He was a 
weightlifter, he used steroids, he was a real tough individual to deal 
with. He murdered one or two people in southern Alberta. This 
inmate controlled the prison.
<P>
	Corrections Canada, with the support of the solicitor general and 
the government members, agree with that. They say let this man 
exist. They do not come out and say that to the public but by their 
inaction to do something about the interior problems within these 
institutions they condone it. If you do not do something to stop it 
then you condone it. That is the bottom line.
<P>
	What benefit would a situation like that developing in our 
prisons be to other offenders?
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	There may be some who might not agree with the process within, 
who have a desire to be self-rehabilitated. I have talked to many. I 
have talked to some who have gone into prison who had no desire 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7638"> 7638 </A></B>
<P>
ever to go back again, who are extremely critical of the system 
inside because it does not deal with self-rehabilitation at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> That is what you want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> I am talking about self-rehabilitation. The 
parliamentary secretary to the justice minister cannot tell the 
difference. That is the problem.
<P>
	This government does not know the difference between 
rehabilitation programs that are sponsored by the state and the 
self-rehabilitative desire on the part of the individual to correct his 
behaviour.
<P>
	The individual who has a desire to correct his own behaviour is 
not supported by the system in any way, shape or form. In fact, he 
is probably hindered.
<P>
	I have received numerous calls from inmates who have former 
prisoners who have been in that category. The minute they were 
arrested, they went through the process, stepped inside the prison at 
that point in their life and said ``no more''.
<P>
	The system does not deal with those who have set their hand 
against authority as a matter of course. It does not deal with those 
people. In fact, it manipulates them and allows them to be 
manipulated by others within the system. That is what is happening 
in our prisons. No one can tell me that is a positive aspect of 
corrections Canada. It is not.
<P>
	In effect, with all the money that is being spent on rehabilitative 
programs all we are really doing and all the taxpayer is really doing 
is warehousing. There is nothing substantive. There is no skills 
training any more, or very little.
<P>
	They are shutting down a lot of the shops within the prisons 
which used to teach some skills that would give them a slight 
advantage, if you will, by stepping out and doing something 
constructive on the other side. It gives them something to work for 
and desire. Not any more. Look at the shops being closed.
<P>
	There is an organization called CORCAN. Mr. Speaker would 
understand that organization since he has half a dozen prisons in his 
riding. There are a number of votes there that might mean a lot to 
you, I do not know.
<P>
	Here is an organization within called CORCAN. CORCAN loses 
money every year. Why does it lose money? It is supposed to help 
the prisoners with their programs. It is supposed to teach them. It is 
supposed to employ within. Why does it lose money? Have 
members ever asked themselves that?
<P>
	I speak directly in a way through you, Mr. Speaker, to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General. Why does 
CORCAN, the agency that is supposed to employ people within the 
prison system, lose money? Why, with its existence as long as it 
has been there, does it only employ a fraction of the inmates in each 
institution?
<P>
	I was at one institution in Alberta. Since Calgary is my home 
town, I have had a chance to visit those prisons more than many 
others.
<P>
	CORCAN has a farm on the property owned by corrections 
Canada, 350 cow-calf operations. Some urban people might not 
know what that really signifies, but it is 350 cows. They give calves 
every year, they feed these animals and ship off the beef.
<P>
	The beef goes all over the place. It goes to other prisons and 
elsewhere. I have not been able to track down where. How many 
people would that kind of operation employ? I know farmers and 
ranchers who own and have operations of that size. They are family 
run operations. In the setting at Bowden penitentiary, there are 80 
prisoners looking after what many could operate as a family 
operation in this country. Tell me where the justification is to that?
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Do you want to give them experience or not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> The parliamentary secretary asked me if I want to 
give them experience in this kind of operation. That is all well and 
good. I say yes, but let us look at the other side of the issue. Does it 
take 80 people to feed 350 cows? What are the other 75 people 
doing in the meantime?
<P>
	I would have to say that if they are trying to teach somebody the 
value of getting up at six o'clock in the morning and putting in a 
full day's work then I think they have failed. Five of them might get 
up but the other seventy-five might or might not get up because 
they do not have to go to work. That is the attitude in the prison 
system. If they do not want to go to work, they do not have to. 
There might be some adjustment in their pay. They may get paid $1 
or $2 less per day but that is about it. There is no obligation on the 
part of the inmates in our prisons today to go to work.
<P>
	Most of the inmates are undisciplined anyway which is why they 
are in jail. They have had their hand against authority right from 
the beginning and are not going to learn any discipline tactics there. 
They are not going to learn what it means to get up and take a lunch 
box to work. They are not going to know what it means to earn a 
decent day's pay. They want it for nothing and if they cannot get it 
for nothing then they will take it. Unfortunately, that is often their 
attitude and is supported by the Liberal government on that side of 
the House. I do not think that is a healthy attitude to develop in 
anyone.
<P>
	The former parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general 
agrees with all of that. He also feels this is all acceptable and 
rehabilitative, but that is where the breakdown in the programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7639"> 7639 </A></B>
<P>
comes. It is not acceptable. It is a failure. Unfortunately the Liberal 
government on that side of the House cannot recognize that at all.
<P>
	Let us look at another reality of the bill in reference to 
deterrence. To extend temporary absence programs would actually 
have the opposite impact on incarceration in the area of deterrence. 
In other words, how is it going to deter anyone? We are talking 
about this so-called rehabilitative viewpoint. How is this going to 
deter anyone from committing a crime and being incarcerated and 
not wanting to go back? Deterrence is not there to make it clear to 
the inmate or the potential criminal.
<P>
	I have dealt with enough criminals in my lifetime and put 
enough individuals in jail to know what their mentality is like. For 
the most part they get together and discuss a lot of things when it 
comes to crime. They discuss a matter before they even do it, 
especially if they are operating in conjunction with one another. 
They will look at it and since they are already bent, for the most 
part, to break the law and defy authority, they will look at the 
system and ask ``what is going to stop me, what are the costs of my 
going out and committing this act?''
<P>
	If they say a person is going to be sentenced to two years less a 
day but they will make sure the person gets out quicker now than 
before, which is what this bill is actually stating, then by the time it 
filters down into the communities they will be out quicker than 
before.
<P>
	The deterrent aspect of the bill diminishes the present law, the 
present form of incarceration and the demands placed on provincial 
governments to keep offenders in and cut down on the cost of 
crime. That again is something this government will not address.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	As I pointed out before, Bill C-53 places prisoner rehabilitation 
and reintegration as equal to the consideration of the protection of 
society. The bill says that rehabilitation and reintegration are equal 
to the protection of society. The truth of the matter is that if the bill 
says this, then the opposite is true. It is not going to do that because 
under the present rehabilitation, parole and temporary absences 
program, the cost of crime continues to soar in our communities.
<P>
	One study states that the cost of crime is in the billions of 
dollars. Before getting into the cost of crime as outlined by the 
Fraser Institute, I am going to criticize the government and the 
justice department substantially because they have never 
conducted any studies on the real cost of crime. I pointed that out 
briefly before. They have never availed themselves of the existing 
stats or sought input from victims of crime or communities as to 
the impact of crime on people. They have not done studies to 
determine what the hospitalization costs are for victims who have 
been assaulted or raped. The impact of criminal behaviour on our 
society has not been examined with regard to hospitalization costs.
<P>
	Let us look at what the report says. I am reading from page 24 on 
hospitalization costs: ``There are hospitalization costs associated 
with violent crimes which should also be included as part of the 
direct costs of violent crime. The average number of days of 
hospitalization, not including simple outpatient treatment, amount 
to roughly one-quarter of the total number of violent incidents. 
That is, for the 270,000 assaults known to police in 1993, about 
68,000 hospital days costing about $68 million were required to 
repair the physical harm done to the victims''. That is just a portion 
of it.
<P>
	The legislation coming from that side of the House does not deal 
with the true costs, even if we just look at the simple category-and 
I hate to categorize it as a category-of assault. There were 68,000 
hospital days costing the taxpayer or government at one level or 
another money to repair those victims.
<P>
	The report says that since data on the number of hospital days 
required to treat the victims of assault are from victim survey data, 
using crime incidence counts derived from victimization surveys 
instead of incidents reported to the police might prove to be more 
appropriate.
<P>
	What is being said is that a victimization survey was done to 
prepare the report. The victimization survey quickly noted that the 
incidents reported to police and the actual figures of people being 
victimized are two different numbers. In other words the 
victimization rate is a lot higher than what is reported to the police. 
As a result the hospitalization costs skyrocketed to $550 million 
just to deal with assaults in this country. That is outrageous. Why 
would any government want to pass legislation that would further 
harm the people of the country? It defies logic. There has to be 
some explanation, but the explanation I am hearing from the 
government side is not logical.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I was on the CBC a short time ago and I tried to reason through 
some of the legislation that had been passed in reference to the 
criminal justice system. The victim is almost considered to be the 
accused. I have to say that the government sides more with the 
protection of the criminal than it does with the victim. It rushes in 
there and supports the criminal. It supports the rights of the 
criminal over the rights of the victim.
<P>
	The facts are sitting there for all to see. They only have to take 
the shades off their eyes and look.
<P>
	There was another study done by Brandon Welsh and Irvin 
Waller: ``Crime and Its Prevention: Costs and Benefits''. This 
study was done by these gentlemen at the Department of 
Criminology of the University of Ottawa. The study talked about 
shattered lives. What is it costing in shattered lives?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7640"> 7640 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill would put the criminal back onto the street earlier so 
that he can victimize more people. It would allow the provinces 
to do the same thing. The attitude is to open the doors. The motto 
of the government is: open the doors so they can all get back out 
and do more damage. That is what is happening. That is the 
attitude of the government. It is unfortunate and it has a significant 
impact on our communities.
<P>
	Welsh and Waller estimate the cost of shattered lives to be $12.1 
billion each year. The study covered the period from 1991 to 1993. 
The cost is outrageous.
<P>
	What is a shattered life? It is a murder. How do the people in the 
family feel? It could be a rape or an assault. It could be the cost of 
social services. For the most part the victims pay for their own care 
but those who commit the crime are supported by the state. The 
state rushes in to help them at every turn. It is totally unacceptable, 
but it is the Liberal philosophy of the day. The cost of shattered 
lives is significant.
<P>
	The government has never measured the lost productivity of a 
person who has been assaulted. It has never measured whether that 
person is as productive as they were before. It has never measured 
the outrage, the fear associated with property crime or violent 
attacks. People have to change their lives but the government 
refuses to address the matter.
<P>
	The bill should address the concerns of the community to its 
fullest and not just the bottom line of what might be in the 
correctional system both provincially and federally. I would 
support the bill, but Reform will not support this bill in this 
context.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I extend congratulations to my colleague from Calgary 
Northeast for an eloquent speech. It was full of a lot of good 
suggestions that I sincerely hope the government will be able to 
adopt in an effort to try to bring some sense to the increasingly 
absurd situation which is taking place within our prisons and 
reformatories.
<P>
	Bill C-53, an act to amend the prisons and reformatories act, was 
a great opportunity for the government to put forth some 
constructive solutions to situations with which those who work 
within the system and those who are observers from without are 
increasingly dissatisfied. I particularly feel sorry for those working 
within the system, the men and women who work in corrections. 
They are finding it increasingly difficult to work within the system 
and to find meaning in what they do. The outcome of what they are 
faced with has been less than satisfactory, not from the good efforts 
they have made but from the fact that the system within which they 
operate is making it very difficult for them to put forth good 
solutions.
<P>
	The suggestion within this bill, as my colleague from Calgary 
Northeast mentioned, is really to increase the number of temporary 
absence programs. The reason the government is proposing this is 
not for the safety of Canadians, it is not to improve the way in 
which crime and punishment operate within Canada, but it is purely 
to try to save money.
<P>
	In the process of trying to save money, which we all approve of, 
there is going to be a huge cost. The cost is in releasing individuals 
who have committed crimes, sometimes very serious crimes, and 
compromising the innocent men, women and children who live in 
our great nation. That is the cost people are going to have to pay in 
the efforts the government is pursuing in this bill in trying to 
increase the number of temporary absence programs which exist 
within our country.
<P>
	Of all the problems that are affecting our prisons and 
reformatories, the government is messing around with a very minor 
issue. This country's prisons and reformatories need a radical 
overhaul. My colleague from Calgary Northeast, my colleague 
from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley and my colleague from 
Fraser Valley West have all put forward some very eloquent 
solutions in which we can revamp our justice system to try to 
ensure that Canadians are safer and try to ensure that crime and 
punishment and sensible cost effective rehabilitation will be 
integral parts of the system.
<P>
	Instead of pursuing these courses, instead of trying to make these 
solutions better, the government has chosen once again to nibble 
around the edges into an area that is relatively meaningless in the 
grand scheme of reforming our prison system. This not only 
happens within this bill but in fact happens to the majority of bills 
in this House. In fact it happens to the majority of work that is done 
in this House and in the committees of the House of Commons. 
Why is this so? Because we do not have a democracy here. We have 
a fiefdom.
<P>
	Every member in this House, if they are honest and look into 
their hearts, will recognize very clearly that a small cadre of 
elected and unelected, invisible, unaccountable individuals are 
making the major decisions within this country. Because of the 
whip structure that we labour under in this country, the good men 
and women who work in this House as members of Parliament 
across party lines are forced to engage in behaviour and are forced 
to do the bidding of these unelected and unaccountable individuals.
<P>
	This is not a democracy. This is a fiefdom. It does a huge 
disservice not only to the people in this House, but most important 
it does a huge disservice to the Canadian public, the people we are 
supposed to serve.
<P>
	This bill provides the Canadian people with just one more 
example of why our system simply does not work. What goes on in 
this House 80 per cent of the time is a sham. It is a complete and 
utter sham.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7641"> 7641 </A></B>
<P>
	It is offensive to me that we are dealing with nibbling around 
this issue. Unlike what the government believes, the situation is 
that our streets are becoming less safe all the time. It is true that 
the stated statistics demonstrate that there has been a decrease in 
crime in adults. It is true that the stated statistics show that there 
has been an increase in violent crime, in particular with youth. 
There has been an increase in crime in general with youth.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	However, our stated facts and statistics on crime and punishment 
do not reflect the fact that the actual rates of crime in this country 
are much greater than the stated levels are. When we look behind 
these statistics the reason is the Canadian public is becoming 
increasingly dissatisfied, more fearful and has less and less faith in 
the justice system as it exists.
<P>
	If we speak to RCMP officers and the good men and women who 
put their lives on the line to keep our streets safe we will find they 
are becoming increasingly dissatisfied. The system ties their hands 
behind their backs and prevents them from doing their jobs. They 
are overworked, understaffed and labour under a series of rules and 
restrictions that prevents them from doing their jobs.
<P>
	If you are playing hardball with criminals you have to play 
hardball back. One need not look any further than the Asian gang 
crime situation in my province of British Columbia and see the 
terrible difficulties that our police forces are having in trying to 
bring these individuals to justice. They feel aggrieved that there has 
been no leadership at the federal or provincial level on this issue. 
This is why we in the Reform Party have become increasingly 
dissatisfied by the inaction, whitewashing and smoke and mirrors 
that have come forward from the justice minister.
<P>
	Rather than taking the initiative and using his power to work 
with members across party lines to develop good, concrete, 
effective solutions to the problems, he has chosen once again to 
play games. He is not playing games only in this House for political 
reasons, he is playing games with the health and welfare and the 
lives and the safety of men, women and children in this country. 
That is nothing to be proud of.
<P>
	Crime is increasing in this country and we have asked the 
minister to do something about it. Apart from the good solutions 
that have already been put forward by my colleagues let me offer a 
few more. First, as has been said before, we have to change the 
mindset of the way we think about justice. Back in the early 1980s 
the Liberal solicitor general of the day said from now on the 
primary goal of the justice system is not going to be the protection 
of innocent civilians; the primary goal is going to be the 
rehabilitation of criminals.
<P>
	While we think that rehabilitation is essential to developing a 
stronger, safer community in the future,  there can be no doubt the 
primary role of our justice system has to be the protection of 
innocent civilians. Period. End of story. That is what we aim to do.
<P>
	It is wise to divide up those who are violent criminals and 
non-violent criminals. Those who are violent criminals have to pay 
the price. They have demonstrated that they have shown a wilful 
neglect to innocent people in the worst possible way. If they are 
sentenced to a term in prison they must pay that price. People who 
are contemplating committing offences must know they are going 
to pay a hefty sentence if they commit them.
<P>
	Second is to ensure that individuals before they are released are 
not going to pose a threat to innocent people. When I worked in 
prisons one of the most appalling things imaginable that I saw were 
individuals with rap sheets as long as your arm who committed 
many violent offences and who were going to be released even 
though everybody who worked with these individuals knew they 
would commit violent offences when they were out, physical, 
sexual or otherwise. It was known.
<P>
	The system prevents us from protecting innocent civilians and 
that is a terrible situation and everybody pays. It is a crime to 
society.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian public should say loudly and clearly that it is not 
going to put up with it anymore. Canadians demand to be protected 
and this House must stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of 
Canada to ensure that people will not commit violent crimes again. 
To the best of our ability we must safeguard the Canadian public 
from this. If we have to, we should deem those people violent 
offenders and keep them in for such a time that they will not pose a 
threat anymore.
<P>
	Non-violent offenders should be able to work as part of 
restitution not only to the victims but also to society at large and for 
their own incarceration.
<P>
	There are two things which are not spoken of often but which my 
colleague from Calgary Northeast mentioned very well. The first is 
skills training. Many of these individuals do not have appropriate 
skills so when they are released out of the system they have nothing 
to fall back on other than a life of crime, which is what they do. As 
part of the system we must ensure skills training is an integral part 
of the rehabilitation of criminals.
<P>
	The second is the extraordinarily high incidence of drug and 
alcohol abuse by incarcerated individuals. Obligatory counselling 
and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse must be a mandatory and 
essential part of rehabilitation. Drug and alcohol abuse, as we know 
in this House, is a very fundamental part of violence and criminal 
behaviour.
<P>
	My third point concerns dealings with psychiatric patients. One 
of the worst things we have done in recent years is to 
deinstitutionalize psychiatric patients. In my view, many 
psychiatric patients should not have been deinstitutionalized, 
although some certainly should have been and the integration of 
individuals from that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7642"> 7642 </A></B>
<P>
population in society is something that they and those of us who do 
not have psychiatric problems have benefited from.
<P>
	However, there is a large population composed of individuals 
who cannot take care of themselves on the street. They stop 
medicating themselves and they go into a worsening spiral of their 
psychoses. They run afoul of the law and wind up in an institution, 
in a criminal institution, in a correctional facility. These people 
should not be there. They should be receiving the appropriate 
psychiatric treatments. They should be medicated properly. That 
would save the system money. It would save a lot of hidden costs 
for our society and, most important, these poor individuals who 
suffer from psychiatric diseases would be treated appropriately in 
an environment of safety with the assurance and care they need.
<P>
	I strongly advise the Minister of Justice to urge his counterparts 
in the provinces to stop the deinstitutionalizing process and look at 
effective means of determining which patients should or should not 
be deinstitutionalized.
<P>
	My next point is also related to rehabilitation. There is an 
interesting program that has taken place around San Francisco, 
California which touches on what I said before. They have brought 
individuals who are near the end of their sentences into the real, 
non-custodial world to work in the real world with real people. 
They are introduced to working in the real world with 
non-incarcerated individuals.
<P>
	In the process, these individuals learned a great deal about how 
to function appropriately with others. They learned conflict 
resolution strategies. They learned appropriate social mores, how 
to control violent behaviour and how to work effectively in a work 
situation. They were required to act responsibly in the working 
world.
<P>
	Many of these individuals had never had that opportunity before 
and had led lives of crime. When they became a part of this type of 
rehabilitation system-I encourage the Minister of Justice to look 
at this-the outcome was to save millions of taxpayer dollars and 
to help integrate them back into society as useful, productive, 
employable members of society. I would encourage the Minister of 
Justice once again to look at this other solution.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Another thing I would like to address is the issue of prevention. 
In my experience in dealing with youth in juvenile detention 
centres, many of the children do not have the pillars of a normal 
psyche. It is true that many of them have endured atrocious and 
appalling conditions  of violence and sexual abuse. Throughout that 
period the pillars of a normal psyche were not allowed to develop. 
As a result many of them have run afoul of the law and go on to 
develop into dysfunctional adults later on.
<P>
	There is a way out but it does not involve trying to change the 
mindset of these individuals when they are 15. We cannot do it at 
that time and we certainly cannot do it with a three month, six 
month or one year incarceration with optional counselling in a 
juvenile detention centre. Nothing changes. These people are let 
out and they go right back to the criminal behaviour they had 
before. Many of these kids go back into the same family situations 
and endure the same appalling family situation. This does not 
work.
<P>
	There are solutions. First, we need to identify children at risk 
very early on and we need to identify families at risk. It is not too 
early to identify these families right at the prenatal stage. Families 
at risk do not just materialize. It is something that one can observe 
clinically. When these families are identified it is worthwhile to 
have quick response teams go in and deal with these families.
<P>
	Furthermore, the school system can be a useful tool. They did 
this down in the United States, I believe at Columbia University. 
What they did at inner city schools, which had terrible rates of 
violence, drug abuse, teen pregnancies and dropouts, is they took 
these kids early on to teach them at four and five years old not only 
their A, B, C's, but also appropriate conflict resolution, drugs, 
alcohol, self-respect and respect for others.
<P>
	When doing this intervention beginning at the age of four, they 
had an enormous impact on the future psychological development 
of these kids. Furthermore, they also brought the parents into the 
system, many of whom were single parents, and taught the parents 
the same issues.
<P>
	The outcome of this was a radical decrease in dropout rates, 
violence and teen pregnancies in these children. The savings to the 
system were absolutely enormous. The parents who were also 
involved were able to develop appropriate parenting skills that they 
never had before. It was a win-win situation for all concerned. It 
will not cost us more money. In fact, it will save us money.
<P>
	I presented this to the Minister of Justice last May or June. I 
asked him to take a leadership role to bring together his 
counterparts in the provinces, the ministers of health, human 
resources and development and the solicitors general, to develop 
some kind of formalized plan that can be employed in the 
educational system very early on beginning with kindergarten in 
order to teach the kids and to also bring the parents who are at risk 
into the system.
<P>
	The benefits to our society will be massive. I am confident we 
will see a decrease in the youth crime rate and a decrease in adults. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7643"> 7643 </A></B>
<P>
This is not pie in the sky. It is  cost effective economically and it 
has been proven in the United States to work.
<P>
	Dr. Fraser Mustard, part of our centres of excellence in Toronto, 
has done some work touching on these issues. I would again 
encourage our Minister of Justice to take a look at this, not study it 
for 10 years but to start acting and using some of these ideas if for 
no other reason but to use it as a pilot project.
<P>
	I know members of this party would be very happy to provide the 
considerable amount of expertise that exists within our party to the 
minister for effective, cost effective and socially effective solutions 
that are going to make our streets and society safer and stronger.
<P>
	In closing, we do not support Bill C-53. It does not address the 
central issue we have in this country which is the issue of an 
increasing crime rate and decreasing safety and putting greater 
emphasis on the protection of innocent civilians rather than on the 
rehabilitation of the criminal.
<P>
	I would ask once again for all of us to work together on this issue 
for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the presentation of my hon. 
colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca about Bill C-53.
<P>
	I know from travelling throughout my riding of Peace 
George-Peace River and across the country that Canadians are 
concerned about some measures which have been taken by the 
government to keep criminals out of the prison system. I speak 
specifically about the measures known as the alternative measures 
and conditional sentencing.
<P>
	In meetings that I had during the Christmas break in my riding, a 
number of people came to me with concerns about the justice 
system and specifically about the lack of deterrence in the justice 
system.
<P>
	One of the arguments made by the Liberal government is that 
more criminals have to be kept out of the system and alternative 
measures must be provided because of the overcrowding of the 
prisons, the correctional facilities. It seems to me that part of the 
reason why the jails are overcrowded is that we have made them 
such a comfortable place in which to reside. Perhaps-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A tea party.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Boy, that certainly got 
some heckling going from the opposite side, did it not? They 
certainly dislike to hear that type of reasoning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Name me one Canadian who wants to go to jail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> The parliamentary 
secretary for the minister of justice is spouting off saying, name me 
one Canadian who wants to go to jail. I am sure we could come up 
with a long list of repeat offenders. Is he perhaps indicating that 
there are no repeat offenders in the country? There is a growing list 
of repeat offenders. Why are there so many repeat offenders if jail 
provides a real deterrence?
<P>
	Would my hon. colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca like to 
comment on the reality that as long as we continue to send people 
to jail to shoot pool, play golf, eat steak on Saturday, there is not 
much deterrence? That is the viewpoint of a growing number of 
Canadians. Whether or not the Liberals want to recognize that, it is 
the reality in the real world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my hon. colleague from Prince George-Peace River 
who, with his colleague from Prince George-Bulkley Valley, has 
shown a longstanding, intense interest in the justice system. He has 
put forward some very good solutions. He has worked very hard on 
the issue and knows of what he speaks. He spends a lot of time in 
his riding and in other ridings speaking about the justice system. 
He has done a commendable job in this House in lending expertise 
to this issue.
<P>
	A new jail was built in his area. Each cell in that jail cost 
$175,000. He is quite correct that, contrary to what some of the 
government members say, there are some individuals who do not 
mind being in jail. Quite frankly, there is very little deterrence to 
being in jail for these individuals.
<P>
	There are four nice meals a day, better than they would be 
getting were they out. There are a number of options that they 
would never have outside the jail. That is one of the reasons why 
the Canadian public feel aggrieved.
<P>
	They say: ``Why are people who are incarcerated getting better 
treatment than we are outside? I am part of the working poor. I am 
slogging away. I have to put my kids through school and be taxed to 
death. I have to pay my medical, yet somebody who commits an 
atrocious crime goes into jail and gets all this free''. There is no 
penalty, no responsibility and no deterrence.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	We are not saying that individuals should not have proper 
medical care, treatment and counselling in jail. However, they 
should put their backs into paying for it. One solution that has come 
from this party is the sensible solution of restitution. There should 
be restitution to society and also to the institution so that in turn 
these people can contribute to paying for the cost of their 
incarceration which for a juvenile can be approximately $90,000 a 
year and for an adult approximately $60,000 a year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7644"> 7644 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is dumping, pure and simple. It is an economic bill 
that dumps people out of jail and on to the streets. The cost will 
be the safety of the Canadian people. It is not a sensible bill.
<P>
	As my colleague for Prince George-Peace River stated, the 
government has not brought forward any sensible solutions for 
deterrence and no sensible solutions for alternative measures. 
These people must know that committing a crime is not a 
pleasurable thing and that they will pay a penalty. There must be a 
significant element of deterrence put into the system for those who 
commit crimes.
<P>
	Since we are a sensible, balanced party, we are putting forward 
constructive, sensible, economically feasible solutions for 
restitution and rehabilitation.
<P>
	We are not in any way, ever going to compromise the health, 
welfare or safety of Canadians. The bill does just that by dumping 
these people out on the streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed listing to my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. He 
has a pretty good handle on some of the problems regarding the fact 
that there are a lot of repeat offenders in the system.
<P>
	I had the opportuntiy of visiting a maximum security prison 
about two years ago in Edmonton. It is the top level of the prison 
service, maximum security. There are a lot of social workers, 
psychiatrists and psychologists working with inmates to try to 
bring about some rehabilitation.
<P>
	As a bit of background, about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the 
people in the prison at the time of my visit were repeat offenders, 
returned after having served sentences in the past. However, the 
prison officials were trying to rehabilitate these people and that is 
very commendable.
<P>
	However, at the same time we understood there was a drug 
problem in the prison. They were trying to rehabilitate prisoners 
from drug abuse at the same time that drugs were coming into the 
prison. That simply does not work. The warden of the prison 
admitted that there was a big problem. He said the drugs came in 
through conjugal visits, but I suspect it is more than that. Maybe 
some of the prison staff may be involved. However, it is ironic that 
we are trying to rehabilitate prisoners for drug abuse at the same 
time drugs are getting into the maximum security prisons.
<P>
	My colleague said that he has worked a little in the prisons in his 
capacity as a doctor. I wonder what his ideas would be on how to 
correct the problem so that we could get back to rehabilitation, 
which is really what the prisoners deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague for Peace River has hit the nail on the head about a very 
important problem that is affecting prisons  across the country, one 
which the men and women who work in our prison systems are 
finding increasingly difficult to deal with, and that is the huge 
problem of active drug use within the prison system and also the 
fact that individuals who have drug and alcohol problems are not 
receiving treatment.
<P>
	As part of their incarceration, as part of the condition for release, 
individuals must take counselling for drug and alcohol problems. 
Also, there should be significant penalties for individuals who 
smuggle and use drugs and alcohol in the prisons. All they receive 
right now is a slap on the wrist and that is not adequate.
<P>
	Contrary to the belief of some social thinkers, deterrence does 
work to some extent. If people know they are going to be faced 
with something a little more severe than a slap on the wrist, then 
they would think twice about doing this.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The solution is for these individuals to have their sentences 
extended as summary justice for committing these criminal acts 
while in jail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-53. It gives me no pleasure 
to address bills like this when I think about what the government's 
first priority is supposed to be. Government was formed on one 
principle: to look after the safety and well-being of its citizens at all 
times and at all costs.
<P>
	We have had only two basic governments in this country: Liberal 
and Conservative. Through time both of these governments, 
working hand in hand, because there really is no difference in them, 
have come up with programs such as this piece of garbage. They 
put these programs forward for the safety and well-being of 
Canadian taxpaying citizens. That totally goes against the reason 
for government: the safety and well-being of its citizens. I wish 
those governments could understand that. They cannot. They have 
not for years.
<P>
	Reformers talk to the people. Like our Prime Minister we do not 
talk to imaginary friends. We talk to the people out there who pay 
the bills. They own this chair. I do not own this chair.
<P>
	The reason we are standing here today to discuss this is basically 
the safety and well-being of Canadian citizens. Because of bills 
such as this, which have been put forward by both Liberal and 
Conservative governments, people out there are starting to live by 
the law of the jungle, not by the law of the land. They live in fear.
<P>
	Government members may joke about it, but it is a fact. Elderly 
people are afraid to go out at night to get a loaf of bread. 
Government members think that is a joke. They think that because 
people are now starting to live in walled communities in order to be 
safe is a joke. It is a joke to this great sharing, caring Liberal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7645"> 7645 </A></B>
<P>
government. Government members do not pay attention to what is 
going on in the real world.
<P>
	Government members have three basic functions in the House: 
keep your mouth closed; do what you are told to do; and do not step 
out of line. For the little bit of gratitude you get, you will be able to 
sit in the front seat or be able to get your nomination papers signed.
<P>
	Let us take a look at this. We could go through the whole system 
of sentencing; truth in sentencing.
<P>
	At one time when you were given 10 years, 12 years, 15 years, 
you got 10, 12 or 15 years. That was it. Then along came the 
bleeding hearts. They say: ``This is not good enough. Somebody 
who murders should not have to do 20 or 25 years. Gosh, they only 
took a life. They only left a number of orphans. They only left some 
widows. That is nothing. We do not know them. We will change the 
system. We will put in a faint hope clause. We will allow them the 
opportunity to get out, maybe, in eight years. We will give them 
something to look forward to, you bet, to go out and reoffend''. 
This is what we run into in this country. We run into a system where 
we see the bills from this great government. What for? For cleaning 
needles so that prisoners can have drugs without being infected in a 
prison. They cannot control the drugs in their own prison. What the 
heck is going on here? Where has reality gone? With the red book 
down the toilet. There is absolutely no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	They say that nobody wants to go back to prison. There are 
people who make that their first home and have made it their first 
home for a number of years. They forget what it is like to be on the 
outside.
<P>
	I really do not want to talk about prisoners so much here. I want 
to talk about the honest, law-abiding, hard working taxpaying 
citizen of this country who absolutely gets no protection from this 
government. How many people do we hear about who are working 
at the 7-Elevens or the gas stations where an armed robber walks 
in, holds them up, shoots them, paralizes them and puts them in a 
wheelchair for the rest of their lives? What do you do with them? 
You stick them in a corner and forget all about them. There is no 
system in place for these people, but there certainly is for the 
person who pulled that trigger or stuck them with a knife. You have 
all the sympathy in the world for that, do you not?
<P>
	What about the young children who have to grow up without a 
mother or a father? There is nothing in place for them, is there? No, 
but there sure is for the person who made them that way. There is 
every kind of sympathy you can think of, like re-education. We 
have our own children out there who cannot afford to go to 
university, but we will supply university programs. We will do that 
for the prisoners. You bet we will, but not for the honest 
law-abiding child who wants to get a better education. No.
<P>
	We will give them free medical, the best that can be. We have 
people out there who would love to be able to have medical 
attention, but no. What do we do? We shut down the hospitals. We 
create the line-ups, but not for the prisoners. No sir. That would 
sure be a crime if we ever did that.
<P>
	We can look at the dental service. There are lots of people out 
there, I included, who have no dental plan. We work for ourselves. 
We pay our taxes and we pay to go to the dentist. But not our 
prisoners. No. We will keep our own people broke paying for it but, 
by golly, do not let one little prisoner suffer not one iota in this 
country. Do not let them suffer. Do not make them work. Don't you 
dare make them work to help supply the costs for incarceration. 
No, do not do that. That is against their rights. Yes sir, never mind 
the right of the taxpayer who pays your bills. No, do not worry 
about them, not one little bit.
<P>
	I do not understand it. I just do not understand it. We have a 
system set up. I was asked this question. I have been branded a cold 
hearted redneck over this question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Extremist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Oh yes, I hear ``extremist'' from over there. Sure, 
it is extremist to worry about the taxpayer in this country. It is 
extremist to worry about the livelihood and the safety of my 
mother. It is extremist. That is right, you keep it up. That is what 
you call extremist. Shame on you. I hope your parents give you a 
talking to when you get home. That is all I can say. You have no 
more thought for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Racist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I hear the word ``racist'' from that side. Do you 
have the fortitude or the gonads to stand up and come across here 
and say that to me, you son of a bitch? Come on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Hopkins):</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I will not have some s.o.b. sit here and call me a 
racist.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order please. Hon. 
members know that sometimes tempers flare in debate but I think if 
the hon. member would continue to engage in verbal sparring 
rather than the other sort we would all be better off. I think that is 
true throughout the House.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member if he wishes to resume his remarks to do 
so. If he feels it is not a good time for that obviously he can allow 
another member to speak. If he has a problem that he wishes to 
raise he can do it through the Chair. I invite him to address his 
remarks through the Chair, indeed all hon. members to address 
their remarks through the Chair rather than directly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7646"> 7646 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are right, I should address the 
Chair. I do not mind being called a lot of things but there are a 
few things I will not stand for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> But you can call 
anybody what you want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I have never said that to any man yet. Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> You should read the blues tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, I am afraid I have read your blues before. I 
have heard all this before from you people.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I invite the hon. 
member-and I thought he had agreed to take my advice-to 
address his remarks through the Chair. The intemperate language 
that we are hearing in the House is perhaps unnecessary and it is 
not helped when members address each other instead of addressing 
the Chair.
<P>
	I respectfully again urge the member in his remarks to address 
them through the Chair and not to other members in the House. I 
am sure if that happens other members will try to do the same. I 
appreciate that co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are right.
<P>
	Bill C-53 does absolutely nothing to address the safety and 
well-being of citizens of this country. I have said that before and I 
will say it again because I do not think people fully understand 
what goes on here. We hear from the government time and time 
again that violent crime is down in this country.
<P>
	Yes, in some aspects it is but they forget to tell the people that 
one of the reasons is because it is called plea bargaining. We have a 
plea bargaining system set up that when a person is charged with a 
number of offences, through our good graces we are a forgiving 
people, I guess, and we will wipe that all underneath the table if 
they will plead guilty to one portion of their crime. When the 
government says that violent crime is down in some areas, sure it 
is. We have allowed them to get away with it. We have allowed 
them not to be sentenced on that issue.
<P>
	Let us look at truth in sentencing and what it really is. It is a joke. 
It is a joke on the taxpaying people of this country but the members 
on the other side do not seem to think so. They use this as a basis 
for their argument. They do not tell the people the proper stats of 
what the crime is, what the plea bargaining system does or what 
was plea bargained away. No, not this sharing, caring government. 
It would never think of doing that.
<P>
	I am proud to stand here today and oppose this bill and I look 
forward to any of the questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Through 
you, Mr. Speaker, to the member I want to begin by reading a short 
sentence from the bill because I think it is important that Canadians 
understand exactly  what this bill does. If they listened to the 
member for the last few minutes his speech in no way, shape or 
form reflected anything that was in this bill. He was talking about 
something that had nothing to do with this bill. This enactment 
amends the Prisons and Reformatories Act by adding a statement 
of purpose and principles for temporary absence programs similar 
to the statement in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
The enactment also authorizes the provinces to create additional 
types of temporary absences consistent with purposes and 
principles.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The enactment extends the period of temporary absences granted 
for non-medical reasons to a maximum of 60 days and adds the 
power to renew temporary absences following a reassessment of 
the case. The amendments authorize the provinces to establish 
eligibility criteria for temporary absences in order to restrict the 
concurrent eligibility of prisoners for some types of temporary 
absences and parole.
<P>
	Part of this whole program is about rehabilitation. Is the member 
from the Reform Party saying that he does not believe in 
rehabilitation? Is the member saying that once you are assigned or 
put in prison that is the end of you for life? Is this some kind of new 
treatment the member is trying to design? I am just not clear where 
the member is coming from.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could make it quite clear to those of us in 
the House and state categorically that he does not believe in 
rehabilitation in any way, shape or form. That was the message I 
got from his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member got that 
from my speech because that is not what I meant at all. I believe in 
self-rehabilitation. I believe in the rehabilitation of certain 
criminals for certain crimes. There is nothing wrong with that. 
What I have trouble with is when we have the state passing out 
little goodies, allowing them out on temporary absences. How 
many have re-offended during temporary absences?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> That's not what the bill 
says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> You guys are just mixing apples and oranges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No, we are not mixing apples and oranges. We 
want truth in sentencing, especially for violent, repeat and serious 
criminals. We want that.
<P>
	We hear the rhetoric all the time from this government that this 
is not what this or that means, then all of a sudden down the road 
the light goes on for them. Maybe two or three years too late they 
say ``by gosh, that was used for that, wasn't it?'' We get this all the 
time. We read about it all the time. We did not understand that is 
what it meant.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7647"> 7647 </A></B>
<P>
	I say and have always said two violence strikes and you are out, 
period, bang. Every criminal who is convicted the second time of 
a violent crime should be sentenced to imprisonment without 
eligibility for early release or parole. That is totally opposite to 
early release and temporary absence. That is all that means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I allowed 
two or three minutes for cooler heads to prevail, as you saw, Mr. 
Speaker, a few minutes ago.
<P>
	However, I would like to rise on a point of order on 
Beauchesne's 485 regarding unparliamentary language which 
caused the outburst of rage from my colleague who was insulted by 
the member for Scarborough Centre who shouted words across the 
floor and accused my colleague of being a racist and an extremist. 
This type of language from members of the Liberal Party, the 
governing party, demonstrates their contempt for people who wish 
to express a point of view that is different from their own. This type 
of language does not belong in the House. It does not belong in a 
civilized society. It does not belong in any part of politics.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I would hope that the member for Scarborough Centre would rise 
and apologize profusely and without reservation to my colleague. I 
would hope that these remarks would be withdrawn and that the 
incident be recorded as having come from the Liberal Party 
members as their attitude when challenged by someone who has an 
opinion different from their own.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We will 
have to look at the blues. The actual unparliamentary language that 
was used came from the member opposite who was speaking at the 
time.
<P>
	I was sitting two benches away from the member for 
Scarborough Centre. If someone would look at the blues and put 
the debate into context, the speaker at the time was referring to 
generalities with respect to certain terms that he was using in his 
speech.
<P>
	All the member from Scarborough Centre did was to suggest 
other forms of words that he would be able to use. Extremist was a 
word that was used, yes. The member for Scarborough Centre also 
used the word racists in the plural tense. He did not put his 
criticism directly at the member. He directed it at the terms 
members are using.
<P>
	I would encourage the Chair to review the blues to see that the 
blues speak for themselves. The actual apology should come from 
that member for the words we know he used.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It would be helpful to the 
House if the Chair had an opportunity to review the blues to see 
what was said as suggested by the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	As members know, I was not in the Chair at the time even though 
I was in a position where I could hear what was being said in the 
House. I was immediately adjacent to the Chamber. I did not hear 
all the words that were alleged. However, I understand that there 
was a contretemps. I heard some language that was 
unparliamentary used. In the circumstances, since the matter has 
now been raised, it would be appropriate to defer the matter until 
the Chair has an opportunity to review the transcript of the 
proceedings. We will get back to the House.
<P>
	If members have further submissions to make on the point, it 
might be appropriate that they make them in chambers after rather 
than now in the circumstances because I think we have heard both 
sides of the argument.
<P>
	If the member for St. Albert insists, I will hear more, but given 
what I have decided to do, I hope his remarks will be extremely 
pertinent to the position of the Chair, given what I have already 
said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Most pertinent, Mr. Speaker. I would like to draw 
your attention to the remarks by the parliamentary secretary who 
was talking about the heated debate being in context. The Speaker 
has ruled on many occasions that unparliamentary language is 
unparliamentary language in context or out of context.
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is that the member who 
uttered the words is sitting in the Chamber. He should stand up and 
acknowledge that he said that in this House before his peers. If he 
can shout it out in anonymity, he should be prepared to stand up and 
acknowledge his words. He has the opportunity to stand up right 
before us as we speak to withdraw the comment he made.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport on the same point. Again, I 
hope he bears in mind what I said to the hon. member for St. Albert 
before he started his second comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to 
speak on this issue. It is pertinent and I respect your wise counsel.
<P>
	It should be noted by all members of the House that when there 
is the rhetoric that may fly back and forth during debate between 
members in the House, there is opportunity for any member who 
disagrees with a member opposite to follow protocol, to stand in 
their place and ask the Speaker whether he or she has heard the 
remark and then ask the Speaker to rule that that remark be 
withdrawn.
<P>
	However, for a member to leave his chair, call someone an s.o.b., 
run across the aisle and physically challenge him I hope will be a 
consideration in your ruling.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Debating the matter in this 
way is perhaps unnecessary. I know members have strong views 
perhaps as to what transpired, but I have indicated the Chair will 
look at all the facts and will review the blues. As I indicated, the 
Chair did not hear some of the comments that have been alleged 
and so is not in a position to make a comment without that review. 
In the circumstances we will leave the matter until the Chair has 
had that opportunity. Then further discussions can take place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, given what happened and what 
transpired, as my colleague described earlier, with the verbal abuse 
coming this way and the physical reaction, I will respect the 
Chair's decision to review the blues. At that time I will be prepared 
to stand up and withdraw the word racists in plural, if I have to after 
your review, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I thank the hon. member. 
The Chair will proceed with the review as indicated.
<P>
	We have five minutes remaining in questions and comments. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of 
Canada on a question or comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood who has attempted to put 
this debate in its true context. We have in front of us a simple bill, 
Bill C-53, a bill that has been discussed and negotiated after several 
years of discussions not only with the provinces and the territories 
but with each official judicial power and each provincial justice 
ministry. They have unanimously endorsed our position.
<P>
	Members opposite seem to have difficulty understanding that 
this bill deals with provincial legislation which affects offenders 
serving two years less a day. I sat hear patiently this morning and 
listened to the rhetoric and the challenges of the members of the 
Reform Party. They challenged the government as to what it has 
done. I will remind them of our initiatives.
<P>
	I remind them of the provisions in Bill C-45 to establish 
someone as a long term offender. I remind them of the indefinite 
sentences that have been imposed on those long term and 
dangerous offenders. They are indefinite sentences in the sense that 
they will no longer only get 10 years but a judge has to condemn 
them to indefinite sentences. This means they are not eligible for 
parole before seven years. It also means that after those seven years 
their sentences could be prolonged by a subsequent two years and 
cannot come up for review before two years.
<P>
	Why did Reformers vote against those initiatives? Why did they 
vote against the initiative to allow for 10-year supervision after a 
complete sentence has been served by an offender? Instead they 
have chosen to hide behind the rhetoric.
<P>
	I will ask the member specifically since it was he who brought it 
up. Last spring when it came time to review section 745, the 
infamous faint hope clause, we could have put serial killers behind 
bars for good without eligibility for parole. We could have 
specifically addressed the case of Clifford Olson to prevent him 
from even applying. Why did the member's party vote against all 
these initiatives? Why, why, why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, why should Clifford Olson even be 
allowed to apply for release, period? Why, why, why? Because the 
government has allowed that type of system to ferment here.
<P>
	Government members can try to dress this up with all the pretty 
flowers and all the pretty words but the fact is that they are still 
kicking people out through the system. They are giving that over to 
the provinces; there is no doubt about that. But why? Why would 
they even be thinking about that? Why would they not be thinking 
of something else instead? We have tried for years with the Liberal 
way and the Conservative way to address crime, to address 
reoffenders. Actually, many of the good programs have been taken 
out of the penal system. It is pretty tough in some areas to learn a 
trade in prison because of all the other programs that are in place 
like weight lifting, swimming, tennis and golf.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	When people get out of prison they might like to be able to say 
they can do welding, mechanics or iron work, something where 
they may stand a chance of a job placement and contribute to the 
system instead of abusing it. This has absolutely nothing to do with 
that. I could readily support bills that did that sort of thing. No one 
in the Reform Party would have trouble supporting bills like that.
<P>
	Instead we get this feel good, fuzzy-wuzzy thing: ``We will 
release you early. We will kick you out. We will make sure you do 
not do your sentence. We will give you a temporary release for 
anything you like''. To me that is not what prison is for. People are 
normally put in prison because they broke the law, not because they 
obeyed the law. In the odd case that may happen, but it is very, very 
seldom. In fact, I have not heard of one.
<P>
	I was always led to believe that if you do the crime, you do the 
time. That does not seem to be the case any more. We do not have 
that. Now it is: You do the crime and we will look after you for life. 
You do not have to worry about anything. Step out of jail and we 
will just keep right on looking after you. We will make sure that 
your wants and needs are met, but if there is something we cannot 
supply, you just go right back out and commit a crime. That seems 
to have been the attitude over the last 25 years.
<P>

	When we were young I guess we all thought we were tough and 
nothing would ever happen to us and we would get along just fine. 
But as tough as guys thought they were in my day, they always 
stood aside for the elderly and helped the elderly and had respect 
for the disabled and helped in any way they could. Today we do 
not see any of that. Why? Because there is nothing in place. Penal 
systems are looked upon as a joke.
<P>
	I understand that many prisoners are trying to get extradited back 
to Canada from the United States and other countries to serve their 
time.

Criminal Code (production of records in sexual offence 
proceedings) be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to submit to the House for second reading Bill C-46, 
an act to amend the  Criminal Code regarding the production of 
personal records of complainants and witnesses in sexual offence 
proceedings.
<P>
	This legislation, which the minister introduced last June, has 
been the focus of much media attention. The problem which the 
legislation addresses has also been thoroughly debated in the media 
and in Canadian courtrooms.
<P>
	The amendments to the Criminal Code for which I am seeking 
support respond to a troubling and complex issue which is having 
an adverse effect on sexual offence victims, the majority of whom 
are women or children.
<P>
	I know that members of the House are familiar with this issue. 
Their constituents have brought it to their attention and it has been 
subjected to questions in the House. I know all members share my 
concern. I am confident they will support these very essential 
measures.
<P>
	Over the last several years defence counsel has increasingly 
sought access to the wide range of personal records of sexual 
offence complainants, the type of records one would expect to be 
private, including school records, medical, psychiatric counselling 
and other therapeutic records, employment records, Children's Aid 
Society records, journals and diaries. The list goes on.
<P>
	In sexual offence prosecutions, more so than any other offence, 
the defence focuses on the credibility of the complainant. Sexual 
offences are unique. Usually there are no witnesses to the offence 
and often there are no observable signs of an offence having been 
committed. For many sexual offences the only element which 
distinguishes normal and acceptable sexual activity from a sexual 
offence is the absence of consent of one party.
<P>
	Sexual offences are also unique in another way. They are 
surrounded by myths and stereotypes about the type of person who 
becomes a victim and why. Moreover, the consequences of a sexual 
offence are devastating and long lasting.
<P>
	While the prosecution must prove every element of a sexual 
offence, including the absence of consent of the complainant, often 
the complainant's word pitted against the accused is the only 
evidence to establish this one essential element of the offence. 
Hence the defence of the accused will focus on the credibility of the 
complainant in most cases. The search for personal records has 
become the strategy to assist the defence in the impeachment of the 
complainant's credibility and reputation.
<P>
	Consider the following scenario. A person is sexually assaulted 
and following the assault receives counselling from a sexual 
assault centre. The counsellor may take notes of the sessions where 
the complainant is distraught and full of self-doubt about why this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7650"> 7650 </A></B>
<P>
has happened. The notes are the perceptions or recollections of the 
counsellor. They are not verbatim transcripts of the conversation. 
They are not statements. Yet defence  counsel may attempt to gain 
access to and explore those records, looking for perhaps what is in 
the view of the defence an inconsistent statement. Or perhaps the 
complainant has undergone therapy for depression or child sexual 
abuse long before the assault which is now subject to criminal 
charges.
<P>
	These records may also be sought to suggest that the 
complainant's perceptions or recollections of the incident are 
confused. In other words, the suggestion is that the complainant 
who has received such counselling or therapy is less credible.
<P>
	In the extensive consultations which led to this legislation the 
Minister of Justice was overwhelmed by the accounts from sexual 
assault service providers, sexual offence survivors and lawyers at 
the range of records sought, the reasons advanced for the records 
and the relative ease with which they have been produced to 
defence counsel. The most troubling aspect of the consultations has 
been the devastating consequences of the production of irrelevant 
personal records for the victim.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The minister was also troubled by the perception of victims and 
service providers about the insensitivity of the criminal justice 
system. They recounted several examples which caused them to 
believe that there is little point in participating as a witness in a 
sexual offence prosecution. For example, they referred the minister 
to an event in 1988 where defence counsel in the Ottawa area, 
attending a workshop on tips and strategies for sexual assault 
proceedings, were being advised to seek records, including 
Children's Aid Society records, medical, psychiatric, hospital and 
immigration records as part of a strategy ``to whack the 
complainant hard at the preliminary inquiry''.
<P>
	This attack on the complainants was recommended so that either 
she would give up and ask the crown to withdraw the charges or in 
the event that she withstands this gruelling and embarrassing 
treatment to cause the lawyer to rethink the accused's defence.
<P>
	This approach ignores the fact that the complainant is not 
supposed to be on trial and moreover trial by ordeal has never been 
part of the criminal justice system in Canada. Yet these ordeals 
continue to occur and may result in sexual offence victims deciding 
not to report offences or not to participate as witnesses.
<P>
	The willy-nilly production of personal records to the accused is 
having a serious and devastating impact on sexual offence 
complainants and on record holders themselves. Some claimants 
will decide not to participate as witnesses in the prosecution. Some 
may decide not to report an offence to the police. Others may report 
to the police but forgo the counselling or treatment essential to 
their recovery and well-being due to fears that these personal 
records, whether generated before or after the offence, will not be 
kept private during the court process.
<P>
	The impact is also experienced by record holders, including 
hospitals, sexual assault centres, social service agencies and 
doctors who are incurring substantial legal costs to appear in court 
to respond to subpoenas. In addition to the legal costs, such 
appearances take the record holder away from their day to day 
work of helping people, that is, doing what they ought to be doing. 
The very act of issuing a subpoena to a record holder cannot be 
ignored. Whether the records are even remotely relevant to the 
proceedings or not, the record holder must respond.
<P>
	The consultation process also reveals situations where 
subpoenas for records were issued to the service providers who had 
never met, treated, or counselled the complainant at all. In other 
words, these subpoenas were simply fishing expeditions.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that a person should not have an opportunity 
to pursue the best defence available and defence counsels do 
acknowledge that relevance is a factor in accessing information and 
records. However, relevance appears to take on different 
interpretations in sexual offence proceedings and does not appear 
to be a very significant hurdle to access to those records.
<P>
	In describing the current situation that Bill C-46 will address, the 
minister has consistently referred to the impact on sexual offence 
victims in a generic way. However, let there be no mistake. We are 
talking about women and children. Our sexual offence laws and, 
indeed, all our laws apply equally to men and women in the sense 
that they are gender neutral. A man or woman can sexually assault 
another man, woman or child, but the overwhelming majority, that 
is 99 per cent, of sexual offence victims are women and children.
<P>
	While the law is on its face gender neutral, when it comes to 
sexual offences the impact of the law is disproportionately felt by 
women and children. The production of personal records raises 
more than simply rights of privacy and the rights of full answer in 
defence. It raises equality issues and thus the solutions to this 
problem must squarely address these equality issues.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	One of the most troubling aspects of the impact of the production 
of records is that it runs counter to the spirit of reform of our sexual 
assault laws which the federal government has been attempting for 
the past 20 years.
<P>
	In the past, our laws have not adequately served victims of 
sexual offences. Before the substantive reforms to the sexual 
assault provisions of the code, in 1976 and later in 1983, the 
successful prosecution of the offence of rape was extremely 
difficult. The evidentiary provisions required the victim's evidence 
to be corroborated and left the victim's personal life, including 
sexual history and reputation, virtually an open book.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7651"> 7651 </A></B>
<P>
	The reforms of 1983 attempted to eradicate long, outdated 
myths about sexual offence victims and their behaviour. However, 
despite the reforms of 1983, which repealed the old offences, 
including rape, and put in place the current sexual assault offences 
and which repealed the restrictive evidentiary provisions, attitudes 
about sexual offence victims have been slow to change.
<P>
	Thus, it was necessary for further amendments in 1992 to restore 
the rape shield protections in the Criminal Code to safeguard the 
complainant's sexual history to as great an extent as possible 
without adversely affecting the rights of the accused to a fair trial.
<P>
	Today we are faced with dealing with yet another issue which 
threatens sexual offence victims and indeed every woman's 
confidence in the criminal justice system. We must take this 
opportunity to put the progressive reforms of our sexual offence 
laws back on track. We must take the-

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during 1997 Canadians from coast to coast to coast will be 
celebrating a special milestone in the history of this country.
<P>
	January 1, 1997 marked the 50th anniversary of the Canadian 
Citizenship Act. Prior to the passage of this important legislation, 
legally there was no such thing as a Canadian.
<P>
	The inspiration behind the drafting of the Citizenship Act is a 
story worth telling. In February 1945 cabinet minister Paul Martin 
Senior visited a military cemetery in Dieppe, France. Struck by the 
varied ethnic origins of the soldiers' names on the gravestones, Mr. 
Martin concluded that the one thing that united them all was that 
they were Canadians.
<P>
	With the blessing of Prime Minister King, Mr. Martin drafted a 
Canadian Citizenship Act and presented it to the House of 
Commons in 1946 where it was passed with overwhelming support.
<P>
	This 50th anniversary is an opportunity to think about how 
precious our Canadian citizenship is and a chance for all Canadians 
to reflect with pride on how much we-

continues to be a thorn in the side of all Canadians. The Liberals 
have double-crossed, danced around and window dressed the GST 
to no avail.
<P>
	During this Parliament, government revenues have increased by 
$26 billion a year. The GST only brings in $16 billion a year. This 
proves that the government could have lived up to its promise to 
axe, scrap and abolish the GST. It proves that it could have lived up 
to its commitment without introducing another tax. It demonstrates 
that the Liberal government will take a tax dollar wherever it can 
find it, squeeze it or collect it. The concept of tax relief has never 
crossed its mind.

ruined their lives.
<P>
	Like the boat store owner who has had to lay off 70 per cent of 
his staff because of high taxes. Or the builder who was in dispute 
with GST over the amount owing. Revenue Canada garnisheed 70 
per cent of his net income, forcing him into bankruptcy which has 
led to the loss of his home and the breakup of his marriage. Or the 
young trucker who decided to buy his own truck. However he failed 
to incorporate his business and when he fell behind in his GST 
payments his personal accounts were garnisheed and he and his 
wife, who was six months pregnant, lost their home.

	If only this government would attack its own wasteful spending 
with the same zeal it has gone after the average Canadian taxpayer, 
then maybe we would not have such high unemployment, a record

	Instead of living up to its jobs promise, this government's

<P>
	One thing Canadians are unanimous about is to see some action 
on health care before the election and not to be subjected to a bunch 
more Liberal promises without action.
<P>
	Today the Prime Minister was given the opportunity to act 
through the report of the national health care forum that he set up.
<P>
	Let us see some action on drug prices. Let us see some action on 
establishing a stable core for federal funding. Let us see some 
action on home care. And let us see some action on unemployment, 
which is the major cause of bad health in this country.
<P>
	All these things the Liberals can do before the election. Let us 
see some action.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The inquiry into the events that took place in Somalia has taught 
us a lot about the behaviour of senior officers in the Canadian 
military. But since the minister has decided to have the commission 
wind up its work soon, we will unfortunately not learn the whole 
truth. It must be admitted that the armed forces wasted at least six 
months of the commission's time with the business of documents 
that were falsified, hidden, hunted for, and not found, and now that 
everything needed is available, the minister decides to put a stop to 
the inquiry.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Defence agree that he could very 
well require the commission to produce an interim report on June 
30, allowing him to go ahead with the changes he wants to make, 
and then authorize the commission to continue its work and try to 
find out what really happened in this affair?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no 
doubt that the commission is examining a rather complex matter, 
that being the events that took place in Somalia, what happened 
before the troops were sent on the mission and, obviously, what 
happened after the incidents that took place were discovered, which 
Canadians categorically reject.
<P>
	The only question in my mind, and I hope my hon. colleague will 
understand this, is whether at some point Canadians interested in 
knowing what went on in Somalia would like to have a historical 
document. The commission has been sitting for almost two years. 
We have never commented on the list of witnesses; we have not 
commented on the schedule; the commission of inquiry on Somalia 
was granted three extensions, it was originally supposed to hand in 
its report by the end of December 1995.
<P>
	In my opinion, Canadians are interested in how we are going to 
react in the future, should such incidents happen again. They want 
to be sure that there is not a repetition of all the problems we have 
heard about and discovered during this inquiry.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition is interested in a historical 
document, we in the government are prepared to take action and 
think that the time has come to take steps to learn what the 
commission has done, to evaluate its recommendations and to try 
to do whatever we can to avoid a recurrence of such events.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has several times 
mentioned a historical document, he just did so again. What the 
opposition wants is not a historical document, but the truth about 
what went on. We share his concern-the one he has expressed in 
any event-for seeing that light is shed on this whole affair. We 
want to see changes in the Canadian armed forces; that is what 
everyone wants. Changes are necessary.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	My question is the following: If he wants to take appropriate 
action and take it in the right place, does he not have to have all the 
information? If so, why he is rejecting the extraordinarily 
construc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7656"> 7656 </A></B>
<P>
tive suggestion we are making of requiring an interim report on 
June 30, which would allow him to begin taking the action he 
wishes to take? All the information will be included in the final 
report, as he sees it, allowing the commission of inquiry to deal 
with all the new material that came up during this inquiry, which no 
one had any inkling of at the outset.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this inquiry has 
gone on for almost two years. There is no doubt that those who 
have been following the whole inquiry have no trouble 
understanding that, if we were to go along with the hon. member's 
suggestion that the three commissioners must be satisfied they 
have seen and heard all the witnesses that were to appear, and gone 
into all the details of what went on before, during and after, and that 
all the lawyers representing all the intervenors, that everyone must 
agree that everything was completed, my hon. friend, the Leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois, and I would not live long enough to see the end 
of the affair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has just made an extraordinary revelation: we 
did not know there was so much involved. Imagine what we will 
miss if he wraps up the inquiry on March 31.
<P>
	Seriously though, I am sure that the Minister of National 
Defence will want to reply to this question. A very serious thing 
has occurred: senior officers of the Canadian military blackmailed 
the former defence minister, Mrs. Campbell, who was running for 
the office of Prime Minister at the time. Such a revelation is very 
worrisome, fraught with consequences for institutions like the 
armed forces and Parliament, and for democracy.
<P>
	I put the following question to the minister. Should we not get 
right to the bottom of this affair, so that it does not happen again? 
Listening to the minister's answers, seeing him shift from one idea 
to another, I wonder whether he himself has been the subject of 
threats or pressure from the armed forces.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I very much 
appreciate the Leader of the Opposition's concern as to whether I 
have been threatened by someone. Not lately.
<P>
	I can assure you that I have such respect for my predecessor, who 
went on to become Prime Minister of Canada, that I would not want 
to lend credence to the idea that when a minister arrives in a 
department such as National Defence, everyone can blackmail him 
as simply as the hon. member seems to want us to believe.
<P>
	I think it is relatively easy for those who feel that something is 
not right, that the former Prime Minister is certainly entitled to 
speak out, and as former defence minister as well. I hope that 
everyone understands that, in order to find out what happened and 
whether it was as serious as some people are claiming, all that the 
individual in question has to do is to give their version of events.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister claims not to have been pressured, at least not 
recently, by senior officers in the Armed Forces. We are aware that, 
during her leadership race, former Minister of Defence Kim 
Campbell experienced very heavy pressure, even blackmail, from 
senior ranks to convince her not to go too far with her 
investigations in the Somalia affair.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	How can the minister expect us to believe that he has not been 
pressured as former minister Kim Campbell was, when he suddenly 
changes his tune and quickly puts an end to the work of the 
Commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, all I can do is 
assure my hon. colleague that I have not been threatened at any 
time. No one has tried to scare me, or encourage me to make a 
decision.
<P>
	I would like to remind my friend that, when I assumed my 
position as Minister of National Defence-and this is quite easy to 
verify-I said right from the start, and repeated it numerous times, 
that I hoped the Somalia Inquiry would table its report on March 
31, 1997. I have never changed my mind. From the time I assumed 
my position I have repeated, and repeated frequently, that I hoped 
they would make their report public March 31.
<P>
	Obviously, because an extension was requested, the government 
agreed for the third time to extend the mandate of the Commission 
until the end of June. We thought, however, that this was sufficient 
to get the work done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when he 
appeared before the Commission as a witness last week, the Chief 
of the Defence Staff literally insulted the commissioners and 
prosecutors by attacking their work. This was an obvious attempt to 
discredit the Commission and, according to Justice Létourneau, the 
Chief of the Defense Staff came very close to being cited for 
contempt of court.
<P>
	Is the Minister of National Defence's rush to prevent the 
Commission from hearing more witnesses not the result of pressure 
from the Acting Chief of the Defence Staff, who has had enough of 
watching Armed Forces personnel answer the commissioner's 
questions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have always 
been careful not to comment on the evidence submitted to the 
Commission. I do not believe it would be right.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7657"> 7657 </A></B>
<P>
	I wish to assure my hon. colleague that, given my experience 
as a lawyer, I understand that it is not unheard of for lawyers 
involved in legal proceedings to be a bit difficult when questions 
are being asked. Some are more polite than others. I hope 
everyone understands that. I believe that most Canadians who saw 
Admiral Murray in action understood that this is a man who 
wanted to defend his situation as best he could. All Canadians 
have a right to do so under any circumstances.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICINQUIRIES">PUBLIC INQUIRIES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government has adopted a double standard with 
respect to public inquiries. It was keen to investigate the murder 
and cover-up in Somalia when it thought it was a Tory scandal, but 
as soon as the inquiry started to get close to former deputy minister 
Bob Fowler, the Prime Minister's friend and golfing buddy, all of a 
sudden it lost its enthusiasm.
<P>
	It was okay when Justice Krever's investigation was examining 
Tory complicity with the tainted blood scandal, but when Krever 
wanted to examine why the Liberal government in 1984 ignored 
the early warning signs about tainted blood, the government started 
throwing legal obstacles in his way.
<P>
	How can Canadians trust this government when it has two sets of 
ethical standards, one for Liberals and their friends and the other 
for everybody else?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member referred to my golf buddy. I never played 
golf with him. Perhaps in the middle of the night in January in 
Yellowknife I did, but I do not remember.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence took this matter seriously. We 
had this inquiry for two years and the leader of the third party, as 
the Minister of National Defence yesterday so rightly said, was the 
one pleading with us to terminate that as quickly as possible so that 
we will not have anything to hide by the time of the election.
<P>
	So we are responding. The Minister of National Defence is doing 
his best to fulfil the request by the leader of the third party but the 
leader of the third party has again done a flip-flop.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue here is not parties or statements. The issue here 
is public trust. The thousands of tainted blood victims in the 
country and their families trusted the blood system and it failed 
them. They trusted the government to find out why and now the 
government is failing them. Their trust has been abused.
<P>
	Instead of acting in the best interests of the victims of the blood 
system, the government tried to block Justice Krever in the courts 
and attempted to circumvent his findings with a parallel 
investigation. What is worse, the Prime Minister has now put the 
blood system in the hands of a minister who has already abused the 
public trust over highway funding.
<P>
	Why should tainted blood victims trust this government to fix 
the blood system? Why should they trust a minister who has 
violated the public trust before?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to the preamble of the hon. member's question with 
regard to the blood system in this country. Notwithstanding his 
desire to give the impression to Canadians from coast to coast that 
the blood system somehow lacks the confidence of Canadians, I 
wish to assure the House and Canadians that our blood system does 
have the confidence of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	Finally, I say to the hon. member opposite that if the hon. 
member wishes to put words to action, why does he not have the 
guts to run against me in an election campaign?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It seems today we have taken a few terms in 
anatomy that we are trying to use time and again. I would go to the 
hon. member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister gives an arrogant and an unfeeling answer to 
a question about tainted blood. It is the type of answer that got the 
Prime Minister into all that trouble on the TV town hall meeting. It 
is the type of response that is considered so clever in this House and 
applauded by members opposite but which if repeated outside this 
House to the suffering families of the victims of tainted blood 
would be denounced by every compassionate Canadian as callous, 
unfeeling and-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> When will this minister and this government 
start to respond to the tainted blood tragedy in a way that restores 
public trust rather than destroys it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite forgets that it was this minister and this 
member in opposition who requested and pushed the previous 
government to have an inquiry into the Canadian blood system.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have been trying to work co-operatively with 
provincial governments, consumers and stakeholders across this 
country to put in place a new system which would ensure that the 
past would never happen again.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	I have said privately and I have said publicly, in this House and 
outside this House, that I accept and have acted on all the 
recommendations that the eminent  Justice Krever has made. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7658"> 7658 </A></B>
<P>
look forward to having his report so that we can do follow-up in 
terms of the various measures he wishes to recommend.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder, my colleagues, if I could ask you to 
tighten up a bit on the questions and on the answers.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	By gagging the commission of inquiry on Somalia on very 
questionable grounds, the government is actually challenging the 
independence of the commission and discrediting, in a way that is 
unprecedented, the whole system of commissions of inquiry in this 
country. And in doing so, it prevents the public from ever knowing 
the whole truth about the matter.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whom the government is protecting in 
this case? Its acting chief of staff, vice-admiral Murray; its 
ambassador to the UN, Mr. Fowler; its ambassador to NATO and 
former chief of staff, John Anderson; its senior officials or senior 
ranks within the Department of National Defence or the minister 
himself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is very 
important to realize that the process which has been going on for 
nearly two years will in fact go on until the end of June.
<P>
	I am convinced that the report that will be produced by the 
commissioners will be of the utmost importance to the government 
and to Canadians in general.
<P>
	We have no intention and, in fact, no reason to protect anyone at 
all. We have to make a decision, on behalf of the government, that 
allows us to proceed with changes in the Canadian Forces and the 
Department of National Defence, to ensure that in future they will 
work far more effectively, in a far more acceptable fashion.
<P>
	We are fully aware of the problem that arose in Somalia and of 
what has happened since Somalia. What interests the vast majority 
of Canadians is that we find solutions instead of continuing-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is muzzling the commissioners. It refuses 
to even consider a possible extension. In so doing, it puts witnesses 
in a situation where they can afford to be arrogant, since they know 
that after June 30, everything will be over with.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that by acting this way, he is making a 
gesture without precedent in Canadian history, one that will have 
consequences, because so far, no Canadian government ever denied 
a commission of inquiry an extension of its mandate? How can the 
public be expected to have any confidence in the inquiry system 
from now on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member asked a very good question. Every member of this House 
will at some time have to consider the following: when we appoint 
a commission, are we supposed to let the commission go on 
working in perpetuity?
<P>
	The government has already agreed to three requests for an 
extension of the committee's mandate. In this case, the commission 
was supposed to finish its work by March 30, but it was given an 
extension for the study component until June 30.
<P>
	Even if the hon. member does not understand, Canadians who 
are following the situation understand perfectly well why the 
government made this decision.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of National Defence says that he does not need a full 
report now from the Somalia inquiry because he already knows the 
facts. Since he knows so much about what really happened, will he 
answer this quiz question about these two Liberal patronage 
appointees: former deputy minister Robert Fowler and former chief 
of defence staff John Anderson were involved in a high level 
cover-up in the Somalia affair, true or false?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member yesterday took issue apparently with how I answered some 
of her questions. I just want to make sure that I understand, as we 
continue with this inquiry that she is conducting, whether the hon. 
member wishes to step outside the House and make any allegations 
she may wish to make out there with respect to any alleged 
wrongdoing she may be aware of.
<P>
	I would point out to the hon. member that the deputy minister to 
whom she refers was appointed to that position by the previous 
government. The incidents that occurred in Somalia occurred under 
the previous administration. The appointment to which she refers, 
that of the deputy minister, is certainly not one that was made by 
this government. It was the responsibility eventually, of the person 
who became the Prime Minister of this country in the previous 
administration.

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member might want to consider carefully any 
allegations she may wish to make and to make sure that whatever 
she says in here that she has the intestinal fortitude to say outside.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
Fowler had not been shipped off to the United States we probably 
would not even have needed the Somalia inquiry in the first place.
<P>
	Since the minister obviously cannot say, in that long answer 
when I just asked him for one word, that these two Liberal 
appointees were not involved in a cover-up, and since the minister 
has shut down the inquiry that would have gotten to the bottom of 
this and told us the truth, does the minister not realize that he is 
directly responsible for hiding the truth? How can we trust his 
bravado which is his own real cover-up for bungling?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In posing questions hon. members should not in 
any way impute motive. I would hope that this slant might better 
better worded, the questions might be better worded in future. If the 
hon. minister wants to answer it, I will let him.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us see if we 
can give this a fresh start.
<P>
	Part of the problem we are all grappling with-and I know that 
Eaton's always play an important role in this-they like guarantees 
and it is satisfaction guaranteed or money back at Eaton's. So let us 
see if we can get it straight now.
<P>
	Again referring to <I>Hansard</I>, I want to know if the hon. member 
who just posed this question agrees or not, because she likes yes or 
no answers. Does the hon. member agree with her leader, yes or no, 
that he wanted the Prime Minister of Canada to ensure that there 
was no ultimate cover-up in the Somalia inquiry and that the results 
of the inquiry would be made fully public before the next federal 
election? Or does the hon. member not expect the next federal 
election in this century?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence and the Prime Minister 
promised that the Somalia inquiry would get to the bottom of all 
this. They have once more broken their promise by imposing a 
deadline on the commissioners. The minister tells us there have 
already been three extensions. If the army had not tried to conceal 
the documents, there would have been no need for an extension.
<P>
	By muzzling the commissioners, is the government not 
interfering politically in a judicial process? In other words, is the 
government not acting both as judge and jury in this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I can assure the 
hon. member that, as I see it, when a commission asks for an 
extension the first time, it is okay for the government to say yes. At 
least I hope that was the case.
<P>
	They ask for a second extension, and the government says yes. 
That is entirely above board. It is not interference, and everything 
is okay. They ask for a third extension, and the government says 
yes. But when the government adds: ``However, we want you to 
finish your work by a certain date'', in that case, it is interference.
<P>
	Is it interference when we say no but not when we say yes? If 
that is the case, why ask for an extension in the first place, if it 
should be automatic, according to the hon. member?
<P>
	We must have some logic here. If people ask for an extension, 
they should realize that the answer may be yes or no, or yes with an 
extension but with a deadline set by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister says he granted an extension because he saw 
a number of requests. The commissioners asked for extensions 
because there were a lot of things they did not see. They were 
concealed by the army. Obviously, if there had been no concealing, 
there would have been no request for an extension.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence said a few months ago that he 
wanted to know about everything that happened in Somalia. He 
may have heard some very important news, so important he no 
longer wants to know everything.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	I want to ask the minister whether, when he made his decision, 
he was perhaps thinking about the next election campaign, and 
whether the true intentions of the Minister of National Defence 
were to ensure that what comes out of this report will be only what 
happened under the Conservative government and then to conceal 
from the public what happened under this Liberal administration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, no, this is not 
about trying to conceal or bury anything whatsoever.
<P>
	What is important in my mind, and I hope it is in the minds of 
Canadians, is that we must proceed so as to ensure that the 
Government of Canada takes steps to prevent such situations from 
recurring in future.
<P>
	Regarding what happened in Somalia, the two incidents that 
occurred within a rather short time frame, everyone is aware that 
these elements were very carefully examined by the commission. 
We never required the  commission to follow a schedule set by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7660"> 7660 </A></B>
<P>
government. We refrained from suggesting who should be heard as 
witnesses.
<P>
	When the commission has finished its work, it will be able to 
make recommendations and reach any conclusions it feels 
appropriate, and the government is committed to take these into 
consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have direct 
allegations that Robert Fowler and General Anderson shredded 
important documents relating to the murder investigation of 
Shidane Arone, and that Mr. Fowler did not keep Kim Campbell 
informed during this entire thing. But the Prime Minister protected 
his friends, appointed them to positions outside of the country and 
now he is trying to bury the inquiry before we find the smoking 
gun.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister explain this abuse of trust?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
difficulties is in dealing with this whole area of the inquiry that the 
hon. gentleman is pursuing. I want to make sure that I understand 
because I do not know quite what type of response the hon. 
gentleman wants.
<P>
	In the ethics bible of the Reform Party it says: ``Questions 
should not be used to get straight information''.
<P>
	What I am trying to find out here is: Are you asking straight 
questions or do you want straight answers?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, you will please address all of your 
remarks directly to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
remind the Prime Minister that we asked these questions about Mr. 
Fowler two years ago and then he was hustled off to New York.
<P>
	My business experience says that if you want to rebuild 
something that is not working you start from the top, not from the 
bottom. The problem is the Prime Minister has been protecting the 
people at the top. When things went wrong for the Prime Minister's 
friends in positions of responsibility he shut down the inquiry and 
let the people at the bottom take the blame.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister stop shielding his buddies at the 
top and show some integrity by holding them accountable?

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr.

integrity of his ministers, who obviously goofed in the Airbus 
affair. Perhaps he might be less forgiving of the obvious 
incompetence of the RCMP Commissioner, Philip Murray, who 
took two years to realize that his men were investigating a former 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Everyone agrees that it 
makes no sense for the top man at the RCMP not to be aware of the 
famous letter to Switzerland. Under the circumstances, does the

answer to my hon. friend's question.

I reject the premise of my hon. friend's question because the

	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the minister of Indian affairs. Last November, the royal 
commission on aboriginal peoples issued its final report. The 
commission urges us to end decades of jurisdictional uncertainty 
and deal with aboriginal peoples on a nation to nation basis within 
the Canadian federation.
<P>
	The minister has had two months to study this report. Will he tell 
the House what actions the government has taken toward 
considering the recommendations in the royal commission's final 
report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member has an 
easier question. The royal commission has spent five years with 
many ups and downs. In the end it has created a very scholarly 
report. The commission should be commended. It is a living 
document, a touchstone as has been evidenced by 600 people who 
met in Montreal last week to discuss the pros and cons.
<P>
	We could not wait for the report to be finished during our tenure. 
So many of the things that it recommended in the end we were 
already doing as they were being discussed: inherent right, general 
policy, specific policy, the Inuit Grise Fiord package, the 
contemporary treaty in B.C.
<P>
	I know the Reform Party has no interest in aboriginal affairs. The 
150 tables we had going across the country were interested in what 
happened to royal commissions. This is what happens. There are 
150 tables. This will be a touchstone for our negotiators. It will be a 
light.
<P>
	There are 440 recommendations of which 89 touch us. I hope all 
provinces and territories where they are affected will use that same 
report as a touchstone, as a light to get to do the job better.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by November 
8, 1995 the justice minister knew about the inflammatory contents 
of Kimberly Prost's letter to the Swiss authorities regarding the 
Airbus scandal.
<P>
	At that time the justice minister had the opportunity to withdraw 
the letter and forward a second one, minus the libellous language. 
This would have stopped the $50 million lawsuit and saved the 
taxpayers a $1 million out of court settlement and would not have 
interfered with the RCMP investigation.
<P>
	Why did the justice minister not withdraw the letter immediately 
on learning of its libellous content?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that 
a second letter was sent days after November 8, 1995.
<P>
	A second letter was sent at the request of Mr. Mulroney and his 
solicitors. That letter made clear that the contents of the first letter 
were allegations only, unproven and part of an investigation. I hope 
the hon. member takes that into account when he assesses this 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, anyone who 
is familiar with the file realizes the contents of the second letter, 
and it did not do one single solitary thing about appeasing the 
complainant in this whole matter.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	The justice minister continues to absolve himself of any 
responsibility when clearly it was his irresponsible decision that 
cost the Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars. As soon as the 
justice minister heard of the libellous letter, it was his duty to act 
responsibly.
<P>
	Why did the minister not withdraw the original letter and issue 
his apology immediately? Why did he take over a year and millions 
of taxpayers' dollars to settle this affair? How can the people of 
Canada trust this minister's judgment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is entitled to his 
own opinion but he is not entitled to his own facts.
<P>
	The facts of this letter are clear. Within days of Mr. Mulroney's 
lawyers coming to the department and complaining about the 
language in that letter, a second letter was sent. The first letter had 
already been acted on and was sent, but the second letter made it 
clear that what was said were mere allegations, that no conclusions 
had been reached.
<P>
	The hon. member asks about my responsibility. I made clear 
from the outset that I take responsibility for the Department of 
Justice. The record shows that acting responsibly, I have changed 
the system inside the department.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-46, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual 
offence proceedings), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today in 1997 we are faced with yet another issue which threatens 
sexual offence victims and indeed every woman's confidence in the 
criminal justice system. We must take this opportunity to put the 
progressive reforms of our sexual offence laws back on track. We 
must take the opportunity to craft a law which articulates that both 
the complainant and the accused are worthy of the law's protection. 
Equality before the law and under the law must be more than 
rhetoric. Doing  nothing will only reinforce the status quo which in 
many cases is inequality.
<P>
	I should also point out that other jurisdictions are grappling with 
the same issues. This is not a uniquely Canadian problem. I am 
aware that the production of a variety of personal records of sexual 
offence victims has discouraged reporting and participation of 
victims in virtually all American states, in the United Kingdom, in 
Australia and in New Zealand. The approaches developed or 
proposed in other states to address the issue vary. Some have opted 
for statutory privileges which apply to specific communications 
and records. Others have opted for an application for the hearing 
procedure. What all have in common is the recognition that rights 
to privacy must be accommodated along with the right to full 
answer and defence, and that where records are at stake the accused 
must demonstrate the likely relevance of such records.
<P>
	I believe that our legislative proposals address this complex 
issue in a fair and comprehensive manner. While we have learned 
from the experience of other jurisdictions, the proposals that are 
put forward are very uniquely Canadian.
<P>
	Bill C-46 amendments will significantly improve the situation 
for complainants and witnesses of sexual offences. I emphasize 
that these amendments are indeed a package. There is no quick or 
simple solution.
<P>
	In a nutshell, we are proposing a two stage test for the production 
of records which places the onus on the accused to establish the 
threshold of likely relevance of the records requested.
<P>
	In addition, we are providing guidance to the courts in their 
consideration of the likely relevance by the articulation of several 
insufficient grounds for production. The legislation emphasizes 
that the trial judge must consider the charter rights of both the 
accused and the complainant or witness when determining whether 
to produce the records.
<P>
	Strict procedures must be adhered to when seeking personal 
records. In the event that records are ultimately produced to the 
accused, appropriate safeguards for privacy are available.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	A new form of subpoena for personal records will provide better 
information to the recipient of the subpoena. Important, we have 
included a preamble which explains why these reforms are 
essential and what our intention is as legislators.
<P>
	While the legislation is comprehensive, I emphasize that it does 
not prohibit the production of records. It recognizes that both 
complainants of sexual offences and persons accused of sexual 
offences have rights guaranteed by the charter and that these rights, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7664"> 7664 </A></B>
<P>
while they may  conflict, must be accommodated and reconciled to 
the greatest extent possible.
<P>
	I would like to briefly highlight the key features of Bill C-46, 
worked on and brought forward by the Minister of Justice. I know 
that the legislative committee will carefully review the bill and I 
will be available to respond to any questions it may have in 
addition to questions in this House.
<P>
	As mentioned, Bill C-46 includes a preamble. Until recently a 
preamble was considered quite a unique feature in criminal 
legislation. However, a preamble has proven to be a very effective 
way of Parliament's intention of reforming the law, in identifying 
the mischief that the law seeks to address and in guiding the 
interpretation of the legislation. The preamble in Bill C-46 does all 
this. It reiterates our concern about sexual violence and its impact 
and specifically acknowledges that the compelled production of 
records may deter complainants from reporting to police and/or 
from seeking treatments.
<P>
	It also highlights that the rights guaranteed by our charter are 
guaranteed to all people, be they accused of criminal offences or 
complainants or witnesses in criminal proceedings.
<P>
	Bill C-46 will amend the Criminal Code to provide that in sexual 
offence proceedings all applications by the accused for the 
production of records of a complainant or witness shall be 
determined by the trial judge in accordance with the new law and 
procedure.
<P>
	A justice presiding at the preliminary inquiry will not have 
jurisdiction to determine an application for the production of 
records.
<P>
	The Criminal Code will also set out a definition of records. The 
definition is general: any form of records that contain personal 
information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
In addition, to avoid any disputes about whether a certain type of 
record is included, several specific records are referred to as 
examples. The definition is capable of embracing other types of 
personal records heretofore not sought.
<P>
	Note that the definition specifically excludes records or notes 
made by the police in the course of their investigation or made by 
the crown in preparation of its case. Where personal records are 
sought in sexual offence proceedings, the accused must make an 
application to the trial judge with notice to the crown, the person in 
possession of the records, the record holder, and the complainant. 
This written application must set out the grounds or reasons relied 
upon to establish that the record sought is slightly relevant to an 
issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify.
<P>
	The code will further provide that certain assertions made by the 
accused, unsupported by other information, will not meet the 
threshold of likely relevance which is necessary for a judge to 
review the records. The  amendment will also guide the trial judge 
in determining likely relevance by directing the judge to consider, 
at the initial stage and again at the second stage, the salutary and 
deleterious effects of production on the accused's right to make a 
full answer and defence and on the right to privacy and equality of 
the complainant.
<P>
	Several specific factors must be considered, including the 
probative value of the record, the nature and extent of the 
reasonable expectation of privacy in the record, whether 
production is based on a discriminatory belief or bias and society's 
interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences.
<P>
	It is after this careful consideration that the judge determines 
whether he or she should review the records to determine whether 
they should be produced to the accused. The judge will conduct 
such a review in private. I fully appreciate that even production to 
the judge for the judge's eyes only has a devastating impact on 
complainants. That is why we have drafted a fairly high threshold 
which the accused must meet even before the judge will review the 
records.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	At the second stage the trial judge will conduct the same 
exercise, i.e., determine if the record is likely relevant to an issue at 
trial or the competence of a witnesses to testify, and will consider 
the same factors including the charter rights of both the accused 
and the complainant.
<P>
	This determination is based on the judge's own review of the 
records. It may be clear after such a review that the records are 
absolutely irrelevant. On the other hand the records or some part of 
them in the judge's view may likely be relevant. If so, the records 
will be produced to the accused.
<P>
	Bill C-46 also comprehensively addresses the procedural aspects 
and it provides additional safeguards to protect privacy and the 
equality rights of the complainants.
<P>
	For example, the application must be in writing and must set out 
the specific grounds relied on by the accused for production. Also, 
adequate notice, usually seven days, of the application must be 
provided to the record holder, crown, complainant, or witnesses 
and any person to whom the record relates.
<P>
	A subpoena duces tecum in new form 16.1 must be served on the 
record holder along with the notice of motion. The hearing to 
determine whether the record should be produced to the judge for 
review will be in camera.
<P>
	The complainant or witness, the record holder or any person to 
whom the record relates may appear at the application hearing and 
be heard, but they are not compellable witnesses by the crown or 
defence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7665"> 7665 </A></B>
<P>
	The judge must conduct any review of the records in private. 
The judge must provide reasons for the determination. Where the 
judge orders production to the accused, appropriate conditions on 
production must be considered. A ban on publication applies to 
the contents of the application and all other information at the voir 
dire and the judge's reasons.
<P>
	Specific amendments are also proposed with respect to the 
issuance and form of the subpoena previously mentioned. For 
example, in sexual offence proceedings a subpoena which requests 
a witness to bring anything to court must be in a new form, form 
16.1, which will provide detailed information to the recipients 
regarding their rights and obligations.
<P>
	These changes to the issuance and form of the subpoena are an 
essential part of this package of amendments. Subpoenas are not 
statutory to be pulled from the shelf and served without any 
consideration of whether they should in fact be issued. The code 
already provides a test for determining whether the subpoena 
should be issued. The test is whether a person is likely to give 
material evidence. This is an adequate test and it will remain the 
test.
<P>
	However a subpoena which directs the recipient to bring 
documents or material with them, referred to as a subpoena duces 
tecum, will be in a new form. That form will provide full 
information to the recipient regarding their obligations. They are 
required only to bring the material to court.
<P>
	In sexual offence proceedings where the material requested by 
the subpoena is a record as defined in the Criminal Code, the 
recipient of the subpoena will be informed that the determination 
whether to produce these records must be made by the trial judge at 
the special hearing.
<P>
	These amendments are designed to ensure that record holders 
who receive a subpoena do not assume that because the subpoena 
has been issued by a court official that they must automatically 
hand over the records requested. The records may not be relevant. 
It is up to the trial judge to decide whether anything should be 
produced. The subpoena is simply the mechanism to ensure the 
attendance of a person in court. These records cannot speak for 
themselves and it is the record holder's attendance that is requested 
by the subpoena. The code still requires however that in order to 
issue the subpoena the issuer must be satisfied that the person is 
likely to give material evidence.
<P>
	Some critics of Bill C-46 contend that this legislation is simply a 
knee-jerk reaction to the supreme court's decision last December in 
O'Connor. This is not the case. The trend to seek out personal 
records emerged several years ago and was brought to the attention 
of the Minister of Justice in June 1994 when he met with national 
women's groups.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The minister launched an extensive consultation two years ago 
to fully explore the extent of the problem, its impact on sexual 
offence victims and possible solutions. The consultation process 
has included equality seeking women's groups, victim advocates, 
service providers, the defence bar, crown attorneys and the 
provincial attorneys general. The consultation process began 
before and continued after the supreme court's hearing and 
decision in O'Connor. So these reforms can hardly be said to be a 
simple knee-jerk reaction to that decision.
<P>
	It may be recalled that in response to questions in this House 
over a year ago, the Minister of Justice indicated that he would 
legislate in this area and that he would not necessarily wait for a 
decision in the O'Connor case. In his capacity as the Attorney 
General of Canada, the minister intervened in the O'Connor case 
urging the courts to adopt a higher threshold for the production of 
records to the judge for review and urging other procedural 
protections. But even if the supreme court had completely adopted 
the argument of the federal government, in my view the legislation 
would still have been necessary.
<P>
	The supreme court dealt with the case before it and the issues 
that arose in that particular case. In the consultation process it 
became clear to the Minister of Justice that there were several 
issues and concerns which the O'Connor decision would not 
comprehensively address.
<P>
	While the minister could have pursued legislation before the 
supreme court rendered its decision in O'Connor, the minister 
thought it wise to consider the views of the supreme court. 
Following the release of the decision in O'Connor, the Minister of 
Justice very carefully analysed the judgments in relation to the 
legislative options then under consideration. Again the minister 
consulted with members of the Canadian Bar Association, the 
Criminal Lawyers Association, the Canadian Council of Criminal 
Defence Lawyers, women's groups, sexual assault service 
providers, academics and crown lawyers.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice considered a wide range of views and 
advice. I would note that no single point of view has prevailed to 
the exclusion of any others. The Minister of Justice concluded that 
the legislation was still essential to restore the confidence of the 
people of Canada in the criminal justice system, to ensure that the 
equality guarantees in our charter were reflected in law and in 
practice, and to bring certainty to the law and procedure governing 
the production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	We have the mandate as legislators to craft a law which 
comprehensibly addresses an issue which is having a serious 
impact on victims, particularly women and children. Moreover we 
have a duty to do so rather than to rely on the common law to make 
incremental changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7666"> 7666 </A></B>
<P>
	Some critics of Bill C-46 argue that the legislation steamrolls 
over the supreme court's decision in O'Connor. I do not agree. 
There are many similarities between this bill and the supreme 
court's decision. There are also significant differences. We have 
not set out to codify O'Connor but it has been carefully considered 
along with all of the other factors considered in crafting 
amendments.
<P>
	I do not intend to respond to every anticipated criticism of this 
legislation. The legislative committee process will provide another 
opportunity for careful consideration of these amendments. 
However I would like to address one other concern.
<P>
	Some critics contend that the proposed amendments which 
require the accused to establish the likely relevance of the records 
and which set out several assertions which on their own, in other 
words without any supporting information, are not sufficient to 
justify the likely relevance of criteria, place the accused in a catch 
22 bind. They argue that the accused may not be able to establish 
how the records are likely relevant because he does not know what 
information is in the records. I do not accept this supposed catch 22 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	First of all, if the law does not impose a threshold of likely 
relevance on the production of records, then it would be open 
season on records. They would be simply available for the asking 
or requesting.
<P>
	If an accused does in fact have a defence to the charges, for 
example if he did not have any contact with the complainant, if he 
believes the complainant consented and if the incident did not 
happen, then he may pursue that in a defence in the appropriate 
manner. But the accused should not have carte blanche to peruse 
records in search of a defence in the form of impeaching the 
complainant's character or credibility or by intimidating the 
complainant to such an extent that charges are withdrawn. I would 
also point out that we are talking about personal records which 
have been made by third parties, counsellors, teachers, doctors; 
third parties that have no obligation to provide these records to the 
accused.
<P>
	This legislation only deals with the production of records. An 
accused cannot plunder through irrelevant personal records for 
titbits of information which can either be exploited or unhelpful, 
safely ignored. But nothing prevents the accused from calling as a 
witness a person who has material evidence and asking relevant 
questions.
<P>
	As I indicated, the legislation sets out several assertions which 
the accused cannot rely on to establish the likely relevance of the 
records. The need for articulating these insufficient assertions was 
highlighted in the consultation process and goes right to the heart 
of why these amendments are necessary. The accused will not 
satisfy  the likely relevance threshold for production to the trial 
judge for review by setting out any unsupported assertions of why 
the records are or may be relevant. The accused must establish how 
or why the records are likely relevant to an issue at trial. In some 
cases this may require the defence to reveal information pertaining 
to the proposed conduct of the defence.
<P>
	In addition to the general requirement of likely relevance, the 
code will clarify that any one or combination of unsupported 
assertions will not meet the test. For example the accused cannot 
simply state that the records should be produced because records 
about the complainant exist, or that they may disclose a prior 
inconsistent statement, or they may relate to the credibility of the 
complainant or witness, or may reveal allegations of sexual abuse 
by others.
<P>
	The articulation of insufficient grounds or assertions is intended 
to ensure that speculation will not found an application for records. 
Fishing expeditions will not be condoned by our law and neither 
should they be. If the legislation permitted an accused to guess why 
records may be relevant, then in every case records would be 
produced and this legislation would have accomplished nothing.
<P>
	But note that these assertions are not impermissible per se where 
the accused can offer some support for the assertion. For example if 
the accused can establish to the satisfaction of the trial judge that 
the records are likely relevant because they do in fact disclose a 
prior inconsistent statement, the trial judge may determine that the 
records should be reviewed.
<P>
	This legislation responds to a situation which threatens the 
confidence of the people of Canada, particularly women and 
children, in our criminal justice system and it responds in a fair and 
focused way. The legislation applies only in sexual offence 
proceedings. The legislation does not sacrifice the rights of the 
accused to benefit the victim, nor is it my intention nor the 
intention of the minister, nor is it the desire or the intention of 
victims to do this. Our intention is to ensure that the law protects 
equally all those who rely upon it.
<P>
	The essence of the amendments I have described is that 
applications for personal records of complainants and witnesses in 
sexual offence proceedings must be carefully scrutinized by the 
trial judge. I am not suggesting that this will be a simple or speedy 
task for trial judges but it is a necessary task.
<P>
	The amendments will not prohibit the production of records. 
Rather the amendments set out the test to determine whether and to 
what extent production should be ordered and to guide the courts in 
applying that test, requiring the courts to consider and balance the 
competing charter interests at both stages.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	An accused person who can establish the need for relevant 
information in the records in accordance with the law and 
procedure will not be denied the records. The right to a full answer 
and defence has not been sacrificed.
<P>
	The personal commitment of the Minister of Justice is to 
continue to examine the laws of Canada to ensure that they 
effectively protect the people of Canada and that they reflect 
fairness and balance in responding to the needs and concerns of all 
Canadians. This commitment is shared by all members of the 
government. Bill C-46 is yet another example of this commitment.
<P>
	Bill C-46 is indeed another example of the tremendous 
achievement of the Minister of Justice to put forth real solutions to 
real problems. In the history of this Parliament it can be said with 
safety that no more significant amendments have been made to the 
criminal justice system to make our streets and homes safer than 
those which have been introduced by this Minister of Justice. In 
this regard I am very proud to offer my support to this legislation 
and I encourage others to do the same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of the official opposition and to address 
Bill C-46, an act to amend the Criminal Code, particularly as 
regards the production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	Incidentally, the 35th Parliament will probably go down in 
history as the one during which the largest number of criminal 
issues were dealt with. A large number of bills have been on the 
House agenda, and the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs has been particularly busy throughout this Parliament, and 
it seems that it will continue to be until the end. I do not think there 
was a need to speed up things in every case. In some cases yes, but 
not all the time.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River just made 
a speech in which he was already referring to Bill C-46 as an 
achievement for the government. Let us not rush things. We are 
currently building the foundations of a bill, and I take the hon. 
member's word to the effect that this bill will be thoroughly 
reviewed by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. 
I do hope this exercise will not be conducted hastily, as has been 
the case with certain bills in recent months.
<P>
	That having been said, Bill C-46 includes some interesting and 
valuable provisions, as well as others that may be more 
questionable or that raise concerns. The witnesses who will appear 
before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will 
shed light on these, so that we can deal with them accordingly.
<P>
	Restricting the disclosure of some files to the defence and, 
consequently, to the person accused of a criminal offence of a 
sexual nature that often involves a woman or a child, is a laudable 
principle.
<P>
	The hon. member said earlier that this bill does not in any way 
violate the constitutional rights of the person accused. At first 
glance, I have doubts about this, because the act includes a 
preamble with seven whereases before we get to the following: 
``Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and 
House of Commons of Canada-''.
<P>
	When the government includes such whereases in a bill, it is 
because it thinks the legislation does not meet the Oakes test. The 
restrictions contained in this bill have no justification in a free and 
democratic society. It seems, at first glance, that they will have to 
be justified before the courts, since there are probably grounds for a 
charter challenge.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	However, the possibility of a charter challenge is not grounds 
enough to prevent our legislating. I would say that the likely 
success of a charter challenge should be a much more serious 
caution. In my opinion, however, the mere possibility must not 
preclude the examination of legislation.
<P>
	In order to better understand Bill C-46, let us draw a parallel 
with the situation when rape was a criminal offence. The term we 
use now is ``sexual assault''.
<P>
	For a long time in Canada, when rape was defined as a criminal 
offence and an offence related to the commission of a sexual act, 
the victim's past was open to all and sundry. At a rape trial, it was 
not clear whether the accused or the victim in the witness box 
should be responding to the accusations from the way they were 
going after the victim's past. Quite simply, in an effort to cast doubt 
in the minds of the jury, to colour the victim's testimony, the 
victim's sexual history was scrutinized in an effort to discredit her 
testimony and to show that she had had numerous or bizarre 
experiences, according to the customs of the time. Regardless, they 
hit into the victim, regardless of the ultimate intent. In many cases, 
the ultimate intent for the defence was to cast doubt in the mind of 
the jury or of the judge, if the trial was before the judge alone.
<P>
	The legislator changed the situation in somewhat the same way 
Bill C-46 is attempting to do. If, during a trial for sexual assault, 
the victim is to be questioned on her earlier sex life to find out 
whether, for example, as we used to put it, she was previously of 
chaste character, the course of the questioning must be presented to 
the judge in a voir dire.
<P>
	Before the jury is allowed to hear the evidence on the victim's 
past, the judge is entitled to know exactly what link the defence 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7668"> 7668 </A></B>
<P>
thinks it can establish, not to simply  imply that the victim who 
may have behaved in a certain way had no credibility.
<P>
	Through Bill C-46, a norm is set. Before an accused can seek 
production of personal records that may be in the hands of a 
psychiatrist, a member of the medical establishment, teachers or 
guidance counsellors, and even the production of personal diaries 
that may be in the hands of a complainant, he or she will first have 
to convince the judge that this evidence is likely to be relevant to 
the trial.
<P>
	The accused will have to demonstrate to the judge, who will be 
sitting without a jury and conducting a hearing very similar to a 
voir dire, that this evidence will convincingly raise a reasonable 
doubt. The first time around, the accused will be required to back 
up the grounds for making an application, and the judge will hear 
this application in camera. The complainant could be heard. I read 
the bill to mean that the accused could be heard as well.
<P>
	We have reached here a breaking point, a cut-off point between 
the rights of the victim and those of the accused, who is entitled to a 
full defence.
<P>
	One can wonder how, without having reviewed records such as 
those being requested, the accused can be expected to prepare an 
application and make sufficiently detailed allegations to convince a 
judge of the relevancy of presenting the evidence.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	This is an issue that will be very difficult to resolve. Perhaps we 
will manage to find both a positive and a clever solution that 
respects the rights of both parties, because, in law as in every other 
area, matter is neither lost nor created. What you gain on one side 
you lose on the other. The balance on which the economics of our 
entire criminal law rests must be maintained.
<P>
	Regarding the evidence that may be disclosed at trial, for the 
jury's information or for the presiding judge to review, Bill C-46 
seeks to ensure and give us the assurance that they will be relevant 
and pertain to the issue at trial.
<P>
	I noted in passing that this is the only case where the accused is 
required to use this procedure, i.e. make a voir dire type of 
application for the production of such records. This is specified in 
clause 278.3(2), which reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, an application under subsection (1) may not be made to a 
judge or justice presiding at any other proceedings, including a preliminary inquiry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What about the accused who wishes, at the preliminary hearing 
stage, to submit to voluntary examination and plead on voluntary 
examination to have charges against him dropped for total want of 
evidence, I wonder? Is he precluded from serving subpoenas on 
those who have possession of these documents? This is a matter for 
the  Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to look into.
<P>
	At the preliminary investigation and voluntary examination 
stage, assuming the person charged agrees to such a voluntary 
examination, given its explicit conditions, will the person be 
deprived of certain means of defence? If we seek to deprive that 
person of certain means of defence, again we are possibly violating 
the guarantees provided during a full defence.
<P>
	And what happens if the documents are in the hands of the 
Crown, a third party, a member of the medical profession, or a 
psychiatrist? Is the Crown, given the Supreme Court decision in the 
Stinchcombe case, not required to make these documents available 
to the defence? This is another issue which the committee will have 
to look at.
<P>
	These are measures which may sound appealing, but which have 
to be taken carefully, in small doses, because they have an impact 
on the fundamental rule of justice in our legal system, a system that 
includes the Criminal Code of Canada, the civil code of the 
Province of Quebec and the municipal codes in the various 
provinces, which are the cornerstones of our whole legal system. 
When these cornerstones are altered, our whole legal system is 
affected.
<P>
	The civil code reform took place over a number of decades in 
Quebec, beginning in the fifties. In fact, the process had started 
long before with the Pérodeau act, in 1915, the Dorion report, in 
1931, and then the change regarding the rights of married women 
in civil matters, in 1954. All this took several decades. The changes 
were not imposed overnight.
<P>
	The people of Canada-and the people of Quebec in the case of 
that province's civil law, know what their legal system is based on. 
A civil code and a criminal code are basic documents in our 
society, just as the Holy Scriptures are fundamental to religion.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We should not rewrite the Scriptures every two or three years. It 
is a genuine document. We do have various translations and, from 
time to time, exegetes who provide a new interpretation, but we 
always come back to the same text. The Scriptures are made more 
meaningful because they have never been rewritten. Apocrypha are 
dismissed because they do not meet the same authenticity 
standards as the Scriptures, as we know them.
<P>
	This little digression was meant to show you that the basic 
instruments in our legal system should not change too much or too 
often. Let me loop the loop I started at the beginning of my speech, 
when I said that we have passed too many pieces of criminal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7669"> 7669 </A></B>
<P>
legislation during this Parliament: the people subject to trial, the 
solicitors, the lawyers and probably many judges no longer know 
what the law is any more. Yet, one basic requirement for a society 
like ours based on the rule of law, under the 1982  Constitutional 
Act, is that those who are subject to the law of the land must know 
what the law says, which is why our basic laws like the Criminal 
Code should not change too often or according to the whims of 
those in power who, for some reason, maybe because of some 
pressure from a lobby group, may decide to make changes.
<P>
	So this bill will have to be examined thoroughly in order to 
weigh the ins and outs of the proposed reform. At first blush, its 
intentions appear laudable, there is no doubt. But if we were to ask 
Canadians, whom the justice system is there to serve, to name one 
of the important rules of criminal law, they would probably 
immediately mention the presumption of innocence, without any 
prodding whatsoever. An accused cannot be presumed guilty; he is 
even entitled to remain silent, to remain seated during his trial and 
say nothing.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Supreme Court and even the Privy Council 
have had to make this point again on several occasions, overturning 
juries' verdicts when crown prosecutors went too far with their 
arguments from time to time, or when judges overstepped the 
bounds, because it is not even permitted to comment on an 
accused's silence, if he decides not to present a defence. When the 
crown has finished presenting its evidence, and the accused does 
not rise, the next step is arguments, and neither the crown 
prosecutor nor the judge may comment on the accused's silence; he 
is entitled to remain silent. This is one of the key principles of our 
criminal justice system and, for once I agree with many colleagues 
in this House, a system which compares very favourably with 
criminal law systems in other countries.
<P>
	We now realize that, with Bill C-46, we are going to oblige the 
accused to present evidence, obviously not before a jury, just 
before a judge, showing that certain elements of evidence are 
relevant to his defence in order to be able to produce them later on.
<P>
	In certain cases, the accused will be forced to speak and to reveal 
part of his strategy because, in a trial, there is the element of 
strategy. This may lead the crown to say: ``If that is the defence 
they are preparing, I will adjust my evidence accordingly''.
<P>
	The accused's right to silence is, of course, affected by this bill. 
Although not in itself grounds to oppose this bill, this is a reason to 
ask whether we are affecting basic rights which have taken 
hundreds of years to become established in our British system of 
criminal law.
<P>
	We must not, in the space of a single legislative session, 
demolish piece by piece, without truly really realizing what we are 
taking away, what we are changing, values which have been 
unanimously acknowledged by our forefathers and are the 
fundamental guarantee of our democratic freedoms, deemed so 
important that they were entrenched in the 1982 Constitution, 
particularly, but not exclusively, in sections 7 through 15.
<P>
	The official opposition will, with an open mind, give its 
agreement in principle to the adoption of this bill on second 
reading.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	In doing so, however, we wish to make it known that we will be 
keeping a watchful eye in committee in order to ensure that, in its 
guidelines and in its practical application, our system of criminal 
law, the envy of a number of nations, remains a system that 
continues to be the envy of many countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to speak for a few minutes to Bill C-46. Bill C-46 will 
amend the Criminal Code. It deals with the specific issue of the 
production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to ensure that counsel for the accused 
and the accused would only be permitted access to a complainant's 
or a witness' personal records under very specific and very 
restricted conditions, thereby better protecting the privacy rights of 
complainants and witnesses.
<P>
	As my colleague from the Bloc has just pointed out, there has 
been a longstanding tradition in the British legal system that 
accused persons should have the opportunity to make a full and fair 
defence to any charges that are brought against them. This element 
of our legal system is something that has been abused, sometimes 
both ways. Sometimes, especially in sexual offence proceedings, 
there have been some real accusations and concerns about accused 
persons and their counsel poking into the private affairs, papers, 
writings, diaries and journals of sexual assault victims to see 
whether something can be dredged up whereby the accused or their 
counsel might impugn the credibility of the alleged victim. That 
has been seen as a real abuse. On the other hand, there have 
certainly been instances where complaints that sexual offences 
have taken place have been brought fallaciously, frivolously, with 
malice, for reasons of revenge, personal advantage or, in some 
instances, due to something called false memory syndrome.
<P>
	We have two very competing interests. We have genuine victims 
of sexual offences needing to be protected from being further 
invaded, further outraged and further violated by having their 
personal lives, records, writings and intimate thoughts dredged up 
and chewed over in public simply for the purpose of putting 
forward some defence on the part of an accused person who has 
genuinely been an offender and who has violated the rights and the 
safety of that individual. On the other hand, there are some persons 
in our society who have been accused of sexual offences wrongful-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7670"> 7670 </A></B>
<P>
ly and maliciously, without any justification, who genuinely  must 
be entitled to all the resources available to clear his or her name.
<P>
	When we deal with those competing interests and when 
legislation seeks to make some adjustments in the balance between 
those competing interests, the question we must ask as legislators 
is whether the balance that is being changed or rebalanced in the 
legislation is appropriate and fair, and does it genuinely address in 
an appropriate way these two competing interests.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Government members opposite will I am sure be pleased to 
know that I and my colleagues do approve of the balance that has 
been reached in Bill C-46 to some extent. We make that approval 
contingent on further examination of these provisions. We feel that 
there will be a further and more detailed examination of this 
legislation in committee, that there will be witnesses and those 
interested particularly and expert in these areas who will be 
bringing forth further considerations on this. I think at that point all 
members of the House can make a better judgment as to the 
adequacy of this legislation.
<P>
	I think there has been some abuse of the protections and the 
rights of accused people to further go on fishing expeditions and 
dredging the personal lives of genuine victims. That has been a real 
concern. On balance we feel that this is legitimately an issue that 
should be addressed by government and at this point I think the 
government is moving in the right direction.
<P>
	However, there will be other considerations coming forward as 
the bill is debated, as the bill is examined in committee and as we 
look a bit more closely at some of the ramifications of this bill.
<P>
	The bill will change the situation with respect to the production 
of a complainant's private records. I should say that these records 
include medical records, therapeutic records, where a complainant 
has undergone therapy in the past. This is particularly relevant to a 
complainant who may have come out of therapy claiming some 
renewed or suddenly discovered memory of abuse or assault, which 
of course has led to some real concerns in what is now called false 
memory syndrome. Those records of therapy could be extremely 
pertinent.
<P>
	They also would refer to counselling records, to psychiatric 
records, to children's aid society records, to school records, 
employment records and, as I have said, personal diaries and 
journals.
<P>
	In order for any of these records to be produced the accused will 
now have to satisfy a two stage process in order to obtain the 
production of these records. First, the accused will have to satisfy a 
judge in an in camera session, a private session in the judge's 
chambers. The judge will have to be satisfied that the records being 
sought will likely be relevant to an issue at the trial or to the 
competence of a witness to testify. Therefore all things considered, 
a judge must say yes, the accused  needs, is entitled to and it is 
appropriate that the accused has access to this information in order 
to make a full and fair defence.
<P>
	In this hearing, although both parties will have an opportunity to 
oppose or promote the application, this will be done in a private 
hearing so that the privacy and the personal life of complainants 
will be protected.
<P>
	Again, it is important to point out that not all complainants are 
true victims. We do have to be careful that just because a man, 
woman or child comes forward complaining of having been 
sexually offended or assaulted that does not necessarily mean, and 
that is the whole reason we have trials and the court system, that the 
person is a victim. In fact, they may be making a victim of the 
person they are accusing and so we need to be very careful about 
that.
<P>
	There is opportunity for that kind of application for records 
relating to an alleged victim to be held in privacy. There is a 
protection there in the act because section 278 requires a judge to 
provide reasons for any order that he or she might make coming out 
of that hearing.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This provides some degree of accountability for the judge's 
action because that would allow further feedback by the victim or 
other third parties and, of course, an appeal of the decision of the 
judge, although this drags out the proceedings even more. I must 
say that a lot of Canadians are pretty frustrated that court 
proceedings are so lengthy. That is the first stage of the process.
<P>
	If the judge decides that the accused has met this requirement, in 
other words if the accused shows that this information is relevant to 
a defence of the accused person, the judge will order the production 
of those records.
<P>
	The judge will review those records. The judge will then 
determine whether, in his or her view, the documents are 
appropriate and are necessary for the accused to make a full answer 
in defence of the complaints against him or her.
<P>
	The judge's discretion must balance the witness' or 
complainant's right to privacy against the accused person's right to 
make a full defence.
<P>
	One of the concerns I suspect will come forward in committee 
and from witnesses is a certain and increasing lack of confidence, it 
is fair to say, by the public in the discretion of the judiciary.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues who intend to speak to this bill will bring 
out some of the incredible decisions, the incredibly unreasonable 
and unjust, at least to a lay person observing, decisions by judges, 
by the bench, when it comes to handling this whole difficult matter 
of victims, victim rights and the rights of accused persons.
<P>
	There will be concern about the kind of discretion that is placed 
with judges. Yet that has been the way our  judicial system has 
worked for centuries in the British common law system. If we feel 
that the discretion of judges is not being exercised appropriately, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7671"> 7671 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps there are better ways to address that than simply to remove 
that discretion from the bench.
<P>
	In any event, it will be for the judge to review the material to 
make a finding, a determination of whether that material is relevant 
to the defence and then say whether it should be brought forward 
and used in the trial of the case.
<P>
	To sum it up, any opposition to this legislation will come 
because of its potential effect on the right of the accused to a full 
and fair defence. Those are legitimate concerns. They have to be 
taken very carefully.
<P>
	The way this is intended to work, if judges are open, if their 
discretion is fair and reasonable, the balance should be kept quite 
well. Judges must actually give reasons for their decision in these 
matters, even though the hearings are in private, and provide some 
measure of openness and public scrutiny of this discretion.
<P>
	There is a very important principle of our legal system that 
justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done. 
Therefore the less we have these decisions made behind closed 
doors and in a hidden and unchallengeable way, the better. We 
would want to make sure that does not happen.
<P>
	We want to ensure that we protect the right and privacy of 
complainants, many of whom have already suffered incredible 
violation and abrogation of their rights to safety and to privacy.
<P>
	Many victims of sexual assault, male and female, simply refuse 
to come forward because the last thing they need is to suffer more 
personal trauma, more publicity, more invasion of their emotional 
well-being. They choose simply to try to put the pieces back 
together in private rather than come forward. We know that this is a 
real problem but we also must ensure that justice is not 
compromised.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the 
punishment of crime, the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property ahead of all other objectives. We promote a greater 
emphasis on assisting true victims of crime.
<P>
	It is important we recognize that not everyone who makes an 
accusation is really a victim, but we also need to recognize that a 
great number of people have suffered incredible amounts of harm, 
hurt, terror, pain and suffering and an invasion of their personal 
safety in these sorts of cases. Extra protection for these persons 
who have been genuinely sexually offended or who may have to 
testify in these cases is something that we need to move toward if 
we can do that in a fair and balanced way.
<P>
	The accused, through their counsel, will have to satisfy some 
additional process in order to obtain private and sensitive 
information relating to a victim or a witness. If on further study and 
examination it is found that there are sufficient checks and balances 
to achieve that objective, then Reform would be supporting this in 
the final reading.
<P>
	It is fair to say that we do need to take seriously as legislators, as 
the government of this country, the need to genuinely protect the 
vulnerable and the people who do not feel safe in our society. We 
have just had a case brought forward of young men in sports who 
have been victims of sexual assault and sexual activity which was 
very destructive to them. Yet there seemed to be very little redress, 
very little protection, for these individuals.
<P>
	As we know, there have been some very difficult cases as 
legislators, as members of Parliament and as elected 
representatives. I am sure most of us, as have I, have had citizens in 
their offices frightened and terrified of a potential threat of harm to 
themselves or to members of their family and simply saying where 
is the protection, what can be done to make us feel safe. Even in the 
court system there are victims who do not feel safe.
<P>
	We have an application being made by Clifford Olson under 
section 745. He will have the right to examine and to gain evidence 
from the families of his victims. These are the kinds of very serious 
measures that lead legislators to try to rebalance the situation as 
much as possible. Citizens who have already been victims of crime 
and of personal assault should not have to look forward to every 
nook and cranny of their personal and private lives being pawed 
over and dredged up by people who have already caused them 
untold pain and untold grief and untold terror. That I think is the 
evil that is sought to be addressed in this legislation.
<P>
	We want to make sure it does not create a greater evil where 
everyone accused is simply assumed to be guilty and does not have 
the tools or the fair legal system to defend themselves. It is really 
heartbreaking for me and for others I am sure to have to deal with 
families that say they knew that their loved one was in danger. ``I 
am afraid to go out on the street. I have to hide my phone number 
and keep changing it because I know that this individual who has 
already sexually offended against me is out there, but I do not want 
to have to go through the court system''.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	These are difficult issues. I tried to get statistics about how many 
citizens this involves in my own city of Calgary. There were over 
700 sexual offences, sex related assaults, in the city of Calgary last 
year alone. Unfortunately the statistics range from unwanted 
touching, what we consider a less serious assault, although not 
something to take lightly, to serious sexual assaults against women, 
children and men.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7672"> 7672 </A></B>
<P>
	As one of my colleagues said earlier when talking on another 
bill, the reason we have government, the reason we ban together 
as a society and put up with the invasion of organized government 
in our lives and certainly in our pocketbooks is in return we expect 
to have our lives and property protected and, to some extent, some 
measures of corporate well-being centrally administered.
<P>
	In many instances our justice system has not preserved the lives 
and well-being of our citizens. These are serious matters. There is a 
serious lapse in the responsibility of government which we need to 
address with reasonable measures, well balanced measures and fair 
measures, measures that continue to assure the citizens of this 
country that they will have justice, that there will be fairness when 
they are accused and also that there will be fairness and protection 
when they have been violated and harmed by lawless people.
<P>
	At this point the Reform members believe that, on balance, this 
is a good piece of legislation. It is something which we would 
consider supporting. We will be very interested to hear the debates 
in the House because we want to make a good decision on this bill. 
We will very closely follow it in committee and listen to the 
witnesses. We hope that at the end of the day this will achieve the 
goal of better protection for genuine victims of sexual offences 
while at the same time not crossing the line of being unfair or 
unjust to persons who are wrongfully and inappropriately accused.
<P>
	It is a tough balance to achieve. However, as legislators that is 
what we are called on to do, to balance competing interests in a fair, 
intelligent and workable manner. It is not easy, but that is what we 
get the big bucks for. I hope that we do a good job for all the 
citizens of our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not normally track justice legislation or comment on 
justice bills. However, I am going to comment on Bill C-46 for a 
very specific reason which I hope members opposite will listen to.
<P>
	About five weeks ago a man and his wife came to my 
constituency office. He is in his seventies and she would be about 
the same age. They are well known in the town that I live in as 
upstanding people, members of the church and so on and so forth. 
They told an incredible story. Apparently their daughter, who was 
then in her fifties, had been subject for very many years to 
depression every now and then. In fact, it probably cost her her 
marriage. About three years ago she started going to a therapist for 
her depression.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	It turns out that the therapist discovered that she had been 
seriously sexually abused as a child, complete with satanic rights 
and the whole thing. She had no recollection of these incidents until 
she went to the therapist. They involved the father. The elderly 
couple sat in my office and the wife was in tears because this  
woman, in her fifties, had taken the results of her memories, which 
were vivid, to the police. She could tell chapter and book how her 
father abused her.
<P>
	The reason why the old couple were upset and why they came to 
my office is that they heard that Bill C-46 had been introduced into 
the House of Commons. They asked me to look at it carefully so I 
have.
<P>
	I first looked at this phenomenon that was mentioned by my 
colleague from Calgary North called repressed memory syndrome. 
This is apparently what was the case with respect to this daughter. 
She went to a therapist. According to psychological theory, when a 
child has a very traumatic experience he or she can suppress that 
experience and bury it in memory. The therapist, many years later 
during the therapeutic sessions and in probing the past of the client, 
suddenly encounters these memories and brings them to the 
surface. That is called repressed memory syndrome.
<P>
	In the past 10 years or so approximately 800 people have been 
convicted in North America on the basis of repressed memories 
that have been brought back to the surface by therapists. They have 
been convicted of very serious crimes usually involving sexual 
abuse. They have gone to jail solely on the evidence of these people 
who had no recollection of these crimes against them as children 
but suddenly found vivid memories when they were treated by 
therapists.
<P>
	In the past few years the medical authorities in Canada and the 
United States have come to recognize that there seems to be a very 
strong probability that many of these repressed memories are not 
memories at all but are induced by the therapist. Indeed, just a year 
ago the Canadian Psychiatric Association came out with a position 
paper in which it stated that developmental psychology casts doubt 
on the reliability of recovered memories from early childhood. 
Reports of recovered memories of sexual abuse may be true but 
great caution should be exercised before accepting them in the 
absence of solid corroboration.
<P>
	Naturally I began to do some research. I had another case just in 
the past year and a half about a B.C. lawyer in Victoria. I will not 
give his name because I am sure he suffered quite enough. He is a 
man in his late forties. Suddenly out of the blue he was accused by 
a cousin of abusing her when she was only eight years old. It was a 
case of her being subject to bulimia and having emotional 
problems. As the information came out in the courts, she went to a 
therapist and found that she remembered all kinds of things 
involving sexual abuse, satanic rituals and all those kinds of things.
<P>
	This man was convicted in B.C. court of doing this. The court of 
appeal, however, just a year ago overturned the conviction on the 
grounds that the original trial judge chose to accept some of the 
information that she reported from the therapist and not other 
information. In other words, her memories were so elaborate that 
the  original trial judge felt that he could only accept some of them. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7673"> 7673 </A></B>
<P>
The court of appeal said that the original judge could not be 
selective like that, overturned the case and called for a new trial.
<P>
	Added to that, in this particular case there were other witnesses 
who came forward who also recalled this lawyer having engaged in 
sexual abuse, satanic rituals, burying a cat in the garden and those 
kinds of things. They had also undergone this therapy.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	When the authorities actually tried to establish the facts of the 
case, to actually dig in the garden where the ritually executed cats 
had been buried, they found nothing. The court of appeal found that 
the case against this man relied solely on the very elaborate and 
exaggerated testimony of this woman based on memories that had 
been brought forward by her visits to the therapist.
<P>
	I come to Bill C-46. I hope that all my colleagues will listen very 
carefully to what I have to say. If Bill C-46 goes forward as 
currently written, the two examples I cite, the couple who came to 
see me just in the last five weeks and this lawyer in B.C. would not 
have the opportunity to bring forward evidence of the therapy that 
the accuser underwent.
<P>
	Section 278.3(4) says that if the accused wants records he must 
apply to the trial judge. Even before the trial judge can demand 
those records, according to the legislation the trial judge is not 
allowed to consider that the record being asked for by the accused 
relates to the medical or psychiatric treatment, therapy or 
counselling that the complainant has received or is receiving.
<P>
	This legislation makes it impossible for the accused to get the 
relevant records or even discover the relevant records in a case of 
false memory syndrome.
<P>
	The member for Calgary North put a lot of reliance in her 
remarks on the discretion of judges. I was very interested in her 
remarks. However, the problem is that the legislation does not give 
judges discretion. The legislation shuts the judge out of actually 
requesting the records that are relevant to the accused.
<P>
	Let me just elaborate on that point a bit. I am going to repeat just 
a little bit. One must understand that the accused when he seeks the 
records has to apply to the judge, but the judge cannot agree to 
order the records on certain grounds. Listen to this. It is not 
grounds for the judge to ask for the record for the simple reason 
that the record exists. Just as an example, if one is accused as a 
result of false memory syndrome and one knows that the records 
exist, that is not good enough reason to ask for the records.
<P>
	Second, it is not grounds to ask the judge to demand the records 
if the records relate to medical therapy. We have already dealt with 
that. If the complainant has undergone that therapy the accused is 
not allowed to obtain those records in defence.
<P>
	Furthermore if the record relates to the reliability of the 
testimony of the complainant, that is also not reason to ask for the 
records. In other words, the judge cannot use that as grounds to 
demand the records.
<P>
	Where someone is falsely accused by someone who has suffered 
from depression, the very essence of the defence is to question the 
reliability. But if the records cannot be obtained that demonstrate 
the person's reliability or lack of reliability, one cannot defend 
adequately. It is a major problem.
<P>
	The judge is not allowed to seek records on the request of the 
accused if the record may reveal allegations of sexual abuse of the 
complainant by a person other than the accused. It is certainly not 
beyond the realm of possibility that a person who is basically sick 
has probably made accusations of sexual abuse against many 
people.
<P>
	If there was a situation where as a result of therapy or 
counselling that a person disclosed they had been abused, not just 
by the father but by the cousin, the uncle and the brother, it would 
be very relevant information to appear at trial.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I stress that the accused is not allowed to know about this 
information because the judge cannot tell whether the information 
exists or does not exist. The judge cannot seek the information, 
cannot seek the records. We have to be very concerned about that 
clause in the legislation. We need to be very worried about it.
<P>
	The problem is this. The situation with false memory syndrome 
is that the testimony of recovered memory through therapy has 
become widely discredited in the United States. All kinds of people 
who have been convicted on these charges are now being released 
from prison. It is recognized that it is not a very reliable source of 
testimony. Moreover, some states in the United States will not 
allow a prosecution based on recovered memories. However, the 
situation we will have in Canada in this legislation is that we are 
going in the opposite direction.
<P>
	If this legislation goes through as presently drafted we will make 
it so easy, so possible, so absolute for people to make these charges 
based on what we think is false memory. In many instances, it is 
false memory. In fact, there was a study done in the United States 
which found that the majority of the instances were fabricated 
recollections.
<P>
	This legislation, if it goes through as it stands, will send innocent 
people to jail, including my elderly couple. The reason they came 
before me was because he is afraid of being charged after this bill 
passes. He will not be able to defend himself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7674"> 7674 </A></B>
<P>
	I laud the intention of this legislation. I appreciate that we must 
do whatever we can do to protect the rights of the victim and to 
not require people to appear before the courts to disclose intimate 
details of their lives for frivolous or trivial reasons.
<P>
	When it is a question of the accused being free or going to jail, 
when it becomes a question of the accused defending himself with 
all the freedom and power that a democratic society invests in the 
presumption of innocence, then it is not trivial at all to make sure 
that the records of the complainants are at least available to the 
judge.
<P>
	This legislation could be fixed up enormously if this clause 
which puts all these barriers to what the judge can ask for was 
eliminated and it was simply a case where the accused could go to 
the judge and ask for records and the judge could vet those records. 
We must not attach strings to them.
<P>
	I would like to comment on one other thing with respect to this 
legislation. It shows that it may be conceived, however well 
intended, in a way that does not truly reflect the high values we, as 
legislators, must hold toward the principles of the presumption of 
innocence and the right of the accused to a fair trial.
<P>
	In clause 278.5(2) it says that in determining whether the judge 
should produce a record or not as a result of the request of the 
accused, the judge has to ask himself how deeply he will invade the 
privacy of the complainant and that kind of thing.
<P>
	Here are three unusual things. According to the legislation, the 
judge has to also consider whether the production of the record 
would potentially prejudice the personal dignity and the right of 
privacy of any person to whom the record relates.
<P>
	In other words, we have on one hand the accused fighting for his 
or her freedom and we have the judge having to consider, not the 
rights of the accused or the presumption of innocence or whether it 
is a fair trial or not, but the right to privacy or the dignity of the 
person making the accusation is going to be compromised in any 
way.
<P>
	I submit that there is something wrong there because the 
fundamental job of the courts is the determination of guilt or 
innocence, not to worry about the sensibilities of any witness, for 
that matter, much less the person who is laying the complaint.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	In this same clause the judge is also told he has to ask himself 
when he considers producing the records or not, whether society's 
interests in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences will be 
compromised. He is also told he has to consider society's interest in 
encouraging the obtaining of a treatment by complainants of sexual 
offences. In other words, he is asked to consider that which is not 
relevant to the trial at hand, that which is not relevant to the 
innocence or guilt of the person who is accused.
<P>
	I do support in principle, but only in the broadest general sense, 
the idea that we must do what we can to protect the reputations of 
those people who find themselves the victims of sexual abuse. 
However, as legislators we must never forget that our primary 
obligation is to protect the fundamental rights, the fundamental 
liberties and the fundamental freedoms of all Canadians, especially 
those who are accused and before the courts.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to express my appreciation to my colleague for 
Hamilton-Wentworth for his intervention in this debate.
<P>
	I did ask about the import of section 278(3) and was told that the 
intent of that section was to remove the notion of fishing trips by 
the accused or their counsel. Relevant records could still be 
brought forward but just any old thing could not be brought up and 
the judge had to go through it.
<P>
	I am very interested in the member's construction of this section 
which says that in fact this would bar the judge from bringing 
forward these records. I would agree with him if that is the import 
of the section that it would cause some real concern for people who 
are accused under this so-called repressed or false memory 
syndrome.
<P>
	I think too that some of the construction which could be put on 
the mandate given to the court of certain public policy 
considerations could interfere with the pure notion of justice.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The member has made some extremely troubling and serious 
points in the debate about section 278.3(4). I would like to ask the 
member if he studied this, what evidence or authority can he bring 
to bear to suggest that there really is no discretion at all on the part 
of the court, that it would simply close the door on these records 
being brought forward? I have been given to understand that 
although it prevents fishing expeditions, it did not absolutely close 
the door. Perhaps the member could discuss a bit more why he has 
taken that position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I approached the legislation, as 
I do in all instances, I looked very carefully at the text. I like to 
think that as a result of my background I am fairly practised at 
analysing language and words. I will read into the record the 
relevant words that put restrictions on what the judge can call 
forward and the member can judge for herself.
<P>
	Subsection 4 says: ``Any one or more of the following assertions 
by the accused are not sufficient on their own to establish that the 
record is likely relevant to an issue at trial''. Then it goes from (a), 
(b), to (c) that it is not sufficient ``that the record relates to the 
incident that is the subject matter'', or ``that the record may relate 
to the reliability of the testimony of the complainant or witness''. 
To my mind the text of the legislation is very, very clear.
<P>
	Sometimes we perhaps get our attention diverted, and I do not 
offer this as a criticism; I should be so lucky that I should be right 5 
per cent of the time myself. Sometimes we are a little deceived 
inadvertently by the words and descriptions and intent of 
legislation which we as members see as part of the publications for 
many departments. As members we very rarely have the 
opportunity to study legislation at length. Indeed, I point  out to the 
member that I would never have noticed this legislation had it not 
been for this elderly couple who came full of fear about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to thank the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth for his interventions, which I know from 
experience are interventions that will add to the value of the 
legislation we are addressing. I hope the member opposite will 
raise this as the bill progresses to committee. If there is substance 
to the concern particularly as it surrounds false memory syndrome, 
it is something we had better inoculate this bill against.
<P>
	I would bring to the attention of members that what Bill C-46 
does, at least in the interpretation of what I bring to the debate, is it 
clarifies the circumstances when such records may be subpoenaed. 
It was not considered advisable that the term ``likely to have 
relevance'' be left to a case by case judicial interpretation. 
Specifically, the records cannot be subpoenaed at a preliminary 
hearing, only at trial. This is a very important distinction. They 
cannot be brought forward at a preliminary hearing, only at trial. At 
that time there is a two-step process, first to establish the relevance 
of the documents and second, an examination of the documents by 
a judge in private.
<P>
	Does the member think that the legislation would be improved if 
part of the legislation was that the judge who reviews the evidence 
may not be the trial judge?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know how to answer that. I 
see what the member is getting at.
<P>
	One problem of the trial judge being the sole arbitrator is that the 
judge himself can make a mistake. The problem is these records are 
being examined in camera. I would prefer if it was not just the trial 
judge, that there was another person in authority who could 
examine the records at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	My difficulty is that the accused is fighting for his freedom. I 
even think it is appropriate for the accused to go on a fishing 
expedition if that is a way of trying to find evidence he believes 
exists that will either prove his innocence or discredit the 
complainant. On the other hand I am sensitive to the problem of the 
victims as well.
<P>
	Where I think the line should be drawn is that the accused should 
have the option in this legislation of asking for whatever records he 
or she likes, so long as the records are reviewed in camera by the 
trial judge, and I accept the member's point, and one other person, 
one other official of the court or somebody else. We can then make 
sure that the records are being handled in a non-prejudicial fashion 
because it is possible for a trial judge to be prejudiced.
<P>
	I think the bill can be corrected and still achieve its basic target, 
but only if we always allow the accused the opportunity to defend 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7676"> 7676 </A></B>
<P>
himself absolutely by the production of records. It does not matter 
even if those records are held in camera, just so long as the accused 
and his counsel can see those records.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Québec, the status of 
women critic, for giving me this opportunity to speak to Bill C-46.
<P>
	In fact, the purpose of Bill C-46 is to regulate the production of 
records of victims of sexual assault. This bill became necessary as 
a result of a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in December 
1995, in the O'Connor case. This was a case of sexual assault in 
which a man accused of sexual assault against four young girls 
demanded access to the school, medical and psychological records 
of the complainants. In a decision that was by no means 
unanimous, the Supreme Court declared that in certain cases, the 
accused should have access to the records of complainants.
<P>
	We should put this debate into the context that existed at the 
time. For several years, victims of sexual assault had been 
protected by new provisions of the Criminal Code which provided 
that an accused person may not attack the reputation of his victim, 
especially the victim's sexual reputation.
<P>
	You will recall that these provisions were adopted following 
decades of abuse of victims by the accused. The latter could, and 
certainly took every opportunity, to try to tarnish the credibility of 
their victims by publicising the sexual past of the latter. Thus the 
myth was maintained that a woman who was no longer a virgin 
deserved to be raped. Fortunately, this is now a thing of the past, 
thanks to a change in attitude that was long overdue.
<P>
	Women gradually won their right to equality, including the right 
to sexual freedom. The battle has been long and hard, but we 
cannot take the results for granted, especially when certain judges 
start to air their real feelings towards women.
<P>
	Women had won a certain measure of legal protection. This 
protection is important because it encourages women who are 
victims of sexual assault to lay charges. It also encourages them to 
persevere, once the initial charges have been laid. Legal protection 
also gives victims a chance to minimize, as far as possible, the 
impact the assault has had on them by encouraging them to seek 
assistance that is available in the community and from 
professionals.
<P>
	The framework of legal protection is essential in the battle 
against violence towards women. That is why it is so important to 
have legislation that ensures the accused is entitled to a full and 
complete defence but also protects the victim's access to the courts.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Such access confirms men's and women's entitlement to 
equality. How could we talk about equality between the sexes when 
men could sexually assault women almost without impunity, 
because the women would not report the assaults for fear of having 
their private life made public?
<P>
	If we want a society where men and women are equal we must 
use every means at our disposal to ensure that men and women are 
equally entitled to integrity and security. The best guarantee of 
these rights remains, despite its failings, the legal system.
<P>
	On the subject of the protection of rights, I will look at the first 
issue of concern, that of the balance between the rights of the 
accused and the rights of the victim.
<P>
	In its preamble, the bill talks of the accused's right to a full 
defence and the victim's right to privacy and equality. The 
preamble also talks of striking a balance between these rights as far 
as possible.
<P>
	The arguments of the parties opposing this bill rest on these 
words, the concept of balance. On the one hand, counsel for the 
defence want greater access to the victims' file, basing their 
request on the absolute right of the accused to a full defence. The 
idea behind that is that it is better to free 1,000 guilty individuals 
than to unfairly sentence one single innocent one.
<P>
	On the other hand, according to those speaking on behalf of the 
traditional victims of sexual assault, i.e. women, hardly any 
lawsuits are instigated on the basis of false accusations of sexual 
assault and the right of women to privacy and to not be assaulted 
demands that access to records be strictly forbidden.
<P>
	Where is the middle ground between these two extreme 
positions? How can a balance be struck between the rights of the 
accused and the rights of the victims? At present, it would appear 
that the rights of the accused are better protected. Let me explain. 
As we all know, the right of the accused to a full defence has been 
entrenched in the Constitution since 1982.
<P>
	But this right was already afforded enough protection by the 
courts before the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was 
passed. As I said earlier, it is already part of our judicial standard to 
protect the innocent against wrongful conviction at any cost. 
Indeed, especially since passage of the charter, the courts have 
developed a whole slew of rules and criteria to protect even better 
this right to a full defence.
<P>
	A whole series of rulings have been made on this provision of 
the charter and there will likely be more still. But much less known 
is the right to privacy and the right to personal safety, which have 
not yet made it into our judicial and folk culture. Because fewer 
judicial decisions having a strong impact have been made on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7677"> 7677 </A></B>
<P>
subject, it is wrongly viewed as less important, when in  fact, both 
are mentioned in the charter and nowhere does it say that this right 
is less important.
<P>
	Why is this? I think this is, unfortunately, a reflection of the 
lesser prominence traditionally given to women's rights. As 
<I>Toronto Star</I> journalist Michelle Landsberg has pointed out, have 
we ever heard of a police officer testifying at a trial and being 
required to disclose his medical records or sexual life in order to 
establish his credibility as a witness?
<P>
	Why have women traditionally been subjected to such 
humiliation, if not because they were not given the same 
credibility? Yet, as this journalist noted, there is no such invasion 
of the victims' privacy in other criminal cases. Whenever women 
and sexuality are involved, our society always feels the need to 
impose constraints on women. Yet, their right to privacy is 
protected under the charter.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Now that I have raised this issue, I want to deal specifically with 
the justice minister's bill. The minister wants to strike a balance, 
but he does not provide any guidelines, any specifics as to how to 
achieve such a balance.
<P>
	Again, at this point I am merely raising concerns. However, I 
wonder if, in light of the current tendency to give priority to the 
right to a full and complete defence, judges who will have to deal 
with an application for the production of records might not be 
involuntarily influenced, thus denying the right of the victim to 
privacy. We will have to take a careful look at this issue if we want 
to make sure that, some day, women and men are treated equally.
<P>
	Another issue which raises concerns, in my opinion, is the scope 
of disclosure. The bill provides that the records of the plaintiff or of 
a witness can be the object of an application. What does this mean?
<P>
	If, for example, the victim's child must testify, will the accused 
have access to the child's medical and therapeutic records, or to his 
diary? Similarly, if, as provided under the definition of ``record'', 
the content of a diary or personal journal can be produced, will the 
fact that a third party is mentioned as having been a sexual partner 
result in that person having to be involved in the process in order to 
protect his right to privacy?
<P>
	I believe the current wording might lead to abuse and we will 
have to take an in-depth look at the possible impact of this 
legislation on third parties who are absolutely not involved in the 
proceedings.
<P>
	Finally, I want to mention a very real concern of women's 
groups, namely the issue of costs. It is now clear that the O'Connor 
decision had a real impact on the practices of certain stakeholders. 
This impact varies from one organization to another, depending on 
their philosophy and financial resources.
<P>
	In speaking with support groups for victims of sexual assault, I 
learned that some have simply decided not to keep files. These 
groups still provide assistance to victims, but no longer keep files, 
so that they will not have to divulge them to an accused.
<P>
	The consequences of this decision are fairly major, since it is 
through keeping files that continuity in the assistance provided can 
usually be ensured, in addition to allowing the versatility that leads 
to better results. The consequence of this is that victims are 
penalized.
<P>
	Other organizations, however, have decided to continue keeping 
files, and must therefore incur legal expenses to intervene when 
they receive requests to turn these files over.
<P>
	We are all very aware of the cuts in funding to aid groups. I have 
talked about it on several occasions, as have many of my 
colleagues. In this era of cutbacks, how can victim assistance 
organizations allow themselves to spend their meagre resources on 
lawyers' fees? These are heartbreaking decisions to have to make. 
Should more women be helped, or should those already in the 
system be protected?
<P>
	There is something wrong with a system that forces 
organizations that request and receive funding for victim assistance 
to use part of this funding, which is still inadequate, to defend 
victims' right to privacy.
<P>
	It seems to me that the government should recognize its 
responsibility in this situation and include measures in the bill that 
will ensure that the costs of those holding files and of witnesses 
will be paid when they are defending the right to privacy.
<P>
	In conclusion, I repeat my support in principle of Bill C-46, but 
on condition that the House be allowed to conduct an in-depth 
study of the elements that raise questions so that victims are finally 
granted equal rights.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity, at second reading, to 
urge the government to act in good faith and to agree to the 
proposals the Bloc Quebecois will be making to improve this bill.
<P>
	It seems to me that, one day, we will have to stop playing petty 
politics when considering bills that have an impact on the most 
vital aspect of human beings, their integrity.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise this afternoon and speak to 
Bill C-46, an act to amend the Criminal Code as it pertains to the 
production of records in sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	I must say at the outset that I have been very vigilant in listening 
to the various interventions which have been made by my hon. 
colleagues on both sides of the House. In particular, I wish to 
commend the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth who just 
spoke. He brought out some very real concerns about how this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7678"> 7678 </A></B>
<P>
particular piece of legislation will affect the rights of the accused 
and perhaps impact dramatically on those rights. He was concerned 
about how it would affect a fair trial under our judicial system 
because of allowed testimony, particularly as it pertains to what has 
been known as the repressed memory syndrome and to cases of 
false memory syndrome. That is a very real concern.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Calgary North in addressing the bill 
stated that the support of the Reform Party for this legislation is 
very tentative at this particular time because we want to see and 
hear all the relevant witnesses who will come before the justice 
committee to speak on it.
<P>
	We have some very grave concerns. We want to ensure that the 
rights of the accused are protected. However, at the same time, as 
the member for Calgary North so eloquently put it, we have felt for 
a long time that the victims of crime have been overlooked by the 
justice system in Canada. It is high time that governments began to 
act in the best interests of the victims rather than always 
concentrating on the rights of the accused and, in many cases, the 
rights of convicted criminals. That is why the Reform Party 
supports this legislation in principle. It is why we are interested in 
hearing various members making their interventions and bringing 
up relevant points.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth spoke about 
specific cases in his riding. Constituents went to his office to voice 
their concerns about this legislation. That is very important. Too 
often members in this place and governments become unresponsive 
to people out in the real world who ultimately have to deal with 
legislation that is passed in this place.
<P>
	It is important that we cast the net as widely as possible in 
looking at this piece of legislation and in asking witnesses to come 
forward. We must ask for input from Canadians from coast to coast 
who will undoubtedly be affected if the legislation becomes law.
<P>
	A couple of hours ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice spoke about the absence of witnesses in these 
cases. He said quite eloquently that we are primarily talking about 
women and children in this legislation.
<P>
	As I travel throughout my riding of Prince George-Peace River, 
meeting with constituents, justice is a big issue. I have taken to 
referring to it as the lack of justice in our legal system in Canada 
today.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	I feel so strongly that this government is missing the boat in 
many areas of trying to protect the most vulnerable citizens of our 
country. I will bring something to the attention of the House. It is 
something that I had  endeavoured to bring to the House quite some 
time ago. It was my observation at that time that my concerns fell 
on deaf ears. The concerns I have been bringing to the House in this 
area are concerns of the people back home which I consider with a 
great deal of respect.
<P>
	This government would have the Canadian people believe that it 
is especially concerned about the most vulnerable, the women and 
children. As I have noted in the past, we have to be very careful. In 
our discussion of Bill C-46 today we have heard that we have to be 
very concerned and very careful to achieve a balance with judicial 
legislation, a balance between the rights of the accused and the 
rights of the victims of crime. I have already heard a great many 
colleagues speak today about trying to achieve that balance.
<P>
	The case I will refer to is related to a piece of legislation that was 
passed previously. Because Bill C-46 deals with sexual assault I 
want to zero in on a case that I was made aware of last fall. We pass 
legislation from time to time in the House of Commons while many 
times we may not really understand the possible ramifications. 
That is why it is so critical, as I said earlier, that hon. members 
bring forward the concerns of their constituents and bring them to 
the House of Commons for debate.
<P>
	The case I want to point out flows from a bill that was passed 
over a year ago in this place. At that time it was known as Bill 
C-41, which brought about a system of conditional sentencing in 
our judicial system. At that time Reformers raised a number of 
concerns about that piece of legislation and the government in its 
infinite wisdom said that those concerns were unfounded, that it 
would make sure conditional sentencing was not used in cases of 
violent crime and that it was only there for the discretionary use of 
judges in minor crimes.
<P>
	Some time ago there was a case in my home province of British 
Columbia that involved a woman who was a victim of sexual 
assault. The alleged perpetrator, the accused aggressor was a past 
common law spouse of this woman. At the time she reported the 
assault to the police she did not even report it as being a sexual 
assault but as just a common assault because she did not think the 
system would respond, that the system would respect the fact that 
she was sexually assaulted by a former spouse.
<P>
	For reasons of anonymity I have to be careful not to reveal the 
location and the identities of the people. This woman lives in fear 
for her life and in fear of ongoing reprisal by the aggressor. When 
the case eventually went to court, the judge found the aggressor 
guilty of sexual assault.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In the judge's ruling he said: ``In this case I do not believe the 
evidence of the accused, nor am I left in doubt by it''. So he found 
the accused guilty.
<P>
	He went on to say in making his judgment: ``I think that while 
society might have an interest in sending [Mr. X]  to jail, it seems 
to me that the victim and her children might be better served by 
[Mr. X] serving his sentence in the community and continuing to 
pay support''. Is that not something? What we have here is an 
individual convicted of sexually assaulting a woman and the 
sentence is one year to be served in the community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7679"> 7679 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to read the conditional sentence order that was 
imposed upon this convicted rapist. Let us call the fellow what he 
was, a convicted rapist. This is the conditional sentence order: 
``The court adjudged that the offender be sentenced to a term of one 
year and that the serving of the sentence in the community would 
not endanger the safety of the community. It is ordered that the 
offender shall from the date of this order, or where applicable the 
date of expiration of any other sentence of imprisonment, serve the 
sentence in the community subject to the offender's compliance 
with the following conditions''.
<P>
	What are the conditions that the judge imposed upon this 
convicted rapist? They are: ``Namely, the said offender shall: (1) 
keep the peace and be of good behaviour, (2) appear before the 
court when required to do so by the court, (3) report to a supervisor 
on October 3, 1996'', and it gives the location that he is ordered to 
report to, ``and thereafter when required by the supervisor in a 
manner directed by the supervisor, (4) remain within the province 
of British Columbia unless written permission to go outside of the 
province is obtained from the supervisor, and (5) notify the 
supervisor in advance of any change of name or address and 
promptly notify the supervisor of any change of employment or 
occupation and in addition, shall have no contact directly or 
indirectly with the [name of the victim], nor attend at or near any 
premises occupied by her. Shall abstain absolutely from the 
consumption of alcohol and shall submit to a breathalizer upon the 
demand of a peace officer. Shall attend, participate and 
successfully complete any counselling as directed by your 
probation officer. You shall continue to provide for your 
dependants'', signed by the judge.
<P>
	I find this absolutely preposterous. It clearly shows why we have 
to be so very careful in this place in the legislation that we pass. 
Here is a judge using the old Bill C-41, the amendments to the 
Criminal Code, to allow a convicted rapist, to what? To serve his 
time in the community, to continue to pay support for his children 
and his estranged spouse, to take some counselling if it is directed 
by the probation officer. It is absolutely incredible.
<P>
	Following that decision a letter was received by Reformers from 
the victim. I would like to read it into the record. From time to time 
we have to bring what happens in this place down to how it affects 
average Canadians, Canadian men, women and children out there 
in the real world.
<P>
	This particular victim wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to inform you of a recent court decision and the subsequent sentence 
imposed under guidelines of the new Bill C-41, sentence reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was the victim of a sexual assault at the hands of my former common law 
spouse, [Mr. X].</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Initially I did not disclose the sexual assault to the RCMP for fear that they would 
not believe me. I only disclosed the common assault. Finally, three days before the 
trial, I told the crown counsel the whole story. [Mr. X] was charged and subsequently 
convicted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What concerned me was that after finding the accused guilty [the] judge said 
something about this being a good case for ``community sentencing''. The 
sentencing was conducted in [another town], therefore I was unable to see justice be 
done and could not have any other input other than my written victim impact 
statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Watching [Mr. X] be sentenced would have helped me put some closure to this 
crime. I had to find out from word of mouth about the sentence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the close of the trial His Honour said something about [Mr. X] and I getting 
along in family court the week before and he seemed to think that because of this 
[Mr. X] would be a good candidate for this new type of sentencing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have no choice but to get along with [Mr. X] in family court because I do not 
want the court to think that I am using my children to get back at him. I have tried 
very hard to keep the family and criminal matters separate. Is the court telling me 
that they needed to see a serious reaction from me in family court and then they 
would understand the extent of my fear toward this man, and then perhaps send him 
to jail? I would rather see him go to jail than get his child support.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As far as I am concerned, [Mr. X] got the usual slap on the wrist. How is it that he 
is the convicted sexual offender and I am the one who is a prisoner? I am terrified of 
this man. It is no consolation to know that he'll have a criminal record, or that he has 
a lot of conditions. He is still free and I suspect he does not feel punished. I, on the 
other hand, will be trying to heal for many years to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This type of sentence tells the public that sexual assault within a marital 
relationship is not that serious. Don't you think?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think the crown counsel should appeal this sentence. I also think that our 
government should clarify what types of criminals will be dealt with under this new 
legislation. Perhaps community sentencing should be for less serious crimes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In closing, as much as I would have liked to go to the media with this I cannot do 
so for fear of [Mr. X].</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I submit this is a very sad case indeed. Shame on this 
government for not listening to those types of cases.
<P>
	On November 4, 1996 in this very Chamber I raised this 
particular case in a question to our justice minister. Quoting from 
<I>Hansard</I> from that date, the question I asked reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, at one time in Canada someone convicted of rape was subject to very 
severe penalties. Now with conditional sentencing their life does not seem to change 
much.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A man in B.C. was just convicted of sexual assault. What was his punishment? He 
is on conditional release, scot free.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These lenient decisions in three different provinces-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-because I had referred to a number of cases-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-have set dangerous precedents. Section 742 states that a conditional sentence is 
not an option when there is a danger to the community. Are women not part of the 
community?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the minister responsible for the legislation clarify this for women and, more 
important, for judges? He talks about a tool for the courts. He talks about 
appropriate cases. Will he clarify whether a conditional sentence is appropriate for 
rape?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here is the response on November 4 from the Minister of 
Justice:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago Professor Anthony Doob of the University of Toronto 
did a study. He showed newspaper reports of sentences, in particular of criminal 
cases, to members of the public and asked them if they felt the sentences were strong 
enough. The vast majority felt they were not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He took the same people, the same cases, and provided all the information about 
the cases, all the facts involving the offender and the offences. After they had read all 
the facts a clear majority thought the sentences were too harsh.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reality is that when the court looks at the offender and the offence and takes 
all the circumstances into account, the court does a pretty fair job of determining 
appropriate punishment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the part I like, how the minister summed up:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Obviously, the business of this member is not to worry about the facts or the 
reality but to use fearmongering to make his squalid point. That is very regrettable 
and it is bad public policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7680"> 7680 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what the justice minister said in reply to a question that I 
felt was very valid about a piece of legislation that he brought 
forward and which this Liberal government passed and how it 
affected one particular case, one particular woman who is out there 
and has failed to see justice done even though the aggressor in this 
case was convicted of sexual assault.
<P>
	In summary, what needs to be done? What can we do in this 
place? I have a long list of how we can shift the balance toward 
supporting the victims of crime. From your indication, Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately I do not have the time to go through the 
whole list here today.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	I challenge the government to do as Reformers are doing and 
start listening to the Canadian people on the issue of justice reform.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are crying out for the justice 
minister to bring about meaningful legislation to protect them and 
to protect the most vulnerable members of society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. In Beauchesne, with respect to decorum, 
citation 329 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In general, Speakers have enforced conservative, contemporary standards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Everyone knows that male members must wear a jacket and tie, 
but the Standing Orders do not mention jeans.
<P>
	My point of order is to find out whether members of this House 
may attend, and rise to speak, wearing jeans or whether 
contemporary standards require clean and suitable clothing, a suit, 
with jacket and tie.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak to the point of order.
<P>
	As the member correctly points out, there is no reference in 
Beauchesne's of which I am aware, of what type of pants we are 
allowed to wear in this place. I wear jeans from time to time. I have 
noted that members on both sides of the House do from time to 
time. I do not do it out of any disrespect for this place.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I am amazed that the member would bring up such 
a trivial point and consume the time of the House with such a point 
of order. Since he has, I would point out that jeans are the accepted 
apparel for a lot of working people in the real world. Certainly they 
do not find anything out of order with the wearing of jeans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order. Early 
in the first session of the 35th Parliament, I can recall very 
distinctly the occasion when a member opposite came into this 
Chamber wearing a turban.
<P>
	People were all waiting for the explosive fireworks to happen. I 
can recall being asked about that and saying that it did not matter 
what was on a person's head but what mattered was what was in the 
person's head.
<P>
	I would say today, it does not matter what kind of pants a person 
is wearing. What matters is what is in the pants.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does anyone else want to have a go? It is 
hard to know how seriously to take this. Members will recall that 
the Chair ruled that members had to wear a tie and a female 
member got up and asked: ``Do I have to wear a tie?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Terrebonne, who raised the point by 
quoting Beauchesne. I would like to return to this point of order. It 
is true that in French Beauchesne refers to ``tenues classiques 
conformes aux usages contemporains''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The English version is that in general Speakers have enforced 
conservative contemporary standards. I take seriously the member 
for Terrebonne who is concerned  that a member from a western 
province would be wearing blue jeans.
<P>
	There are many members here who probably think all British 
Columbians and Albertans wear blue jeans to their weddings. I 
have no idea.
<P>
	In light of the fact that the member has made the objection, the 
Chair will try to come back with some kind of refinement of what 
has been said in the House today. I thank the hon. member and in 
due course, if it seems necessary the Chair will come back with 
some kind of ruling on that, as possible as it might be.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The Chair has received notice from the hon. member for North 
Vancouver that he is unable to move his motion during private 
members' hour tomorrow, February 5. Regrettably, it has not been 
possible to arrange an exchange of positions in the order of 
precedence. Accordingly the Chair would direct the table officers 
to drop that item of business to the bottom of the order of 
precedence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hour provided for consideration of Private Members' 
Business will, therefore, be suspended and the House will continue 
to examine the matters before it at that time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this has been a very interesting debate. It was made much 
more interesting by the intervention of the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth who brought another dimension to the 
debate. That dimension is that it is far better that 1,000 guilty 
people go free than one innocent person be convicted. That is the 
cornerstone of our jurisprudence and that is the way it should be.
<P>
	If we go back to zero, back to the start of parliamentary 
democracy, I believe we will find that as parliamentarians our 
fiduciary responsibility is to the individual citizen and to protect 
those citizens from the power of the state. That is what this bill is 
about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7681"> 7681 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth dealt specifically 
with people who came to see him and brought to his attention that 
someone with false memory syndrome could totally destroy the 
lives of people with false accusations. The counsellor protecting 
the accused would not then have the ability to investigate, to prove 
that it was false memory syndrome that caused the problem. This is 
a particularly cogent criticism of the bill and it is something we 
should investigate very carefully in committee.
<P>
	This bill has the effect of making it far more difficult, but not 
impossible, for defence lawyers to break down the credibility of a 
complainant. We must ask ourselves, why is this? I believe it is 
basically to protect innocent persons from being victimized by the 
trial process.
<P>
	This was very aptly put when, in a 1988 presentation of how to 
go about undermining the position of a complainant, a criminal 
lawyer said: ``Whack complainants hard at the preliminary inquiry. 
Attack with all you have got so that he or she will say, `I am not 
coming back'''. We ask if this is justice for someone who has been 
assaulted or sexually assaulted. It is usually only a small minority 
of women who are sexually assaulted that actually come forward. 
Why? It is because they have been invaded as it is. Then they come 
forward and find their whole lives being bared to everybody. They 
find themselves being whacked by the lawyer for the accused. We 
must balance the rights of the victim with the rights of the accused. 
As I read it, that is what this legislation is all about.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It is important to look at the mindset of a society which allows 
the law to put the rights of the accused far ahead of the rights of the 
victim. I would like to use as an example a particularly egregious 
incident which took place and was recently brought to light in a 
trial in Yukon. I am talking about the circumstances of the murder 
of Susan Klassen.
<P>
	Let me tell the House something about Susan Klassen. She died 
in November 1995. She was 36. She was murdered by her husband 
Ralph. Her husband pleaded guilty to manslaughter, 
notwithstanding the fact that he killed her with his bare hands, 
bruising his thumbs doing it, and then knotted a pillow case around 
her neck.
<P>
	How is that manslaughter? Manslaughter is when a person hits 
someone and they fall over dead. The person did not mean to kill, 
however, the individual hit his head and ended up dead. How is it 
manslaughter when you choke someone so hard that you bruise 
your thumbs and then you strangle them with a pillow case? How in 
God's name can that be manslaughter?
<P>
	We wonder what it would take to get 300 people from the Yukon, 
on one day's notice, at minus 38 degrees, to march in honour of 
Susan Klassen. They were not marching just for Susan Klassen; 
they were marching out of frustration and rage at a judicial system 
that would allow provocation to be used as the excuse for killing. 
Provocation. My God. How on earth could anybody use 
provocation as why they killed somebody by strangulation so hard 
that they bruise their thumbs and then smother them with a pillow 
case? Provocation is when somebody says something, you get a 
little bit upset, like what happened here in this House today, you go 
over and you nail them, and the person winds up dead. You did not 
mean to kill. That is what manslaughter is all about.
<P>
	Susan Klassen attended St. Angela Catholic elementary school 
and Sir John Thompson junior high school in Edmonton. She won 
the top award for excellence at Archbishop MacDonald high 
school, graduated from university in 1981 as an occupational 
therapist with  distinction, and worked in the community. She 
probably was not an angel. None of us is. Was whatever happened 
in the relationship between Susan and her husband sufficient 
provocation for this person to kill her and then plead manslaughter 
because of provocation?
<P>
	How does that come back to Bill C-46? It is an entirely different 
circumstance but it has a common root. When women-and we all 
know that 99 per cent of the time it is women-suffer from assault, 
whether it is sexual or any other kind, and when that assault is 
permissible because of provocation for whatever reason, then we 
are in a situation where a person who brutally kills someone is able 
to say: ``I did not mean to, therefore, it was manslaughter. I did not 
mean to rape this girl. I did not break into her house and rape her. I 
was provoked into raping her because she was there''.
<P>
	It is time that we put an end to that. We need to balance the rights 
of the accused and the victim through amendments and at 
committee we may satisfactorily answer the question of false 
memory syndrome. However, the rights of the victim must at least 
be on par with the rights of the criminal. I would ask the House to 
consider this when the bill goes to committee and before it goes to 
third reading.

<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 3.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Minister of Canadian Heritage should 
proceed immediately to exempt CBC North from layoffs and funding reductions to 
the operating budget resulting from the $127 million reduction in federal funding to 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation announced in 1996, as well as future cuts 
should they occur.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the issue of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. Hon. members who 
are carrying on discussions in the Chamber could perhaps go 
behind the curtains. The hon. member for Yukon has the floor and 
members who are interested in participating in the debate this 
afternoon will want to hear her.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address this 
motion today. It is an important motion, not just for CBC and Radio 
Canada in the north but of course for all of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7696"> 7696 </A></B>
<P>
	I have specifically chosen to address the portion of CBC North 
because obviously, I have heard most about that from my 
constituents. I would add that throughout many years, the New 
Democratic Party members in this  House have supported our 
public national broadcasting system. We continue to do that and 
feel it is essential to the unity of our country and to bringing 
Canadians together.
<P>
	With respect to CBC North, this motion has received a lot of 
interest in the north. MLAs in the Northwest Territories legislature 
very much support the motion and support the intent of the motion.
<P>
	In November 1996 Charles Dent, Minister of Education, Culture 
and Employment, wrote and spoke to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. He conveyed to her that the Government of the Northwest 
Territories strongly urges the minister to recognize the unique and 
vital role of CBC in northern Canada.
<P>
	The member for Nunatsiaq has lent his support to the campaign 
to save CBC North and I thank him for that. I have not heard 
anything from the member for the Western Arctic on this issue, but 
I do hope she will have the opportunity to respond to the motion 
today and to support CBC in the north.
<P>
	The Yukon government very strongly supports the motion as 
well and CBC in general. Both the government leader, Piers 
McDonald, and minister Dave Keenan have shown a strong interest 
in the issue.
<P>
	I want to quote briefly from a letter written to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage by the hon. Dave Keenan, a minister of the 
Yukon government. It succinctly outlines why this issue is so 
important to Yukoners and to people in the north:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a national institution the CBC is mandated to strengthen Canada by reflecting 
and sharing the diversity of its regions and cultures. In the Yukon the requirement to 
build national unity is tied also with the requirement to strengthen the unity of our 
peoples as major changes in economic and political institutions take place. The cuts 
proposed to the CBC northern service threaten to remove the ability of the CBC to 
speak with Canadians who live and work in the north as local news and current 
events programming is reduced, and will direct the service toward a service that 
speaks to these people, often with more prepackaged programs from the south.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That succinctly says what much of the concern is by northerners. 
I should add that the NDP Yukon government has also passed an 
all-party resolution calling for an end to the cuts to the CBC. The 
resolution was supported by members of the Liberal Party in that 
legislature.
<P>
	I had the opportunity today to look through <I>Hansard</I> and to 
realize once again that New Democrat MPs have been the only 
ones, along with perhaps one or two interveners from the Bloc 
Quebecois, who have stood in this place and defended the vital role 
of the CBC. New Democrats are the only ones who are speaking for 
the majority of Canadians when we say that the Liberals should 
keep their election promises and restore funding to the CBC.
<P>
	Since Mr. Beatty announced in September the CBC board of 
directors plan to deal with the most recent cut to the corporation's 
budget, my office has been absolutely inundated with letters and 
telephone calls. I might say that in the almost 10 years I have been 
a member of Parliament, as surprising as it may seem, I have never 
received more calls, conversations, letters, petitions than on this 
issue. That is why it is so important that people across the country 
and in this House hear how vitally important this national 
broadcasting system is to the people of the north.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	In December I sent the Prime Minister some 140 letters which 
until that time had been received by me in a two to three week 
period. Since that time I continue to receive calls about the future 
of CBC and Radio Canada. I would also like to mention the strong 
movement within the community again through petitions to urge 
the government to have adequate and stable funding for CBC and 
especially for CBC North in our view.
<P>
	I would like to also mention the editor of the <I>Yukon News</I>, Peter 
Lesniak, who has undertaken on his own and in his own name a 
save the CBC campaign. Again this illustrates the real intent, the 
emotional attachment and intellectual attachment people have to 
the service of the CBC.
<P>
	This is an important motion to northerners and I believe to all 
Canadians. It is our way to be heard by other Canadians. I have to 
note that without a strong CBC and Radio Canada in the south, we 
do not have a strong CBC North either.
<P>
	We would have liked to have seen much more debate on this 
motion and have had it brought to a vote, however we do not have 
this. This has been denied but I would like to point out a few facts 
to the House today.
<P>
	In the past 28 months CBC North has dealt with budget cuts of 
$1.9 million and has already laid off 30 staff. The latest cuts will 
mean a further reduction to CBC North radio of 28 per cent and to 
CBC North TV of almost 40 per cent. This is not death by a 
thousand cuts; this is being hung, drawn and quartered. This is not 
what the public want to see, nor what they expected from this 
government.
<P>
	Aboriginal language programming in the north could be one of 
the first victims. I have been told that cuts could also affect 
programs now being broadcast in Inuktitut. Inuktitut will be one of 
the two official languages of the new Nunavut territory. In fact it 
might be argued that cuts may violate the Nunavut Settlement Act 
since the federal government has an obligation to provide basic 
services in both languages.
<P>
	French language services in northern Quebec could also be 
affected. CBC North provides a weekly news magazine called 
``Boreal Hebdo''. There is a good chance that this program which is 
widely listened to may  also be seriously affected and see its last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7697"> 7697 </A></B>
<P>
days. So we have aboriginal languages, French language, obviously 
English language programs all being affected by these cuts.
<P>
	There is the red book promise, which I am sure we could debate 
at length. I think many other Canadians believe that during the last 
election the Liberal government and the current Prime Minister 
made a commitment to maintain funding for the CBC. But like 
many other promises during the last election, the Liberals promised 
they would stabilize funding for the CBC and they did not do it. 
During the last election the Liberals said they would scrap the GST 
and they did not do that.
<P>
	Pierre Berton best summed it up when he said: ``The Prime 
Minister promised us that he would trash the GST and save the 
CBC and then he saved the GST and trashed the CBC''. That is 
Pierre Berton's comment. As we know he is a national hero and has 
supported national unity. He and many other national figures are 
now speaking out on this.
<P>
	In the last election the Liberals said they would make jobs the 
number one priority but they did not do that either. In the last 
election they said they would renegotiate NAFTA and they did not 
do that. In the last election the Liberals made 21 promises to 
aboriginal people. So far they have kept only three and have 
shelved the royal commission report on aboriginal peoples. In the 
last election the Liberals said they would fund the national day care 
system to create 150,000 new child care spaces for children and 
they did not do that either. In the last election the Liberals said they 
would protect medicare and education from Tory cutbacks but by 
1997-98 they will have cut $7 billion from those programs.
<P>
	There are many challenges facing the country today, including 
the child poverty issue which we are all aware of and the 1.5 
million people who are unemployed. What do changes to the 
unemployment insurance mean to the Liberal Party? It means a 
change of name to employment insurance. Who buys that? Less 
than half of the unemployed now even qualify for the benefits and 
social program spending has been slashed.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Now at the 11th hour we are going to hear some new promises 
from the Liberals. They are going to say: ``You know those children 
who have been put into poverty? We are going to do something 
about that. We will start to do something about it after you have 
voted for us in the next election''. It is shameful. It is a betrayal of 
Canada. Canadians will not forget these broken promises, just like 
the CBC cuts that were not supposed to happen.
<P>
	I know all members of the House do not all agree on what should 
be done with the CBC, but at the same time it would have been 
important to ensure that everyone  here could have debated this 
issue. We should have had a debate about something as 
fundamental as our 60 year old national broadcasting system. It is a 
system which in French and in English has served Canadians well. 
It serves our country well. Canadians need to have the opportunity 
to express their views.
<P>
	Throughout the north CBC North is one vehicle. We have very 
good radio stations which operate in the Yukon, however, it is the 
CBC which provides that connection with national and 
international events. It makes the linkages to all parts of the 
country possible. It allows us as Yukoners and as northerners to 
speak with the rest of Canada and it allows the rest of Canada to 
speak with us. Surely that is what this country should be about.
<P>
	We have seen the destruction of many of our national symbols. 
Just flying the flag does not hold the country together, as important 
as it may be. We need a vehicle which will allow us to express our 
identity and to express our soul.
<P>
	I want to say that the emotional reaction to the potential loss of 
the CBC and Radio-Canada really underscores that the government 
got it wrong. There are certain values, there are certain principles, 
there are certain things that we need to maintain to preserve the 
Canada that we know.
<P>
	Some people have argued that people should take their 
complaints to Mr. Perrin Beatty, the chair of the CBC board of 
directors. However, I would point out that the CBC board of 
directors does not have anyone on it from the north speaking for 
northern communities. That is why this issue needs to be revisited 
in the House of Commons. Every other region of the country has 
someone in that boardroom who can say, ``No, we should do this. 
Yes, we should do this. Here is an alternative. Here is our regional 
concern'', but there is no one from the north.
<P>
	The cuts to the CBC, as I mentioned earlier, are more than just 
figures in a book. We all realize that there are stringent necessities 
in terms of budget. However, we also realize, and it has been 
brought home to us very well, that it is important that we not only 
have symbols of our country but that we have a way to talk with 
each other. CBC Radio-Canada has provided that. In the north it is 
a vital link for us in many areas.
<P>
	I would like to close with the words of the New Democratic 
Party leader, Alexa McDonough, who does not yet have the 
opportunity to speak in the House of Commons, but in the new 
Parliament we will be happy to see her here. We know she is a 
representative who will keep her word, who will speak for the 
people of Atlantic Canada and for all Canadians. In November, Ms. 
McDonough said that the CBC is one of the most important 
institutions in this country and that it is capable of holding Canada 
together. I believe that from the bottom of my heart.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7698"> 7698 </A></B>
<P>
	A national and international public broadcasting system is 
important to this country. To the north and to rural areas it is the 
vital link that makes us the country that we are.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to end by asking for unanimous consent to refer this 
motion to the heritage committee for further study.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The House has 
heard the proposal of the member for Yukon, asking for the consent 
of the House to refer the motion to the heritage committee for 
further study. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I see that 
members of the Liberal Party do not want to put this to the heritage 
committee. I would then ask for unanimous consent to make this 
motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent that the motion be made votable?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is no consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Yukon. The purpose of this motion is to exempt the CBC 
Northern Service from the CBC cuts.
<P>
	These cuts became necessary when the government decided to 
reduce the CBC's overall parliamentary vote by $127 million in 
1996-97.
<P>
	Members will recall that these cuts came on top of the $227 
million in reductions imposed on the CBC by the Liberal 
government since it took office. These reductions of $350 million 
in the CBC budget, imposed by the Liberal government, will mean 
the loss of 4,000 jobs, jobs that will disappear because of these 
huge cuts.
<P>
	The official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, has always been 
very strongly opposed to large cuts in the CBC's funding. Since our 
arrival in Ottawa, we have reminded the government time and 
again of the promises it made in its own red book regarding vitality 
and funding. They promised not only to recognize our major 
institutions, such as the CBC, the National Film Board and 
Telefilm Canada, but to ensure their funding. The Bloc Quebecois 
has always urged the government to keep its promises.
<P>
	As for the proposal made by the member for Yukon, the principle 
is a fundamental one. If it were to be voted on, I would expand on it 
and say that the whole network  should be exempted from the cuts, 
not just the CBC Northern Service. Let us not forget that $350 
million in cuts and 4,000 in lost jobs are at stake.
<P>
	We are in agreement with the principle of the motion put forward 
by the member for Yukon, but the government must realize that it is 
hurting not just communities in the Yukon, but francophone 
communities throughout Canada.
<P>
	Remember that, in northern Canada, the CBC and its 145 
employees provide 220 hours of television and radio programming 
in eight native languages to an audience of 100,000. Under the 
latest cuts imposed on the CBC Northern Service, the present 
television budget of $14 million will be reduced by 30 to 40 per 
cent and radio service will be reduced by 30 per cent.
<P>
	With respect to French services, remember that this government 
has made cuts of $70 million, including $20 million to radio. The 
cuts imposed on CBC radio are tragic for Canada's francophone 
communities, since what they are experiencing is not a reduction in 
service, but the outright closing of their stations, and in other cases 
considerably reduced services.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	I would like to refer to the press release sent by the Fédération 
des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada when the 
cuts at CBC Radio were announced. The federation said that the 
federal government and the CBC were abandoning Francophone 
and Acadian communities. That is how they reacted.
<P>
	In responding to the cuts announced by Perrin Beatty and 
Ghyslaine Saucier, chairperson of the CBC's board of directors, the 
federation said in its press release that this decision was tantamount 
to destroying a tool that was central to the development of our 
communities. Ms. Copps should have invested the money in the 
CBC instead of a flag campaign.
<P>
	For many Francophone and Acadian communities, CBC regional 
programming is the only medium that reflects their community and 
culture in their own language. With these budget cuts, the federal 
government is sending a devastating message. In spite of its 
high-sounding commitments, it is abandoning the development of a 
thriving Francophone and Acadian community in this country. 
When will Mr. Chrétien and Ms. Copps understand the 
importance-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
knows perfectly well he must not mention members of this House 
by name. He must refer to them by the name of their riding, even 
when is quoting what they said. He should use only the name of 
their riding or their title. I hope the hon. member, who is well 
acquainted with the Standing Orders, will take this into account in 
his comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7699"> 7699 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have here a 
quote I would like to read to you. As you know, when a text is 
quoted, it should be quoted word for word.
<P>
	So the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister were 
asked when they would understand the importance of their 
commitment to serve the community. The Liberal government 
should intervene and reverse the decisions and dangerous 
guidelines imposed by the CBC.
<P>
	This government has itself admitted that it did not meet the 
commitments made in its red book. In fact, there are some quotes I 
would like to make to show how far this government has drifted 
away from its commitments in a number of areas, which is a 
complete reversal from the emotional message they sent in their 
red book.
<P>
	I would like to quote to you what they said initially about the 
Conservatives' approach to cultural matters: ``Culture is the very 
essence of national identity, the bedrock of national sovereignty 
and national pride. At a time when globalization and the 
information and communications revolution are erasing national 
borders, Canada needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural 
development''.
<P>
	Referring to the Conservatives, it said: ``Funding cuts to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council, the 
National Film Board, Telefilm Canada, and other institutions 
illustrate the Tories' failure to appreciate the importance of cultural 
development. The recent attempt to consolidate the Canada 
Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council 
is but one more example of this disregard for the promotion of 
artistic endeavours''.
<P>
	In the same breath, they said: ``A Liberal government will be 
committed to stable multiyear financing for national cultural 
institutions such as the Canada Council and the CBC. This will 
allow national cultural institutions to plan effectively''.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	What did they do as soon as they got into power? Since 1993, 
three years ago now, they imposed a total of $350 million in cuts on 
the CBC. They also imposed cuts on the National Film Board and 
abolished 4,000 Radio-Canada/CBC radio and television positions.
<P>
	Here is what they did based on a statement they call their 
own-let us recall it to mind now: ``Culture is the very essence of 
national identity, the bedrock of national sovereignty and national 
pride''. We know that, we share that opinion in Quebec. That is 
what we say, our Quebec culture is the very essence of the pride in 
our country.
<P>
	They said, and I repeat it here: ``Funding cuts to the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council, the National Film 
Board, Telefilm Canada, and other institutions illustrate the Tories' 
failure to appreciate the importance of cultural and industrial 
development''.  ``When we are in power'' they say ``we will 
provide these institutions with stable financing''. What a disgrace.
<P>
	Not only do they make promises, but they win people's votes for 
this party on the strength of statements and convictions about 
culture and then, as soon as they get into power, they do the total 
opposite and bludgeon culture.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must say that this government has no vision of 
culture-the opposite is true. The major cultural institutions still 
have a sword hanging over their heads, for they do not know what 
the next budget will bring. Will new cuts be imposed?
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that this government has said that the CBC 
was not doing its job of promoting national unity. The Minister of 
Defence has even suggested doing away with it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but his time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure it is of absolutely no 
surprise to the members opposite that CBC is a rather unique 
institution. It is an arm's length institution. It has institutional 
bodies that guide it, that set its priorities.
<P>
	I am really pleased that there is a debate on CBC North. It is the 
public broadcaster for Canada's north. CBC North has the mandate 
to serve all Canadians living in the north regardless of language, 
culture or locality. It was created in 1958. CBC North brings public 
broadcasting services to remote and isolated communities which 
are not economically viable for commercial broadcasters.
<P>
	Indeed we do have a very unique relationship with CBC. In fact 
it would be safe for me to say that northerners have a visceral 
attachment to that public broadcaster. It has made their reality more 
real to the rest of the world, to the rest of Canada for sure. It has 
brought in a sense to some of the remotest regions the world news, 
world events and those in the rest of Canada. It has been a unifying 
force in this country politically, culturally, economically. I would 
say that northerners have a unique relationship and a very deep 
attachment to that public broadcaster.
<P>
	I do not believe for one moment that I have remained silent or 
mum on this issue. I may not be broadcasting my views as such for 
political purposes because I feel that there has been real pain. 
Really difficulty decisions have been made. Those are difficult 
things. I think in a sense to go out there and parade around 
politically on this issue would not be wise.
<P>
	I am trying to be very careful in picking my words because I do 
not want to offend my colleagues. I know that they have an equal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7700"> 7700 </A></B>
<P>
attachment and respect for the  people who work in the north in that 
public broadcasting institution.
<P>
<B>(1905 )</B>
<P>
	CBC's northern service is part of the corporation's public 
mandate as reflected in the Broadcasting Act to reflect Canada and 
its regions to national and regional audiences and to contribute to 
shared national consciousness and identity. All that to say CBC 
North currently produces 220 hours of radio programming per 
week in 10 different languages. It serves a total audience of over 
100,000 Canadians from across the north in radio production 
centres in Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Inuvik, Whitehorse, Yellowknife 
and Montreal.
<P>
	CBC North gathers and exchanges the news of daily life in 
northern Canada. Regional, national and international news is 
presented every day. It is drawn from CBC's extensive news 
gathering sources.
<P>
	Radio truly is a lifeline service for northern Canadians. Mr. 
Speaker, if you have ever had a Delta experience in the north, for 
example in my riding where I come from, you will know about 
sitting in a fish camp and being able to get very important messages 
about the changing weather, about transportation, about medical 
services or about any such necessities that are there for the people 
who live on the land. You will know that CBC is a very real and big 
part of northern people's lives.
<P>
	Having said that, on television CBC North produces four weekly 
current affairs programs in seven languages. Television production 
centres in Yellowknife, Iqaluit and Montreal present multilingual 
coverage of major events.
<P>
	The CBC recently announced decisions to address budget 
reduction measures. We must get our fiscal house in order, and that 
means reductions in government expenditures. No federal 
department or agency has been immune. Everyone has had to 
tighten their belts. Ministries have cut, departments have cut, 
crown agencies have also had to cut. The CBC recognizes that it 
must do its part in this exercise.
<P>
	In reference to the comments of my colleague from Yukon, this 
does not make it easy for me to say that it has been easy, that it has 
been draconian or Machiavellian, that it was easy to do. It was not 
easy to do. I am not here as a government apologist. I am here to 
say that there are circumstances beyond the individual, beyond this 
government.
<P>
	Yes, we could make our forays to the Minister of Finance, to the 
minister of heritage, to any minister in this government, but we 
must remember that the CBC is an independent agency. Its board of 
directors and senior management are responsible for making 
decisions on how best to manage its operations within its resource 
allocation.
<P>
	On the resource allocation, yes the government has cut programs 
all across the board. Agencies and departments  have cut. That is 
true. Yes, we wear that. Yes, we assume the responsibility. But the 
CBC is an independent agency that sets its own priorities.
<P>
	Government also sets fiscal targets and it is the CBC's 
responsibility to determine how best to meet those goals. The CBC 
is guaranteed journalistic, creative and programming independence 
under the Broadcasting Act, and Parliament must respect and 
uphold that relationship. The CBC will decide the appropriate 
budget for the northern service in the context of its public mandate, 
overall operations and resource allocation.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite would be the first to complain if we 
were to interfere with the journalistic integrity of the CBC. The 
member would be the very first, I am sure. I would understand that. 
To be quite honest, the CBC would not tolerate having the 
government's fingerprints all over its priorities and planning. It 
would not appreciate that. It would not accept that and the member 
opposite knows that it would protest vehemently. I would also 
understand that.
<P>
	The president of the CBC announced decisions in September 
with the details of implementation and what it means in terms of 
layoffs still to be determined in some places. No CBC service is 
exempt. There will be reductions in both staff and programming in 
English and French radio and English and French television. 
However, CBC is not abandoning its public mandate to serve 
Canadians. In fact, it is returning to its roots as being as Canadian 
as possible and offering a truly public broadcasting service. It will 
continue to tell the story to Canada and to present a world seen 
through Canadian eyes.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	New avenues have also opened up. Let me say that I am 
saddened and unabashed about the sadness and the feeling that I 
have. I do not perhaps share the priorities that put CBC North in its 
present position. I would have liked it to be different. I feel there 
has been a disproportionate cut.
<P>
	I know the north and I understand the remoteness and the people 
who work there. The north is a small place. Both my colleague and 
I know intimately people who work there. So it is not a matter of 
not caring, it is the reality of the fact that the CBC is an 
independent agency. It has to set its own priorities.
<P>
	Yes, we as government officials are responsible for the overall 
fiscal restraint we operate under and the goals that we set as a 
government. However, we do not interfere at the departmental or 
agency level or with the crown corporations that set their own 
specific priorities.
<P>
	I feel the north is a priority. I believe it provides a unique 
service. I would like to continue to work with the people who have 
the authority, but that would be protested. It would be interfering. I 
am not allowed to do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7701"> 7701 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard the issues raised in the House when ministers 
of the cabinet have interfered with quasi-judiciary bodies. It is not 
tolerated. In that sense my hands are tied.
<P>
	I can only tell northerners how important we feel the work that 
the broadcasting corporation has offered to us over the years. We 
cannot thank it enough for that work. We must recognize that the 
CBC has made a valuable contribution to the north and for the unity 
of the country and for Arctic sovereignty. Over a whole range of 
issues it has been a unifying force, a cultural promoter. It is a 
wonderful institution that should be supported.
<P>
	I support the CBC but there are realities which are beyond my 
capacity. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first like to congratulate the member on her 
initiative, because I think we both believe in the value and 
importance of CBC northern services and we are both concerned 
that Canadians in remote and isolated communities in the north 
continue to receive the CBC television and radio services that link 
them to each other and to their neighbours to the south.
<P>
	CBC North has a mandate to serve all Canadians living in the 
north, regardless of their language, their culture and their location. 
The northern cultural landscape is one of great wealth. The national 
and regional programs of CBC North bring the various peoples of 
northern Canada together.
<P>
	The CBC northern service shares the Corporation's public 
mandate, which is to reflect Canada and its regions to national and 
regional audiences. CBC North's mission statement, drafted by its 
employees, provides for serving the peoples of the north by helping 
them understand each other and by enabling them to communicate 
with each other and the rest of the country.
<P>
	At the moment, CBC North produces 220 hours of radio 
programming a week in English, French and 8 native languages. 
This programming is a combination of local programs and the 
national programs of CBC radio. CBC North's radio service had an 
operating budget of $9.7 million in 1995-96.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The CBC delivers its northern television service with two and a 
half hours of northern produced programming that is combined 
with CBC's national service programming. It produces four and a 
half hour programs over 26 weeks in Cree, Inuktitut, three Dene 
languages and English. It reaches 96 communities in the north with  
over 100 hours of television programming per week. That is, by 
any measure, a very impressive operation.

	The budget for CBC's northern television service was $3.3 
million in 1995-96. We have heard many members speak today 
with regard to CBC North. We have to recognize the reality of this. 
We must get our fiscal house in order and that means reductions in 
government expenditures throughout. The budget that was 
announced in February 1996 gave the CBC the time necessary to 
plan responsibly and make the appropriate decisions to manage its 
operations, including CBC North, in light of the new fiscal targets.
<P>
	The CBC is an independent crown agency and Parliament must 
respect that relationship. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for 
the government to intervene in CBC's internal decision making 
process concerning budget allocations, including the budget for 
CBC North. These are tough decisions but the government has 
every confidence that CBC's board of directors and senior 
management will manage its resources efficiently and will treat its 
people and the regions fairly.
<P>
	We do not yet know all the details of the announced measures to 
meet the budget reductions and what it means specifically for CBC 
North. However, I would like to assure the hon. member that CBC's 
obligations under the Broadcasting Act ``to reflect Canada and its 
regions to national and regional audiences'' will be fulfilled. As 
part of the service of our national public broadcaster, CBC North 
ensures that the interests of Canadians living in the farthest regions 
of Canada are served. This is CBC's mandate and it will not 
change.
<P>
	Fundamental and unprecedented changes face the people of the 
north. In 1999, two new territories will be created through the 
division of the Northwest Territories. Land claim settlements are 
creating aboriginal governments equal in scale and resources to 
public governments. Economic development is poised to unfold in 
many areas of the north which will expand communities and build 
new ones. Meeting this change is a small population with a history 
of survival under harsh conditions.
<P>
	Now, more than ever, northern Canadians need to be joined 
together through their public broadcasting system to share their 
stories and to see and to hear themselves and other Canadians. 
Cable and in the near future direct to home satellite and other 
wireless services are breaking down the north's media isolation but 
these new communication bridges to the north are delivering 
signals from the south, many of which are American.
<P>
	On the other hand, the small population base in most centres 
make it difficult for Canadian private television services to operate 
economically. There are only two private radio stations serving 
northern centres.
<P>

<P>
	There are great opportunities for broadcasting in the North, and 
CBC North is well placed to take advantage of them, but the CBC 
needs to use new technologies if it is to really take advantage of 
those opportunities.
<P>
	Digital conversion in the North is inevitable, given the 
anticipated conversion of the radio and television broadcasting 
industry as a whole. Digitization involves a rather high initial cost 
for broadcasters, but it offers them the unique opportunity to 
consolidate their operations and to realize greater economies of 
scale. Conversion to digital will also make it possible to provide 
superior signal quality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The broadcasting distribution infrastructure is undergoing 
fundamental change throughout North America and, indeed, 
throughout the world. Once we have gone digital, there will be 
opportunities for all broadcasters in the north, public and private, to 
share infrastructure costs and achieve greater efficiencies in 
distribution.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	Digitization provides a common technical platform that will 
encourage a network of networks between CBC North, TVNC, 
private radio and television broadcasters in the north. Growing 
from the humblest of beginnings as radio stations transferred from 
the military, CBC North has built a pan-northern service across 
four million square kilometres of Canada. In the future CBC North 
would be a vital link in Canada's northern information highway.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier by the hon. secretary of state, partnerships 
will be increasingly important in this complex world where we 
must do more with less. In particular, partnerships will be critical 
for building the bridges that will construct our information 
highway for the millennium and beyond. As a service of our 
national public broadcaster, CBC North will be an important 
partner in helping to build the north's information highway.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing to our attention this very 
important subject today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I should advise the House 
that if the hon. member for Yukon speaks now she will close the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate my colleagues from the Liberal Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois for addressing this issue seriously. I might not agree 
with all of the responses, but I do feel that it has been an important 
debate.
<P>
	I am saddened that the Reform Party has not seen fit either to 
participate or to be present for this debate because I think that they 
too-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member, but she knows that she is not allowed to 
refer to the absence of members from the House. Perhaps their lack 
of participation in the debate is fair comment, but not their absence 
from the House. I would draw that rule to her attention. I know she 
is aware of it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Yes, certainly, Mr. Speaker. I withdraw the 
comment about the House. However, participating in the debate I 
think is important because it affects all parts of the country.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to all members who spoke on this 
matter. I listened to their arguments. I am a bit puzzled by some of 
the arguments.
<P>
	The hon. member for Western Arctic said that CBC North is a 
lifeline that deserves support. I would agree. In terms of the many 
services that are provided by the CBC it is a lifeline that deserves 
support. At the same time, the member for Western Arctic said that 
there are fiscal constraints. We recognize that. I believe the 
member for Western Arctic said that we must get our fiscal house 
in order. Again, I agree.
<P>
	However, there is another debate which we also need to have, 
which is: What is the house that we are getting in order? It is the 
country. How do we preserve, maintain and develop the culture and 
the unity of that house that we are trying to get in order?
<P>
	My point, by this motion and by my comments today, is that the 
debate around the CBC is not just a funding debate, it is about the 
house that we are attempting to get in order. We may do so well at 
getting it in order that people may not feel the same allegiance to 
the house as we lose social programs, health programs and national 
institutions such as our rail system and the CBC.
<P>
	That is why I proposed that we have a vote on this motion and 
that we refer it to committee, although my proposal was defeated.
<P>
	I understand the argument made by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the hon. member for 
Western Arctic that the CBC is an independent agency in which 
there should not be government interference. I do not object to that. 
However, it is impossible to maintain an appropriate service and a 
stable service without appropriate funding. It is the Government of 
Canada which provides that funding.
<P>
	I assume that my two colleagues who spoke before me are not 
suggesting that providing funding constitutes interference.
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw their attention to the fact that during the 
1993 election there was a very clear promise from the Liberal 
Party, its members and its leader, that  there would be adequate 
support and maintenance of the CBC.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7703"> 7703 </A></B>
<P>
	I draw my colleague's attention to the definition of the word 
promise from <I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I>. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>an assurance that one will or will not undertake a certain action</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>assure, confirm</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a promise.
<P>
	This Liberal Party promised to support the CBC. Support, 
according to the same dictionary, means ``keep from falling, 
sinking or failing; give strength to or encourage''.
<P>
	I do not think all the people who are speaking out in support of 
CBC can define what the Liberals had meant by supporting the 
CBC because it is certainly falling, certainly sinking and certainly 
failing.
<P>
	That also is at the heart of this argument. There was a clear 
understanding by the Canadian people that the Liberal Party, were 
it to become the government, would support our national 
broadcasting system.
<P>
	The two members from the government side who spoke said that 
they liked the CBC and realized that there are constraints, as we all 
do, but they did not know what they could do as it is an independent 
agency. What they could do is advocate within their caucus, within 
their government and within their cabinet that there be sufficient 
funding for the CBC to continue.
<P>
	Why is it that so many Canadians are speaking out about what is 
happening to the CBC? Are my colleagues on the government side 
suggesting that people like Margaret Atwood, Karen Kain, Atom 
Egoyan and Norman Jewison who have come together with other 
celebrities, Pierre Berton for example, to support the CBC are 
wrong, that they do not know anything and that they do not 
understand the fiscal house? Are we to assume that the group called 
Safe Our CBC does not understand what is happening? Are we to 
understand that Friends of Canadian Broadcasting does not really 
understand the situation in Canada, that the many constituents I 
have heard from and I am sure the member for Western Arctic and 
the Member for Nunatsiaq have heard from do not understand 
Canada?
<P>
	I think they understand Canada very well. I think what they and 
many of us fear is that it will no longer be a vehicle to help 
Canadians understand each other, to define our country to each 
other, to define our culture to each other and to maintain it in a way 
that it will be able to do these things.
<P>
	It is fine to say that we like the CBC. We love the CBC but we 
are not going to advocate for enough stable funding for it to run 
appropriately.
<P>
	I think what all of these groups are trying to say, what I am trying 
to say today and what my colleagues from the  Bloc Quebecois 
were saying is that not only do we have to get our fiscal house in 
order, as we and all of the groups and individuals I mentioned 
understand that, but we also understand that this country is 
important. Some of the institutions will of course be adapting to 
change but some of the institutions like our national broadcasting 
system is what will help to preserve the house.
<P>
	I understand the arguments that are being put forward about 
inference but I think it is a hollow argument, I am sorry to say. It is 
a hollow argument because no one is asking the members across 
the way and the government to interfere with the CBC board. What 
we are asking for is stable funding for Canada's national 
broadcasting system for the preservation of a very important 
Canadian institution which contributes to not only national unity 
but to the development of our culture and understanding of each 
other as Canadians.
