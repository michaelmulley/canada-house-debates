have no militarily useful role, and that additional financial 
support be allocated to Russia to ensure safe and secure

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 150—<B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Minister of Canadian Heritage, or anyone in the Ministry 
of Canadian Heritage, hold consultations with the National 
Association of Japanese Canadians prior to deciding to make the 
changes to the mandate and reporting structure of the Canadian 
Race Relations Foundation that are proposed in Bill C-44, The 
Administrative Tribunals (Remedial and Disciplinary Measures) 
Act, and if so, what were the results of those consultations? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (parliamentary secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  The Department of Canadian Heritage 
did not hold consultations with the National Association of 
Japanese Canadians prior to deciding to make the changes to the 
mandate and reporting structure of the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation proposed in Bill C-44, The Administrative Tribunals 
(Remedial and Disciplinary Measures) Act.  However, when the 
amendments to the Canadian Race Relations Foundation Act were 
first introduced in June 1996 in Bill C-49, The Administrative 
Tribunals (Remedial and Disciplinary Measures) Act, now Bill 
C-44, the honourable Hedy Fry, Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), informed stakeholders, 
including the National Association of Japanese Canadians, NAJC, 
that the government intends to maintain a lead role in race 
relations policy and programming and that amendments are 
necessary to avoid overlap and duplication of efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Canadian Race Relations Foundation Act are 
in keeping with the government's commitment to streamline federal 
boards, agencies and corporations and to make them more 
accountable to the Canadian public.  The amendments will also 
clarify the mandate of the foundation to ensure that it will be 
able to achieve its objectives and that it will efficiently and effectively 
complement the activities of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the changes to the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation Act will make it easier for the Canadian Race 
Relations Foundation to be a significant factor in the resolution 
of race relations issues in Canada.  The proposed amendments do 
not alter our vision of the key role the foundation will play. 
It will be a centre of excellence, a national resource to serve 
the information and research needs of governments, public and 
private institutions, researchers, communities and the general 
public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK44">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to conclude an agreement with 
the provinces and territories, prior to December 31, 1998, and 
based on the unanimous resolution of the provinces as agreed to 
last August 7th at Saskatoon, to strengthen the partnership 
between the federal, provincial and territorial governments in 
order to secure Canada's social programs for the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Since today is the final allotted day 
for the supply period ending December 10, 1998, the House will go 
through the usual procedures to consider and dispose of the 
supply bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of recent practices, do hon. members agree that the bill 
be distributed now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  During the course of today's debate members of the Reform 
Party will be dividing their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in 
support of the supply day motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, as members will note, calls for the government to 
conclude an agreement with the provinces and territories prior to 
the end of the year and to establish a stronger partnership for 
the provision of essential social services such as health care, 
education and social assistance.  It calls for that agreement to 
be based on the unanimous resolution of the provinces as agreed 
at Saskatoon last August 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the motion calls for a positive, timely, 
proactive response by the federal parliament to the demands of 
all provinces for a better and stronger social union.  I do not 
need to tell the House that such a response to the social union 
proposals from the premiers is long overdue and even more urgent 
in light of the provincial election results in Quebec last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a democrat who accepts and respects the results of elections, 
I want to extend congratulations to all those members of the 
Quebec Assembly who were elected yesterday. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate Mr. Bouchard's government on its 
re-election.  Congratulations as well to Mr. Dumont and Action 
démocratique du Québec, which offered Quebeckers a third option 
between sovereigntists and traditional federalists. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate Mr. Charest for fighting a valiant 
campaign with one hand tied behind the his back, a hand tied by 
the actions or more correctly by the inactions of the Prime 
Minister and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is imperative that the federal government and 
parliament send a clear message to all the provinces including 
Quebec that the reform of the federation is essential and a 
national priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, over the past 12 months the federal government has had 
at least three opportunities to send that message and has failed 
to do so.  On November 25, 1997 the official opposition put 
forward a motion endorsing the efforts of the premiers to 
initiate reform of the federation through the Calgary 
declaration, including the seventh point of that declaration 
which pertained to the reform of the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion specifically called for the federal government to 
communicate the Calgary declaration to the people of Quebec and 
to consult them on its contents.  The government supported the 
motion but failed to act on it, missing a golden opportunity to 
communicate to Quebecers the demand for reform of the federation 
in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then on August 7 of this year, after intense negotiation among 
the provinces themselves in which Premier Bouchard also took 
part, the 10 premiers and 2 territorial leaders endorsed 
resolutions calling for a new partnership between the two orders 
of government for the provision of social services including the 
refinancing of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Prime Minister reacted negatively in the press to 
these proposals and his officials have resisted action on several 
of the main points.  Thus there was still no concrete, tangible 
progress to report on reform of the federation when the Quebec 
election was called on October 28.  Yet another missed 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset of the Quebec election there was the Prime 
Minister's infamous interview with <I>La Presse</I> in which he 
implied again that fundamental reform of the federation, in 
particular relations between federal and provincial governments, 
was not an option or a priority.  In other words, the tired old 
song that federalism is good enough as it is, precisely the wrong 
message to send to Quebec at the beginning of a provincial 
election.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three golden opportunities over a 12 month period to send a 
clear message to all provinces including Quebec that reform of 
the federation is a viable option and national priority were all 
missed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the sun still shines on Canada.  Here we find ourselves on 
the day after the Quebec election with yet another opportunity to 
send a message to the people of all the provinces that parliament 
is prepared to respond positively today to the demand for reform 
of the way this federation delivers and finances social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all hon. members that in the final analysis this social 
union is not a constitutional measure.  Nor is it merely some 
subject for academic debate about federal-provincial relations or 
the administration of government programs.  The social union is 
about health, education and support for people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time when federal transfers to the provinces 
have been cut by $7 billion, when hospitals are closing, when 
1,400 doctors have left the country in the last two years, when 
nurses are striking in British Columbia, and when almost 200,000 
people are on waiting lists, the social union is particularly 
about health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premiers call for joint action between themselves and 
the federal government to repair the health care system, when the 
electors of Quebec support joint action to repair the health care 
system, and when our motion today calls for joint action to 
repair the health care system, we are asking the federal 
government to respond to the health care needs of real 
people—somebody's mother, somebody's father, somebody's child, 
somebody's friend—waiting for the government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is asking the federal government to conclude an 
agreement with the provinces this month that will make a 
difference as to how health care is provided and financed in the 
country next year and in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the representations of all the premiers and the 
polls that there is demand in every province for social services 
reform, even if there is still some disagreement about the 
details.  I urge NDP members of the House to support the efforts 
of Premier Romanow and Premier Clark on this issue, to support 
the motion in principle and then argue for their particular 
perspective on the details of the social union at a later time. I 
also urge PC members of the House to support the efforts of 
Premiers Klein, Filmon, Harris and Binns on this issue to do 
likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know from the Angus Reid poll of November 24, conducted 
for Radio Canada in Quebec, that 73% of respondents said that if 
Premier Bouchard were re-elected his priority should be to 
attempt to improve the position of Quebec within Confederation, 
while only 24% said he should commence to gather winning 
conditions for a referendum on sovereignty. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that Bloc Quebecois members will see in this 
motion the major features of the social union motions they 
themselves introduced on October 5 and November 19.  I sincerely 
hope, as well, that Bloc Quebecois members will support this 
motion, because it reflects the wish expressed by Quebec voters 
for immediate priority to be given to social service reforms. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I appeal to government members, indeed to all members 
of the House, not to miss yet another opportunity to provide some 
positive leadership on the issue of social union. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament's job in the coming months will be to create 
winning conditions for all Canadians as we enter the 21st 
century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century there should be winning conditions 
for taxpayers, winning conditions for jobs, winning conditions 
for health care, winning conditions for all our people regardless 
of their language, culture, ethnicity, station in life or where 
they live in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support the motion as a positive step 
toward creating winning conditions for the new Canada of the 21st 
century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. leader of the Reform 
Party.  It concerns the deadline of December 31, 1998.  I wonder 
why this particular deadline. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that it has made the motion much more problematic than 
it needed to be.  My understanding is that the premiers would not 
be happy with a motion passed by the House which required that 
they and the federal government arrive at an agreement by the end 
of this month, given what month it is.  It seems hard to believe 
the motion was put forward with any kind of realistic expectation 
that this could happen, or put forward for that matter 
constructively, knowing how difficult it would be to meet such a 
deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who approach this issue constructively are somewhat 
mystified at why this deadline would be put in the motion.  It is 
not just in respect of the difficulty of meeting the deadline but 
also because of the difficulty of having any due process between 
now and then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the hon. member and his party castigating the rest of 
us for lack of public consultation when it comes to these kinds 
of things.  Does the member really think that between now and 
December 31, 1998 there could be some meaningful public 
consultation, or has he converted to executive federalism? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I will respond in two ways.  First, there is a 
reason for the deadline.  Our understanding is that the premiers 
want this concluded by the end of the year.  The premiers have 
referred to the end of December as a deadline that must be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking for the federal government to respond 
conclusively to the resolutions they passed in August.  They are 
not saying that the legislation, if there is a requirement for 
legislation, has to be in place.  They want a definitive response 
from the federal government by the end of the year to proposals 
which have been on the table for months and months and months. 
That is the reason for the December 31 deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the member's second point, of course we see a place for 
public process but there has to be public process with respect to 
some agreement that is in place.  Until we know the federal 
government's response to the premiers' resolutions, what would we 
discuss with the public in a public discussion at this stage? It 
would be the various options the federal government may pursue. 
We see all sorts of room for process after there has been some 
definitive agreement between the federal and provincial 
governments.  In fact we would insist on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members not to let the time factor be a restraint 
from voting against the motion.  The House has to put some 
pressure on the government, which has been dragging its heels for 
years on this subject, to come to some kind of conclusion now on 
matters that have been before it for months. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talked about how important it is to invest in our 
health care system for the benefit of all.  The member doth 
protest too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the member whose party supports a two tier health care 
system, one for the rich and the leftovers for the rest of 
Canadians.  He is also the leader of the party that wants to 
scrap the Canada Health Act which provides the foundation for the 
quality of health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member reverse his position on two tiered health care 
and on eliminating the Canada Health Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member shows a 
gross and I would suggest a deliberate misunderstanding and 
misrepresentation of the position of the official opposition. Our 
position has always been that health care should be available to 
all Canadians regardless of ability to pay and we do not support 
an American style of health care.  We never have and never will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are open to amendments to the Canada Health Act.  Coming out 
of the social union discussion we may require amendments to the 
health act.  If the member is concerned about the health care 
act, he should be concerned about the violations of it today. One 
of the five criteria of the Canada Health Act which the 
government swears is its number one priority is accessibility to 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility means being able to get health care when one needs 
it.  With 188,000 people on waiting lists, that one criterion of 
the Canada Health Act is being violated tens of thousands of 
times per day.  It is violated not by anything the official 
opposition has done but by the inaction of the federal 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to speak to the motion of 
the Leader of the Opposition about the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate some of the comments that he made regarding 
the need for the federal government to show leadership and to 
acknowledge to Canadians that there is room for reform in the 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to explain what the social union 
is. As the premiers stated in Saskatoon in August, “it is about 
governments working together within their constitutional 
responsibilities to ensure strong and sustainable health, 
education and social services for all Canadians.  It is not about 
more power for one order of government or another”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it quite simply, the social union would mean better 
health care for all Canadians by ensuring that the funding 
arrangements between the federal government and the provinces is 
reformed on the basis of transparency, consistency and 
sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at Saskatoon that the premiers unanimously endorsed the 
social union.  That does not mean that there was not some heated 
debate.  There were concerns expressed by all the provinces. Some 
provinces may have more difficulty with some areas than others, 
but they compromised and they agreed to set a parameter of an 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union has the support of four Progressive 
Conservative premiers.  It has the support of three Liberal 
premiers.  It has the support of two New Democratic Party 
premiers.  And it has the support of the Parti Quebecois premier. 
It crosses all party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the social union was debated in October, it had the support 
of all the opposition parties.  The federal Liberals stand alone 
in their opposition to the social union. One has to question why 
that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Premier Romanow of Saskatchewan put it, “the Canadian social 
union has been challenged in recent years by the unilateral 
actions of the federal government”.  It is time for the federal 
Liberals to accept the evolving relationship between Ottawa and 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The re-election of the Parti Quebecois yesterday has assured 
Canadians that the social union issue will not go away.  We are 
faced with the paradox of the position of Premier Bouchard who on 
the one hand is talking about strengthening the social union 
while on the other hand he is intent on creating the winning 
conditions for a referendum to take Quebec out of the federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Quebeckers have decided to re-elect the Parti 
Quebecois because they believe it to be the party that is best 
able to govern and represent their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also quite clear from the polls that what the large 
majority of Quebeckers want is reform within the Canadian 
federation, with increased control of their personal affairs. 
This is what the Reform Party offers, not only to the Province 
of Quebec, but also to all Canadians from all the provinces and 
territories.  Together, we must work to meet the winning 
conditions for the creation of a new Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this motion should not be seen as a response to 
yesterday's election, it is clear that the federal government has 
allowed Premier Bouchard to gain the momentum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, federalists can once again reclaim the 
initiative that was started by the premiers.  It is with this 
opportunity of supporting this motion that the federalist forces 
in this country can reclaim the position of leading toward a new 
direction in the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can show all Canadians that by strengthening the partnership 
between the two orders of government, by strengthening the social 
union we can improve the federation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers' agreement was not outrageous.  It can in no way be 
construed as an attack on the federal government or federal 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the premiers asked for collaborative arrangements 
on federal spending in areas of provincial-territorial 
jurisdiction. This means that before the federal government 
starts spending money in an area of provincial jurisdiction, the 
federal government should collaborate with the provinces.  How 
can this be construed as an attack on the federation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked my constituents about this in my latest householder. The 
question was:  Do you agree that the federal government should be 
prevented from spending money in provincial jurisdictions without 
the approval of the majority of the provinces?  With over 1,800 
responses to date, over 80% of these respondents said yes.  The 
federal government should be prevented from spending money in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction without the agreement of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers also asked for a new dispute resolution mechanism 
that would prevent disputes and resolve them fairly when they 
arose.  How does this challenge federal powers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces also asked for an opt out provision that would 
allow provinces to opt out of any new or modified Canada-wide 
program with full compensation provided that the province carries 
on a program that addresses the priority areas of the Canada-wide 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers claim that this is an essential dimension of the 
provincial-territorial consensus negotiating position.  The 
premiers are being realistic with this position.  Because our 
country is so diverse, one cannot always impose a one size fits 
all solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union has the unanimous support of the provinces. 
Polls just prior to the Quebec election indicated that 73% of 
Quebecers did not want separation but rather a renewed Canadian 
federation. With this motion, the Reform Party is offering that 
renewed Canadian federation, an opportunity to create the winning 
conditions for a new and stronger Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do wish to put forth the following amendment.  I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the word “House” 
the word “strongly”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

the positions of the various provincial governments with respect

</I></B></P><P align=left>She is also a representative from the province of British 
Columbia.  Would she care to comment on the importance of the 
social union proposals to that great province?  That province

experience on that subject? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia, probably more than many, feels 
very disconnected from the federation, from the central 
government in Ottawa. Often we find ourselves on the other side 
of a situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for the federal government to recognize 
that British Columbia is a growing province and is most likely to 
be the second largest province in the next century.  The federal 
government must recognize that all the provinces have grown up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for this federal government to recognize that in 1867 
the jurisdictions of health, education and social services were 
given to the provinces.  The provinces are ready to assume 
responsibility.  The provinces are asking the federal government 
to acknowledge that they are capable of assuming that 
responsibility and agreeing to the social union.  It clearly 
establishes some rules for this new partnership, with the 
recognition from the federal government of the provinces' ability 
to deliver services, and this new partnership will be confirmed 
with the agreement of the social union.  Because there is a set 
process and regulations to be followed, this will enable the 
provinces to do what they can do best, which is to deliver 
services to their people who would receive the best services 
because they are done by the government closest to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the member, is what we are really talking about 
here not just a warmed over Charlottetown accord which is going 
to give more power to the provinces, weaken the federal 
government and play directly into the hands of separatist Premier 
Lucien Bouchard?  Is that not what they are proposing on the 
other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely not.  There is 
no reason that the federal government would be less strong. All 
we are talking about is an open relationship between the federal 
government and the provinces recognizing the vision the founding 
fathers had of confederation in 1867. There is no way this would 
weaken the federal government any more than it already is by 
telling Canadians that they are not prepared to look at the 
country evolving from 1867, that they are not prepared to look at 
change, that they are not prepared to work with the provinces to 
provide better health care, education, and social services to the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way that this agreement can be considered the same 
as the Charlottetown accord.  I would suggest that with this 
debate and the debate we had on the supply day motion a week ago, 
we are trying to get this government to open up the debate so 
Canadians will have an understanding of what it is we are talking 
about. This House is a good place to start the debate.  It is 
important for all of us to continue this debate out in the public 
and include Canadians in the decision making.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there seems to be one essential question that must be 
asked first of all: Why do we have a federation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion, the suggestion of the Government of Canada, is 
that we have a federation in order to ensure that we are able to 
pursue common objectives within our diversity of experiences. 
Unitary countries can set common objectives, but cannot draw 
upon the wealth of diversity of experience as a federation can. 
Ten self-centred republics to the north of the United States 
could have the diversity of experience, but not the same 
capacity to set common objectives and benefit from each other's 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this because it is natural for provincial governments to 
be concerned primarily by the diversity of experiences, or in 
other words their own autonomy, while still keeping in mind the 
necessity for common objectives.  It is equally natural for the 
federal government to be concerned primarily with common 
objectives, while still keeping in mind the diversity of the 
country.  This is exactly what is happening with the 
negotiations for social union, an issue of extreme importance 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the invitation of the Prime Minister of Canada, primarily, as 
well as the Premier of Saskatchewan, the Prime Minister and the 
premiers, along with the territorial leaders, reached agreement 
on December 12 to try to improve the Canadian social union.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces set out to work together, coming up with a common 
approach only on June 18.  I cannot blame them for taking six 
months; this is a complicated matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada took a month, until July 16, to react. 
The Quebec premier really joined the discussion only on August 
7, and without the leadership of a government in Quebec with a 
belief in Canada, things became more complicated and progress 
slower.  Since then, we have been discussing these two 
propositions together: one from the provinces and one from the 
federal government.  Both are under examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim is not to reach an awkward compromise between the two; 
the aim is to draw out of the two the best possible social 
policy, the best possible framework for a decision so Canadians 
may have the social policies they are entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no easy achievement, because it is an important issue. 
It involves health and the social safety of people in Canada and 
because, what is more, we already have a good social union and 
it is always hard to improve on something good.  I hope that the 
opposition parties will not try to diminish Canada's 
achievements for political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has achieved something good in its social union, without 
a doubt, as it has in the Canadian federation in general.  It is 
a success, when you look at what is going on elsewhere in the 
world.  It is not a work in progress. 
And so it is difficult, and it is not just the Government of 
Canada saying this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study released by the national bureau of economic research of 
Harvard University about the quality of governments compared 150 
governments according to their capacities to deliver good 
services to citizens while respecting their freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada ranked 5th of 150 governments.  It is not so bad.  We 
have to improve something that already is good.  We need to work 
together, especially at this time following a lot of cuts and 
difficulties.  Governments have been able to put their fiscal 
houses in order.  Now together we have to choose good policies. 
It may take time but it is necessary in order to succeed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to link this debate and the unity of our 
country, Canadian unity.  There is, in our opinion, a bad way to 
pose the problem and a good way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad way to pose it is to react as if in a panic under the 
pressure of a separatist threat and as if we were trying to 
appease them with a policy that could be a poor one, but simply 
to placate them—this is what may be called loot politics. 
Separation blackmail and loot politics have no hold on the 
Government of Canada and never will, so long as the government 
is Liberal. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to badly describe it is to call it a power grab. 
The federal and provincial governments both explain that is not 
what is under negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our difficulty arises when the Prime Minister is misquoted, 
especially by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Prime Minister 
never said he does not want to improve the federation, to put 
forward concrete changes.  He said that constitutional change now 
is not the best way to achieve it.  The Leader of the Opposition 
has said the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why invent difficulties where there are none?  I would 
understand the Leader of the Opposition putting pressure on us 
the way he is if the provinces were complaining that the federal 
government is not negotiating completely in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote what Premier Romanow, chairman of the premiers 
conference, said yesterday: “The first order of business is the 
social union, negotiating it as quickly as we can, not under 
artificial deadlines or timetables, doing it with dispatch, doing 
it with determination”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wants to do it.  His ministers want to do it. 
The premiers want to do it.  Premier Bouchard signed on in 
Saskatoon in August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bargaining position of the provinces and the territorial 
governments is what the premiers did.  They set out several 
positions we would like to see implemented in the social union. 
It is a bargaining position.  It is a give and take.  There is 
compromise, flexibility and no artificial deadlines.  I could not 
agree more. 
I have other quotes from premiers saying the same thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now explain why the motion of the Leader of the 
Opposition is unacceptable to the government and I will suggest a 
motion that I hope will be acceptable to all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is that this House strongly urge the government to 
conclude an agreement with the provinces and territories prior to 
December 31, artificial deadline.  We do not need to rush.  We 
need to work cautiously and seriously, based on the unanimous 
resolution of the provinces as agreed at Saskatoon August 7.  I 
am not sure what that means.  Does that mean that if the Leader 
of the Opposition were the Prime Minister of Canada he would sign 
exactly what the provinces are suggesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case he and his party should say that very 
clearly to Canadians.  If it is to negotiate in good faith to see 
if we can improve both federal and provincial proposals we would 
agree, but this is too vague too support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To strengthen the partnership between the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments in order to secure Canada's social 
programs for the future, why do we only want to secure social 
programs?  Do we not want to also improve our social programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would move: 
<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “conclude” and substituting the following therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The best possible agreement with the provinces and territories 
and based on the commitment of first ministers in December 1997 
and affirmed by the provinces at Saskatoon last August 7, to 
strengthen the partnership between the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments in order to secure and improve Canada's 
social programs for the future”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House to move this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there already is an amendment before 
the House, I think it is clear that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs cannot move another amendment right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent to 
allow the minister to move this amendment now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot express strongly enough my disappointment 
in the minister's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was just a litany of reasons for delay.  It reminds me of 
Lincoln's comment on people in his day who said they were in 
favour of the abolition of slavery but could not do it on this 
day, not on that day, not by this way and not by that way.  At 
the end of the day, of course, they really were opposed to the 
change that was being recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister a practical question.  What is 
it in the proposals put forward by the premiers that is the great 
obstacle to bringing this to a successful conclusion? 
Is it the opt out clause, is it the dispute settling mechanism? 
What are the practical things that the federal government simply 
cannot solve in its relations with the provinces that prevent 
this social union agreement from moving ahead?

to suggest bad purposes to others.  We are working to improve 
health care, social policies for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something important but it seems like the Leader of the 
Opposition considers that a power grab from one government to 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I know is we need to improve our capacity to work together, 
the provincial and federal governments.  We are looking at it 
very responsibly. The provinces ask us to do the same. No one 
speaks now about the deadline of December 31.  This is not 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will go ahead to have a good federation.  We will improve 
both the capacity to work together to our shared objectives and 
the capacity for the provinces to experiment in the diversity of 
their own solutions.  It will be a win-win solution for federal 
and provincial governments and above all for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have to ask the minister a question again, and I will do it very 
slowly, because what I heard from him were a couple of notes 
jotted down on a sheet. There was no forethought, there was no 
organization in that.  I suggest he read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow 
to see how little sense that speech actually made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southwest asked him in good faith what is 
the problem, what is the hang-up with the federal government, and 
again more blather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows how serious this issue is.  The government 
can talk about the fact that everything is great in Quebec and in 
every other province. But the government did precious little to 
help the federalist side in the election last night and then the 
minister stands up today as if everything is terrific. It is not. 
We have a separatist government again in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to stand up and say exactly what it is with his 
government that is the hang-up to seeing through this social 
union that every premier in the country wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need a lecture on unity this morning. We need the 
minister to stand up and say what he will do to make sure the 
social union goes through with every premier in the country and 
what his hang-up is. Name it, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the central answer to 
the question is we want something even better than what the 
provinces have suggested for all Canadians.  The provinces agree 
that their current proposal is for negotiation.  It is not 
something they want us to sign as it is.  They want to look at it 
with us as we may improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where is the problem to try to improve something so 
important?  As the hon. member was starting to say in the 
question, if we have a social union why do we have so much 
poverty and unemployment and so on?  It is true we have a lot of 
things to improve in the federation and we will not succeed if we 
do not invent good solutions for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what we need for that.  We need 
imagination and faith in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
off, I would like to congratulate Lucien Bouchard and the Parti 
Quebecois, in whom the people of Quebec put their trust 
yesterday. They will form the next government in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate Jean Charest and the Liberal Party, 
Mario Dumont and the Parti de l'action démocratique, and all 
those who participated in this election, whether or not they got 
elected, illustrating what democracy is all about and how much 
courage is required to take on this task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the government Quebeckers elected 
yesterday is a good government. This was not a referendum. We 
sovereignists never said it would be. The federalists in Quebec 
were the ones who held it would be a referendum election. They 
will have to live with that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never made any such assertion. We are asserting, however, 
that it is indeed a sovereignist government that the people of 
Quebec elected yesterday, confirming the decision they had made 
in the 1994 provincial election and in federal elections, first 
in 1993 and again in 1997, with more than 60% of the members 
from Quebec in this House being sovereignists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, today, we must realize that, from across Canada and 
also from Quebec yesterday everywhere, a clear message has been 
sent to Ottawa. It concerns social union. This has been a 
traditional demand of Quebec's for over 50 years. That is why I 
was somewhat amazed to hear the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs state that the motion before us was a panic reaction. 
This is an issue that has been debated for 50 years, and we are 
told this morning that it is a panic reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a little surprised to hear him tell us that this was 
an artificial deadline. It is strange that this government 
insisted so much on Quebec taking part in these negotiations, 
considering that, since 1994, the PQ government was present at 
the negotiation table 89% of the time, while from 1990 to 1994, 
the provincial Liberals were present only 23% of the time. This 
is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government kept telling the PQ government to take 
part in the negotiations, because it was important to settle the 
issue. That was before the election. Now, less than 24 hours 
after the results came in, this government says “This is not 
urgent. Why all the fuss?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did hear Roy Romanow yesterday and I am very disappointed by 
the attitude of the NDP today, because there are NDP 
governments—I can think of Mr. Clark and Mr. Romanow—that 
insisted on Quebec taking part in these negotiations, and that 
saw how important it was to settle this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue goes back a long time. I said 50 years, which includes 
not only Maurice Duplessis, but also Jean Lesage, René Lévesque 
and Robert Bourassa. These people were from various backgrounds 
and represented different parties. However, they all shared the 
same view on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Jean Lesage who, in 1960, said the 
following and certainly not because he was panic-stricken: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This full financial compensation with the right to opt out 
should take the form of additional taxation rights, specifically 
reserved for the provincial governments, and of corresponding 
equalization payments. Each province would be free to dispose of 
these revenues as it pleases, within its own jurisdictions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daniel Johnson senior added the following in 1966: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec hopes that it will be understood once and for all that, 
for socio-cultural reasons, it insists wholly and absolutely on 
its constitutional areas of jurisdiction being respected and 
accepts no federal interference in those areas, whether direct 
or indirect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970, Robert Bourassa, who can most certainly not be 
suspected of any sovereignist leanings, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec continues to believe that this federal spending power in 
areas that come under exclusive provincial jurisdiction ought 
quite simply not to exist, and the federal government would do 
well to quite simply renounce it totally. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not panic speaking, it was a clear judgement by Robert 
Bourassa.  In 1978, René Lévesque added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec believes that federal spending powers ought to be 
restricted only to those areas listed as exclusive or joint 
federal responsibilities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Quebec has been saying clearly for 50 years.  Today 
in Quebec this is a view that is held not only by the Parti 
Quebecois, which will form the next government as a result of 
yesterday's election, but is also shared by Mr. Charest of the 
Liberal Party and Mr. Dumont.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy of the sovereignists, along with that of the 
federalists, and indeed of all leaders of political parties in 
Quebec, all those who are politically active in Quebec, with the 
exception of the federal Liberal Party and the members of that 
party from Quebec who sit in this House, such as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, shows that we have the interests of 
Quebec at heart.  What is being practiced here is not the 
politics of the worst case scenario, which is the worst kind of 
politics.  We are acting in defence of Quebeckers' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor are we engaged in a kind of blackmail, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said earlier.  Good heavens, 
sovereignist policy has never had anything to do with holding a 
knife to anyone's throat. 
It was first expressed by Léon Dion, the father of the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, and in pretty clear terms.  Today, 
they are trying to convince us that it was the sovereignists who 
did so.  We must get back a bit closer to the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the minister does not appreciate being confronted with 
reality, but that is what was said, and history will prove it. 
The sovereignists have never applied this policy.  We were 
clear.  We are here to defend our interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we believe in sovereignty, and it is our right to do so, 
just as others have the right to believe in federalism. 
That is not what we are debating today because, for once, 
federalists and sovereigntists are in agreement, the parties 
here—I hope that the NDP will rethink its position—because Mr. 
Clark is a New Democrat, Mr. Romanow is a New Democrat, Mr. 
Harris, Mr. Klein and Mr. Filmon are Progressive Conservatives, 
the Reform Party, the Progressive Conservative Party here, Jean 
Charest, Mario Dumont, Lucien Bouchard, almost everyone except, 
once again, the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who but this government is preventing the provinces and the 
federal government from changing for the benefit of all 
Quebeckers and Canadians?  It sings the same old song at every 
referendum, makes up all sorts of stories before a federal 
election, and then, the morning after, tells us there is no rush 
to resolve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months, we heard quite the opposite.  Now they tell us no 
action is necessary.  We say something has to be done and done 
fast. As the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out, 
we are not talking about a constitutional amendment.  We are 
talking about an administrative agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this urgent?  Because there is a budget in the offing. 
Because there are surpluses:  $10.4 billion that the government 
has built up over the first six months by dipping into the 
pockets of the unemployed, by helping itself to money that 
should go to the provinces for post-secondary education, welfare 
and health, particularly health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the budget is brought down and if we do not reach an 
agreement making it possible to opt out with full compensation, 
we will see this government again launch into a spiral of 
reckless spending that will saddle us with new deficits, again 
interfering in provincial jurisdiction, having slashed health 
care funding throughout Canada with dangerous results, and 
swooping in to rescue us at the last minute, with assurances 
that Ottawa knows best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had it.  We are fed up.  That is the long and the short 
of it.  And that was the message sent by Quebeckers yesterday. 
And it is the message being sent by the 10 premiers.  And I hope 
it is the message of all opposition parties worthy of the name 
in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc Quebecois not supporting the motion because the Bloc 
Quebecois is on the same wavelength as the Reform Party and the 
Reform Party is on the same wavelength as the Bloc Quebecois?  It 
is sovereignty and it is separation that the Reform Party is 
supporting here.  We can see this clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I support the motion for 
one main reason.  It is because almost everybody in Canada is 
supporting the motion and also in Quebec.  All provinces are 
supporting the motion.  The only people in Canada who are not 
supporting the motion are sitting on that side of the House, and 
they are on a one-way to a dead end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I did not mean my rising to cause a mass exodus on the part of 
the Bloc, but while the member who asked the last question is 
still in the House I want to begin by saying that it is a 
profound mistake to caricature this debate as one between 
separatists and federalists, or between those who somehow support 
the agenda of the Bloc and those who do not.  There is a degree 
of support within a variety of federalists in the country for the 
whole notion of a social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be profoundly cheap in the political sense or 
intellectually vacant to try to caricature the debate as somehow 
having to do with who supports the separatists and who does not. 
There may be a convergence of views among the Reform, the Bloc 
and others, but I do not think this is the appropriate way to 
portray the debate on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a convergence of a number of things.  We have the 
convergence of the view of the Reform Party which has always been 
for a more decentralized Canada, a Canada in which the federal 
spending power is much more restricted than it has traditionally 
been, and the view of the Bloc which is a traditional Quebec 
position whether or not one is a separatist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Liberal government, far from the 
provinces being the ones who have destroyed or are destroying the 
power of the strong central government, has systematically 
weakened and destroyed the power of the federal government in the 
federation by acting unilaterally and unfairly, by withdrawing 
from various programs and by acting in a way to weaken its power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any sense to demonize the provinces.  It is the 
federal government that has been destroying its own status and 
its own power in the country by way of withdrawing from the 
partnerships it established, particularly with respect to 
medicare and in a variety of other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a convergence of what I would say is the Bloc and Reform 
views of a more decentralized federation and a weakened federal 
government, with the reality being that the federal government is 
systematically weakening itself and converging with the reality 
that the provinces have to deal with the federal withdrawal from 
medicare, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces are saying they need some other way of dealing with 
this matter.  They cannot continue to imagine that they are in 
some kind of idealistic partnership when in fact they are in no 
partnership at all.  They are constantly subject to the 
unilateral actions of a federal government which does not 
collaborate with them.  It does not co-operate with them.  It 
does not endeavour to set up ways of dealing with these problems. 
They want a less conflictual federation, the kind of conflict we 
see all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister thrives on this kind of conflict.  I do not think 
he is particularly helpful in the way he deals with it.  He could 
have answered the questions asked of him in a much more helpful 
way than giving us the usual Liberal diatribe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union, as I understand it, comes out of two things. 
It comes out of the anxiety of the premiers after the referendum 
of 1995 that there was no federal leadership.  They needed to do 
at least what they could do to provide a context in which 
Quebecers who want to make the country work could see that others 
in the country wanted to make the country work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anxiety about lack of federal leadership continues to this 
day. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a paucity of federal leadership when it comes to 
this file.  On top of that is the fact that the federal 
government in its budget of 1995 virtually withdrew from the 
partnership it had established over the years with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have these two factors which I think put the premiers on 
the road to Saskatoon last August.  I think there is great merit 
in their proposals and great merit in trying to build a less 
conflictual confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the federal government has the authority any more 
to unilaterally set standards in health care if it is not going 
to pay the tune.  If the federal government is only paying 6 
cents or 15 cents on the dollar, or whatever it is, depending on 
whose figures we believe, it just does not have it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government would put the money back in, speak with 
authority and go back to the old system.  But if the government 
is not going to put the money back in it cannot do it.  It means 
that it has to sit down with the provinces and work something out 
instead of belabouring this with all of its tired, old rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some concerns about the social union and about the 
motion.  We still think the December 31, 1998 deadline is not 
helpful and not something which the chairman of the premiers 
supports.  But we also have concerns with the Saskatoon agreement 
itself and I want to put those on the record.  They are not 
insurmountable things.  They are things that could disappear in 
the course of the negotiations between the provinces and the 
federal government.  I hope they would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our particular concern is with respect to the language of opting 
out, with compensation, out of new or modified Canada-wide 
programs.  There is nothing new about new.  “New programs” was 
in Meech.  “New programs” was in Charlottetown.  But modified 
Canada-wide programs would open up the door to a situation in 
which at some point there could be changes to the Canada Health 
Act or changes to something else with respect to medicare that 
could allow some provinces to argue that medicare was now a 
modified program and, therefore, they had the right to opt out of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say, in spite of our desire to be agreeable and 
constructive and to see the merits of the social union and the 
merits of the provincial arguments on this score, that the 
federal NDP will never agree to a social union which opens the 
door to opting out of medicare by provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it is important to get the social union so 
that we do not have a situation in which provinces might decide 
to opt out anyway.  Because at some point, if it is only 6 cents 
or 15 cents on the dollar, why would some provinces which feel 
they could afford it not say that they might as well go it alone? 
Then they would not have to put up with all of the rules from 
these guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the danger, this is the precipice that this Liberal 
government has led us to with respect to medicare and other 
programs.  By so weakening the federal presence in the existing 
social union we now have these proposals before us which, in many 
ways, we would not have if we had significant, real and inspired 
leadership from the federal government on the unity file and in 
respect of maintaining a decent federal presence in these social 
programs.  But we do not have that and so we have the situation 
which is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that we have has to do with the status of 
aboriginal people in respect of the social union.  There is a 
concern on the part of the aboriginal leadership that the 
fiduciary responsibility which the federal government has for 
aboriginal people is not dealt with in any of the social union 
documents that have come forward so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly seems to me that this is something which has to be 
addressed in some way or another if we are to conclude an 
agreement at some time.  At the moment the provinces and the 
federal government do not take this into account at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the leader of the Reform Party why he wanted an 
agreement by December 31, 1998 and he said that he wanted a 
federal response.  The motion does not say “Let us have a 
federal response by December 31, 1998”, it says “conclude an 
agreement”.  That is not just a federal response, it is an 
agreement between the federal government and the provincial 
governments.  That is why that continues to be such an 
unrealistic proposal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I share many of the points of view that have been 
expressed by the hon. member, except for the usual debate we have 
about the role of the Liberal government.  He knows what we will 
answer to his critiques.  We will say, as is the case, that if we 
take into account the tax points, the federal government cut much 
more from its own programs than it did in transfers to the 
provinces.  If we had not done that, our social union would be in 
pretty bad shape today.  We would have a huge deficit, no 
economic growth and so on.  But I do not think this is the matter 
of debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is on how to improve the federation in terms of 
aspects that are so important to Canadians, social policies and 
health.  As the member has said, the answer is to invent ways for 
governments to work together, in partnership, in a more efficient 
way.  This needs imagination and faith.  We must stop demonizing 
the provinces and the federal government, as well as the games of 
the separatists and so on.  We must stop unilateral action and we 
must work together as much as possible.  That is why we invented 
the CHST and that is why we have said that we will not 
unilaterally decide on new programs like home care or pharmacare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is the same as the question I 
asked the Leader of Opposition, who did not answer it.  Would he 
sign the proposal of the provinces as it is, or would he consider 
it, as the provinces are asking us to do, as a base for 
negotiation in order to improve the social union? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe the minister was 
speaking to his parliamentary secretary while I was speaking.  I 
made it quite clear that the NDP would not sign the Saskatoon 
agreement as it now stands.  I went into great detail about how 
we objected to the language of new or modified Canada-wide social 
programs.  The first dumb question of the day.  I just explained 
why we would not sign the Saskatoon agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that they brought in the CHST in order to 
solve these problems.  I am saying that the CHST is a form of the 
very unilateralism that the social union, in its best intention, 
is designed to overcome.  We have had one unilateral action after 
the other, going back to the MacEachen budget of 1982, which was 
the first time the EPF transfers were cut unilaterally by a 
Liberal government.  The Tories said that they would never do 
such a thing.  Then they were elected in 1984 and the first thing 
Jake Epp did was unilaterally cut the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but I am 
going to unilaterally cut the member off because we have two 
minutes for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his talk.  I 
would ask him not to get too hung up on the deadline, mainly in 
light of the minister's response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member sees the resistance on the part of the 
government to moving forward on this at all.  Our reason for 
putting the deadline was to try to create pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that maybe we should ask for a federal 
response.  I know what the member is getting at, but he has seen 
the federal response.  It is pure mush.  It does not drive to a 
conclusion.  I would ask the member to reconsider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers added a modifying clause to the opt out clause. 
They added:  “provided that the province or territory carries on 
a program or initiative that addresses the priority areas of the 
Canada-wide program”.  The member is aware of that proviso.  Did 
that help him at all in his objection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not saying that the 
motion would be better if it asked for a federal response.  I was 
saying that when I asked the member a question about the 
deadline, he talked about a federal response instead of talking 
about the language that is actually in the motion, which is to 
conclude an agreement.  I was not asking for a federal response; 
it was the member himself in responding to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modified opt out clause is not good enough for us when it 
comes to medicare.  We entertain no notion by which it would be 
possible for provinces to opt out of medicare.  We can see the 
possibility for new programs, et cetera, but we consider medicare 
to be beyond reproach and beyond the reach of any new 
arrangements with respect to the social union.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the federal government do what we think it 
should do, which is to re-establish its credibility and its moral 
authority in this area by putting back at least $2.5 billion into 
the federal transfers and not the piddling $1 billion that may be 
called for by the finance committee.  This is something that the 
government should do if it wants to bargain in good faith and 
show Canadians that it really means it when it talks about—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again the opposition parties are the ones raising the issue of 
social union in this House. It is very difficult to advance this 
issue federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will probably recall that the Bloc Quebecois introduced 
a similar but more detailed motion whose intent was the same: to 
spur the federal government to action. Between the Bloc 
Quebecois motion and today's Reform motion, a meeting chaired by 
the Minister of Justice was held in Edmonton, if I am not 
mistaken, with the intergovernmental affairs ministers of all 
the provinces. It seems to have helped provide both sides with a 
clearer understanding but nothing has come of it. 
That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs alluded 
to a federal government proposal. Which proposal? I would like 
the minister to give us an example or two. I would like to know 
the status of the federal government's proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He should table it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> I cannot force him to table it; he has not 
put it on the record yet. If he agrees to do so, then House 
rules will apply and the minister will introduce his proposal in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the minister and the government would provide more 
details. There is no substance; this is an empty proposal. There 
are numerous concerns and the government does not seem to 
understand how important social union is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a two-way street. 
Our NDP colleague who just spoke was quite reticent.  He does 
not really understand what a social union is either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Quebec election campaign, we saw that the Premier of 
Quebec also perhaps interpreted what he signed in his own way. 
He quoted only one or two paragraphs of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear about the famous right to opt out and have 
the minister read the federal proposal on opting out.  What 
Quebec, with Premier Bouchard, understands is that opting out 
includes full compensation, but not obligation.  The Saskatoon 
agreement does not say that, however.  There is no automatic, 
universal and unquestioned right to opt out.  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules are set when a new program is created or an old one 
modified, and the government says to the provinces—I said this 
in October on the subject of the Bloc motion, and I say it 
again—there is the right to opt out of the administration of a 
program, but there is an obligation to change or establish a 
program in line with what was negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system of national standards is set up, in the end.  Some in 
Quebec will react angrily to that, naturally, but this is what 
is to be found in the document on social union. We can agree 
with that or not. However, could we have the minister's position 
and a quote from his document on opting out—an important 
element in the respect of jurisdictions and the administrative 
capabilities of the provinces and regions?  Could we have a bit 
of information? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element is the matter of the veto, which is not a 
veto. 
That is in the document as well, and it requires consent.  If 
there is no consent, a veto applies.  After the veto comes the 
right to compensation.  But what is that?  Could we hear from 
the government on that?  Could we make progress on the matter of 
the social union? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we not involve the parliamentarians in this House?  Would 
the government not agree to strike a committee comprising all 
parties?  We could agree, first, to explain what is meant by 
social union and see whether we agree on the definitions.  We 
could quickly set up an all party committee.  Perhaps we have 
some good ideas on both sides of the House to move things 
forward a bit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister could surely propose good ideas and be open to the 
good ideas of the opposition, and we would know what is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in every riding ask us “What is this social union?” We 
try to get into the specifics. We tell them “It is a document 
that was prepared by the provinces”. This morning, the minister 
told us that there is also a federal document, a federal 
proposal. Does such a document actually exist? Is this just 
rhetoric or is there really a written document? If there is such 
a document, could it be distributed among parliamentarians? That 
would be important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the wording of the Reform motion, it goes without saying 
that we cannot disagree with the notion of social union. The 
Conservative Party has been discussing this issue for two years, 
but our approach is much more comprehensive. We talk about a 
social and economic union, about what we call the Canada pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have been discussing this issue for a long time. It 
was an integral part of the Conservative Party's platform during 
the 1997 election campaign. We would like things to move forward 
a little. They do at the provincial level and they should at the 
federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's motion stems from yesterday's election in 
Quebec. Yesterday, the Reform Party was preparing for action. It 
sent an opposition motion and then changed it. The Reform Party 
changed its mind. It prepared another motion on a different 
issue. All this is not very serious. It lacks credibility. 
Social union is so important. 
This is part of the everyday lives of Quebeckers and of 
Canadians.  Credibility and seriousness are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the December 31 deadline, unfortunately, I have my 
Christmas shopping to do, and I am not alone in that.  It is 
December now.  A government has just been elected in Quebec . 
Some outcomes will be contested, which will not change much, but 
still.  Before a new cabinet is sworn in at Quebec City, weeks 
will go by.  Is it not a bit irresponsible on the part of the 
Reform Party to propose this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I understand the idea.  Mr. Bouchard spoke about a December 
31 deadline.  I understand the other provinces, but would we in 
this House have any credibility—at least on this side—if we said 
“We will put in the dates that work best”? 
I feel this is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>December 31 is all very fine.  The Leader of the Official 
Opposition told my NDP colleague “there is no point getting all 
caught up in dates”.  Even without getting all caught up in 
dates, it is still important.  When legislation comes into 
effect, like Bill C-68 on firearms, it is important.  A date is a 
date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have problems with the matter of a date.  I have a lot of 
problems as well with what possessed the Reform Party to bring 
into this House a less detailed proposal than that made by our 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues in October. 
Being more detailed, ours forced the government to address 
matters in greater detail, as we are trying to do again this 
morning, and to get some answers, to find out what is going on: 
Is the general store open or closed?  Can customers enter or 
not?  What is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not really know what is happening with social union.  What 
we hear from the government is “We shall see, there is no hurry, 
negotiations are under way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion by the Reform Party is like the feel-good Barney 
song “I love you, you love me”.  But we cannot get any details 
on it. I feel we could have pushed a bit harder on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with the December 31 date.  It is not 
credible.  It could have been signed in September or perhaps in 
October. 
There was nothing from the federal government, but now it is 
right before the holidays, a new government has just been 
elected in Quebec.  Give it some time.  Will Mr. Facal still be 
Quebec's minister of intergovernmental affairs?  I think he 
will.  Mr. Facal himself said he had had a good meeting in 
Edmonton. Could the government not demonstrate a bit more 
credibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House to move an amendment. 
It will perhaps not be along the lines of what the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs suggested this morning, but it will 
reflect the New Democrats' concerns.

seconded by the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche.  I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the words “prior to December 31, 1998” be deleted and 
replaced with “prior to the next federal budget”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important. 
The provinces are worried about the next federal budget and the 
next throne speech.  I am asking that, prior to the next federal 
budget, prior to the next throne speech and prior to the next 
cabinet shuffle, the federal government, the Minister of 
Finance, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Prime 
Minister reach an agreement with the provinces that would then 
be reflected in the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a minor amendment and takes nothing away from social 
union, the Reform Party or any other party, or the government. 
What we are saying is that, with the prospect of a budget of 
over $140 billion that refers to transfer payments and 
federal-provincial relations, and a throne speech in which new 
programs will be announced, would it be possible to have an 
agreement prior to the next federal budget and throne speech?

and some action, and we are seeking the unanimous consent of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member rightly pointed out that the December 
31 deadline was totally unrealistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it must be remembered that it was on December 12, 1997 
that the Prime Minister and the Premier of Saskatchewan 
convinced their counterparts to go ahead with improving the 
social union. The provinces came up with their own proposals in 
mid-June. The federal government replied in mid-July. The Premier 
of Quebec only got on board in early August. Without the 
leadership of the Premier of Quebec, things are much more 
complicated. Since then, an election was called in Quebec, and 
that also slowed things down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are negotiating rather intensely. 
I remind the hon. member that his party was in office for eight 
or nine years and never proposed such measures. They tried the 
Meech Lake accord, but I would remind him that in the throne 
speech of February 1996, the federal government agreed to make a 
move and to improve the use of its spending power more 
significantly than under the Meech Lake accord. We are already 
in the post-Meech era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for getting parliament involved, I quite agree, but again 
this is a matter of stages. Right now, negotiations are taking 
place between governments. There is not a single provincial 
government that would agree to discuss these negotiations in 
committee in its own legislature. Again, this is simply a matter 
of going step by step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also point out that the provinces' proposal was not made 
public by the provinces, but was leaked to the media, which is 
very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have a question for the hon. member. It is the same 
question I put, in vain, to the leader of the official 
opposition, who did not answer, and the same one I put to the 
NDP member, who did reply. If they were in office today, would 
the Progressive Conservative leader, Mr. Clark, and his party 
sign the provinces' proposal as it stands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would invite the minister to 
reread the Progressive Conservative Party's 1997 election 
platform.  It is very clear.  In our opinion, the proposal on 
social union must go much further.  We are also thinking about 
the economic union.  If the federal government were open, we 
could talk of social union and resolve it and talk of economic 
union as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matters go even further.  The social union under consideration 
also requires a number of federal departments to move.  I remind 
you that the ministers of finance of all the provinces asked the 
federal government in May and June in the negotiations on social 
union for money and a five-year commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that we agree with the social union as 
proposed. 
However, it must include a financial commitment from the 
Minister of Finance, as proposed at the time of the agreement in 
May and June, and must, in our opinion, also deal with the 
matter of economic union.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, Mr. Clark and the Progressive Conservative Party 
have no problem with social union.  It is a document that 
warrants being translated into law, into regulations, but it 
suits us fine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the member of the Conservative Party to clarify the time 
frame contemplated with respect to social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion clearly states an agreement must be reached prior to 
December 31, 1998, and its purpose is to ensure that the next 
federal budget will not contain, as last year's budget did, 
initiatives like the millennium scholarships, which are not in 
keeping with the Saskatoon declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the time of year when the federal budget is being 
prepared. The longer the time frame is, the more likely the 
government is to hide behind the fact that the budget is 
prepared ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to understand the member's position with respect to 
the time frame, while at the same time hoping that an agreement 
can be reached by the end of December. I would also like to know 
whether he wants the next federal budget to be in keeping with 
the spirit of the Saskatoon declaration, so the government does 
not pull another stunt like the millennium scholarships, but 
this time around with new initiatives in health care or in other 
fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to determine whether he is making it clear to the 
government that it better not make another mistake like the 
millennium scholarships in other provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are indeed going further. Far from being closed, the matter 
of the millennium scholarships is in fact on the table, as part 
of the negotiations on social union. In our opinion, the 
millennium scholarships are not in keeping with the agreement 
signed by Pearson and Lesage in the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone should keep the issue of social union in mind and 
remember that the millennium scholarships will have to be 
reconsidered in light of the agreement with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the December 31 deadline, to suggest such a date 
before the next budget has been described as a cynical move. If 
an agreement is reached before the next budget, I think 
including it will not be a problem. If the government is 
committed to reaching an agreement before the next budget, it 
will have a potential agreement in mind while preparing its 
budget, as we will see in the throne speech. 
The throne speech may very well do a great deal of damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding all this, I agree with my colleague that the 
next budget must respect, if not the letter, at least the spirit 
of social union, the spirit of the Canadian pact. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to express my support for the opposition motion before us. I 
will read the motion, to make sure it is well understood: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to conclude an agreement 
with the provinces and territories, prior to December 31, 1998, 
and based on the unanimous resolution of the provinces as agreed 
to last August 7th at Saskatoon, to strengthen the partnership 
between the federal, provincial and territorial governments in 
order to secure Canada's social programs for the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 25, 1997, the official opposition moved a motion 
supporting the efforts made by the provincial premiers to reform 
the federation with the Calgary declaration, including the 
seventh point of that declaration, dealing with a reform of the 
social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion specifically asked the federal government to promote 
public awareness of the Calgary declaration in Quebec and to 
hold consultations on this issue. I personally questioned the 
Prime Minister on several occasions regarding his plans to 
consult Quebeckers, but he did not reply and he did not take any 
measures to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government supported the motion, but did not take the 
necessary measures, thus missing a golden opportunity to make 
Quebeckers aware of the fact that other Canadians want to reform 
our federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, on August 7, after intense negotiations between the 
provinces, in which Lucien Bouchard took part, the ten premiers 
and the two territorial leaders supported the resolutions for a 
new partnership between the two levels of government regarding 
the delivery of social services, including the refinancing of 
health care services.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister did, however, react negatively to these 
proposals, and his colleagues refused to act on a number of the 
most important points.  There was not yet any concrete and 
tangible progress toward reform of the federation when the 
Quebec election was called on October 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an Angus Reid poll on November 24, conducted in Quebec for 
Radio-Canada, 73% of respondents said that if Premier Bouchard 
were re-elected, his priority should be to attempt to improve the 
position of Quebec within Confederation, while only 24% said he 
should commence to gather “winning conditions” for a referendum 
on sovereignty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the government and all members of the 
House that we have a great opportunity to put partisan politics 
aside and to put Canada first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion outlines exactly what we would like the government to 
do, to give a response to the premiers of all the provinces that 
want a response before the end of the year as to whether or not 
the conditions outlined in the Saskatoon agreement are in line 
with what the government believes should be reformed in the 
federation for the future. It is a simple request on behalf of 
the official opposition. I believe that all members of the House 
see the value of this simple request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, when we see what happened last night in the province 
of Quebec, when we see the feelings that exist right across the 
country with regard to the way the federation functions in its 
current state, especially with regard to the relationship between 
the provincial governments and the federal government, there is a 
real need and desire for positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers have done this on two occasions, first with the 
Calgary declaration and now with their meeting in Saskatoon. They 
are urging the federal government as are we in the official 
opposition to either concur or give some sort of response whether 
or not the federal government agrees with this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition have said that we believe this is 
a positive start.  These are exactly the ideas that need to be 
talked about when it comes to the balance of power in the country 
and the way relationships exist between the federal government 
and the provincial governments.  It is obvious that sort of 
sentiment exists right across the country, not just in Quebec 
where again we see people are not happy with the status quo as we 
saw last night with the election results. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would appeal to the government members, indeed all 
members, not to miss yet another opportunity to provide some 
positive leadership on the issue of the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of this Parliament in the months ahead is to create 
winning conditions for all Canadians as we enter the 21st 
century, winning conditions for taxpayers, winning conditions 
for jobs, winning conditions for health care, winning conditions 
for all our people regardless of their language, culture, 
ethnicity, station in life, or where they live in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to see support of this motion as a 
positive step toward creating winning conditions for the new 
Canada of the 21st century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you will hear from all my hon. colleagues, we 
are happy to put forward the motion.  As the Leader of the 
Opposition has said, despite the timeline that we put within the 
motion and which has also been outlined by the premiers, we feel 
that it is very important that the government finally take some 
leadership on the issue.  It must put forward a response to give 
some encouragement to the premiers for the hard work they have 
done in trying to reform the federation to help us take it into 
the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given what the member has said, does he agree that the 
federal government and the provinces should certainly negotiate 
and try to come up with a more effective social union, but would 
he not agree that it should not be at the price of weakening the 
federal government's influence in the lives of Canadians?  We 
have to keep the federal government strong.  Would he not agree 
with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to entertain 
the hon. member's question, but because the federal government 
has remained so strong and many people feel that it has neglected 
especially the regional issues and concerns in this country, the 
answer is not to continue strengthening only the federal 
government.  As the official opposition and the premiers are 
putting forward, it is time to look at rebalancing the powers 
that exist between the federal government and the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might mean that we would not only just strengthen the areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, but at the same time strengthen the 
areas of jurisdiction which are solely federal. It is not just 
unilaterally looking at the federal government and saying we 
should have a strong federal government and neglect the provinces 
as this government has done, but looking at the way to strengthen 
the balance of power that exists between the provincial 
governments and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have outlined that in our new Canada act. The premiers have 
outlined how to do that in their deliberations.  I would 
encourage the hon. member not just to look at it as unilaterally 
strengthening the federal government, but to look at how to 
balance that relationship as the whole country is calling out 
for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member and other members in his party use health care as an 
example of one of the areas in which they want to balance the 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask again whether the member supports his party in its 
position that there should be the option to have a two tier 
health care system where the rich could pay for the health 
services that they want and whatever is left over, the residuals, 
would be left for the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what he calls rebalancing the federation, by allowing 
the dismantling of the Canada Health Act and allowing a two tier 
health system, or does he have some other explanation of how he 
is going to balance that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition attempted to answer this question 
earlier in the debate and I am happy to do so once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we currently have a problem in our health care 
system.  The only ones in the House who do not want to face up to 
that fact are the members opposite.  They have cut billions of 
dollars out of the transfers in health care. The only thing the 
official opposition has ever said with regard to health care, and 
I know the Leader of the Opposition reiterated it, is that we 
want to have access to health care for everyone within our 
Canadian system.  We want to strengthen that. It might mean that 
we have to allow some flexibility under the current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just not acceptable when 1,400 doctors are going south and 
there are over 188,000 people on waiting lists. Obviously there 
is a problem.  The government has neglected its commitment on 
transfers to health care and it is leaving no other options for 
the provinces to deal with that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment is to a national health care system.  There is no 
doubt about it.  We should look at that system and see how we can 
provide health care much more effectively.  If that means 
flexibility to some extent with the Canada Health Act, then so be 
it.  But we need to be able to provide the same standards to 
everyone across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I 
understand the Reform Party in this motion, it is that the House 
of Commons of Canada should accept, without question and without 
any attempt to negotiate, the position of all the provinces.  Is 
that truly the position it is putting forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would 
read the motion as it stands, it says that we urge the government 
to conclude an agreement with the provinces and territories prior 
to December 31, 1998.  That does not mean to accept it in its 
current form.  Even we as the official opposition have some 
concerns with the current agreement but we feel it is a positive 
initiative.  We feel it should be entertained in this House.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the premiers have asked, we should be giving the response to 
them by the deadline they have outlined.  The government has 
known about this agreement for a number of months now.  We cannot 
continue to wait.  We have to act.  That is what the official 
opposition motion deals with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this afternoon to speak on a topic that is important to all 
of us, national unity.  National unity takes on a special 
significance today given the results of yesterday's election in 
which a party dedicated to the break-up of our country was 
re-elected in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Government of Quebec will attempt to say that it 
has been given a mandate to hold a referendum and begin the 
departure from Canada, I beg to differ.  I believe Quebecers have 
made a choice of good governance and not separation.  Poll after 
poll indicates that Quebecers do not want another referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Quebec is looking for what he calls the winning 
conditions for separation.  We must ensure that the only winning 
condition which exists is that of Canada. It is time that we all 
rise to this challenge and create the climate for winning 
conditions for Canada.  All Canadians must work together to 
ensure that there is not another referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is a political one and parliament has a very 
important role to play.  We must give all Quebecers and all 
Canadians a reason to believe in our country.  We must show them 
that Canada can work.  This is a wake-up call for the Government 
of Canada.  It is time for it to be proactive.  A Liberal 
government cannot take the stance it took in the last referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Canada there are options and ideas on the table.  The 
official opposition has already presented the new Canada act. 
Today's motion contains a framework for Canada as we enter into 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is committed to ensure that every 
attempt is made to avoid the break-up of the country that we love 
so much.  Canadians from coast to coast share the same view.  We 
have seen the Calgary declaration garner support from almost all 
provinces.  We have also seen the provinces make tremendous 
progress on the issue of the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a rare opportunity for co-operation between provinces. 
We must seize this golden opportunity for a new era of 
federal-provincial co-operation that will benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel that the Calgary declaration and the social union 
will give Quebecers a reason to believe in this country.  The 
time for rhetoric and feel good statements is over.  It is time 
for this government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what we are discussing today.  The social union 
negotiations which are currently taking place between the federal 
government and its provincial counterparts are a tremendous step. 
First, we have seen a unanimous provincial consent on the issue 
of the social union.  This is significant given the ideological 
and partisan differences which exist among our provinces. Second, 
the social union will afford the provinces the right to create 
programs tailored to their individual needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk of social union, what exactly are we referring to? 
We are referring to a new system where the provinces would have 
greater freedom to design social programs to fit their individual 
character.  There needs to be more federal-provincial 
consultation in the design of social programs and a collaborative 
approach to the use of federal spending powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces should be given the ability to opt out of programs and 
receive compensation as long as they implement a program which 
addresses the specific needs.  It is clear that in certain areas 
national standards are needed, but national standards do not 
necessarily mean federal standards.  They need to be developed 
jointly with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When disagreements do occur, a dispute settlement process is 
needed which is not dominated by one side.  Perhaps more 
important, a social union is needed so that the federal 
government cannot unilaterally dictate standards, cut funding, 
and then expect the provinces to maintain these standards.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces need to know that sufficient funds will be made 
available by the federal government so that programs can be 
effectively implemented.  The social union is essential because 
our country is large and diverse.  A central parliament cannot 
hope to effectively address the needs of diverse regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My one and a half years as an MP have reinforced my view that 
decentralization in key areas is the best method of dealing with 
our diversity.  It is time that the federal government realize 
this and stop playing with the future of our country. The federal 
government has done an effective job of convincing Canadians that 
any sharing of powers is detrimental the well-being of our 
nation. We have reached a point when we must re-evaluate the 
manner in which we approach our deteriorating social net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me draw the attention of members to what is happening in my 
home province of Alberta.  In Alberta today we receive $578 
million less than we did in 1994 for health care.  At the same 
time, Alberta's health care spending has risen by $400 million 
largely due to an aging and increasing population and high costs 
of medical technology and drugs.  Overall Alberta has gone from a 
50:50 cost sharing arrangement with the federal government to a 
situation where the federal government now funds approximately 
14% and the province of Alberta spends about 86% for health, 
education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lacking predictable funding, provinces like Alberta have been 
scrambling to address the long term issues that have risen in our 
social assistance program.  Provinces now share all future risks 
due to rising costs, aging population and lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government assumes a lesser role in the area of social 
care, this void is being filled by families, individuals and 
communities.  There are over 700 community organizations and 
literally thousands of dedicated volunteers delivering social 
services in the city of Calgary.  However, despite the best 
efforts of these fine people there are simply not enough 
resources set aside for social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home town of Calgary there is an estimated 1,000 homeless 
people requiring shelter.  A recent attempt to provide shelter 
for 150 of Calgary's downtown homeless population failed largely 
due to costs and red tape. Many people find themselves on the 
outside looking in.  This is not acceptable.  Hence we see the 
desire of the provinces to create programs for their specific 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the federal government is taking its usual slow time to 
respond.  Therefore our motion is calling for a deadline.  The 
Leader of the Opposition has asked the government what 
is the hold up.  The government is not answering. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, it is high time we took this 
responsibility seriously. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I call on all members of the House to cast aside 
partisan politics and help create the winning conditions for 
federalism. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker I 
will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are given an opportunity for debating today a concept-social 
union.  It is important to note that it is not tabula rasa.  It 
is not a new concept.  It was first used in continental Europe in 
the 1970s.  Members can find it applied in a practical sense in 
countries like West Germany.  One should draw a lesson from that 
that the attainment of a social union, which is a pragmatic term, 
requires institutional changes and adjustments in many levels of 
government. In the European case it involved bringing in three 
levels of government, federal, provincial and municipal, and some 
consequential constitutional changes.  It is not something that 
can be legislated overnight by a wave of a magic wand.

policy making, sometimes helped by court decisions and sometimes 
hindered.

resolved in a quick snap debate and knee-jerk reaction to events 
in other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is an official opposition motion and a very 
specific motion.  It sets an artificial deadline of December 31, 
1998.  Why?  It urges the conclusion of an agreement with 
provinces, to legislate in other words.  It is also predicated on 
what is stated to be a unanimous resolution of provinces, 
although we have already had suggestions from the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona intervening in this debate that while there 
was a consensus there was not an identity of views on all 
subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion strikes one as perhaps something that was put forward 
in good faith by people who stayed up too late watching 
television and television events but could have benefited perhaps 
by more examination of the problem area.  What we are dealing 
with is a process of ongoing negotiations between heads of 
government.  It is not for strangers in the process to intervene 
without carefully considering what is already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, constitutions change, federal systems can change by 
constitutional amendments and by great acts of legislation.  But 
the experience is of course that those are rare events and rarely 
come to successful fruition unless in periods of national 
euphoria, the experience of other countries after a great 
revolution or military victory or something similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me in this motion is that it ignores the fact that 
there is an ongoing process involving heads of government talking 
to each other in good faith and basing themselves on a reality 
that since the 1982 Constitution Act it is very difficult to 
change our Constitution by a formal amendment.  To make 
legislation or an amendment or an agreement which presumably 
would have to be legislated, the be all and end all, one puts 
aside the very effective and pragmatic opportunities and 
processes for changing a federal Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing in action is executive diplomacy being 
exercised between heads of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one listened to the debate this morning one would see that 
while everybody approaches with enthusiasm the general notion of 
doing something new in social policy, there are wide divergencies 
in what should be done and how it could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One heard from the leader of the third party a very strong call 
for constitutional changes involving the federal spending power. 
We heard from the member for Winnipeg—Transcona who was, I 
think, reflecting the views of his provincial government, not as 
a spokesman but simply because he is aware of them, a strong 
opposition by his province to opting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the crucial details, the crucial elements of a new 
agreement on a social union that would have to be worked out and 
before any formal agreement could be made.  They are being worked 
out.  There is a give and take in executive diplomacy and that is 
what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I come back to the basic issue that we have an 
ongoing process.  If there is consensus at the end it can lend 
itself to administrative structural changes in the system of 
government without the need for a constitutional amendment. With 
a constitutional amendment if an agreement can be reached but 
without it with the elements of flexibility built in to 
accommodate different provincial positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have models for that in the Pepin-Robarts report which I 
think the leader of the third party commented on and which was 
helped considerably by the intervention of Léon Dion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those particular agreements build in the possibility of a 
pluralistic federalism that allows different arrangements for 
different provinces.  Would this be the conclusion of the process 
of discussion and negotiation on the social union now taking 
place?  I cannot foresee that result until the negotiations come 
to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it into an a priori agreement now, here are the 
blueprints, how are they outlined, I think would fetter and 
confine a process of adjustment, a process of give and take that 
is the lifeblood of any dynamic federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My statement to this motion would be that it is premature, it 
interrupts an ongoing process and may hurt or delay its 
successful completion.  I think in particular the deadline is 
something that puts an unnecessary time limit on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would urge this House to do is accept the spirit of the 
motion that we are committed in Canada, as we have been ever 
since 1867, to a concept of a constitution as a living tree, the 
words of Lord Sankey uttered much later, that a constitution is 
continually evolving, that executive diplomacy, the give and take 
of negotiations between heads of government is part of that.  It 
introduces a degree of flexibility and an ability to meet special 
conditions in one province or region rather than another that 
formal constitutional amendments do not do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the points of debate raised by my colleague 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the social policy renewal initiative began in August 1995 by 
the premiers. There is a long series of initiatives and steps of 
progress that has been made in the process of social policy 
renewal by the provinces and territories since that time.  I will 
not go through that. Given the hon. member's erudition he is well 
familiar with these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From August 1995 to December 1998 the premiers have been 
beavering away in sensible, logical, well thought out steps on 
social policy renewal.  I would like to ask the hon. member what 
the federal government has done to assist and to influence this 
process and how long the hon. member believes would be reasonable 
before the federal government actually comes to some conclusion 
in this whole process which has now been going on since at least 
August 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for a very thoughtful question.  It should be remembered that the 
federal government is only one player in this process and in the 
spirit of pluralistic federalism we do not seek to impose our 
will on the other players.  We seek consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the realities we face when we look at the provinces is 
personnel change. Provincial elections change, governments change 
their own attitudes.  On this issue we could say we will adopt 
the Pepin-Robarts report.  We will apply this sort of formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like, however, the provinces to help us on this issue. 
For example opting out, is this something that all provinces 
would accept?  If it is not, why not?  Is it something that some 
would accept and not others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As federal players we are not seeking to impose our will.  We 
are part of a process and we recognize that the delays, which we 
would regret as much as anybody, occur from the necessary 
democratic point of obtaining a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
answer but it does puzzle me.  First of all, the member says the 
federal government is only one player.  I remind the member again 
that the provinces, the other players, have been playing. They 
have been playing vigorously.  They have been kicking the ball 
toward the goal post for over three years. 
What has the federal government been doing?  What has it been 
doing to play in the game?  Yes, it is only one player, but as 
far as I have seen it has not been doing much to play.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that the provincial players keep changing.  If 
that is a reason for not getting an agreement, we will never have 
an agreement because the players keep changing in any government. 
Surely the people of the country deserve the players that are on 
the field at the time to move toward a goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given whoever is playing at a particular time, what is a 
reasonable timeframe for social policy renewal to reach some kind 
of conclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the supplementary question.  It is not simply that provincial 
players change.  It is that attitudes within provinces change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, for example, we are getting strong representations 
from the third level of government on issues of this sort and 
they are obviously part of the general negotiation.  If what is 
involved may eventually be a constitutional amendment, it is part 
of the process of incorporating those views, seeing whether they 
are accepted or rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say again, the federal government could develop an ideal 
type of what we think should be the social union, but we want to 
be sure the consensus is there.  This debate has made very clear 
that as between even the parties in opposition there is no 
consensus as to what they mean by the social union.   I will not 
say it is a chameleon word, but it is a word, as Dewey said, 
whose truth is determined operationally.  When they finally get 
together and say we agree on this, this is the give and take. 
Then we can move.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party is urging the government to conclude an 
agreement on social union with the provinces and territories 
before December 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that the Reform Party is taking such an active 
interest in our social union, but I cannot support the motion. 
Such an important issue takes time to address.  Imposing 
arbitrary time lines serves no one's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to a few simple principles.  We want 
to continue to build a stronger, more compassionate and 
prosperous Canada.  We want to improve the quality of life for 
all Canadians.  Also we as parliamentarians want to leave a 
legacy for our children and our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no magic formula to accomplish this.  There are no 
simple solutions.  Anyone who says that there are is either naive 
in my opinion or trying to pull a fast one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Positive change requires concerted effort on a wide variety of 
fronts.  It demands the good will and co-operation of all levels 
of government as well as the citizens of the country.  Perhaps 
most of all it requires the right attitude.  We need to focus on 
what we can accomplish together.  We need to be willing to share 
our strengths and help each other to overcome our weaknesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of attitude the government brings to policy 
making.  That is the kind of attitude that will help launch 
Canada confidently into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has worked very hard over the last five 
years to renew federalism.  It will continue to do so in the 
months and years to come, because no healthy system is ever 
static.  We have a vibrant democracy and robust institutions.  It 
is only natural that they would grow and develop over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's motion raises some issues that are dear to 
Canadians.  In many respects our social programs reflect the 
heart of the country.  They speak to what we stand for as 
Canadians.  As Canada changes, they need to evolve, but this 
evolution must follow a reasoned and positive direction.  We are 
talking about programs and institutions that are crucial to the 
citizens of the country and crucial to our children and 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the Reform Party seems to be so anxious to 
rush forward.  Negotiations are still under way.  While the 
government is confident that a good framework will be developed, 
we recognize that these things take time.  If we were to support 
the motion, I believe the House would not be acting responsibly 
and in the best interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations give a good indication of the type of 
activity we are seeing throughout the government these days. 
There is a great deal of positive work being done to reform the 
federation and build a better Canada.  I relish the opportunity 
to discuss this issue.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a multitude of reasons why the Canadian federation 
works. I could list the federal programs and initiatives that 
have served Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia as well other 
parts of the country. Every federal government department would 
be on the list, and the lives of all Canadians and Quebeckers 
like me would be affected by the activities listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Substantial progress has been made on a number of issues. We are 
withdrawing from mining, logging and tourism. 
We have launched measures to stimulate job creation through the 
Canada infrastructure works program. And work will continue as 
part of the national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members of this House who will no doubt continue to 
maintain that Canada does not work. They claim that the Canadian 
federation lacks flexibility and that the true aspirations of 
the provinces can never be achieved in such a restrictive 
system. If a framework agreement on social union is not signed 
within a month, they will say it is further proof of the fact 
that Canada does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not share that opinion. I think that the majority of 
Canadians do not share it either. Therefore, I cannot support 
this motion. I find it rather ironic that the Reform Party and 
the Bloc Quebecois stand on the same side of this issue with 
respect to this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the rest of the world is trying to figure out the 
secret of our prosperity.  Other countries are looking at Canada 
and asking themselves how they can achieve that level of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend some time talking about that reaction.  There is a 
great deal we take for granted in the country.  We sometimes 
forget just what we have accomplished together.  That is not 
despite our differences but rather because of our differences. 
They have forced us to become creative and conciliatory.  Our 
willingness to embrace both French and English, to celebrate our 
aboriginal heritage and to welcome cultures from around the world 
have made Canada the success story it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to talk a little about the government's agenda. We 
hear about the need for change.  There has been change, something 
that the opposition neglects, and a lot of it.  Perhaps it is 
time Canadians knew about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have already addressed the economic successes we 
have seen recently.  I will not delve too deeply into that area. 
Suffice to say we have a budget surplus of $3.5 billion, the 
first surplus in more than a generation.  That is a remarkable 
$45.5 billion swing in just four years from the $42 billion 
deficit we inherited from our predecessors in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's balanced fiscal and economic plan has 
created a Canadian economic foundation that is among the most 
fundamentally strong and dynamic in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to the social policy side of the government's 
accomplishments.  What has the government done in the last five 
years, Canadians may ask themselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our social safety net is a source of great pride in Canada.  It 
is the essence of the values we share.  Guaranteeing the 
continuance of our health and social programs is the priority of 
Canadians and of their governments.  Our health care system and 
other elements of our social safety net are the envy of the 
world.  They point very simply to the principles of mutual help 
and common interest underlying our federation and our social 
union.  They testify to Canadians' commitment to a shared sense 
of responsibility for each other and toward the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are voices saying it is perhaps time to begin dismantling 
the system or, better yet, to privatize everything. 
I think that the federal government and its provincial partners 
must continue to work together on this and find new ways to meet 
the needs of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been several initiatives recently which illustrate 
what I am talking about.  The national child benefit was 
introduced to reduce and prevent child poverty and to assist 
parents of low income families in either moving from welfare to 
work or staying employed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the community action program for children which 
recognizes that communities are best positioned to address the 
needs of young Canadians.  It builds on community strength by 
funding neighbourhood groups that deliver services to children at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nearly 400 CAPC projects in over 300 urban, rural and 
remote communities across Canada.  Every week almost 29,000 
children and 27,000 parents and caregivers visit these projects. 
I would like to think those are 29,000 children whose lives are 
just a little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A variety of health related activities have been developed over 
the past few years.  Health Canada, for example, provides funding 
for five centres of excellence for women's health in Halifax, 
Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver.  These centres are 
dedicated to improving the health of Canadian women by enhancing 
the health system's understanding of and responsiveness to 
women's health issues.  In a similar vein the government is 
funding a variety of research initiatives.  In June the federal 
government announced its renewed support for breast cancer 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is confident that we will negotiate a framework 
agreement that is good for all Canadians.  Such an agreement 
would promote equality of opportunity for all Canadians wherever 
they live or move in the country.  It would also strengthen the 
partnership among governments in order to serve Canadians better. 
Is this not the legacy we want to leave our children and our 
youth? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government seems to be hedging on the 
fact that it supports this agreement in principle or that it 
supports the concept of social union.  When does the government 
see itself as coming to some conclusion with respect to the talks 
with the premiers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, unlike the opposition 
member we will not set an artificial deadline for negotiations. 
Negotiations are ongoing.  We have shown flexibility and 
openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to work in collaboration with the provinces to arrive 
at a social union that is the best social union in the world, as 
we have worked toward assuring Canada is the best country in the 
world.  We will not put an artificial deadline on such important 
negotiations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions for the hon. member.  The member said 
in her response that Canada was a great country.  She said the 
usual Liberal things:  feel happy, feel good and everything is 
going great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A United Nations committee came here and blasted us on child 
poverty.  In my speech I said that there are over 1,000 homeless 
people in Calgary.  StatsCan said today that taxes were so high 
the disposable income of Canadians is getting lower and lower. 
How can she talk about a feel good approach with everything that 
is going on?  Does she not read all these things? What would be 
her response to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would welcome the 
occasion to repeat what I said in my speech about the different 
initiatives undertaken by the government, but I will not repeat 
it because I am sure most Canadians listened to what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the United Nations index, the member may not know 
that for five years in a row Canada has been chosen as the best 
country in the world.  No one is saying that we have no poverty. 
No one is saying that there are not problems.  However, the 
difference between this side of the House and the other side of 
the House is that we look for solutions to problems.  We do not 
criticize; we look for solutions.  We have proven that we have 
given solutions to Canadians.  We have proven that we have 
solutions to address most of the problems of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations human development index indicated that the 
Australians, the Americans and the French regard Canada as the 
country they would most like to live in.  I am very proud of the 
government's record and I see a legacy for our children.  We look 
for solutions that are in collaboration and in consultation with 
our provincial and territorial partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to address today's motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion calls for a social union with co-operation between 
the Government of Canada and the provinces.  There is unanimity 
in this area—with the provinces, with the territories, with 
medical groups, with nurses' groups and with the opposition. 
Unanimity is not easily achieved in a country like Canada.  It 
is hard to find unanimity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In matters of health care, unanimity is necessary and possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to approach the motion in as positive and 
constructive fashion as I can.  The social union the provinces 
have called for relates strictly to the reason I came to the 
House of Commons, and that is for a health care system that is 
better than the one we had when I left my practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to summarize why the provinces are so vociferous on 
this issue.  This is not being done in a critical sense but in a 
factual sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the federal government spent $18.7 billion on social 
transfers directed to the provinces.  For reasons that most 
Canadians understand, it decided to drop those transfer payments 
to $11.1 billion, a drop of $7.6 billion. The government did it 
unilaterally.  There was no consultation, no agreement.  That 
action on the most important social program in Canada 
precipitated a series of events which has led us to the point 
where the provinces from every political stripe are all united in 
calling for a social union that will never allow that to happen 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could never be a unilateral action of that kind if a 
social union were entered into.  I have listened over and over 
again to my Liberal colleagues say that there is in fact a very 
important program, health care, and they are bound and determined 
to support it.  This would be a mechanism where they could do 
more than just talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that has made the provinces so unanimous 
on this issue.  I will give an example that does not relate to 
health care but is about welfare in British Columbia. B.C. set up 
some residency requirements after the cuts for social assistance 
took place.  The federal response was to fine the B.C. 
government.  It took away transfer payments, even more for social 
assistance.  There was no dispute mechanism, no interchange of 
information.  The federal fist was slammed down and that was the 
end of the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason today there is unanimous provincial agreement 
for a social union.  It is hard to imagine how the provinces 
could be more unanimous.  Who else is unanimous on these issues? 
Medical colleagues throughout the country are unanimous. Why? 
Some of our best nurses are leaving their profession.  They are 
not just leaving the country but they are leaving the profession 
because they cannot stand the workload they now have.  The cuts 
have gone through the system so deeply that they cannot stand the 
workload they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You asked for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  I hear from across the way 
that is a provincial responsibility.  It is selective 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is outdated equipment.  We have 1.1 MRI per 100,000 people 
in Canada.  Germany has 3.4 MRI per 100,000 people.  Why should 
two countries that are so similar in terms of economic 
capabilities have such a difference?  There is outdated equipment 
due to those cutbacks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a drop in the level of confidence in Canada.  In 
1993, 55% of Canadians considered the health care system 
excellent or very good.  Today, in 1998, only 29% of Canadians 
find the system excellent or very good.  Why?  Waiting lists are 
an obvious problem for doctors, for patients and for nurses. 
What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a study done for the CMA by the Angus Reid group 
for the past three years, Canadians feel access to certain 
health care services has become more restricted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the federal government care about that?  Why would the 
Liberal members care about that?  It is because they themselves 
will get ill.  They themselves will find themselves on waiting 
lists.  They themselves will have grandparents or children left 
in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are asking for something that is fairly 
straightforward and fairly simple. They are asking for the 
federal government to never ever take funds from health care 
unilaterally.  If there is a disagreement on the Canada Health 
Act, if there is a disagreement in the way the Canada Health Act 
is being implemented, they are asking that there be a dispute 
settlement mechanism, that there be a tribunal that would sit 
down and say “Here is one perspective.  Here is another.  What 
is good for the patient?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always try to put comments about health care in a personal 
vein and I will do that today.  A patient wrote a letter to me 
not so long ago, a woman from Ontario who was diagnosed with 
breast cancer.  She was told that she needed to have a procedure 
very quickly and then chemotherapy to follow. She was sent to the 
specialist.  He did a biopsy and sure enough the cancer was worse 
than it was originally thought. The procedure needed to be done 
quickly. She was booked for surgery in two weeks and that was 
considered to be quite reasonable and normal.  When the date came 
the surgery had to be put off. There were not enough nurses for 
the surgery.  It was put off for another two weeks. When that day 
came, the surgery was done. Then her chemotherapy, which should 
have been started almost immediately, had to be put off for three 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear, the concern, the worry.  That is what the provinces 
are asking for. It is not for some political juggling match.  It 
is simply to provide the care for that most important social 
program to that woman with breast cancer who had needs that were 
not met here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the comment about having the Reform Party admit that it 
wants two tier medicine. The Reform Party does not want two tier 
medicine.  What we want is care for patients that is timely, that 
is available, that is modern and which keeps people healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All throughout the world people are grappling with these 
problems.  Most countries seem to put health care as the highest 
priority, not just in terms of hyperbole, not just in terms of 
rhetoric, but in terms of practicality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union is moving positively toward that end.  Does it 
have to happen in 30 days?  I have listened to my colleagues say 
that is too quick.  Then I say, set a Liberal date.  Do not 
listen to a Reform date.  Set a Liberal date.  We will be happy 
to be able to say there is progress being made.  But as of now 
the provinces are asking where the progress is.  We will push 
hard for that progress to be made for one reason, for health care 
for Canadians, for the patients.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short question for the hon. member from the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says the deadline is December 31.  Let us assume that 
everybody agrees on the deadline and we pass the motion.  What 
happens if we do not meet the deadline?  Are we going to come 
back on January 1 and ask for a deadline of January 31 and so on 
and so forth for the next year?  These deadlines are artificial. 
We do our best and they do their best to make sure the country 
works. A deadline does not work.  If it is not complied with or 
the agreement is not reached by the deadline, then a second 
deadline is necessary and there could be no end in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitments should be made and we have to work together to 
improve the federation.  That is the commitment we should make 
rather than to stick to a deadline which is not realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I understand why the member 
might be hesitant to face a deadline and that is a valid point 
Our question is what is the Liberal timeframe?  We have seen very 
little progress on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perfect time to have entered into a social union surely 
would have been prior to the Quebec election.  What a powerful 
tool.  What a baseball bat to have driven separatist thoughts 
lower on the agenda.  There may be good reasons for not meeting 
that deadline.  I am perfectly willing to listen to a Liberal 
timetable. This is trying to drive the agenda toward completion. 
If December 31 is too quick, I am listening and would like to 
know, when?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are relatively favourable to today's Reform Party motion.  It 
is similar, if not identical, in purpose to the motion we moved 
in October, urging the federal government to speed up 
negotiations on social union, given that the premiers had come 
out with a statement in August in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we get out of the Reform Party motion is that more haste is 
required.  As our leader reiterated this morning, this is an 
issue that has been around for a long time.  Reformers have 
rarely mentioned it. 
For 50 years now, Quebec has been calling on the federal 
government to respect the areas of provincial jurisdiction set 
out in the Constitution, such as health and the social sector, 
but to no avail.  The federal government has used its spending 
authority to interfere in provincial jurisdictions and, in 
recent years, in order to eliminate its own deficit, it has 
slashed transfer payments to the provinces, with the results 
mentioned by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Reform Party member agree with Quebec's demand that 
there should be a right to opt out of new programs in this 
sector with full financial compensation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> Mr. Speaker, for me it is not a partisan issue 
but an issue that concerns all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want unanimity for social programs in Canada and, in the case 
of health care, an agreement is necessary for all Canadians. 
Personally, I do not like the Bloc Quebecois proposals, but the 
social union is not a political issue, it is an issue that 
concerns all Canadians. This is why I am presenting my position 
in the House today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the Reform supply day 
motion.  It has an essential role to articulate to the people of 
Quebec and the rest of Canada what we plan on doing to strengthen 
this country, to strengthen social programs for all Canadians. 
I compliment the member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley for 
her leadership on this issue.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian federation is not only based on constitutional 
principles. Indeed, our country primarily strives to help those 
who are less fortunate and to provide them with the necessary 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government definitely has the financial resources to 
ease the plight of the poor. We all remember how Canadians got 
together to help their Quebec friends when they had to deal with 
floods, in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This definitely shows that, when some real disaster occurs, we 
Canadians help each other. Canadians are once again displaying 
their fundamental qualities to promote the social union. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union is integral for the future of Canada and for 
the future of Canadians.  As my colleague for Macleod just 
mentioned, it speaks to a stronger partnership which Canadians 
hold dear to their hearts and which is critically important for 
the health and welfare of Canadians.  It speaks to the saving of 
our social programs, in particular health care, education and 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has a fiduciary responsibility to work 
with the provinces in these areas, and yet what we have seen is 
the destruction of these programs.  These programs have been 
gutted from within.  As a result, people who work in these areas 
are hanging on by their fingernails.  Indeed, the Canadians who 
are supposed to benefit from these programs, particularly health 
care and education, are suffering.  As we all know, health care 
and education are being destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to hide behind the Canada Health Act and 
say that Canadians are receiving health care when they need it, 
it is either not telling the truth or it has its head stuck far 
into the sand.  The cold hard reality is that Canadians are not 
getting health care when they need it.  The Canada Health Act is 
being violated in four of its five principles.  As a result, 
Canadians needing treatment for cancer, or urgent medical care 
for heart operations, down to the most mundane operations, are 
waiting.  While they wait they suffer and their families suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last few years the government has been content to sit on 
its hands and say that the status quo is acceptable.  It 
acknowledges that there is a problem, but it has not put forth 
any constructive solution.  Instead it has pointed its finger at 
us in a derogatory way, saying that we want to destroy these 
ideals.  If we wanted to do that we would not have put forth this 
motion to save our social programs:  health care, education and 
the supplemental income required by people who lose their jobs 
through no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform wants to save these social programs and put them on sound 
fiscal footing within the resources we have available to us.  We 
have to speak practically about this.  We are willing to 
introduce in this House a solution that involves asking the 
federal government and the provinces to work together to ensure 
that the feds do what the feds do best and the provinces do what 
the provinces do best.  Is there agreement on this?  Indeed there 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of premiers have asked, have pleaded, have 
begged the federal government to engage in a discussion with them 
so that in the 21st century we will have social programs that 
will benefit all Canadians, that will be there for all Canadians 
in their time of need and will be on sound fiscal footing. 
That is the essence of this motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also do it from the point of cost.  Having the provinces and 
the federal government doing the same thing is patently idiotic. 
It is duplication.  The left hand does know what the right hand 
is doing and it is a waste of taxpayers' money.  Why do we not 
let the feds do what the feds do best and let the provinces do 
what the provinces do best? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also benefit national unity because we would then see a 
willingness on the part of the Government of Canada to work with 
all of the provinces, from British Columbia to Newfoundland, and 
the territories to ensure that these social programs are 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Quebec the day after the election.  The Quebec 
people have clearly said that at this point in time they do not 
want a referendum.  They want strong social programs, a strong 
economy, lower taxes and a better future for themselves and their 
children.  That is what Canadians from coast to coast want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the best efforts of everybody inside and outside this 
House, the federalist message does not get to the people of 
Quebec outside of those in Montreal.  Les gens du Québec outside 
Montreal, in Chibougamau and other cities, do not hear the 
federalist message because the issue of national unity has taken 
place between the political and intellectual elites of this 
country.  This message does not penetrate the barriers that exist 
within the francophone, separatist-leaning media in Quebec and 
does not get to the French-speaking people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to travel outside Montreal to see that the people 
live in an information vacuum when it comes to federalist 
solutions.  They live in a bubble into which the rhetoric of 
separatist politicians is continually introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of what the federalists are proposing, the love that 
Canadians have for Quebec under the umbrella of equality for all, 
does not get through.  Because that message does not get through 
the people of Quebec are left with a biased and warped view of 
what happens outside Canada.  I would also argue that what 
happens within Quebec is not as well known as it should be 
outside its borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to keep this country together we have to engage 
in communication between the people of Quebec and the rest of 
Canada, between the rank and file people in the trenches, on the 
ground and in their homes, people to people, not between 
politicians or intellectuals in university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the message in yesterday's election says that Quebecers do 
not want a referendum at this point in time, it clearly did not 
say they do not want a referendum at all.  I would argue that 
what is going to happen is that the people of Quebec are going to 
wait until their health and welfare is improved through the 
Government of Quebec and when they are on stable footing then 
they will look for a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a narrow window of opportunity.  The federal government 
must meet with the people of Quebec in the trenches, eyeball to 
eyeball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a large meeting in Montreal of Canadians from coast to 
coast asking the people of Quebec to vote no in the last 
referendum.  Why did the French-speaking separatist politicians 
hate that so much?  Because it bypassed their power and their 
control.  It got a strong federalist message directly to the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that is what tipped the balance in favour of the 
no vote.  That is possible.  Therein lies a lesson.  With back 
and forth communication between people we will have a chance to 
keep this country together.  If we fail to do that we will 
certainly be looking at another referendum, again putting Canada 
at the precipice of a breakup.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, traditionally 
the people in the territories, who are the poorest and most 
vulnerable in this country, have depended on a strong federal 
presence to equalize their standard of living and their place in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned about the member's motion because it has 
excluded the first nations people of this country from 
participating in a social union.  I would like to know why the 
member did that because, as far as being vulnerable goes, these 
people are the most vulnerable.  The first nations people are the 
poorest, they have the highest health risks and the poorest 
housing conditions.  I would like the member to explain that 
exclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further 
from the truth.  This motion explicitly asks for Canadians from 
coast to coast to be involved.  The last time I checked, the 
aboriginal people of Canada are Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the hon. member to the work of the 
members for Skeena, Wild Rose and others in the Reform Party who 
have been asking for input from aboriginal people.  In fact, 
these members have held meetings with aboriginal people, asking 
them what we can do to help.  Over 100 aboriginal people have 
attended each of these meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, many of these grassroots aboriginals—not 
the chiefs, not their political leaders, but grassroots 
aboriginals—are saying thank you to the Reform Party for helping 
them to get their message out in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grassroots aboriginal people have not been heard on this 
issue.  As the member acknowledged, and I know she has worked 
very hard on this issue, they suffer the worst possible 
socio-economic conditions in this country.  Members of my party 
have been working very hard to ensure that their message is heard 
loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over $8 billion is put into aboriginal affairs.  However, it has 
been argued that only $1 out of every $20 gets to the people on 
the ground.  That is appalling.  There have been accusations by 
aboriginal people of the misappropriation of funds by aboriginal 
leaders.  However, when they ask questions, they get the cold 
shoulder.  The first nations are abused, not only by the system 
which non-aboriginals created, but also by their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that what the government needs to do and what the 
minister of Indian affairs needs to do is listen to the 
grassroots aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister came to my riding.  Aboriginal people from the 
Pacheenaht reserve, Becher Bay and elsewhere have been asking the 
minister for years for answers on where the moneys are going and 
expressing their concerns about abuses on the reserve.  The 
minister met with the political leaders, but did not speak to the 
people putting forth the accusations, one of whom was the 
hereditary chief of a band.  It was embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the minister to listen to these aboriginal people 
and not to wave off what they are saying because of what she has 
heard from their leaders.  The minister should work with the 
aboriginals to solve their appalling conditions.  The first 
nations should be given the tools they need to provide for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people do not want separation.  The grassroots 
people do not want the political nirvana of separate statehood or 
nationhood, but they do want health care, jobs, education and a 
safer future for themselves and their children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a doctor and 
a member of parliament.  I think it is correct that about $80 
billion is being spent on health care from various sources across 
the country and about $250 million is being spent on medical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much stress would the hon. member put on increasing 
assistance to medical research to help the health care system 
generally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that the hon. 
secretary of state has done a tremendous amount of work in 
providing constructive solutions to the health care field.  He 
has written some very eloquent articles on this issue which many 
of us have read with great admiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we have to proportion our resources in research on 
the basis of mortality, morbidity and the effect on the patient 
and their families.  I compliment the government for putting more 
money into research in the last budget.  It is something that is 
long overdue and the government needs to be commended for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think there are some novel ways in which we can get 
more money into the research areas. 
Perhaps one way of doing that is to ensure tax exemptions and tax 
cuts for people who wish to invest in research facilities. They 
can use that as a tax write-off.  But also moneys can be used 
within the system to do more research into prevention. What we 
tend to focus on is dealing with the problems.  I draw the 
attention of the House to the head start motion that was passed 
in the House in May 1998, my private member's motion, that dealt 
with prevention in crime and with the basics of children in the 
first eight years.  If we adopted that motion and dealt with 
those solutions we could save a lot of people's lives and a lot 
of money across the country.

I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise on this very important issue  but puzzled 
as to how we have arrived at this moment in our history where we 
are debating a motion that would arbitrarily and artificially 
impose a deadline on negotiations that are currently going on 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the previous speaker and I have listened to him on 
many occasions and heard thoughtful comments in this place from 
that member of the Reform Party. I see the member for Calgary 
East who I know does not always agree with his party's positions, 
particularly some of the more extreme ones.   I heard the member 
for Macleod, the health critic, talk in terms of his party's not 
wanting two tier health care and various other things he was 
denouncing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has occurred to me as I listen to this debate that this whole 
thing is about double standards.  I want to share with the House 
a couple of comments, and this is a direct quote, which would 
seem to run in the face of the comments by the member for Macleod 
when he said the Reform Party is not advocating a two tier health 
system.  This relates very clearly to the social union 
negotiations that were going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party to the Saskatoon Business 
Association on April 2, 1995 said:  “We want to amend those 
sections of the act”, the Canada Health Act, “that deny the 
provinces the flexibility to require some Canadians to pay at 
least a portion of their own health care costs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would members interpret that in any way other than two tier 
health care?  I find it a complete contradiction in terms, a 
denial of his own leader's recorded statements, when the health 
critic for the Reform Party stands here urging the government to 
move ahead unilaterally on an issue that would clearly impact the 
delivery of health care and he is denying his leader actually 
said this by claiming that the Reform Party is not in support of 
dismantling the Canada Health Act and establishing a two tier 
health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23, 1998 the member for Vancouver North said: “I 
had to go into a hospital in Florida.  It really put a shame to 
what happens in my riding in North Vancouver with socialist 
medicine.  I do not think there is any harm in having some 
competition”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again it is a matter quite clearly of the words not 
matching the music, of saying one thing and believing another.  I 
see that the health critic is here and I want him to know that I 
believe he cares about Canadians' health.  He is a medical 
doctor.  I believe he has serious concerns.  But I do not 
understand how he reconciles the difference between the 
statements made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How he reconciles these double standards is a problem that the 
Reform Party in my view must wrestle with in its caucus meetings. 
It must be fascinating to be a fly on the wall to listen to “on 
the one hand we want to do it this way, but on the other hand we 
think we can sell it better if we announce it another way”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, that is what we are seeing here with the issue of 
putting some kind of arbitrary deadline.  All members in this 
place want to see a deal done on behalf of all Canadians that 
makes Canada work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe even members of the Reform Party believe that all 
members who were sent here as federal politicians, anyone who 
comes here with a federal interest in making this federation 
work, want to see some kind of a deal structure. There may be 
exceptions with Bloc Quebecois members obviously who were sent 
here more as regional or provincial politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very clearly that I was unable to go to Montreal when 
the big rally took place at the last minute during the 
referendum.  My wife, a member of council, and a number of her 
colleagues went on a bus and a number of people from my riding 
went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told me what an incredibly moving experience that was. Yet 
the Reform Party, instead of joining hands with Canadians in 
Montreal, worked against not only us but against this entire 
nation.  It ran a deficit in its own budget.  It went over its 
own budget.  It spent money it did not have which again points 
out a double standard to try to destroy the Charlottetown accord. 
I think it succeeded in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During one of the parliamentary recesses, when we are getting 
messages from around the world about the financial stability of 
this country, we saw the leader of the Reform Party at a speech 
somewhere in Asia totally tearing down the social and economic 
fabric of Canada.  This is someone who would purport to be a 
prime minister.  This is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with members a couple of quotes that came about 
as a result of the events last evening in the province of Quebec. 
We all know what we saw in the province of Quebec last night was 
a clear message.  It was a message from the people of Quebec to 
the separatists that they do not want a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that to my colleagues in the Bloc.  It is a clear message. 
They do not want a referendum.  I did not see anybody strutting 
around.  I watched the news.  I did not see great yelling and 
cheering at the supposed victory parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what I saw was puzzlement from the separatists who said 
“We thought Quebecers really wanted a referendum and they really 
wanted to separate.  Maybe the don't”.  What they really want is 
government to get on with the job.  In a vast majority, if 
someone looks at the numbers, 55% of the people in the province 
of Quebec last evening voted against the PQ.  That is a pretty 
clear message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share a couple of quotes.  The first one I want to 
share is a quote from the provincial premier who happens to be 
the chair of the provincial premiers as they meet this year.  It

may use a little bit of play on Premier Bouchard's campaign 
slogan, winning conditions for referendum, for me the focus now 
is winning conditions for Canada.  And the first order of 
business is the social union, negotiating it as quickly as we 
can. Not under any artificial deadlines or timetables. Doing it 
with dispatch, doing it with determination.  The Prime Minister 
wants to do it, his ministers want to do it.  The premiers want 
to do it.  Premier Bouchard signed on, here in Saskatoon in 
August, to the bargaining position. I underline those words, the 
bargaining position of the provinces and the territorial 
governments.

the negotiation that's ongoing, I think that's something that 
we'll get back to early in the new year without artificial

if there is a commitment by his government to actually bring this 
discussion, this initiative by the premiers, to some conclusion. 
It has been ongoing for a year. There has been no real indication 
from the federal government that it will reach a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a commitment from the Liberal government to actually 
sign a document at some time down the road? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question and a responsible position to take. I would hope there 
is a commitment that our government is negotiating.  I know the 
Prime Minister is interested in seeing a deal done.  The House 
has heard the quotes I shared from Premier Romanow and from 
Premier Tobin.  I know there is a serious desire to see a social 
union contract put in place which protects medicare, which 
ensures that proper transfer payments flow and at the same time 
protects a strong position for the federal government to have a 
role in leading policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be neutered the way the Reform Party would see us

the hon. member's compilation of yesterday's election results is 
a rather odd one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussing social union, he referred to the Meech Lake 
Accord.  As a Quebecker, I remember that the present Prime 
Minister, then leader of the Liberal Party but without a seat in 
the House, played a very specific role in the failure of Meech, 
with the complicity of then Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells. 
Today he gets all worked up about those who were responsible for 
the failure of Meech.  He ought to look back at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to social union, these 
are demands that go back 50 years, in Quebec and in the other 
provinces as well.  It is also in part the outcome of the 
federal government's cuts to transfer payments to the provinces, 
of its brutal cuts to health care.  They are what has triggered 
this discussion, since the other provinces were forced to make 
cuts to health care, to the hospitals.  That is what they have 
been pushed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the federal government understands the urgency for 
remedying the situation by restoring transfer payments as 
promptly as possible, in the next budget, for health care in 
particular, but also for education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know my hon. colleague's opinion on this matter, 
that is on the money the federal government has cut from the 
provinces in these areas.

to deal with transfer payments that impact on health care in the 
province of Quebec, in the province of Ontario and right across

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the current negotiations on the social 
union.  This is a very important issue.  These negotiations give 
us the opportunity to improve Canada's social and health 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions are presently being undertaken at all levels of 
government in Canada in the hopes of making improvements to the 
social union for our country.  These governments are attempting 
to find the best way for governments to help and serve Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are elements of the motion that are difficult to 
understand and certainly impossible to support, the motion 
provides us with a valuable opportunity to debate important new 
initiatives started by our government to strengthen federalism 
and to make the country work more efficiently for the benefit of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations are an important opportunity for Canada to 
improve the social and health policies that mean so much to all 
Canadians wherever they may live.  All governments in Canada are 
currently involved in negotiations on how to improve Canada's 
social union.  They are trying to design the best approach for 
helping governments to help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we call the social union most Canadians know through their 
direct experiences in their communities.  Over the years we have 
learned to take for granted that wherever we live in Canada 
quality health care is available when we get sick.  Young people 
can count on first rate education.  Those who have lost their 
jobs or who have been hit by bad times are able to get the help 
they need.  Pensions and benefits are available to secure quality 
of life in old age.  These programs and services are the social 
union. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of social union focuses on the Canada-wide nature of 
these programs and services, as well as the importance of 
providing all Canadians regardless of where they live in the 
country, or where they travel to, an equal opportunity to 
benefit from the programs that meet their fundamental needs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more important, the concept of social union captures our 
commitment to one another, our understanding that we are stronger 
together and that as Canadians we help each other wherever the 
need may be.  We are always willing to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current negotiations are tackling some difficult issues, but 
it is important to keep in mind that we already have one of the 
best social systems in the world.  It is to ensure we can improve 
this quality of life that all governments are committed to 
succeeding in the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations were launched by the Prime Minister and 
Canada's premiers at the first ministers' meeting on December 11 
and December 12, 1997.  At that time first ministers agreed that 
each jurisdiction would appoint a minister to negotiate a new 
social partnership to help improve decision making and delivery 
of social and health policies.  While this may seem like a long 
process these issues are important for Canada and for all 
Canadians.  We must take the time necessary to get it right and 
the time necessary to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried not to allow the process to become political. That 
is why all governments have agreed not to negotiate through the 
media where too often positions become rigid and exaggerated and 
the focus is on power and conflict.  These negotiations are and 
must be focused on what is right for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide the House with a sense of our current social 
union, with a sense of why the government believes we must 
improve it, and with a sense of what we are trying to achieve 
through those negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us take for granted the advantages we receive from the 
social programs put in place throughout the country.  The network 
of social benefits that permits us to have our high level of 
living is relatively new.  It was established only after the 
second world war when the depression was still fresh in our 
collective minds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Old age pension plans, employment insurance, student loans and 
health insurance were all founded within the last 50 years with 
the collaboration of all levels of government in Canada through 
debate, dialogue, disagreement and ultimately compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the social union is a remarkable story of 
creativity and mutual respect.  It is a story of the commitment 
of generations of Canadians to caring for one another and to 
accommodating our differences as we pursue our common purpose. 
Most impressive has been our ability simultaneously to achieve 
Canada-wide initiatives while enhancing the freedom of provinces 
to act for their residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment to improve is particularly important now because 
Canada like all countries in the world faces tremendous 
challenges.  As the baby boomers begin to enter the retirement 
years our aging population will put real strains on our pension, 
health care and social systems.  Within 20 years the number of 
Canadians over 65 will increase by 50%.  With no change in the 
system in almost 30 years fully one-third of the federal budget 
will be needed to be spent on seniors pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and provincial governments after consultations with 
Canadians have already taken steps to ensure the Canada pension 
plan.  With globalization and the emerging information economy we 
will need more than ever a literate technologically skilled and 
mobile labour force.  Our social programs must adapt to the 
changing labour market and new directions in the nature and 
organization of work.  Our youth are entering a labour market 
that is very difficult and different from the one we knew.  We 
must equip them with skills and information they require and 
need, and the freedom to pursue opportunities wherever they 
arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure for all Canadians access to learning and 
unfettered mobility.  We have more to do for Canadian children to 
ensure that they are ready to learn and have the fair start 
necessary to participate fully in Canada's economic and social 
opportunities.  Each Canadian must have access to the 
opportunities afforded them by all for all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have had to take tough measures to balance their 
budgets and thereby increase our flexibility for the future and 
our resiliency in the face of global forces.  This has put a 
premium on efficiency and on making sure that governments do not 
duplicate one another.  We share risks and resources and we learn 
from one another.  We can and we must work together and make it 
better for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the value we attach to our social and health programs, 
given our contribution to our quality of life and given the 
challenges before us, governments are working together to set out 
the basis for an even stronger partnership, a new social union 
framework.  The negotiations on the new framework provide an 
opportunity to strengthen our co-operation for the benefit of all 
Canadians.  To do this we must be consistent with the core values 
and principles of our Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first we must note is that the Constitution must be 
respected.  Respect of the Constitution and constitutional power 
and competencies is essential to maintain the effectiveness of 
public policy and the mutual respect that is a basis of this 
partnership.  The foundations of this social union must respect 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must show greater co-operation to meet the needs of 
Canadians.  Governments are now co-ordinating their work on 
behalf of children, youth and persons with disabilities through 
recent initiatives.  That should carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the ability of governments to act must be preserved. 
Greater co-operation should not and cannot mean that governments 
cannot do anything without asking permission of each other.  We 
can strengthen our partnership without hindering our capacity to 
act. We can avoid what the Europeans call the joint decision 
trap.  The framework must preserve the capacity to act and to 
adapt to change as required and as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth idea I present is the principle that the federation 
must be flexible.  We are learning how to reconcile joint action 
with enhanced flexibility for the provinces.  We have seen this 
in the recent labour market agreements which allowed provinces to 
choose the approach most suited to their labour market.  We have 
seen this in the national child benefit in which provinces were 
able to invest as appropriate to the challenges they faced.  A 
new framework must ensure that flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth notion is that the federation must be fair.  Canada 
has lead the G-7 in bringing down its deficit and gaining fiscal 
control. 
It has achieved this with relatively less conflict and friction 
than what might rightfully be expected but not without 
consequences. Canadians are worried about the adequacy of funding 
for core programs.  With the prospect of a fiscal dividend the 
federal government is conscious of the challenges facing the 
provinces, and we need to act accordingly.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep each other informed.  That too is important and 
fundamental to the framework.  We must also enhance 
accountability for Canadians and to Canadians.  That too is part 
and parcel of this union.  It is very important that we have the 
opportunity to establish this new partnership and a new balance 
to manage the interdependence of services for all Canadians.  It 
will prevent the elimination of the doubling of cost and it will 
lead to a much better federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test of our efforts is simple.  Are Canadians better served? 
Are governments more transparent and accountable to Canadians? 
Are we in a better position to improve our health and social 
policies and to promote the well-being of Canadians in all parts 
of Canada?  Have we improved mobility for Canadians?  Above all, 
have we achieved greater equality for opportunity in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is that we will do that in the best interest of all 
Canadians.  While the motion before us appears reasonable enough 
on the surface, it cannot and shall not be supported.  We need to 
carry on in a way that is in keeping with the values, 
institutions and the symbols that define us a people and unite us 
as a nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my 
colleague across the way.  He outlined five points and because of 
the shortage of time I would like to ask him questions on two of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue was that the Constitution must be respected in 
all cases.  How is it that the Constitution can be respected when 
the federal government is interloping on provincial jurisdictions 
as given to them in the 1867 Constitution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question deals with his fifth point.  He said that 
the federation must be fair and that the federal government must 
be allowed to do the job it feels it is there to do.  Is it fair 
when the federal government goes into a medicare program with a 
promise of 50% funding and years later is only providing 11% 
funding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we on the government side need always to be cognizant, 
as do all Canadians, of the importance of respecting the 
Constitution in all these matters.  That is fundamental not only 
to all Canadians but to all of us in this place.  To present the 
Constitution in a fair manner is important.  It is also important 
to provide a social union framework and context which enable us 
as Canadians to promote and preserve those things that we hold 
dear and which need protection and promotion in a fair and 
equitable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we on the government side continue to 
do that.  We have traditionally and historically been a party and 
a government of nation building.  We intend not to tear down but 
rather to build in a manner consistent with the kinds of values 
and ideals all Canadians want us to use.  It is important to 
continue on that vein and do so in the best interest of all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to speak to the motion. The Reform 
Party believes very strongly it is time that Canada endorsed the 
social union put forward by the provinces and territories. We are 
urging the government to do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to some of the pabulum coming from across the 
way.  My colleague from Surrey asked a very straightforward 
question of the hon. member about the government's commitment to 
health care.  When the Canada Health Act first came into place 
the federal government made a commitment to fund health care to 
the tune of 50%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do?  Now it funds it at 11%.  She asked 
a very straight question of the member and we got back this 
pabulum about the government believes in fairness, that it wants 
to build up and not tear down.  That does not mean anything. That 
is not a commitment.  It is just rhetoric from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, excuse me if I accuse the members of the government 
of being disingenuous with respect to the answers I have heard 
from them today regarding their commitment to signing and 
enacting the social union.  We think it is extraordinarily 
important to do this.  It is important for the well-being of 
Canadians who depend on these social programs, but it is just as 
important for the unity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we raise specific questions we get empty answers.  It 
is unbelievable that in the House of Commons when we are debating 
something that is incredibly important to Canadians, that is all 
we get from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West said that the government 
believes in the social union.  That is great.  Then why does the 
government not sign it?  This has been before governments for a 
long time.  Many of these proposals have been before Liberal 
governments for a long, long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the answer is that the government does not want to give 
up its powers.  It does not believe in national standards.  It 
believes in federal standards.  It believes in standards that it 
alone sets even though all these areas that we are talking about 
fall under provincial jurisdiction in the Constitution. The 
gentleman who just spoke said that we must respect the 
Constitution.  The very fact that the federal government is using 
its spending power to intrude in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
shows that its commitment to the Constitution is at best tenuous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and the official opposition recognize that the 
federal government can and should have a role to play in some of 
these services, but let us enter into them on a co-operative 
basis.  Unfortunately, the government often is not prepared to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the provinces and the territories, 
many of which are represented by Liberal premiers, are calling on 
the government to take this initiative seriously.  The government 
has had a chance to regard it since August and it has still done 
absolutely nothing.  We say that the real test of whether or not 
a government is committed to these things is not whether it says 
it believes in the principles of them in some debate, but it is 
whether it is prepared to sign onto them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an election in Quebec yesterday.  We know that people 
in Quebec do want Canada to work.  They made that very clear in 
the way they voted yesterday.  We know that the premier of Quebec 
has signed onto this social union.  He wants to make this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is which party is it that is standing in the way of 
Canadian unity?  It is the federal government that is standing in 
the way.  The Prime Minister indicated before the election how 
much he was going to stand in the way of this by saying that we 
are not going to have the flexibility that is necessary to make 
Canada work as a confederation, as a co-operative movement, a 
movement that recognizes that not all the ideas have to come from 
the federal government.  Some of them can come from provincial 
governments or from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada most of the time the good things that we do are done 
through co-operative means.  Every day in the private sector 
people get together co-operatively and exchange goods and 
services, money and all kinds of things.  They do it on a 
co-operative basis.  It creates all kinds of good.  It creates 
prosperity, wealth and a lot of good will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know in this case that the provinces and the territories 
got together and said “We are going to work co-operatively.  We 
are going to try to get together because this is in the best 
interests of all of our respective constituents”. That is what 
they did.  They got together and brought forward this social 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently saw securities regulators across the country get 
together and co-operatively work out a new system whereby they 
would establish standards that would apply across the country. I 
point out that the finance minister tried to do this awhile ago 
and completely and utterly failed. We know that a previous 
Conservative government tried to do the same thing and completely 
and utterly failed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that the securities regulators, driven by the 
interests of private individuals who need to have economic 
organization in order to make it easier to invest across the 
country, got together and said that they could do it 
co-operatively. In other words, they established national 
standards without being bound by federal standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be the whole problem here.  We have a government 
that is so stubborn, which is really characterized by the Prime 
Minister, that it simply refuses to sign onto anything that it 
did not create even though it is operating in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to set aside that pride, that 
vanity and to come to the realization that good ideas which 
benefit all Canadians do come from lower levels of government. 
That is exactly what we are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know anybody who thinks that the social union is a bad 
idea, except for the federal government.  If it does not think it 
is a bad idea—and I know it will protest when I say that—then 
why does it not sign onto it?  The government has had months and 
months to do it.  There was the prospect of a Quebec election in 
front of it and the government still did nothing.  In fact, in 
the face of it, it seemed as if the Prime Minister was trying to 
derail the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of suggesting that somehow this motion is not helpful 
when obviously it is and is bringing before the House of Commons 
one of the most important initiatives in the country today, why 
do members across the way not start thinking about ways to 
endorse it?  Why not look for ways to get behind this instead of 
fighting it at every step?  Unfortunately that is not the way the 
government operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing strikes me when we talk about issues like health care. 
The hon. member who spoke just a minute ago talked about how the 
government wants to build.  That is very laudable and those are 
nice words. However, I want to review what has happened in the 
last five years in Canada with respect to health care. I think 
this really does put the lie to some of the words we have heard 
from across the way where the government was saying that it 
believed that we need to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is an area of provincial jurisdiction.  Did the 
provinces have the benefit of being consulted by the federal 
government when the federal government decided to essentially 
eviscerate health care in Canada, when it cut $7 billion from 
health care, when it drove 188,000 people onto waiting lists in 
Canada? Is that the government's co-operative approach?  I do not 
think so. That is not co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an area of provincial jurisdiction and what did the 
government do?  It marched in and said it was not going to cut 
the size of government or pare down its own departments.  It was 
going to cut health care by 35%.  I would argue that is much of 
the reason the provinces finally said they had to get together, 
irrespective of their own differences, to fight the federal 
government because it was standing in the way of giving Canadians 
proper health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government goes ahead and guts health care because it thinks 
it is more important to find savings gutting health care than to 
gut for instance subsidies to big business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the words we have heard from the other side sound very 
nice and warm, they are completely insincere.  We do not buy it 
for a minute.  We think the real test of the government's 
commitment to a social union is action, not more warm words, not 
more discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge members across the way to join with the Reform Party and 
with other opposition parties today and to vote in favour of what 
is being proposed so that we can truly unite Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest 
to the member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word co-operation came up an awful lot.  It really is hard 
to sit in my seat and listen to this when I think back to the 
1997 election campaign where the Reform Party made signs that 
said it did not want to have a premier or a prime minister from 
Quebec. 
Now I ask, does that sound like the Reform Party wants 
co-operation with Quebec?

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is hollow when we listen to words like those from the 
opposition.  The Reform Party would have been very happy to have 
had a crisis in Quebec.  The vote last night was very solid.  It 
does say that Quebecers indeed do want to be a part of Canada. 
Thank goodness that the people of Quebec have not listened to the 
Reform Party.  The Reform Party's rhetoric, its meanness of 
spirit, its not wanting to have Quebecers as a part of Canada is 
awful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member across the way explain to me how he and 
and his party could make this statement, that they would never 
want a prime minister from Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think what we really 
meant to say was that we do not want this Prime Minister who 
happens to be from Quebec. The real answer is that the Reform 
Party did not say those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to see the aspirations of all regions of 
the country represented when it comes to constitutional 
discussions.  That is one of the reasons this social union is 
very supportable by the Reform Party.  It does represent the 
aspirations of all the provinces.  That is why we are very 
supportive of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government across the way would be equally 
supportive.  The government turns around and guts health care in 
Canada.  It cut $7 billion in expenditures to the provinces for 
health care.  Then the government stands in this place and says 
that it believes very strongly in working with the provinces so 
that we can have national standards for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's actions speak louder than its words.  I am not 
surprised that given the government's past actions, it cannot 
support this motion today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to follow up on the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to that ad, the member explained what the ad was 
about but there is one point I would like to make.  I had a lot 
of constituents say to me that Jean Charest was incensed that we 
would label him as nothing but a Quebec politician, but the fact 
that he jumped and tried to become the premier of Quebec proves 
that portion of what we were saying about Jean Charest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the hon. member for Medicine Hat heard similar things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 
Canadians want to see their views represented from all across the 
country.  The very fact that the Reform Party has brought forward 
a list of ways that we can accommodate not only Quebec but all 
the provinces through the new Canada act demonstrates that our 
commitment to this country goes far beyond anything we have seen 
from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to staying in power.  The Reform 
Party is committed to making Canada work.  The government will do 
anything it can can to hang on to power, including gutting health 
care so that it can balance the budget and at the same time 
protect the bureaucracy behind it.  The government will do 
anything it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were really and truly concerned about 
Canadians, it would reverse that process.  Instead of gutting 
health care it would gut some of its vested interests, who have 
been the hangers on in this country for so long and one of the 
reasons people are so cynical about government in Canada today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party has brought forward this motion today 
which calls on the federal parliament to build a stronger 
federation by building a stronger partnership with provincial and 
territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls on the federal parliament to strengthen the 
social fabric of the country by responding to the demands of all 
the provinces and territories.  All the provinces and territories 
have put forward a framework of proposals and the federal 
government has not responded substantively to them.  This motion 
calls for the government to do that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion recognizes that federalism can be a dynamic and a 
flexible system, able to renew and reform itself in response to 
the aspirations and the needs of Canadians.  This motion provides 
an opportunity for federal parliamentarians to show the positive 
leadership needed as we approach the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have long believed that reform of the federation is 
essential and a national priority.  The provinces and territories 
clearly agree.  Reformers have long advocated a more balanced 
federation, decentralizing the delivery of government services, 
allowing the provinces and municipalities the flexibility to 
better meet their own social, cultural, linguistic and economic 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1997, about a year ago, the official opposition put 
forward a motion in the House calling on the federal government 
to communicate the Calgary declaration, which talked about a 
framework for renewing the federation, to the people of Quebec 
and to consult with them on its contents.  The government failed 
to act.  We saw the results yesterday.  When there is no option 
put forward by strong federal leadership, then we have the kind 
of result which we saw yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial premiers and all of the opposition parties have 
endorsed the framework agreement on Canada's social union.  Only 
the federal government refuses to show some imagination and 
courage and to enter into negotiations to accommodate the 
legitimate aspirations of Canadians from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers have pointed out clearly, as have many experts, the 
difficulties with the present arrangements.  The current 
arrangements for the delivery of social programs in this country 
have led to federal meddling in important areas of provincial 
constitutional jurisdiction.  They have led to the duplication of 
effort and expense.  They have led to inefficiency in the 
delivery of the services that Canadians desperately need and they 
have added unnecessary, burdensome cost to the delivery of the 
social programs which are so important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is the millennium scholarship fund.  The federal 
government slashed support for post-secondary education. Then it 
set up its own brand of scholarships, which will go to less than 
10% of Canadian students, with absolutely no notice to or 
consultation with the provinces.  Government members just said 
“Hey, we are going to do this.  We will slash what you do.  We 
will slash the delivery of services by the provinces, and then we 
will gain a medal for spending $2.5 billion in your area of 
jurisdiction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the Canadian foundation for innovation. 
Again, there was no consultation with the provinces.  The 
provinces had to scramble to bring together their side of the 
equation so that research and development could continue to work 
in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one example of where federal-provincial co-operation 
did work, and that is the national child benefit.  In this one 
anomaly the federal government decided to do it right.  It 
actually talked to the provinces.  It gave them notice.  It 
consulted with them.  It made some co-operative arrangements to 
help our families in this country.  The program is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be more clear for the federal government than to say: 
“This is not working.  Stop doing it.  The way to go is with 
consultation and co-operation”?  That is the way to help people 
in this country.  That is what we have to do in the federal 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation which the federal parliament needs to deal 
with.  In August 1995 the premiers held their annual conference. 
At that time they said:  “Social policy reform is one of the 
most significant challenges facing the nation”.  Every province 
and every territory was saying that social policy reform was the 
most significant challenge.  They formed a ministerial council on 
social policy and renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a big secret.  The premiers did not do this in a 
closet.  It was very open and above board.  They were forming a 
council to deal with the issue of social policy renewal.  Where 
was the federal government in all of this?   Nowhere.  The 
federal government did not say “This is an important initiative. 
Social security and the delivery of social services to the people 
of this country is critical.  We care about it too.  Let us work 
with you on this important initiative”.  There was nothing like 
that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1995 the premiers go it alone.  The same year this 
council, moving with commendable expediency, reported principles 
to guide social policy reform and renewal.  The very same year 
this council had results.  Again, what did the federal government 
do?  Did it say:  “Let us examine these principles.  There are 
some things we could add.  We could assist with this.  This could 
work well because we will bring a national perspective to it”? 
Again the federal government was nowhere to be found in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in August 1996, a year after the process started, the 
premiers adopted a paper called “Issues Paper on Social Policy 
Reform and Renewal:  Next Steps”, and established a 
provincial-territorial council on social policy renewal to design 
options to ensure national standards and principles and to deal 
with unilateralism on the part of the federal government.  Again, 
where was the federal government in this important initiative? 
Nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1997 the council presented its option paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1997 the premiers said “Let us negotiate with the 
federal government”.  That was over a year and a half ago.  The 
premiers agreed to continue to work on the framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September they adopted a framework agreement called the 
Calgary declaration and agreed on guidelines for social policy 
renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1997 there was a further meeting of this council, 
which stressed urgency, again pointing to the framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997 the premiers met again and endorsed the 
framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1998 the council met to launch negotiations and for the 
first time in this whole process, nearly three years from the 
time it started, the federal government finally decided that 
maybe it should get involved.  It appointed the justice minister 
to work with the premiers and the territorial leaders on this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened after March?  In June the group met.  Guess what? 
The meetings were described as tense.  They were reported to be 
an “apparent failure”.  The justice minister, the federal 
representative who had finally come along on the train, said “We 
need more time to consider these proposals”, never mind that 
they had been out there for two years or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August the premiers met again.  They issued a major news 
release concerning the framework agreement and said again how 
urgent it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in September?  The Prime Minister finally said 
something.  Here is what he said in an interview with Southam 
News:  “If they don't want to take what I am offering, they take 
nothing.  That is an alternative too”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, after all of the work done by all the premiers 
and the territorial leaders, simply says “It is my way or the 
highway”.  That is not what is called leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking today is that this federal parliament fill 
the leadership vacuum that the Prime Minister and the Liberal 
government have failed to fill and simply move ahead, at a time 
when every single provincial and territorial leader has done all 
of the leg work, to get with the program, help put the ball 
through the goal and make social policy in this country stronger 
and better.  That is what we are asking and I urge members to 
support the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member two questions.  First, Reform 
members come into this House and purport to be acting on behalf 
of the provinces.  Do they or do they not believe that there is a 
position for the federal government in these negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how can they come forward to impose a deadline when the 
very chairman of the process they purport to support does not 
want it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the 
premiers' news release of August 6, 1998.  The last sentence of 
paragraph 6 states:  “Premiers stressed that negotiations should 
now proceed with a view to concluding a draft agreement by the 
end of the year”.  That is what the premiers said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there have to be some goals set.  If the timeline for 
negotiation is infinite, all the federal government has to do is 
play the violin and say nice words about how wonderful it is to 
have co-operation within the federation.  We will never get 
anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be somebody, somewhere, at some time who drives it 
to conclusion.  The premiers have made it extremely clear what 
they think the proper timelines are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a role for the federal government in this. What 
we are saying is “Get on with it.  Play a role.  Do something 
that will move this ball through the goal posts”.  The federal 
government has not only been doing nothing, not only dragging its 
feet, but the Prime Minister himself is saying “We are not going 
to be flexible.  We are not going to negotiate. Either you take 
what we are going to give you or tough bananas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to give us a strong, co-operative 
federation.  We will have to do something differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see by the clock that we still have a 
little over two minutes, but we will hear questions and comments 
after question period.

demands the attention of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 6, 1989, 14 young women were savagely murdered at 
the École Polytechnique in Montreal.  To commemorate the deaths

as a national day of remembrance and action on violence against 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine years after this horrible event I join men and women across 
the country in remembering those who have been injured or killed 
and in thanking community groups that help abused women on a

Algoma Women's Sexual Assault Services, Women in Crisis, the 
Sexual Assault Care Centre, Breton House and the Phoenix Rising 
Women's Centre.  Like their counterparts across the country these 
groups are putting remembrance into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us all do our best to follow their example.  Let us all do

will be a bleak Christmas this year for communities and families

the commodities markets and the government's don't worry, be 
happy attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World oil surpluses are at record highs while prices are at near 
record lows, creating a very uncertain future for those employed 
in the oil industry.  Canada's world class miners have to go to 
Chile and Peru if they want to work in their industry.  The 
Canadian forest industry is facing an unemployment crisis with 
more mills closing every day while the government continues to do 
nothing more than talk about solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a bleak Christmas for many Canadians working in the 
natural resources industries.  We can only hope that the new year 
will bring less talk and more action from the government on 
behalf of these industries which represent the backbone of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one year ago today that the report on the Westray 
disaster was released.  That report noted that management through 
its actions and attitudes sent a message that the safety of the 
workers was not a priority and that this was a contributing 
factor to the disaster.  Based on a submission from the United 
Steelworkers of Canada union the report called for the federal 
government to introduce amendments to legislation to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors be held accountable for 
workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has done nothing to act on that report 
even though on average 900 workers die needlessly in workplace 
related accidents each year in Canada.

absolutely right to ignore Reform's artificial deadline.  It is a

Minister to be a leader, not a straggler, in securing a stronger 
social union. To build on the positive momentum, the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

completely that 55% of contracts being awarded without 
competitive bidding is a percentage that had to be improved.

<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem is

Speaker, I want to ask on world AIDS day if the Minister of 
Health could tell us what is being done to combat this terrible 
disease which is a growing epidemic, especially among young 
people around the world.  Recent statistics show us that half of 
new HIV infections are among young people.  What is the strategy 
to combat this terrible disease among young people?

this morning I published the first annual report from the 
Government of Canada to Canadians on the progress of our strategy 
against HIV and AIDS, a strategy in which we are investing $42 
million each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are daunting challenges before us there were some 
encouraging things that were reported this morning.  We are 
working in partnership with Canadians.  The voices of the 
communities are being heard.  We are targeting youth in 
particular, aiming toward prevention through education and 
instruction.  We are investing in research.  We are supporting 
community efforts.  We are focusing this year on youth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The oral question period that just ended was a 
little more difficult than usual for all members. One must 
realize, as I do, that we sometimes get a little carried away 
during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During today's oral question period, one member, the Prime 
Minister, used the word “hypocrisy”. I asked him not to use that 
word, and when the hon. member for Roberval took the floor, he 
also used the word “hypocrisy”. I asked him not to use such a 
word and, later, for some reason, the hon. member said that 
another member was a “hypocrite”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this language to be unparliamentary. I asked my 
colleague, the hon. member for Roberval, to withdraw his comment 
that another member was a hypocrite, but he would only do so if 
the other member also withdrew his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to me, as Speaker of the House, to make a decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a simple decision to make, and I once again address 
myself directly to my colleague, the hon. member for Roberval, 
for whom I have a great deal of respect. I respectfully ask him 
to withdraw the word he used, when he said that another member 
was a “hypocrite”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I ask you 
to look at the blues before making your decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my impression that there is an important nuance between 
what I said and what you tell me I said.  I believe that looking 
at the blues would be the best thing for you, for myself, for 
everyone and for the Standing Orders.  After that, you and I can 
take the proper steps within the parliamentary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I might ask you this rather small favour of looking at the 
blues and we can then discuss this situation again. I will make 
honourable amends, if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask you to check the blues first. 
Is it possible to ask you to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> As the hon. member said, there may be some nuances 
in the words used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my judgment, the words used, the words “il est un 
hypocrite”, 
he is a hypocrite, caused a disturbance in this House, in my 
opinion.  For that reason, I am asking the hon. member once 
again— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The Prime Minister provoked it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, in my judgment the words used during 
the Oral Question Period by the hon. member for Roberval, were 
unparliamentary.  I ask him once again to withdraw the words he 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the 
Chair, for the institution, but for once, I will have to accept 
your verdict. Unfortunately, I cannot comply with your request. 
It goes against my principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider that I have been unfairly treated compared to the 
Prime Minister.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE STUDY OF SPORT IN CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege with regard to yet another leaked 
document, this time on the subcommittee on sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose to spend a brief amount of time on this, but I will 
suggest a solution to the House on behalf of our members on how 
to curtail this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While browsing through press clippings this morning I noted that 
the debate on the report of the subcommittee on sport began on 
Friday in the Toronto <I>Star</I>.  Tim Harper in an article makes 
the following comment:  “Canada's professional sports teams 
would be eligible for tax breaks if they can show they are 
providing substantial revenues to their communities but need some 
help to continue, a committee will recommend”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to quote the chairman, the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood, saying: “His committee will recommend 
Canadian sports franchises playing in North American leagues 
could be eligible for tax breaks if—” and it goes on and on. 
The article lists a number of items from the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saturday edition of the <I>National Post</I> on page A17 
reports much of the same thing and uses the language “A Commons 
committee recommends”, and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> the debate continues on the 
report.  In an article Gare Joyce states that the opposition 
members leaked details of the report late last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have circumstantial evidence that points to the chair openly 
discussing the report and the article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
actually cites members as leakers. Whatever the case may be, 
there are leakers among us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised this committee is ignoring parliamentary 
practice since it was this committee in fact that decided to 
ignore parliament altogether when it travelled to Toronto without 
the permission of the House.  It is my understanding that the 
committee actually brought with it a host of Commons interpreters 
and other staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee and its members have absolutely no respect for 
parliament.  But then again, why should they?  Leaking a report 
before it is tabled in the House is more common than waiting for 
a report to be tabled. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some recent examples are, Mr. Speaker, and you have 
heard them all from us.  There is the third report of the justice 
committee, the fourth report of the fisheries committee, the 
second report of the health committee, the child custody report, 
the foreign affairs report, and now the report on sport in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening here, Mr. Speaker, is that these people who 
leak this information are being rewarded by getting a hit in the 
news and the news organization that receives the leaked 
information gets a news scoop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is no deterrent for leaking reports, reports 
continue to be leaked in this House. This has happened so often 
without the House taking responsibility that committees and their 
members have now decided to ignore parliament altogether.  I 
wonder what will be next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament is going to be known as a good place for a leak, 
then we have to talk about a little more transparency on the 
issue.  We might as well openly leak reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am faced with this situation with my colleagues.  We have not 
leaked reports but we are sick and tired of reports being leaked 
from all of the committees.  Either these reports will stop being 
leaked from these committees or this party here will consider 
reports from committees to be open public documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, Mr. Speaker, that you consider this and consider that 
time after time we come to this House and appeal to you to have 
this sort of thing stopped with no satisfactory resolution 
whatsoever. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can only speak to that portion of the member's remarks 
that deals with the subcommittee on sport.  I can say two things. 
It was approved in the heritage committee this morning that the 
report would be tabled here on Thursday morning. I can also say 
to the hon. member that he will not find one sentence of any 
article anywhere in this country in the report that will be 
tabled here on Thursday.  The report as of this minute has not 
been leaked in any way, shape or form to the press. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the chair of the subcommittee in 
question has just indicated that to the best of his knowledge 
nothing that is in the report in fact has appeared elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I respectfully recommend to the Chair that before 
determining whether in fact there has been a leak, let alone what 
is done with it, that one should await the tabling of the 
document in question.  That would not ascertain whether there has 
been a leak but it certainly would ascertain of course if the 
allegations made today in the media are false.  We would at least 
know that as a first proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I understand that the procedure and House 
affairs committee has received representations from hon. members. 
In fact it intends to start a discussion of this issue very 
shortly and of course subsequently to report its findings to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things.  One, we do not have a copy of the report 
of the said subcommittee before the House and no way to compare 
whether or not the allegations in the paper are factual.  Two, we 
should also wait for the report of the committee on procedure and 
House affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I must say that I profoundly agree with anyone 
who suggests that it is improper to leak reports from standing 
committees.  I as a parliamentarian and all members of this House 
have the right to be the first to know of what is prepared by a 
committee of our own colleagues. 
I fully subscribe to that proposition and I fully condemn anyone 
who attempts to make a report of ours as members of parliament 
available to someone else before our own colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to say that I share the concern expressed by 
the House leader of the Reform Party and for that matter by the 
government House leader about the pattern of leaked committee 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have more to say on a subsequent point of order about 
question period, but one just feels the whole place here is 
teetering on the brink of chaos.  People each in their own way 
are showing no respect for a variety of customs that have been 
established in this place to keep us from descending into chaos. 
One of those things has been the provision that committee reports 
are private and confidential until such time as they are tabled 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of a larger pattern of disregard for the House. It 
is not surprising to me, although I say this in no way to excuse 
it, but over time members would come to see the media as the 
place to make announcements when a pattern has developed over the 
years where the government itself does it.  The House itself is 
used less and less by ministers, by the Prime Minister and by the 
government to make announcements.  It is not just committee 
reports that we read about in the paper; it is government policy 
announcements and other kinds of major announcements that we read 
about in the paper.  It is a pattern that is destroying this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know what you can do about it because in 
the end it is something we all have to do something about.  It 
does not just have to do with committees.  It has to do with a 
pattern of government disregard for the House which has caught on 
and which has become endemic and is reaching its way into every 
aspect of our undertakings here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge members in whatever their capacity, whether they 
are government or opposition, that wherever they have an 
opportunity, to uphold the view that here is where we hear about 
things first. Here is where members of parliament get elected so 
they can hear about things first, instead of reading about it in 
the newspaper whether it is a committee report or an announcement 
by a minister.  Then we can get back to being a parliament for a 
change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the House leader of the NDP.  As usual 
I appreciate his experience in this place and his observations of 
what has happened over the years.  It is well known that members 
of the Reform Party are willing to look at new ways and different 
ways of doing business in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that need to be respected.  What needs to be 
respected are the rules that we have agreed on going into the 
game.  As happened yesterday, rules were changed on Private 
Members' Business by resolution of the House.  That is how you 
change the rules and until such time you live under those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when constantly day in and day out and week in and week out 
reports are leaked to the press, ideas and balloons are floated 
in the press, then imagine the whip's job as he tries to get 
people into committee and argue with them that it is important 
work of parliament and we are doing the people's work by doing 
these studies.  People come back to me and other people in the 
party and say halfway through that it is totally irrelevant 
because the government leaks it to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of was an exact quote attributed verbatim out of a 
report does not matter in this instance. On talking about the 
sports report that was leaked earlier, when someone quotes 
somebody as saying that his committee will recommend Canadian 
sports franchises playing in North American leagues could be 
eligible for tax breaks, that may not be a word for word quote 
out of the report, but what is the difference?  The report is 
out.  It is now public debate. The work of committee members who 
have been slogging it out for months on that report is now 
irrelevant.  We may as well all go down and talk to our favourite 
reporter and duke it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to come to consensus.  Members of parliament 
who do not like that can come to this place and try to change the 
rules.  But the rules should be followed.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party is following the rules.  I believe this side of the 
House is following the rules.  That side of the House had better 
smarten up or, as the House leader of the NDP has already said, 
we are going to devolve into more disrespect for parliament 
unless they get their act together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As was stated by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, we are indeed talking about a 
broader problem.  It is a problem here with parliament where we 
were elected to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have with the point of privilege that was brought up by 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, at least at this point 
from what I can hear, is that the hon. member is saying that 
someone from the government side leaked a document.  He does not 
name a member but he seems to indicate that one of the members 
may have done it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member that he seems to have indicated, the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood, stood on his feet and as an hon. member he 
told us here in this House that he and no one else that he knows 
of has leaked this particular document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are right about one thing, that we do have the 
rules in the House and ultimately the rules are going to be kept 
by us, the members of this House.  I do not know how many times 
that I as the Speaker have to appeal to all members.  These rules 
are made for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, from what I have heard, we have a dispute on the 
facts of what happened.  I find that there is no prima facie case 
for a point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, how many times do we all stand in this House and bemoan 
this fact?  The government House leader says that he is 
absolutely opposed to anything like this.  We have the Leader of 
the Opposition who is absolutely opposed.  The spokesperson for 
the New Democratic Party is opposed.  We all agree and yet these 
things still go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we the parliamentarians together make a decision as to 
how we are going to conduct ourselves in here, we must not just 
deteriorate into the chaos of pointing fingers at one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that there is no prima facie case for a point of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all my colleagues that unless we want to make this 
place work, it will not work.  I appeal to your sense of honour 
that this type of thing should not happen.  The best place for 
these announcements is here in our House where we are.  This is 
where they should be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all of you, whoever the person is who leaked this, 
if they are indeed in this House or close to the people in this 
House, in the name of respect for this institution, that this 
cease forthwith.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my point of order has to do with question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some members know, like some other members around here I am 
closing in on 20 years in this place and I have to say that was 
one of the worst question periods I have ever experienced.  I 
think we all have some thinking to do about what is happening in 
question period and what happened to it in the extreme today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can continue in a situation where there is 
this sort of collective bellowing and clapping that goes on after 
every exchange. This is not a soccer game here for God's sake.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can be as partisan as the next person.  I like a good heckle 
and a good exchange, but everything that has been happening 
throughout this fall is going beyond the beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess a collective self-interest in the matter.  It is 
not just a question of decorum for us, it also a question that 
the smaller parties get pushed off at the end of question period 
when this happens.  The people who are generally at fault in 
this, who have the power collectively in their numbers to bring 
the House to a standstill, are not the people who suffer.  Either 
the government or the Bloc or the Reform Party each take its turn 
at this and who suffers?  Who gets pushed off at the end of 
question period?  It is not the people who have the power to 
create this kind of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about it from the point of view of the NDP and 
the Conservatives, but it is not just that.  It is also the 
people on the end of the list for the Reform Party, on the end of 
the list for the Bloc and the government backbenchers who were on 
the list.  I do not think we can tolerate this situation any 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I plead with you to rethink your own tactics in 
this regard.  I know that you do not want to say “order”, but I 
am very concerned that the tactic which you employ of simply 
standing until the House reconvenes, until it quiets down by 
itself, is not working.  As much as I know your reasons, which I 
think are noble, for not wanting to say “order”, there are 
certainly times in this place for the Speaker to intervene and 
say “order”, as speakers do with gavels or orally in 
parliaments all around the world.  There is a time and a place 
for this.  I would urge you to rethink your strategy in this 
regard because it is visibly, obviously, clearly not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today was a perfect example of that.  There were moments when I 
felt that an intervention by the Chair might have brought order 
or might simply have moved us on.  If you feel one party or 
another is contributing negatively to decorum, move on to the 
next party.  Do as speakers in the past have done and use the 
discretion of the Chair to punish people who are not contributing 
to decorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that people who are members of the parties which are 
acting up will be punished for the sins of their colleagues, but 
collectively they will have a discussion about it after the fact 
and maybe better behaviour will come of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people watch this on television they cannot tell who is 
yelling.  All they see is you, Mr. Speaker, so they think we are 
all yelling.  We are not all yelling.  Some of us are sitting 
here hoping the place will get quiet so we can get on with our 
questions.  It does not help the public perception of the House 
of Commons to have you standing there for literally five minutes 
at a time sometimes, as was the case today, while there is this 
terrible background noise.  It cannot be good for parliament in 
terms of its perception and it certainly is not good for 
parliament in terms of its everyday practice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to add to the remarks of my 
colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona.  He is absolutely right when 
he says that those who are perhaps the most active in this 
raucous behaviour that is delaying question period are the direct 
beneficiaries of that behaviour and that the people who pay the 
price are those in the smaller parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have something else on the record.  The loss of two or 
four questions from the two smallest parties in this House is 
significant in terms of our overall presentation and our ability 
to participate in a fair way in the question period process.

even-handedness that you do intervene and that you move quickly. 
There should be some consequence for the type of behaviour we 
have seen displayed.

questions that cause this place to deteriorate into an uproar and 
there seems to be little consequence for that behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I appeal to you and ask you to use your discretion 
in the Chair to move quickly.  As has been stated previously by 
the hon. member from the NDP, there has to be some sense of 
fairness and justice if question period is to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly do not have the experience of the previous member, 
but in the short time I have been here, in the past number of 
months, I have seen the deterioration.  Perhaps today was an 
aberration, but I believe that there has been deterioration. 
There has to be some intervention on the part of the Chair if 
this behaviour is to stop.

I want to put on the record that I am also disgusted to be one of 
the 301 people sitting in the House today.  I am ashamed to be 
part of this collective House and what went on in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the comments of both of the last two members who 
spoke.  It is not just today.  We have seen this all fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look, for example, at what happened today.  There was no 
punishment by throwing the member out of the House for the rest 
of the day.  Mr. Speaker, I suggest that you have to take serious 
action and maybe even not recognize people in the future. 
Something has to be done to bring decorum back to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to one of my colleagues “I wonder what it looks like 
through the eyes of the camera, to the people out there?  How bad 
is it?”  I can say that I was disgusted to be one of the members 
sitting in the House today.  We are collectively part of this 
institution and it is time we changed this situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not specifically want to 
comment on the strategies employed by the Chair, other than to 
indicate my support for the Chair and its occupant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do agree that this was not one of our better days.  I do not 
want to say it was the worst one we have ever seen.  I have been 
around here a long time too and I remember a number of others. 
But it is true that this was not up to the standard which we have 
established over the last year, year and half or perhaps before 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe one good idea would be for all of us, as we gather 
tomorrow at our weekly caucus meetings, to review and gather our 
thoughts to determine what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of the season, notwithstanding the insults flying 
across the way, we should do what we can to co-operate at least 
over the number of days remaining before we adjourn for the 
holiday season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are parties that have been aggrieved today, and no 
doubt some were because of the shortage of questions, maybe if we 
do a better job of being brief in our questions over the next few 
days, then we will at least make up for any grievance that might 
have come forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I would hope and I offer it as a suggestion not to 
the Chair, but to all of us, to help make this place work better 
over the next five or six days until we adjourn for the holiday 
season.

establish a direct connection with the point raised by our 
colleague from the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A moment ago, and you did not interrupt him, our colleague from 
Saanich—Gulf Islands suggested that the ruling you had just made 
was not a real punishment of our colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who knows the member for Roberval knows that he is an 
experienced parliamentarian with profound respect for 
parliamentary institutions and, as such, fully aware that his 
decision not to comply with your ruling— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have asked that no reference be made to the hon. 
member for Roberval. If you have a point to make, please make it 
now so that we can continue. I do not want any further reference 
to the hon. member for Roberval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, if in order to make my point 
I must refer to my colleague without naming his riding, as did 
the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, I shall carry on 
without naming his riding, confident that all the members of 
this House know full well who I am referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His decision not to comply with your ruling was a very difficult 
decision for him to make. But having said that, Mr. Speaker, you 
made this ruling on the basis of the disturbance his remarks may 
have caused in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that his request, which, in my sense, was 
a very reasonable one, was for you to examine remarks—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think probably what my colleagues feel is that there is not 
equality in the way in which every member is treated.  I can 
understand the position that you are in.  It is awkward.  You 
have to make a call on the fly and it is a difficult thing for 
you to do.  I think my colleague from Winnipeg made a good point 
that rather than just standing there for what seems forever when 
we are in the short, tight period of question period, maybe you 
do need to be a little more proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just gone up to my office and reviewed the tape of my 
question period time and over five minutes was spent on that. 
There was nothing unparliamentary in what I said.  But what I 
sensed from you, Mr. Speaker, was that because you were angry 
with the Bloc you ended up taking it out on me.  I am not sure 
there is any wisdom in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am getting a pretty good picture of where 
we are going.  With respect to this point of order I am going to 
make a suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this parliament the House leaders came to me 
with a suggestion about question period.  It seemed like a good 
suggestion at the time and I think it is a good suggestion even 
to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a bad question period.  It was probably the worst that 
I have been through as Speaker of the House.  Perhaps the blame 
should rest on my shoulders.  After all, I am your Speaker.  You 
have chosen me.  Perhaps the tactics that I have used have been 
less than proactive, as was suggested.  However, I have always 
been of the view that members of parliament, indeed most people, 
are reasonable people.  You have come to the same conclusion 
today. You have seen what we can do to ourselves in this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to convene before the question period tomorrow.  I 
see that most of the House leaders are here now. 
I would like to convene the House leaders and if they so wish 
their whips, but if not just the House leaders, in my chambers. I 
will have them contacted before the end of this day with a time. 
This is serious enough that I would like them to sit down with me 
in my chambers.  We will address this problem together and we 
will solve this problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with a colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House deal with many different issues on a day to 
day basis.  During any given session we could be talking about 
bank mergers, agricultural subsidies or assistance to northern 
communities.  The topics are as diverse as the physical and human 
geography of the country.  Each is important in its own way 
because each impacts on the communities and the people we 
represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we would all agree that Canada's social union is an 
issue that touches both the hearts and minds of every Canadian in 
each corner of this great nation.  I am happy the Reform Party 
has taken an active interest in the social union framework. It is 
certainly an issue which the government and the Prime Minister 
take seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion neglects to mention that the idea of the social 
union framework arose not from the Saskatoon agreement but rather 
from a meeting between the Prime Minister and his provincial 
colleagues in December 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has always supported the initiative from the 
start.  While I understand the opposition's desire to speed 
things along, I cannot support the motion.  Nor should the House 
support it.  Negotiations are still ongoing and we must resist 
the temptation to rush recklessly forward.  There are important 
issues on the table and it demands that they be addressed both 
thoroughly and thoughtfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thomas D'Arcy McGee, one of the architects of our modern system 
of government, once characterized federalism as a great principle 
that speaks to the very foundations of human nature.  I like 
this. It shows the kind of spirit that went into the development 
of this great country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles at the heart of the federal idea are noble ones: 
mutual support, understanding and accommodation.  These are the 
principles upon which the country was built and helped make 
Canada what it is today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we focus on disagreements and disputes, we lose sight 
of these principles.  We lose sight of how we all benefit from 
federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliament and our country were not built by men who kept 
saying that it was beyond their ability or wondering what they 
would get out of it.  They were built by people who focussed on 
what they could accomplish together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a bit more of this kind of enthusiasm today, because 
Canada is constantly evolving.  It is a work in progress.  We 
have a solid foundation, but we must keep building. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the government is doing.  The Reform Party 
asked about our plans concerning the social union framework.  The 
answer is straightforward.  We are negotiating with our partners. 
It is that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is confident that we will negotiate a framework 
agreement that is good for the country and all citizens.  That is 
how the government operates.  We take a reasoned approach 
designed to produce maximum benefits for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is certainly the approach we are taking toward renewing the 
federation.  We promote national unity by building a better 
Canada for all Canadians.  That is what Canadians want.  If we 
ask people on the streets of Kitchener, Halifax or Drummondville 
what their priorities are, we will get the same answers: jobs, 
safe streets, good health care and a healthy environment for 
themselves and their children.  That is what Canadians want and 
that is exactly what we are working on giving them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what some may be implying, building a stronger Canada 
does not mean focusing exclusively on the Constitution.  The 
Constitution is a useful tool for state building that continues 
to serve the country well.  It needs to be respected, but 
constitutional change is not the only way to improve the 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has worked very hard over the past five years to 
improve our country.  It has worked systematically in partnership 
with the provinces to address the needs of Canadians. 
Negotiation of the social union framework is part of the these 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of our initiatives have been introduced on a variety of 
different fronts.  They have been developed with the goal of 
better positioning Canada as we enter the 21st century.  We have 
a plan that we outlined in the Speech from the Throne.  We are 
following that plan systematically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will discuss some of the advantages we have made on the 
fiscal side of things.  Getting our books in order is 
fundamentally important because it allows us the freedom to 
pursue our goals.  Then I will identify the principles that 
underlie our current efforts toward renewing the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at the initiatives the government has undertaken 
which prove that progress has and will continue to take place. 
That should give members of the House a good idea of how much has 
already been accomplished over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made historic inroads in deficit reduction 
and has worked with Canadians to balance our books.  I am proud 
to say that the world has taken notice.  The financial gurus who 
were disparaging us just a few short years ago are now changing 
their tunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the sacrifices that Canadians made and the conditions 
we have set in place to ensure a strong Canadian economy, we have 
continued a five year tradition of beating every one of our 
fiscal targets.  The federal budget balance has improved from a 
deficit of $42 billion in 1993-94 to a surplus of $3.5 billion in 
1997-98, a $45.5 billion turnaround in just four years.

United Kingdom among the G-7 nations.

nineties our deficits were much higher than those of the U.S. Now 
we have a surplus.  Interest rates on long term government bonds 
which directly affect mortgage rates and business loans are at 
their lowest levels in three decades.  A good economy goes a long 
way in promoting a strong and unified Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition motion fails to recognize that when we are in a 
partnership it takes agreement and it takes consensus among all 
the players.  While it is true that there has been consensus 
reached and the government will build on that coming from the 
Saskatoon meeting of August 7, there is not the unanimous consent 
the motion is predicated upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown that it is willing to work in a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to what I call a 
wonderful accolade which has been given to the government, a 
wonderful vote of confidence, a wonderful gesture of the 
opposition stating that it has the utmost confidence in the 
government to conclude in 31 days what I would call one of the 
most fundamental, one of the most important and one of the most 
significant agreements in Canadian political history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition through the Reform motion is calling on the 
government to conclude an agreement by December 31, 1998 on what 
its version of social union would be.  It is calling on the 
government to unilaterally conclude those discussions and to come 
up with an agreement by December 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really reflect on it, as the hon. member for Burin—St. 
George's should do instead of babbling on over there, the 
opposition is telling us that we should have a clear and full 
mandate to unilaterally, without the scrutiny of the opposition, 
conclude that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think about what social programs are to Canadians, the 
values that Canadians instil through their social programs and 
what they mean to them practically in their day to day lives, 
this is quite an accomplishment.  The opposition is giving us 
quite an accolade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On social programs, our health care system, our employment 
insurance system and our job training system, things that 
Canadians cherish and rely upon, the opposition is telling us 
that with unanimous consent of the House we should be able to 
conclude an agreement within a 31 day period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a nation that has evolved over 130 years.  If we think 
about it, the opposition is now telling us that we should have 31 
days to conclude a very significant piece of work.  I take the 
compliment very seriously and gratefully, but I think the issue 
is far too serious, far too important and far too fundamental to 
the wishes and aspirations of Canadians for us to do so without 
fully engaging our partners in this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social programs are very important.  We take very seriously our 
role in guarding them and making sure that they are available to 
future generations just as they are available to us today.  It is 
not so much ensuring that they are available as is but that they 
evolve according to the wishes and the needs of Canadians over 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreements and discussions that will come forward in coming 
months and years must reflect the priority of Canadians.  They 
must reflect their wishes.  That involves citizen engagement. 
That cannot be done in a 31 day period as the opposition is 
telling us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any agreement could be drafted, and I am not 
saying should be drafted, in a 31 day period given the fact that 
there probably would not be too many opposition members around on 
December 31, 1998 to review it, to reflect upon it or to offer 
their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that bodes well for the conduct and activities of 
the House.  I do not think that those are the original intentions 
or wishes of the opposition.  However, it reflects their very 
poorly thought out, opportunistic and ill spirited intent to 
corner the government for the sake of cornering it by suggesting 
that it would be appropriate to conclude such a significant 
agreement within a 31 day period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are far more intelligent, far more reflective and take 
their social programs far more seriously than to be boondoggled 
by such a very inappropriate and ill conceived notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working diligently toward building a consensus, working 
with our partners and working with all sides of the House in an 
honest debate, not on something that is preconceived and 
arbitrary, not in the best interest of Canadians and not 
reflected by the premiers of the province.  Within the past 24 
hour period they have come forward and said that we should do 
this thoughtfully and responsibly and get the best possible 
social union, not just any social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the difference between members on this side of the House 
and members on the other side of the House.  We are looking to 
get what is in the best interest of Canadians.  That means not 
concluding a deal just for the sake of concluding a deal.  It 
means making sure that we build upon the 130 year history of our 
country and that we build upon the efforts, the initiatives and 
the strengths of our forefathers, the people who built the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember the country did not evolve within a period 
of 31 days as is now being suggested as the objective, the motive 
or the principle we should adopt.  It is being suggested that as 
at December 1, 1998 we should put in place an arbitrary deadline 
for the form and the finality of a social union which will be the 
cultural base of our social programs for the future and will be 
the rigid structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what this is all about.  We are not engaging in a 
debate that will actually determine the nature of social 
programs.  We are engaging in a discussion about how the 
implementation of those programs will proceed.  We will still 
need a lot of flexibility over time.  We will still need the 
input of Canadians over time.  No matter when or whatever 
agreement is concluded, Canadians must, should and will be a part 
of any process.  Canadians have to be.  We have to engage our 
citizens in any such discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we include a December 31, 1998 deadline and say that there 
will be no further discussions after that point, on New Year's 
Eve 1998 while the Reform Party is out celebrating the Government 
of Canada will be finalizing the entire form, structure and 
nature of the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about it.  Canadians across the country have 
already thought about it.  They do not want it.  They want a 
process which is a lot more responsible, inclusive to their 
wishes and abides by the wishes of the 10 provinces.  The 
provinces have spoken.  They have said that we should continue 
the discussions, not put arbitrary deadlines on anything but 
build an agreement which is substantive, in good form and 
reflects the needs of current and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is much more to say.  Canadians know what 
they need.  They know what they want.  They know what they 
deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What they deserve is a process that is fair, equitable, 
transparent and reflects the fact that it is irresponsible to 
negotiate an agreement with a gun to the head as the Reform Party 
is suggesting through a motion that binds the Government of 
Canada to a December 31, 1998 deadline to conclude all future 
discussions, to finalize it, to finish it and to have no more 
involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude where I began.  The Reform Party has given us 
quite an accolade.  It is quite an acknowledgement of our 
capabilities, our spirit and our willingness to work for 
Canadians.  It is quite a show of confidence.  However, it is 
unfortunately one that I will reject right now because this party 
and this government are more interested in doing things right, in 
including the citizens and in doing things the responsible way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member 
opposite.  He said that we have asked them to settle this most 
fundamental and important agreement ever for the government in 31 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here during question period and I heard the Prime Minister 
tell the House that the government originated the social union 
talks.  It must have some parameters upon which it supposedly 
built, although I disagree with who originated it.  He also said 
that they had a response report in December 1997.  We are talking 
about the government having a response to the premiers social 
union 12 months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has been negotiating long enough to respond to 
the premiers a year ago, is he telling me that it cannot wrap up 
a year and a half long or a two year long discussion in 30 days? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the member rapped about 31 days.  We are 
not talking about 31 days.  According to the Prime Minister, the 
government has had at least 12 months from the time it gave a 
response to the premiers on the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand why 
the member from the Reform Party would be confused or not 
understand how members on this side of the House could actually 
enter into a discussion without a preconceived notion.  When the 
Reform Party caucus meets and decides automatically who the 
Reformer of the week is, all those discussions have usually come 
to a preconceived conclusion.  That is why that particular aspect 
of my comments today may not fall on completely sensitive ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite right.  This is a process that does 
take time and has taken time.  Quite frankly it will take even 
more time.  The country was not built in 31 days.  Nor was it 
built in a year and a half.  Nor was it built in a decade.  It 
took several years to come to the point where we have a national 
health care system with universal principles that is universally 
accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took several years to build an economic system where we have 
infrastructure from one end of the country to the other, where we 
have different ideals and beliefs about the implementation of 
labour market principles and where individual provinces agree 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good things take time and it is about time the hon. member 
learned that.

quick question for the member.  The member who just spoke is well 
known as an advocate for his region of the country, Atlantic 
Canada.  He spends a lot of time thinking about, debating and 
working on the issues that are comprised within the social union 
envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell the House whether there has been a cry on the part 
of the Atlantic premiers for a deadline?  Are they expressing 
concern about the speed of this?  In his experience are they 
asking for a specific deadline?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that question actually 
focuses the debate and the discussion much better.  I am pleased 
to answer it.  The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador has gone 
on record.  He specifically said that we should continue to work, 
take our time, be diligent in our discussions, be thoughtful in 
our discussions and do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador has been joined by 
premiers from western Canada as well the constituencies, places 
or regions that some members opposite may purport to best 
represent.  However, premiers from across the country have said 
that they support the federal government.  They acknowledge the 
federal government.  They are equal partners in the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should not be sidetracked into a secondary role based on a 
Reform motion which imposes upon the federal government alone to 
conclude the discussions and the negotiations by December 31, 
1998.  That is not the spirit. That is not the substance of what 
we are trying to do.  The Reform Party should learn that and 
understand it once and for all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in the province of Quebec voters again turned to the 
separatist government of the Parti Quebecois, or did they?  I 
submit that Quebecers did not vote for Lucien Bouchard as much as 
they voted against status quo federalism.  Polls indicate that 
the majority of Quebecers believe in Canada.  However they have 
made it very clear that Confederation must be rejuvenated.  This 
will not be an easy task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has avoided it for over 30 years. Despite 
this terrible record members opposite can make their first steps 
in the right direction by voting in favour of the motion by the 
hon. member of South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, more 
importantly by beginning to create winning conditions for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was formed into Confederation in 1867 at a time when the 
Constitution Act guaranteed the division of power between the 
federal and provincial governments.  However, since that time the 
federal government has clawed back control over areas that 
rightfully belong to the provinces such as employment training, 
social services and education.  Because of this, Quebec and other 
Canadian provinces alike continue to feel marginalized by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 René Lévesque took Quebec to the polls in a bout on 
sovereignty.  This was a wake up call to the House of Commons 
that the social union between the provinces and the federal 
government was not functioning.  Still nothing was done to solve 
the problem.  Instead the federal government under Liberal leader 
Pierre Trudeau continued to pick away at areas of provincial 
responsibility and attempted to impose the federal government's 
will in every facet of social spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution was repatriated to Canada in 1982 with great 
fanfare, much horn blowing and flag waving.  Accords were 
appended at Meech Lake and in Charlottetown.  By 1992 both these 
agreements had been defeated due to their fundamental failure to 
address the issues of provincial-federal relations.  Worse still, 
neither of these agreements responded to the grassroots voices of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rightfully rejected the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
accords.  At the time only the Reform Party stood against these 
backroom, made in Ottawa solutions to Canadian unity.  I am proud 
of our record in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably in 1995 the Parti Quebecois launched a second vote on 
separation.  Throughout the referendum campaign the Prime 
Minister led Canadians to believe he was not concerned or worried 
about the outcome.  Canadians were loath to sleep because of 
these assurances.  The Prime Minister was terribly wrong in this 
assessment of Quebecers' desire for change and we fortunately 
achieved a no victory by the narrowest of margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the history lesson?  Because all these efforts have brought 
us exactly nowhere.  As of Monday we again sit on Canada's 
break-up.  The clock is ticking.  Premier Bouchard is already at 
work in attempting to manufacture a yes vote in the next 
referendum.  In the last 30 years federal politicians have talked 
around the issue of Quebec separation.  They have never addressed 
the core problems of federal-provincial responsibility. This head 
in the sand approach has resulted in two referendums in 
succession, two failed constitutional accords and the growth of 
two full blown separatist parties in the Bloc Quebecois and Parti 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec are clearly dissatisfied and the narrow 
margin of a no referendum victory in 1995 sent a very clear 
message of the vital need for real change in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only Quebecers but British Columbians, Albertans and people 
from all provinces want greater control over the decisions which 
directly impact the economic, social and cultural fabric of their 
lives.  The symbolic gestures of distinct society and regional 
vetoes that were made following the referendum vote have proven 
ineffective and irrelevant to resolving the crisis.  In 
particular, the passing of Motion No. 26 recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society demonstrated a blatant disregard for the wishes 
of Canadians who had twice expressed their opposition to such 
recognition in Meech Lake and Charlottetown.  It had no affect on 
the desire of sovereignists to separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has consistently set out to resolve these 
problems, not with empty rhetoric and bind faith, not with 
rolling dice in backroom deals.  We have proposed substantive and 
workable change in the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1996 we published “20/20: A Vision for The 
Future of Canada”.  This document outlined 20 realities to 
secession so that the federal government would be prepared to 
face future threats of separation.  More important, we provided 
20 proposals for a new confederation.  I believe these proposals 
were the beginning of creating winning conditions for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1988 the Reform Party again proposed changes to modernize 
the Canadian government when we introduced the new Canada act. 
To date the government has taken no action on any of these 
recommendations.  We cannot afford to sit on our hands any 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the floor of the House today speaks to the heart 
of these matters.  If passed it would be the first real step in 
achieving a fair relationship between the federal and provincial 
governments from coast to coast.  It is not specifically designed 
for Quebec, nor should it be.  However, the framework put forward 
today addresses key concerns on the minds of people both in and 
out of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an understanding among all 10 premiers and both 
territorial leaders that health care is a top priority.  The 
Parti Quebecois of Quebec, the NDP Government of Saskatchewan, 
the Conservative Government of Alberta, the Liberal Government of 
New Brunswick all have called for greater input into the 
provision of social services.  The widespread support for the 
Calgary declaration should have been used as a springboard for 
this government to tackle some of the outstanding problems in 
federal-provincial relations.  Instead it sat largely untouched 
and unused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion on the floor today addresses many of the concerns 
Canadians have been expressing across the country.  It provides a 
framework of discussion that will lead to a bilateral, 
universally accepted social union between different levels of 
government and remove uncertainty facing Canadians.  It will 
provide direction for legislation that can address a wide range 
of outstanding issues on health care and constitutional reform. 
Currently there is no federal-provincial dispute resolution 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, the Constitution Act, 1867 guarantees the 
right of provinces to provide these services.  Despite this, the 
federal government has consistently pursued a policy that has 
limited the input of provincial authorities.  We cannot continue 
to unilaterally dictate the terms of social union and provincial 
authorities and expect co-operation under the terms of 
Confederation.  We must establish a framework for open discussion 
and equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from British Columbia.  I state for the record that I am 
dismayed with the performance of the present provincial 
government.  It has helped to drive British Columbia to the brink 
of financial ruin.  Nurses threaten widespread picketing and 
doctors continue job action.  They are critically understaffed. 
But the federal government is equally culpable.  B.C. is like all 
provinces handcuffed by the $7 billion removed from health care 
transfers.  This motion lays the framework for legislation that 
will ensure that when the federal government promises to pay 50% 
of program costs the promises will be kept.  Without this blind 
assurance, the long term planning of health, social welfare and 
educational budgets is impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the federal government is the prosecutor, the judge 
and the jury of any disputes.  British Columbia, Alberta and 
Quebec have all been forced to structure their social welfare 
programs within very strict guidelines despite the federal 
government's ability to unilaterally reduce funding through the 
Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces are not the same.  However, all provinces must be 
treated equally and fairly by providing realistic and mutually 
acceptable approaches to the participation or non-participation 
of provinces in Canada and Canada's social programs.  This motion 
gives more latitude in the provision of social care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is focused on the December 31 date.  I hear it 
over and over again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the beginning.  We are saying it has to get the 
framework in place.  Obviously the details would be ironed out 
down the road. We have to make it happen and there has to be a 
target date. It is nonsense to say we will solve everything. But 
the entire framework and how it is to happen has to be in place. 
It is very achievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the federal government has guarded this right 
zealously.  However, it has not provided provinces the ability to 
operate creatively within this framework.  The motion today 
provides that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity today to put a positive step forward and 
engage the provinces in a meaningful manner, a way that does not 
require constitutional amendments nor placing any one province in 
an unequal position to that of the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion on the floor today proposes a social union between 
the provinces and the federal government.  It would create a 
mechanism to constructively move this process forward.  It would 
give British Columbia a greater say in social policy.  It would 
give Newfoundland fair and even footing with dealing with Ottawa. 
And yes, it would provide the Quebec people with the greater 
control they seek without separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does all these things from a position of equality 
and openness.  It will provide the blueprint for a secure social 
safety net and a more solid foundation for the Canadian 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to vote in favour of it and 
to help ensure that Canada, which we are rightfully proud of, 
will be intact and stable for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Halifax West, aboriginal affairs; 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with some interest to the member for Saanich—Gulf 
Islands and his history lesson. As a student of history and 
someone who reads a fair amount of history, both ancient and 
modern, I would like to repeat a bit back to the member about 
Canadian unity and the ability of the provinces to sit down as 
equals and hopefully work toward a better country for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member was speaking I was thinking of an ad that his 
party supported during the previous election.  It said not 
another leader from Quebec.  They were all crossed out.  That is 
a very difficult thing to overcome and that is the type of thing 
the member has to wrap his head around and overcome if he and his 
party are to move ahead toward unity in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion on the floor today is not about bringing the 
provinces together.  It is a motion to set in place the next 
referendum in Quebec.  It is impossible for the people to meet by 
December 31.  It is an artificial date.  It will not happen. 
Everyone is off over Christmas.  It is totally fraudulent and 
ridiculous and cynical. If the date had been the end of January, 
the end of February or the end of March I think the member and 
the party would have received some support for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How cynical can we be.  There is no open discussion.  There is 
no equal footing among the provinces at this time.  They cannot 
meet a deadline when everyone is off during the Christmas 
holidays.  We will not achieve unanimity and it will fail and the 
new government that sits in Quebec today will say “Look at that. 
We can't even get agreement on a December 31 deadline therefore 
the door is open, let's look at a referendum”.  That is what 
will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments.  People are focused on this very narrow part, the date. 
If that is the only problem, as the member suggested, let us 
change it to January or February. Let us change it.  I am not 
stuck on the date. I am stuck on this country. 
We have to make changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not working. The people of Canada spoke on Charlottetown. 
They sent us a clear message.  We still have status quo.  It has 
not changed.  We need change.  We need winning conditions for 
Canada if my children are to have the country that I had to grow 
up in.  That is what this is all about. 
I read the motion that we set the framework up.  But if the date 
should be changed let us change it.  We are not stuck on the 
date.  Let us change it and make it happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this official opposition motion put forward 
by my colleague from Calgary Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to conclude an agreement 
with the provinces and territories, prior to December 31, 1998, 
and based on the unanimous resolution of the provinces as agreed 
to last August 7 at Saskatoon, to strengthen the partnership 
between the federal, provincial and territorial governments in 
order to secure Canada's social programs for the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion in the light of yesterday's 
election in Quebec. It is very important for this House to 
consider the issue of social union. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw yesterday was Quebecers saying they are not 
satisfied with status quo federalism nor are they satisfied with 
the radical option of separation.  What Quebeckers said by 
granting a parliamentary majority to the Parti québécois but an 
electoral plurality to the Parti libéral du Québec was that they 
do not support either the status quo or the radical option of 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they said in the public opinion polls and the exit polls 
was that they do not support the radical option of separation but 
they do want change.  In this desire they form common cause with 
most other Canadians, certainly with the representatives of the 
official opposition and the vast majority of those we represent 
in western Canada, with the various provincial governments which 
in August agreed on an entente to address the need for change in 
the federation, and apparently with all or most of the opposition 
parties in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers and the governments they represented gathered 
together in good faith several months ago to put forward some 
constructive concrete proposals for the rebalancing of powers 
between the two levels of government.  What did they receive in 
terms of a response from the federal government?  Little or 
nothing.  They received a duck and dodge which the provinces are 
all too familiar with from the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it come down to?  Let us be blunt.  The Liberal Party 
of Canada really believes its own propaganda, that it is the sole 
saviour of confederation, that it is the one and only political 
vehicle for federalism in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is a kind of political arrogance that is endemic in 
the psychology of the Liberal Party of Canada.  It is attached to 
the idea that Ottawa knows best, that top down big brother in 
Ottawa can unilaterally weave its way into areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction through its spending and taxing powers, 
that through this enormous intervention on the part of the 
central government the federation can somehow be kept together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story of our federation in the past three decades is one of 
growing and almost fatal tension between the centralizing, Ottawa 
knows best mentality of the members opposite who I believe hold 
the view sincerely.  There is the growing need of the provinces 
and regions to more ably represent their regional concerns in a 
more flexible federal context. This is the tension that really 
lies at the heart not only of the sovereignty debate in Quebec 
but so much of the feeling of alienation and discontent in the 
rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very disappointing for me to pick up the newspapers today 
and read various quotes of members of the Liberal government 
saying essentially that change in the federation is a 
non-starter, that we are going to just set our feet into concrete 
and that we are not going to allow the federation to evolve into 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in today's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> for instance I 
read a statement from the hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge 
River who said “I have not met an MP who is prepared to 
negotiate away an element of the federal government's role just 
so we can achieve temporary peace with the brawling provincial 
children.  It just is not on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of the attitude of members opposite.  Instead of 
a constructive, collaborative and co-operative approach, the kind 
of co-operative approach upon which a healthy federation must be 
founded, we find this kind of belligerent attitude regarding 
sovereign provincial governments. They are sovereign in their own 
jurisdiction, sovereign as defined in the original Constitution 
of this country in their own areas of competence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of regarding them as co-operative sovereign governments, 
the hon. member and many of his colleagues refer to those 
provinces as brawling children.  He says that we just cannot 
negotiate a single element of what this federal government does, 
the government that spends $160 billion with a cabinet of 35 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has one of the largest cabinets probably of any 
federation in the world, much larger than the federation to our 
south, or Germany or Australia.  It is a federal government that 
encroaches its way into virtually every area of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most galling thing about it is that while these Liberals 
refuse to accept the kind of co-operative change proposed by the 
provinces, at the very same time they undercut the very authority 
upon which the federal government's spending power is asserted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the Canada Health Act.  The only guarantee of the 
enforcement of federal standards in the Canada Health Act is the 
federal transfer, the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal medicare system was developed 30 years ago, of 
course it was predicated on a commitment of 50% funding.  That is 
the basis upon which the unilateral federal standards are imposed 
on the provinces. Yet today this government which prides itself 
on its commitment to unity and federal standards has reduced that 
funding share to 11%.  And it still expects the provinces to 
accept the standards as defined by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the provinces are asking for in the social union agreement 
of this August, what the official opposition and other parties 
are asking for is not unilateral imposition of federal standards 
but rather, co-operative national standards agreed to by all the 
provinces co-operatively, not by one of the governments, the 
central government, unilaterally. 
It is not a radical concept.  It is a concept embraced by 
virtually every mature and healthy democratic federation in the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A social union should consider collaborative approaches to the 
exercise of the federal spending power in provincial 
jurisdictions. This is very important for Quebec, as this is one 
of its traditional demands. Western Canada has asked for the 
same thing and, in this respect, it has a great deal in common 
with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government spends money in provincial areas of 
responsibility or arbitrarily withdraws funding from a 
provincial jurisdiction, this may cause friction in 
federal-provincial relations and problems in service delivery. 
We need a new agreement describing how powers are shared between 
the federal government and the provinces. I would ask that the 
members of this House support this Reform motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, much has been raised about the timing, the deadline 
in this motion, which was simply taken from the accord of the 
premiers in August.  We would like to respond to the legitimate 
arguments raised about the deadline by members of various

deal with both issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member in his remarks made a point of talking about the 
arrogance of the federal government simply ordering things around 
in the union in a top down fashion.  This government for quite 
some time now has been working very hard in co-operation with the 
provinces on a whole range of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Minister of 
Justice in the social union discussions have been working very 
diligently with all of the provinces to bring about a consensus 
on needed changes to the social union framework. That is what is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal government to order—actually not the federal 
government in this case but the House—by passage of this motion, 
whether it is December 31 or before the first budget, is setting 
a setting a condition around these negotiations that we have no 
authority to set.  The provinces are partners in this so how can 
we presume to tell them when they are going to conclude this 
agreement?  I would also suggest it introduces an item into the 
negotiation that mitigates against the kind of consensus we are 
all trying to achieve.  These are extremely important services 
that affect all Canadians in all parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right when he makes the case that they 
should be conducted in an atmosphere of co-operation and 
consultation.  We should work toward a consensus, all partners to 
the agreement, all the provinces, the territories and the federal 
government.  That is the final part of the comment.  The federal 
government is not a passive bystander in this.  It has a role to 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the member is, in supporting so 
fervently the consensus arrived at by the provinces, is he saying 
that this position is the position of the Reform Party?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the precise position of 
the Reform Party with respect to the social union reform of the 
federation has been laid out in some considerable detail in our 
proposed new Canada act, a copy of which the hon. member opposite 
can find at our web site at www.reform.ca, or by writing to my 
office postage free.  I would be happy to send him a copy of the 
new Canada act.  It endorses in large part the recommendations of 
the premiers on the social union but goes further in other areas. 
It is not identical, but we do believe that social union is a 
major addition to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said he was going to address both issues, one of 
which was timing.  All day we have heard from the Liberal members 
that the December 31 deadline in our motion was unrealistic.  We 
have listened to the concerns of various members opposite.  We 
want to be co-operative in this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, we supported a motion from the Conservative Party 
to extend the deadline. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just now I sought unanimous consent for a motion to extend the 
deadline to later in the year 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member opposite has a better idea about a 
deadline, but some kind of deadline is necessary if we are going 
to stop the vacillation of the federal government.  That is all 
we are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not come arbitrarily from the official opposition.  It 
comes from the premiers themselves.  Paragraph 6 of the framework 
on the social union says the “premiers stressed that 
negotiations should now proceed with a view to concluding a draft 
agreement by the end of the year”.  That is where the idea came 
from, not from ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would once again invite the Liberal members opposite to 
reconsider our support for an earlier motion on the part of the 
Conservative member to extend the proposed deadline.  We are not 
stuck.  We do not want to split hairs here.  We do not want this 
very constructive motion to be not supported because of arbitrary 
deadlines.  We are prepared to be flexible. But at the end of the 
day, as the premiers indicated, we do need a deadline to ensure 
the government does not endlessly vacillate, prevaricate and 
obfuscate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is a very important subject which is very important 
to the government and very important to Canadians.  The motion 
however is an unfortunate mix of good intentions and a blatant 
attempt to score cheap political points. As such it is 
insupportable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us asks the House to urge the government to 
conclude an agreement on the social union with the provinces 
prior to December 31.  When the Prime Minister and the other 
first ministers initiated these negotiations last December, they 
intentionally avoided setting artificial deadlines.  This 
initiative is too important for Canadians.  It must be done 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night both Premier Romanow and Premier Tobin rejected 
establishing artificial deadlines.  It is unfortunate the focus 
of this motion is an attempt to capitalize on what is an 
important issue, one that this government takes seriously and one 
that is important to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the important elements of our social union and 
what this government is trying to achieve in these negotiations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal, provincial and territorial governments are 
trying to do is to arrive at a framework agreement on the social 
union. The idea is to strengthen the social partnership between 
the provinces, on the one hand, and the governments and 
citizens, on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada feels that the new partnership should 
have three objectives: to provide equal opportunities to all 
Canadians, wherever they live or travel in the country; to 
increase co-operation between the governments so as to better 
serve Canadians; and to make governments more accountable to 
Canadians for the results they achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide equal opportunities also means to respect the great 
diversity that is an integral part of Canada. 
We must therefore be flexible enough to meet the diverse needs 
of Canadians. That diversity is the result of cultural, 
linguistic and geographical factors, or of other specific 
circumstances or features.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that governments must work together with the 
aboriginal peoples of this country to meet their particular 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the premiers pointed out in the Calgary declaration, it also 
means recognizing that the equality of the provinces is 
compatible with recognition of Quebec's particular needs, in the 
form of its French-speaking majority, its distinct culture and 
its tradition of civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, equality of opportunity means ensuring that Canadians 
are free to travel anywhere in their country, without facing 
obstacles related to place of residence and without concerns 
about access to social benefits. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our social union is about our solidarity with one another.  It 
is about our understanding that we are stronger together, that 
when Canadians in one part of Canada are in need, Canadians from 
all parts of Canada are prepared to help.  This in turn means 
greater collaboration among governments in Canada, learning to 
manage their interdependence to ensure the most effective and 
efficient service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this era of globalization, with an increasingly competitive 
world economy, it is no longer possible, if it ever was, to 
segregate public policy into neat, air-tight compartments of 
social policy and economic policy, federal and 
provincial-territorial responsibilities, or even domestic and 
international considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want their governments to work together to modernize 
our social programs, to face the challenges ahead, to help 
individuals and regions adapt to the new knowledge-based global 
economy and to ensure that social programs work and are 
affordable and sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we translate all of this into action?  Practically 
speaking, it means that all governments should make commitments 
to information sharing, to joint planning and to joint action 
where this would provide more cost effective service to Canadians 
and to advance notice and consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already working together with the provinces and 
territories in this new collaborative partnership approach.  A 
good example of this is the new national child benefit which the 
Government of Canada developed with the provincial and 
territorial ministers.  It focuses on the goal of helping 
Canada's children.  This collaborative approach promises to bear 
fruit in other areas, including developing a national children's 
agenda, programs for persons with disabilities and youth 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Health have also made it 
clear that renewing medicare and modernizing Canada's health care 
system will require co-operation among all governments in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future social union framework agreement will give effect to 
the new partnership between governments in the social policy 
sector by requiring a more co-operative approach to federal 
spending authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the world's large federations, the national government 
has this authority.  It is because of this authority that the 
Government of Canada, in co-operation with the provinces and 
territories, can ensure that all Canadians have access to more 
or less comparable benefits and services.  This was how the 
government promoted equality of opportunity for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that, without this spending authority, we would not 
have Canada-wide social programs, such as medicare. 
In fact, we would not have the national social safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the federal spending power is an essential component of 
the Canadian social union, one that is recognized in the 
Constitution, we must exercise it prudently, taking into account 
and respecting the important responsibilities assumed by the 
provinces in the area of social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the Government of Canada promised in its 1996 
Throne Speech not to implement any new cost-shared programs 
without the consent of the majority of provinces.  Provinces 
opting out of these programs would be entitled to financial 
compensation, provided they offered a comparable or equivalent 
program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the legislation creating the Canadian Health and 
Social Transfer, the CHST, which is the main federal instrument 
of support to the provinces in the area of social policy since 
1995 calls for the drawing up of new principles or objectives, 
by mutual agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has also made an effort to make the 
funding of social transfers more predictable, by having 
multi-year financial commitments, by establishing a minimum 
guaranteed floor for the cash component of the CHST, and by 
holding consultations prior to renewing or modifying any 
taxation agreements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social policy principles and commitments to collaboration among 
governments must be put into practice and made effective.  A 
social union framework must include appropriate mechanisms and 
means to ensure this through public accountability and 
transparency.  This means public reporting by all governments, 
linking expenditures to results for Canadians.  It means 
developing comparable measures and, where appropriate, making use 
of experts and non-governmental organizations for independent 
evaluation and social audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also means recognizing publicly the roles and contributions 
of each government, so the public knows who should be held 
accountable for what.  And it means engaging Canadians, providing 
opportunities for their input into policies and programs and the 
assessment of their effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from the old style government-to-government 
accountability and traditional bean counting.  The key must be 
accountability to Canadians for results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how a social union framework can be made real and 
meaningful to citizens and taxpayers and it should not restricted 
by the timeframes suggested by this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Simcoe North said at the outset that the 
premiers oppose an arbitrary deadline.  If that is the case, how 
would he characterize the statement in their accord of August 6 
of this year which states “The premiers stressed that 
negotiations should now proceed with a view to concluding a draft 
agreement by the end of the year”?  Was that an arbitrary 
deadline?  Was it not?  If so, what is the difference between 
that statement and the deadline proposed in this motion?  That is 
my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is, if he does not want arbitrary deadlines 
and if he does not like the one in this motion, why did he and 
his colleagues oppose two efforts to amend our motion to extend 
the deadline?  Does he have a better idea?  Does he have another 
deadline in mind, or no deadline at all?  Did he just want this 
to go on indefinitely as it has for 30 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as far as a deadline is 
concerned, whether it is the end of the year, budget time or next 
June, that is not the proper way to negotiate an issue that is as 
relevant and as important to all Canadians as this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member's first question dealing with the 
position of the premiers, it is clearly the case that when this 
engagement was undertaken, the negotiations on the social union, 
there was never an intention of imposing a deadline at that 
point.  The negotiations need to be permitted to continue without 
this kind of external imposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I noted that the hon. member opposite 
talked about accountability and the need for the federal 
government to manage programs because it is more accountable and 
more visible to the Canadian public.  He left the impression that 
he does not feel the provinces are capable of managing these 
programs in an efficient and accountable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that the QPP is more financially sound than the 
CPP?  The Quebec pension plan is more financially sound than the 
Canadian pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are very capable of administering programs, in 
some cases far better than the federal government is capable of 
monitoring them, and they are accountable to the auditor general 
as well as to the people of Quebec.

she is imputing to me, that the provinces are not capable of 
remaining accountable or demonstrating their accountability in 
the areas of their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments dealt with the entire governmental process and all 
levels of government.  I said that what we need to accomplish in 
the process of negotiating this social union is accountability at 
all levels.  That is the most important factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member to consult <I>Hansard</I>, but there was 
certainly nothing in my speech that would suggest or imply that 
the provinces are not capable of being as accountable as the 
federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
mixed feelings that I contribute to this debate because I look 
forward to opportunities to discuss the social union in this 
Chamber and to debate the social framework, the agreements that 
are going to guide the federal and provincial governments in the 
delivery of improved services.  I think this is a very important 
topic.  I do not want to reflect too much on the motives of the 
official opposition in bringing forward this motion, but I have 
to wonder why we are into this kind of debate the day after the 
Quebec election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of language on the other side of the House that 
talks about an open debate and the desire to improve programs in 
Canada.  I also hear, quoted by the previous speaker for the 
Reform Party and in his question to my colleague, this sense of a 
desire to facilitate this process based on a statement by the 
premiers in August of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with the House some statements which were made by 
the premiers yesterday and today, not five or six months ago. The 
chairman of the process, the premier of Saskatchewan, stated: 
“The first order of business is the social union, negotiating it 
as quickly as we can, not under any artificial deadlines or 
timetables, doing it with dispatch, doing it with determination. 
The Prime Minister wants to do it, his ministers want to do it 
and the premiers want to do it”.  That is a statement made 
yesterday by the chairman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a Liberal premier of Atlantic Canada, Brian Tobin of 
Newfoundland.  He stated:  “On the question of social union and 
the negotiation that is ongoing, I think that is something that 
we will get back to in the new year.  I think we are making good 
progress with the national government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a Conservative premier, the premier of Ontario, who 
today at one o'clock said:  “We obviously would like to see some 
progress after the budget—I mean on the social union 
discussion”.  He is not demanding a December 31 deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what did the Reform Party undertake to draft this 
motion upon which we are going to be called upon to vote in 15 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to conclude an agreement with 
the provinces and territories, prior to December 31, 1998, and— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two problems with this.  The first problem is the 
deadline; not the specific deadline but a deadline.  Let the 
process go on.  Let the provinces in good faith come to the table 
to discuss this along with the federal government.  These are 
people who want to solve problems on behalf of the people we all 
serve.  Let us not presume from the federal House of Commons to 
set any deadline for them.  They are responsible people. 
I heard the member talking about the ability of the provinces to 
manage these programs.  That is a position I endorse.  Certainly 
they can and certainly they are competent to make the decisions 
about how and when these negotiations should proceed.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part, the second reason why I cannot support this 
resolution is that it is based on the unanimous resolution of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the federal House of Commons.  What I find disturbing 
about Reform's position on this is that it seems to act as though 
there is no federal role, as if there is no reason for the 
federal government to concern itself with these programs.  I do 
not share that view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they need to change?  Absolutely they need to change.  Change 
is something we are always going to have to face and it is hoped 
that we create a framework, a relationship with the provinces 
that allows change to be ongoing.  Circumstances have changed. 
Economic circumstances have changed.  People's mobility has 
changed.  People's opportunities have changed and the programs 
that the federal government and the provincial government operate 
jointly should change in order to reflect those changes in the 
community.  That is a given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who comes out of the social policy, the social 
program area, as director of child welfare in Manitoba for a 
period of time, not only do I believe that the provinces have the 
capacity and the ability to deliver these programs, I think they 
are better able to deliver these programs.  I think that case 
oriented decisions about social services should be made by those 
people who are working closest to the people who are receiving 
them.  I absolutely endorse that.  I do not have any difficulty 
with those positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also believe, as the people who created this 
federation believed, and as we have acted in accordance with 
throughout the life of this country, that there is a reason for 
our being a federation and that there are certain rights and 
abilities we all exercise because we are a federation. I also 
want those things considered and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know that when a disabled person moves from one 
province to the other they will receive services.  I want to know 
that when a person goes into another province they will have the 
ability to work.  I think there are pan-Canadian issues here. 
There also is a very real ability for the provinces and the 
federal government, working collectively, to learn a lot about a 
better way to deliver services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little saddened, frankly, by the discussions I hear 
coming out of the Bloc, because when I meet with members of the 
Bloc and I meet with people within the province of Quebec who are 
working in social services, and I do this rather regularly, what 
I see is a very creative approach to a great many of the services 
I have worked with.  I think they have really captured some very 
important concepts and have developed some very important 
policies in how one activates communities and involves 
communities in the way of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think in many ways some of the activities that have taken 
place in social services in the province of Quebec have proved to 
be a model for the rest of Canada.  I think they are an important 
contributor to the development of policies and services across 
Canada.  So I am saddened when I hear this debate sort of draw 
back into a discussion of powers and rights because I think when 
we focus our attentions and energies on powers and rights, we are 
talking about things that are mainly of interest to a few 
politicians and we marginalize the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what Canadians want to hear us talking about is services 
and opportunities, ways we can be supportive of the kinds of 
goals they have, whether they live in Chicoutimi or Winnipeg or 
Prince Albert.  They want to know their children will have a good 
education. They want to know they will have work.  They want to 
know their health care will be of the highest quality possible. 
If we focus on solving those problems, if we focus on building a 
relationship with the provinces that allows us to collectively 
focus all our talents and energies on solutions to those 
problems, we will have done a great service to this country.  But 
if we simply fall back on to endless arguments about powers and 
rights, I think we all lose.  I think the people of Canada lose. 
I think the people in this Chamber and in all the chambers across 
the country lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased with what I heard coming from the New 
Democrats and the Conservatives. 
What I heard the speaker for the New Democrats talk about was a 
commitment to services.  He wanted to talk about services, as I 
heard from the Conservatives.  I just wish we could find a way in 
this House to put aside on these important services some of this 
battling that seems to serve no one other than perhaps a few of 
our friends in the media.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member at the outset of his remarks questioned the 
motivation of the official opposition putting this motion before 
the House at this time suggesting that for some reason it was 
peculiar to put it forth the day after the Quebec election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that each opposition party is 
allocated a limited number of supply days to debate motions of 
this nature.  We have been planning for some time to hold a 
motion on the balancing of powers, reform of the federation, the 
social union and our new Canada act.  We did not schedule this 
day.  It appeared this way on the parliamentary calendar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is quite propitious that we have an opportunity to 
debate this in light of the democratic decision of the people of 
Quebec yesterday.  Had we done this before an election of course 
the hon. member would have said it was interfering in the Quebec 
election and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This timing is a complete red herring.  There have been two 
motions now to extend what is not a deadline in the motion before 
the House.  It is a target date.  It simply urges to the 
government to conclude an agreement with the provinces and 
territories prior to December 31.  It is a very similar wording 
they use in their own declarations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member does not agree with that deadline or that 
suggested date of conclusion, perhaps he has another one he could 
suggest.  The Prime Minister told us he has always in his 
political career supported Senate reform as an objective.  He has 
been here for 35 years.  Is that how expeditiously this 
government operates with respect to its constitutional agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member why he does not allow some flexibility 
with respect to the timing in this motion.  Why is it he who is 
denying unanimous consent to extend the proposed time line in 
this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely 
correct when he says he did not choose the day but his party 
chose the topic. There are a great many things the House can be 
talking about at any point in time.  They chose today to put on 
the agenda the social union discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the deadline, the motion says that this House urge the 
government to conclude an agreement with the provinces and 
territories prior to December 31. 
If that is not a deadline I do not know what we call a deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we say prior to December 31 or prior to the next budget, 
what we are doing is setting up an icon which is a pressure on 
those discussions that perhaps is not in the best interest.  If 
the hon. member truly believes that the provinces and the federal 
government should and can get together and work co-operatively as 
they say, if we look at the statements of the premiers, none of 
the premiers is calling for this deadline or any deadline and 
they are all saying this thing is moving, they are happy with the 
way it is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote one more time from the chairman: “The first order 
of business is the social union, negotiating it as quickly as we 
can, not under any artificial deadlines or timetables, doing it 
with dispatch, doing it with determination”.  This is a quote 
from Premier Romanow: “The Prime Minister wants to do it, his 
ministers want to do it, the premiers want to do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not an endorsement of the process, I do not know what 
is.  I am not certain what is served by the Reform Party's trying 
to insert itself into this debate.  Frankly I am a little 
surprised that the Reform Party is so willing to sign a blank 
cheque.  I understood Reformers ran for this Chamber because they 
had an interest in the federal government. I am deeply concerned 
about their willingness to run in and sign on sight unseen to a 
provincial position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address today the matter of the social union, which will be 
increasingly prominent in political affairs for various reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first try to define to some extent what underlies the 
notion of social union.  The premiers of all the provinces, for 
some time now, have been working to force the federal government 
to reinvest where it cut money, that is, in social programs 
including health and education, where it substantially and 
unilaterally cut its transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces began discussions to make sure that this sort of 
thing did not recur in the future and that their ability to 
manage social programs would be protected to some extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers got an agreement permitting them to manage their 
programs themselves and allowing them to opt out of federal 
programs, and I will provide a specific example of this in the 
last minute allocated to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this agreement as well, the provinces clearly indicated their 
intention to reinvest the money in the coming years in health 
care.  They also mentioned that they had already begun to do so 
and that the only government that had not done so was the 
federal government, for the current fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces want more money invested in health. 
As everyone knows, the health system everywhere in Canada needs 
reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they have had to cope with difficulties in recent years, 
however, they are best placed to know where the money ought to 
be reinjected, how to make adjustments to situations requiring 
very precise interventions.  In the health field, the 
administrative infrastructures are a provincial jurisdiction. 
The provincial governments do not want to see the federal 
government turning up with all manner of programs just to score 
political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example, this time in post-secondary education. 
The federal government reduced its contribution considerably. 
Then suddenly, feeling in need of a higher profile, the Prime 
Minister launched the millennium scholarship program.  Through 
it, the federal government will be handing out numerous 
bursaries in the next decade to numerous students. 
It will certainly do this itself, through a foundation to which 
it will be sure to appoint its friends, people who will carry 
out the wishes of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is intended to ensure that the students see that the 
money comes from their good friend, the federal government.  We 
in Quebec already have a financial assistance system in place, 
with eligibility criteria which take into consideration the 
student's situation, that of the parents, and so on.  Now, the 
federal government can turn up with other criteria, with another 
infrastructure, adding excellence to the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it has made hundreds of millions of dollars in 
cuts to education.  Would the priority in education not have 
been to reinvest so that all students could benefit?  At the 
present time, there is a crying need at the university level. 
We saw this in the last election campaign.  A number of rectors 
and representatives of the education sector called for money to 
be invested in the university system, but not necessarily as a 
priority in the loans and bursaries system.  If there were needs 
to be adjusted, we could have taken part of the $2.5 billion 
reinjected into the loans and bursaries system, but we could 
have taken and managed the rest according to our own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a striking example of federal-provincial relations in 
which each government tries to define its priorities in what 
should be provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fine example of a situation that will create a dispute 
between governments, rather than real co-operation, initiated by 
a federal government in need of visibility.  It does not meet 
the real on-site priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But why reach an agreement before December 31?  Because we want 
to avoid having the same thing happen in the next federal 
budget.  Let the federal government announce now its intention 
to honour the spirit of the agreement, to comply with it, to 
reinject funds into health and to respect provincial 
jurisdictions.  The federal government must show its respect for 
provincial jurisdictions by allowing them to manage their own 
programs, if it contributes to them, with the right to opt out 
when the provinces have similar programs or the same objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems laudable and very reasonable to me.  However, the 
federal government is not co-operating.  We hope it will wake up 
in time.  We support the motion that was put forward today by 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government to move in the coming weeks, and quickly, 
to improve the situation for everyone. 
In Quebec, everyone, federalists and sovereignists alike, of 
whatever political affiliation, agree that we have to move 
forward based on what appears to be a political consensus of all 
parties in Quebec to move in this direction, as was seen during 
the last election campaign.

sadness that members of the community feel as their pleas for 
immediate crisis assistance continue to be ignored by the 
government.

that after decades of neglect their tragic story and the grave 
injustices inflicted upon their people would be addressed.  The 
Dene of Deline listened as the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development stood in the House on March 30 and stated 
“the government takes this issue very seriously”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are deeply concerned about potential impacts associated with 
the historic uranium mining operations in the NWT.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The country listened as the minister further stated her 
government's position:

</I></B></P><P align=left>—which is making sure that today, and on a go-forward basis, we 
are protecting the communities and the people. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential impacts have occurred.  A people are devastated by 
radiation deaths in Deline and along the route the ore carriers 
travelled from the north to Fort McMurray.  The impacts are the 
loss of an entire generation of elders who pass on the 
traditional knowledge and honourable ways to the next 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impacts are the result of a federal government's inexcusable 
disregard and contempt for not warning the Dene in the early 
1930s when the effects of these, to use the government's words, 
deadly and insidious substances were first identified.  With a 
warning the people could have protected their families and their 
children.  The families travelled with the ore carriers exposing 
an entire generation to the uranium radiation dangers carried on 
their backs in burlap sacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the United Nations conference on human rights this past 
weekend in Edmonton this tragic story was told before 
representatives from countries around the globe.  Six months has 
passed since the minister issued grand statements of caring and 
action.  Since her empty statements Dene representatives appeared 
before the House Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development.  Elder Baton after 30 years told the 
Deline story.  Members were shocked.  Some moved to tears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dene representatives met with the minister and her colleagues in 
June and left with hope.  They still wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community delegation travelled to Hiroshima in August to 
express their sorrow and to apologize that they did not know they 
were assisting in war and would contribute to the nuclear bombs 
that killed thousands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise today the travesty that continues through the 
government's inaction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This community of honour does not deserve the dishonourable 
treatment meted out by this government before Canadians and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask today for the honourable answer.  Where is the immediate 
crisis assistance?  Where is the funding for the community's 14 
point plan?  Or will this government admit today that these past 
six months have been empty promises and false hopes?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development to respond to the hon. member for 
Halifax West on past mining activities in Deline, Northwest 
Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is very concerned with potential 
impacts of historical uranium mining and other activities at the 
Port Radium uranium mine located at Great Bear Lake, Northwest 
Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the Minister of Health and the Minister of Natural 
Resources and the Secretary of State for Children and Youth, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development met with 
representatives of the community of Deline on June 10, 1998 in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of this meeting was a commitment by the ministers to 
work in a partnership with the community to try to address three 
subject matters. First, the immediate and long term health 
concerns of the community including assessments on health and the 
environment. Second, to establish a co-operative approach and a 
joint committee that includes administrative and financial 
assistance for the participation of the Deline community.  Third, 
to establish a common understanding of the history and the 
impacts of the Port Radium mine and related activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development wrote to 
confirm that all parties will work co-operatively and will 
provide the community with discussion papers to assist in 
implementing those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 26 and September 15, 1998 departmental officials met 
with Deline Chief Raymond Taniton in Yellowknife and Ottawa 
respectively to open up a dialogue with the community and to 
investigate how to move ahead on this very critical and important 
issue.  This work continued through meetings and correspondence 
in October and November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently reaffirmed our commitment to provide 
contributions to the community to assist its participation in 
these important investigations and to conduct biological sampling 
programs in the—

interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary as the time has 
expired.

adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
