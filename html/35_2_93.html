	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the city of Estevan, Saskatchewan has recently completed 
its 20th anniversary of the United Way radio and television 36-hour 
fundraising marathon. Between October 18 and 19, Estevan helped 
to raise $144,000 for the United Way, exceeding its goal by 
$14,000.
<P>
	After 20 years Estevan, a city with a population of 11,000, has 
contributed $1,750,000 and has collected nearly 100 per cent of its 
pledges through the years. The United Way in Estevan has been the 
first in Canada to reach its goal 19 out of 20 times since the drive 
was first established. No other community in Canada or for that 
matter in North America can beat this record of raising money for 
the needed agencies of the United Way.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the generous 
and hard working people of Estevan and area who donate so much 
of their time and money to the United Way.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberals have goofed again with their strategy to denigrate the 
Government of Quebec by spreading falsehoods, which have 
reduced the little credibility they had in the eyes of the people of 
Quebec to zero.
<P>
	On October 22, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
heritage stated, in connection with the program providing 
computers to schools, and I quote: ``Quebec schoolchildren will not 
be able to take advantage of the program, as the PQ government has 
refused to take part in it.'' He went on to say that the duly elected 
Government of Quebec was ``depriving young Quebecers of a 
privileged access to computer resources''.
<P>
	According to Department of Industry figures, as at April 1996, 
the Government of Quebec has received over 5,300 school 
computers under the program. Once again, the heritage minister, 
through her parliamentary secretary, is proving that the federal 
Government's campaign to denigrate the Government of Quebec is 
totally unfounded.
<P>
	Rather than carrying out a disinformation campaign, the minister 
should discuss things with her Liberal colleague, the Minister of 
Industry, in order to get an update on this.

<P>
	Prostate cancer causes a great deal of stress and suffering, yet 
there is relatively little public awareness of the serious nature of the 
disease. In B.C., for example, while the breast cancer rate is 30 per

government had no plan for a yes vote and, for that matter, no plan 
for a no vote.
<P>
	What has happened since? Canadians overwhelmingly want to 
preserve this as a country of equals in a federal system. Yet the

the same kind of special status sentiment as Quebec separatists do. 
Little if any progress has been made on the reform of federal 
institutions or decentralization to the provinces or respect for their 
jurisdictions.

	The federal government's plan B is also more words than action. 
It has referred the question of unilateral independence to the

the devastation of Liberal employment policies continue. The

<P>
	This not for profit organization, in its first year of operation,

<P>
	However, this organization has a problem. It has applied to 
Revenue Canada for a charitable registration number so that it can

because its work does not qualify as charitable work.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one year ago to the day, Quebecers voted on their future. 
We remember the result, a very slim win for the federalists, a win 
that changed nothing. We also remember the Prime Minister's 
promises in Verdun, just days before the referendum, meaningless 
promises that were never acted on. Since then, there has been an 
impasse, both in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, as the years go by and 
Quebec calls repeatedly for more power, so that it can be master of 
its own destiny, the offers made by the federal government and 
other provinces are shrinking almost to the point of insignificance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to hear the hon. member mention that 
Quebec voted to stay in Canada exactly one year ago today. It was 
the second time it has done so in 15 years, despite the very 
confusing question.
<P>
	Yesterday, for the first time, the Leader of the Opposition 
actually used the word ``separatist'', something he had previously 
avoided. After two attempts, I hope that the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will one day respect democracy.
<P>
	Democracy means recognizing, after two votes, that the people 
have spoken. As for what we said a few days before the 
referendum, we said that we were going to recognize that Quebec 
was a distinct society and that is what we did in this House in 
December. I would like everyone, particularly Quebecers, to know 
that all the members of the Bloc Quebecois voted in the House 
against recognizing Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
	When we passed legislation giving the regions a veto, members 
of the Bloc Quebecois voted against a veto for Quebec, and they are 
completely ignoring the whole series of changes we proposed in 
February, in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has convinced himself that  what he 
said happened is true. But Quebecers will remember that the Prime 
Minister launched his return to politics in February 1990 at the 
University of Ottawa with an attack on the concept of distinct 
society as defined at Meech Lake, before the Charest report. I know 
that we may not use a member's name, so I will say the report by 
the member for Sherbrooke. Quebecers also remember the 
infamous ``Thank you, Clyde'' and what happened in Calgary.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not admit, like his intellectual 
leader, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, that all he has to offer Quebec is the 
status quo, which is based on his 1982 Constitution thrown together 
that night at the Chateau Laurier and rejected by all Quebecers, 
federalists and sovereignists alike? From Lucien Bouchard to 
Daniel Johnson, nobody wants anything to do with that piece of 
work.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is fascinating is that the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Parti Quebecois opposed Meech Lake. They voted it down in the 
National Assembly. The leader of the party was an MNA at the 
time and he voted against it. It is a sin for me, but not for them?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	What they are ignoring is that in February we made concrete 
offers to transfer responsibility for manpower. We put forward 
proposals in May. Discussions are still going on.
<P>
	We have offered to withdraw from mining, forestry, tourism and 
public housing. We decided that spending authority would be 
conditional on participation by a majority of provinces. These are 
serious offers, that have never before been spelled out in such 
detail. Inevitably, when we make serious offers to Quebec, when 
we truly want to help, they are for the status quo. They do not want 
to see a single thing changed, because they dream of separation and 
they have struck out twice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has said that the Parti Quebecois was 
against recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, and that he was as 
well, because he has finally come out and told us. We heard him 
say that he too was against recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Now the cat is out of the bag.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> So he has finally come out and said it. It took him 
long enough. We said in Quebec City that we were against it. He 
has just admitted it today. He is starting to see things as they really 
are.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister realize that his understanding of Quebec 
and of Canada bears no relation to reality? Will he one day 
understand that the reality is that there is a Canadian people and a 
Quebec people, whose homeland is Quebec, and that any link 
between Quebec and Canada supposes the recognition of two 
founding  peoples and their respective inalienable rights to decide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5882"> 5882 </A></B>

their own future? Quebec has no need to ask permission of the 
Supreme Court, or of Winnipeg or of St. John's, Newfoundland.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have been hearing the same thing for 30 years. Except 
that when we are in Quebec, Quebecers tell us they want us to work 
on improving the economy of Quebec and of Canada in order to 
create jobs for Quebecers.
<P>
	Today, while these people are talking about independence, 
separation, and the Constitution, Quebec is foundering. We in the 
government have put Canada's financial house in order. That is 
why, for example, Quebecers are enjoying interest rates that are 
3.25 per cent lower than in the United States. That is what Canada 
is doing to help Quebecers.
<P>
	But the Bloc Quebecois is still harping on the Constitution. 
While we are working to create jobs for Quebecers, they are 
making jobs disappear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will 
the Prime Minister realize some day that Canada cannot be 
changed, because there are two visions of this country, one that is 
shared by a majority of Canadians who, rightly so, want to have a 
country that meets their needs, and the other that is shared by a 
minority, namely Quebecers, who also want a country that meets 
their needs?
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister realize that nothing will change as long 
as he refuses to recognize this reality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minority vision is the vision of separation, which 
is rejected by the vast majority of Quebecers when the question is 
put to them clearly. The vast majority of Quebecers want to keep on 
being Canadian. They want to celebrate their Quebec and Canadian 
identities as a strength, as a formidable complementarity that they 
will never give up if the question is put to them in a clear and 
honest manner.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister can make all the nice speeches he wants, here or 
elsewhere.
<P>
	But will the Prime Minister admit, one year later, that the 
promises he made just before the referendum, which were light 
years away from what Quebecers want in any case, have not even 
been fulfilled? Is this not the best proof that he has nothing left to

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister said that he wanted to debate the 
issues in the House. Let us debate the issues in the House.
<P>
	The reality is that 1.5 million Canadians are still unemployed, 
consumer confidence has plummeted even though we have such 
low interest rates, and Canadian families have suffered a $3,000 
pay cut since 1993. Those are the facts. He knows them, I know 
them. Canadians are worse off now than when the Liberals took 
power in 1993.
<P>
	Since these three years of Liberal economic mismanagement 
have failed to make a dent in unemployment, consumer confidence 
or the tax burden, why will the Prime Minister not do this: balance 
the budget, cut taxes and create real jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the facts of the matter are, since we have taken office, over 700,000 
new jobs have been created by the private sector. Since we have 
taken office, the unemployment rate has dropped by a point and a 
half. Since we have taken office, Canada's current account surplus 
has been the highest that it has been since 1984. We have become 
one of the major exporting nations of the world. We have turned the 
economy around and it is felt from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, only by 
tax relief are we going to see true job creation and people feeling 
better about themselves.
<P>
	The reality Canadians are facing is this. People are working too 
hard to pay taxes that are too high. Paycheques are shrinking, job 
security is disappearing and family time is taking a back seat to 
overtime and tax time.
<P>
	Reform will give Canadians $15 billion in tax relief, $2,000 for 
the average Canadian family by the year 2000, because leaving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5883"> 5883 </A></B>
<P>
more money in the taxpayer's pocket as  the minister knows is 
more valuable than leaving it in the hands of a politician.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not give Canadians tax relief and 
create real, long term, sustainable jobs for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what the Reform Party is offering to do is to cut the Canadian 
health and social transfer by $3.5 billion. What the Reform Party is 
offering to do is to cut equalization payments for the seven 
provinces which require them without having the courage and the 
guts to stand up in the House and tell us what provinces they are 
going to do it to.
<P>
	Will the Reform Party members from Saskatchewan stand up 
here and say that people in Saskatchewan are not entitled to the 
same level of public services as other Canadians? No, they will not 
do it. They are going to hide.
<P>
	What the Reform Party has offered us is a massive attack on the 
middle class. What Reformers are offering to do is to pit region 
against region, Canadian against Canadian. They would destroy the 
Canadian dream. That is what they are offering us.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
hate to take us down the same road that we went yesterday. I will 
not say what I said, but the minister must have some pretty serious 
concerns about that.
<P>
	He says that we will cut health care. Maybe now it is becoming 
clear to me why this minister is the finance minister and why there 
are some serious problems. We are talking about putting $4 billion 
back into health care. He has cut $3 billion. That may be why we 
are having such serious problems within the finance department.
<P>
	The Prime Minister last weekend told delegates that once the 
budget was balanced his government would return to its free 
spending Liberal ways. The Prime Minister could lower taxes if he 
was willing to kick his spending habit. That is the problem.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister think that $15 billion in the hands 
of government bureaucrats or politicians will do more good than 
those $15 billion in the hands of Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us be very clear. What the Reform Party members are saying is that 
they will take $3.5 billion out of the Canadian health and social 
transfer and then they ask Canadians to trust them to put it back 
four years later. Four years, after how many hospitals would have 
been closed? Four years, after how many low income Canadians 
would have suffered? That is what the Reform Party has offered.
<P>
	If we want to know what they really think, we could take a look 
at their first budget. Their first budget was a  massive attack on 
health care. Their first budget said that we should have two-tier 
health care. Their first budget said that the principles of the Canada 
Health Act did not apply. Their first budget really gave what they 
really believe and that is an idealism that is not Canadian.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are not fooled by the Liberals' spin on their pathetic 
record.
<P>
	Canadian families have suffered a $3,000 national pay cut per 
year, and since the Liberals came to office 1.5 million real people 
are still looking for jobs. The Conference Board of Canada is 
saying that the government's low interest rate policy has failed to 
inspire consumer confidence. According to Statistics Canada, this 
``reflects the ongoing dead weight of weak income and labour 
markets''.
<P>
	When will the finance minister admit that because his policies 
are not working Canadians are not working?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is not quoting the conference board correctly. 
What the conference board has said is that there is a lag time 
between interest rate cuts and job creation. It pointed to the 
tremendous interest rate cuts as having been one of the main 
reasons that there has been stronger job creation in Canada than in 
any other G-7 country outside of the United States.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	What the hon. member ought to do is to look at the fundamental 
measures the government has taken in terms of job creation; our 
external trade and the fact that we have become one of the major 
exporting nations of the world; the Team Canada missions led by 
the Prime Minister which have led to contract after contract; the 
summer jobs from the Minister of Human Resources Development; 
the amount of money we have put into research and development; 
the amount of money we have put into trade financing; the support 
of small and medium size businesses. All of this is leading to a 
very, very healthy economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to 
the finance minister, tell that to 1.5 million unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Canada Trust's chief economist has said: ``Unless we have a real 
strong sense of job security, interest rates just are not going to 
entice people into spending''.
<P>
	The finance minister's job creation strategy is in the tank. When 
will he admit that what Canadians really need is smaller 
government and more job creating, confidence creating tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think one really ought to give the lie to the bogus myth that the 
Reform Party is putting forward.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Give the lie to is not saying it 
is a lie. Try a little bit of English instruction.
<P>
	What the Reform Party members are suggesting in their tax cuts 
is to simply shift the tax burden on to the provinces. They would 
cut federal taxes on the one hand and then they would cut 
equalization. When they cut equalization in Saskatchewan, do they 
not think that the Government of Saskatchewan is going to have to 
look at its own revenues? When they cut the Canada health and 
social transfer and they cut the revenues of the provinces by $3.5 
billion, do they not think the provinces are going to have to look to 
their revenues? When they cut federal taxes, they are as well 
cutting the revenues that go to the provinces. Do they not think the 
provinces will have to increase taxes?

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of National Defence. The fact that 
francophones are consistently under-represented within the armed 
forces is common knowledge. We have known that for quite some 
time. What we did not know is that the army's chief historian 
concluded recently in a book of over 700 pages on the subject, and I 
quote: ``If there is a problem, it is perhaps due to the fact that there 
is no motivation''.
<P>
	Does the new Minister of National Defence endorse the 
conclusions of his chief historian as to the cause of consistent 
under-representation of francophones with the forces, and if so, 
what does he intend to do about this problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no 
doubt that in a number of sectors, it has always been a challenge to 
ensure adequate representation of francophones, and that is the 
case in the armed forces. The historian in question mentioned a 
situation which, as the hon. member pointed out, is common 
knowledge.
<P>
	We are trying to remedy the situation, and I can inform the hon. 
member that it has certainly improved. If we look at all the reports 
made over a certain period of time, there has been an improvement 
but, as in many other sectors, much remains to be done, and we will 
try to do it to the best of our ability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
francophones in Canada and Quebec are sick and tired of hearing 
people say it is always a challenge to give us our fair share. The 
minister's chief historian also concluded that francophone officers 
always have to take most of their training in English. I may remind 
the minister that it was his government, the Liberal government, 
that  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5885"> 5885 </A></B>
<P>
closed the Saint-Jean military college. That is certainly not going 
to reverse the trend.
<P>
	What explanation does the minister have for a comment by his 
historian that the army never wanted to have francophones in the 
intelligence sector, for instance? Is it or is it not true that 
francophones are systematically kept out of certain strategic 
positions in the Canadian army?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I wonder if I 
should start naming all the outstanding individuals who have ever 
held senior positions in the Canadian forces, in order to refute the 
allegations made by the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>

	I can tell him that today about 27 per cent of the people in the 
Canadian forces are francophones. I acknowledge the hon.

are making progress with our recruitment both for the regular 
forces and for the officers corps, even after the closing of the 
military college in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Young Canadians who want to be part of the Canadian forces are 
very conscious of the challenge they are facing if they come from a 
francophone region in Canada. This has been going on for a long

<P>
	Canadians are begging this Prime Minister to keep his promise

``Government travel cards should be used only for official 
government business''. However, the minister of youth knowingly

government business.

yesterday to this problem.
<P>
	There was a minor error made by the minister. We checked with 
the ethics counsellor and every cent has been reimbursed to the 
government. I have looked into  the matter and I am sure that the 
same mistake will not be repeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us talk about 
that minor error. This statement came from the credit card 
company directly to that minister's office. That minister did not 
deduct those personal expenses and submit only the ones that were 
legitimate. That minister submitted the whole bill and signed on 
the bottom ``this is legitimate government business''. If that is not 
a breach of ethics, I do not know what is.
<P>
	I am asking the Prime Minister if he will fire that minister for 
this obvious and blatant breach of public trust.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
these cases, the card that we use as government travel card is the 
Diners Club enRoute card on which no interest has to be paid.
<P>
	The normal procedure is for a member of Parliament to pay 
directly the amount with his or her cheque and then to send it to the 
department which then checks the expenditures. The process the

<P>
	Let us review the facts. In 1991 there was a decision made by the 
former Conservative government on taxpayer migration. In May of 
this year the auditor general drew to my attention his concerns with 
some policy and administrative aspects. I acted immediately to 
direct my officials to improve their administrative process, and the

to an open committee of this House, the finance committee. Having 
received its report he has closed that loophole. This is an example 
of how good government operates.

<P>
	According to the Treasury Board, agriculture Canada currently

recovery programs. Farmers are  increasingly concerned about the 
multiple impact cost recovery is having on their ability to survive 
and prosper.
<P>
	What economic impact analysis has been and will be done to 
monitor these impacts and is the minister prepared to redress any 
serious negative impacts should they result?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
first principle of course is that those who get the benefits of 
government services should whenever possible be those who pay 
for the costs. This is where the user pay policy comes from.
<P>
	In the case of the various departments, the departments are 
responsible for deciding in which circumstances, for what products 
and for what groups of users charges are to be paid. Once this is 
determined they make impact analysis and if they realize that their 
user fees have affects that were not foreseen or are negative then 
they are free to change their policies.
<P>
	For specific initiatives each minister is responsible for their 
impact analysis. The Treasury Board then looks at the overall 
policies and if there is any consequence that appears to be improper 
it is then changed and we amend the policy accordingly.

<P>
	Two days ago, the President of the Treasury Board came to the 
rescue of the Minister of National Defence by supporting his 
decision not to disclose how much General Boyle's generous 
separation package would be. The minister is hiding behind the 
Privacy Act. But the act is clear: discretionary benefits are not 
included in the definition of personal information. For the 
minister's information, I am referring to subsection 3(<I>l</I>).
<P>
	How can the minister stand by what he said when the act, on the 
one hand, does not recognize discretionary benefits as personal 
information and, on the other hand, explicitly authorizes the 
disclosure of any other type of benefit in the public interest? To be 
more specific, I am referring to subparagraph 8(2)(<I>m</I>)(i).
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

share with you our lawyers' interpretation: ``The fees and amounts 
an individual is entitled to constitute personal information, the 
disclosure of which is prohibited under the Privacy Act''.
<P>
	While he was indeed a government employee and an employee 
who served his country well, General Boyle is nevertheless entitled 
to the same protection against invasion of privacy as any other 
officer or employee of the government or anyone in the private 
sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> To listen to the

only last month, in a Federal Court ruling in the McCreery case on

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	This government continues to break major promises by 
approving an $87 million interest free loan to Bombardier. In this 
very House the Minister of Industry said: ``We talked about cutting 
subsidies to business. That is what we stand for''.
<P>
	He also said: ``We are not prepared to grant massive assistance to 
any company''. Why, then, did the Minister of Industry cave in to 
corporate welfare interests rather than keep the government's 
promise to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to explain to the hon. member, as I did to 
his colleague over the last couple of days, that the assistance that 
we have provided in the regional jet project is not a handout to 
business. It is not a handout to a corporation. It is an investment in 
research and development, fully repayable out of royalties on sales 
of aircraft.
<P>

<P>
	This hon. member is the member of his party on the industry 
committee. I think he understands the importance of trying to 
develop industries within this country that can succeed.
<P>
	I remind him that the only high technology sector in which 
Canada at this moment wins a trade surplus is the aerospace 
industry.
<P>
	I remind him that every other country in the world with an 
important aerospace sector is involved in it by state ownership, by 
defence procurement or by other measures.
<P>
	I remind him that as we invest in aerospace in Canada, we will be 
repaid with jobs and growth. If he wants to have his finance critic 
stand up and talk about jobs, then I suggest to him that he 
understand what it takes to create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
could not agree more. I know exactly what creates real jobs. Tax 
relief creates real jobs.
<P>
	In the last 15 years the federal government, including this 
government, has pumped $1.2 billion into Bombardier. Yet when 
taxpayers want to know how much of this money is paid back, the 
taxpayers are told to take a hike.
<P>
	If it is an investment, as the minister claims, why does this 
government refuse to divulge how much money has been paid back 
by Bombardier to the Canadian taxpayer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me first of all assure the hon. member that in 
introducing this new program called technology partnerships 
Canada we are looking only at those companies where we see an 
investment in research and development bringing in products to the 
marketplace that will have success in the international markets.
<P>
	That is the same attention that I will pay to prominent firms in 
his own riding that are applying under technology partnerships 
Canada.
<P>
	Let us look for a second at the $87 million in assistance which, 
as I have told him, is fully repayable and compare it to his 
proposition of tax relief. If we take the $87 million and divide it 
among the 20 million individual tax filers in this country, roughly 
$4.40 would go to each taxpayer.
<P>
	I will take the investment in Bombardier, the 2,700 jobs it will 
create and maintain, over the $4 to buy a hamburger for everyone 
else in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general. By the way, it is 
great to see the solicitor general back in the House. The Gander, 
Newfoundland air crash, the Hinton train wreck, the Dryden 
aeroplane disaster and the Westray mine explosion have one thing 
in common: inquiries were conducted into all four tragedies.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	The Air-India explosion more than 11 years ago was the worst 
civil aviation disaster in Canada's history. Can the minister tell the 
House when Canadians can expect the long overdue inquiry into 
the Air-India tragedy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member pointed out, the crash of the Air-India plane in 
1985 was a terrible tragedy but it was also a terrible crime. 
Hundreds of Canadians lost their lives.
<P>
	That is why the RCMP has been actively investigating the matter 
with a view to getting the evidence on which charges can be laid 
and those responsible for the bombing can be successfully 
prosecuted.
<P>
	The government has not forgotten the victims or their families. 
For the first time a solicitor general, namely myself, met with the 
families. I directed senior RCMP officers to keep them regularly 
informed of the progress of the investigation. As you will recall, 
Mr. Speaker, a $1 million reward has been offered. This has 
generated hundreds of leads which are being actively pursued.
<P>
	It is not considered appropriate to have a commission of inquiry 
while there is an active investigation. However, the commissioner 
has confirmed to me that if there is an impasse in the investigation I 
will be informed. I want to assure my hon. friend that if there is 
such an impasse I will immediately discuss this matter further with 
the Prime Minister.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Statistics Canada has announced that tuition fees for 
students at Canadian universities have increased by nearly 12 per 
cent over the last year.
<P>
	Since the Liberal government took power and started hacking 
away at transfers for post-secondary education, tuition fees in 
Canada have increased by a total of almost 30 per cent. Increased 
fees mean more and more young people are being excluded from 
the opportunity to participate in the so-called knowledge based 
economy that we consider so important because they can no longer 
afford to go to school.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5889"> 5889 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. If by continuing 
the cuts to education is it his intention to deny the children of 
middle class and working families access to education. Is it the 
government's intention to return Canada to the days when only 
the wealthy could afford to go to university?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, tuition fees began to rise in Canada long 
before this government took office. It was as a result of those 
tremendous increases in the tuition fees that the federal 
government, for example in its last budget, increased the tuition 
credits for students. We made it possible for single mothers, for 
instance, or custodial parents who require additional child care help 
to be able to go back to school.
<P>
	I should point out to the hon. member that in his province the 
federal government contributes 65 per cent of the cost of 
post-secondary education.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of privilege which is consistent with <I>Beauchesne's 
Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, fourth edition, 1958, at page 95, 
section 104(4). This point of privilege refers to the matter which I 
want to raise today. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Certain urgent matters, such as assaults upon or insults to Members if they should 
occur during a sitting of the House, may be raised at once in spite of the interruption 
of debate or other proceedings-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My point of personal privilege is in reference to a question put 
by the hon. member for Elk Island to the Prime Minister which was 
responded to by the minister in charge of the treasury board. I feel 
that members of the House, as well as Canadians, are insulted by 
the lack of action and response by the President of the Treasury 
Board and the Prime Minister.

	In question period the hon. member for Elk Island raised the 
point about the Secretary of State for Training and Youth misusing 
her expense account and she has not-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question was put in question period. It was 
directed to the government and at that time the government 
responded to the question.
<P>
	I fail to see how this would be a point of privilege for the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden. Privilege is a very narrow area. I 
would ask, if the hon. member still wishes to proceed, that he go 
directly to the point of privilege which affects him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was just getting to that 
point.
<P>
	The reason I rise on this issue is because I am insulted by the fact 
that the Secretary of State for Training and Youth has abused her 
position and has not accounted for her actions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not have any evidence before me that there is 
any guilt of any member on any side. What I have in front of me, as 
your Speaker, is a question that was asked and a question that was 
answered. Outside of it being unparliamentary, which it was not, I 
judged it to be a parliamentary question and acceptable. I judged 
the answer to be parliamentary. Whether it is acceptable to one side 
or the other is neither here nor there. I judged it to be a normal 
response that the government gives.
<P>
	At this point, at least, my dear colleague, I would rule, from what 
you have put before me, that there is no point of privilege.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to

that must apply to a referendum relating to the separation of 
Quebec from Canada before it may be recognized as a proper 
expression of the will of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill outlines a process for dealing with 
any future referendum on the issue of Quebec sovereignty. There 
are three main features of this bill. First, it allows the Government 
of Canada to determine whether a referendum question in Quebec 
is clear and unambiguous. If it is not, the Government of Canada is 
required to undertake a number of actions, including the holding of 
a parallel referendum in Quebec which asks a clear question on 
separation from Canada.
<P>
	Second, in the event of a yes vote, the bill authorizes the 
negotiation of separation subject to consultation with the 
provinces. Any final settlement would be subject to approval in a 
national referendum.
<P>
	Finally, the bill affirms that a unilateral declaration of 
independence is ineffective with respect to Canadian law  and does 
not affect the functioning of the Canadian Parliament, government 
or courts with respect to Quebec.
<P>
	These proposals avoid the mistakes of the past, ensure a respect 
for our legal order and ensure that all Canadians, including 
Quebecers, have a role in shaping their future.

section 745 allows first degree murderers to apply for early parole 
after 15 years. My bill would make sure that those convicted of the

corrections officers and customs officers, would be denied the right 
to apply for parole and would have to serve at least 25 years rather 
than a possible 15 years of their life sentence.

provide for the limitation of interest rates on credit cards.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to introduce my 
private member's bill today. This legislation is an act to provide for 
the limitation of interest rates on credit cards. The purpose of this 
bill is to significantly reduce the excessive credit card interest rates 
that banks and department stores are currently charging.
<P>
	I am sure that members in the House will agree that the major 
banks are making unprecedented profits. Indeed last year the major 
banks collectively raked in some $15 billion in profits. This year 
the third quarter reported profits are 20 per cent over last year for at 
least two of the major banks.
<P>
	Industry Canada officials have recently stated that credit card 
rates are persistently high. The major banks countered that their 
low rate cards are now in the 11 per cent range.
<P>
	My bill would ensure that any credit card issued by a financial 
institution or a department store could not have  an interest rate 
exceeding more than four or five percentage points over the Bank 
of Canada's discount rate.
<P>
	Our economy needs a boost. My bill will greatly assist in jump 
starting the economy. If more Canadians have access to credit cards 
at a lower interest rate then obviously their purchasing power will 
increase.

<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have two petitions to present 
today. The first comes from Wetaskiwin, Alberta.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. The petitioners therefore pray and call upon 
Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination 
against families who choose to provide care in the home for 
preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to two questions 
on the Order Paper.
<P>
	The first is Question No. 9 of which notice was given on 
February 28, 1996 with a request that a response be made within 45 
days. This same question was initially tabled in the House in 
September 1995. The previous parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader assured me and the House that an answer 
was forthcoming. Apparently a couple of departments were not 
able to supply all of the information quickly. Following 
prorogation of the House, the successive parliamentary secretary 
assured me that an answer was forthcoming very soon.
<P>
	We are now in October and a considerable time has elapsed since 
February, over half a year. I still do not have an answer to Question 
No. 9.
<P>
	As well there is Question No. 60, for which notice was given on 
June 13. Again, much more than 45 days has elapsed and the 
question has not been answered. I would like to know why.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
take the matter raised by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister under notice and will see that the 
message is delivered to the parliamentary secretary, being quite 
sensitive of course from his perspective of the length of time it has 
taken to get the answers.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, quite often that simply reflects the 
complexity of the question. We will take all those things into 
consideration and get back to the House, through you, Mr. Speaker.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADALABOURCODE">CANADA LABOUR CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for the Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-35, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(minimum wage), be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to you and to the 
Minister of Labour for giving me the opportunity to speak in 
support of Bill C-35.
<P>
	This is an act to amend the Canada Labour Code to automatically 
align the federal minimum wage to the levels applied in the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
	When I first realized that the federal minimum wage had not 
been raised in 10 years, I was totally amazed. A lot of things have 
changed in our country since 1986, both economically and socially.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5894"> 5894 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All these years, the four dollar an hour federal minimum wage 
has not increased, and in principle is still at the same level as it was 
in 1986.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the meantime, every single province and territory has 
upgraded its minimum wage and in some cases more than once. 
This means that all workers under federal jurisdiction who have 
been paid at the $4 an hour rate will immediately receive an 
increase.
<P>
	We know that wage increases are much more important for those 
who are at the bottom of the economic ladder. For them, as for most 
people, every penny counts. We each have to stretch them to the 
maximum to make ends meet.
<P>
	As former minister of labour for Prince Edward Island, I can 
assure members that the government has made the right choice by 
aligning the federal minimum wage to the rate applied in each 
province and territory.
<P>
	The provinces clearly have the lead on this issue, as they govern 
98 per cent of all minimum wage earners in Canada. It is a fact that 
industries under federal jurisdiction such as transportation, 
telecommunications, banks and some crown corporations have 
very few workers at minimum wage.
<P>
	Indeed, recent estimates show that less than one-tenth of one per 
cent of the Canadian labour force falls into this category. The 
federal government could have followed the traditional approach 
and introduced a flat increase to set the minimum wage in the 
middle of the range of provincial and territorial rates and the 
government could have taken the path as it has done in the past.
<P>
	Indeed, the government could have just done what past 
governments have done. But then, by the time the new rate would 
have been in effect, a number of provinces could have increased 
their own rates. A number of the provinces, including my own 
province of Prince Edward Island, have raised their minimum wage 
rates since this bill was introduced in the House last May.
<P>
	The status quo was not a viable option either because the federal 
minimum wage was falling far out of line with overall social and 
economic conditions. This is very important because our 
government is committed to helping those who are most in need. 
We mean this.
<P>
	This is why the Minister of Labour has seriously analysed the 
situation and has chosen a method setting the federal minimum 
wage that fulfils three important objectives: to ensure its 
continuing relevancy; to promote fairness by ensuring that 
workers, whether subject to federal or provincial labour laws, are 
entitled to the same minimum wage within the same labour market; 
to provide more incentive for people to seek work while balancing 
and limiting the negative impact of job creation.
<P>
	We recognize that the economic realities and the labour market 
conditions are very often different from one region to the other. We 
also know that these factors are clearly reflected in the way 
different provinces set their minimum wage.
<P>
	Adopting provincial territorial minimum wage rates maintains 
this balance across regions without punishing or rewarding anyone. 
Let us look at the figures.
<P>
	Today the provincial and territorial minimum wage rates vary 
from $5 an hour in Newfoundland and Alberta to $7 an hour in 
British Columbia. This is a huge difference. But then, who would 
argue that the cost of living is not different in these regions of the 
country? This is a perfect example of why aligning the federal rate 
to the provincial rate is the best way to go.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I would like to address the issue of the efficiency of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe all members of this House want to make legislative and 
parliamentary procedures still more flexible and efficient. Each 
week we meet people in our riding offices with complaints about 
the current system. They feel it is too slow and a source of 
confusion, with too much duplication and overlap. I know this, 
because far too many such cases are brought to my attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Here is an opportunity for all of us to do something concrete and 
positive to streamline government activities. From now on there 
will be no need to amend the federal minimum wage regulations in 
order to adjust the federal minimum wage to the reality. It will be 
automatically updated on a regular basis in line with territorial and 
provincial increases.
<P>
	I was also happy to hear the minister note that the new rates will 
apply equally to adults and to young workers. I must admit that I 
have great difficulty in accepting that a person should be paid less 
just because of his or her age. I also believe that such a practice 
may likely be discriminatory under the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. I therefore strongly support section 178(2) of the 
bill which states that where provinces have set rates according to 
occupation, age or work experience the general rate will apply. If 
there are different rates based on age, the highest minimum wage 
rate will apply to those in federally regulated industries.
<P>
	I would also like to say a few words about the process the 
government followed with this bill. We had serious consultations 
will all of the stakeholders before choosing this formula. Every-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5895"> 5895 </A></B>
<P>
body has had the chance to express their view before the final 
decision was made, and the general reaction is very positive.
<P>
	Sometimes employers become very apprehensive when they 
hear talk about raising the minimum wage. They are often afraid 
that these costs will hurt their competitiveness. Not in this case. 
The federally regulated employers, transportation, communication 
as well as the Canadian Bankers' Association have indicated they 
do not oppose the government's initiative. Indeed, business leaders 
recognize that it makes a lot of practical sense to harmonize federal 
and provincial rates since federal employers have done so in 
practice for some time.
<P>
	Labour organizations welcome the move as a small increase long 
overdue. They would like to see a bigger raise in the minimum 
wage and of course so would everyone. But in this field we all have 
to move according to a pay set by the economic strengths and 
weaknesses of a specific labour market. In this specific case we 
have not met any significant opposition for the simple reason that 
Bill C-35 brings into force what has by and large already been 
practised across the country.
<P>
	As the Minister of Labour was saying earlier, we are bringing the 
legislation in line with reality. There is also good support for this 
initiative because everyone recognizes that by harmonizing the 
federal rate with the provincial and territorial ones we will end the 
stagnation we have seen over the last 10 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, some will say that the federal government ought not 
to transfer such responsibilities to the provinces and territories, 
because it would run the risk of ending up weaker as a result. We 
are not, however, giving up our authority, for we are retaining the 
legislative power to establish a different rate, if this decision were 
taken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Should a province or a territory decide to bring down its 
minimum wage or set it to a level we estimate would be too low, 
the federal rate will stay at the higher level. We are not passing our 
responsibilities to the next jurisdiction.
<P>
	What we are doing is working hand in hand with the provinces 
and territories to find the best and most efficient way to keep the 
federal minimum wage in line with reality in each and every 
province and territory of our country.
<P>
	This initiative has been taken with the full knowledge and 
co-operation of all provincial and territorial governments which 
know that this bill will improve the system and better reflect the 
realities of our current marketplace. The bill has gone through the 
scrutiny of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and is coming back to us without a single 
amendment.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	This shows clearly that the formula is the right one and that the 
consultation process was absolutely appropriate to develop a large 
and a strong consensus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Given the Government's creative strategy with respect to the 
federal minimum wage, I feel that the future looks most 
encouraging.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his speech at second reading of this bill the Minister of Labour 
told us about his plan to overhaul the Canada Labour Code in order 
to make it a more useful tool to move and adjust to the new realities 
of the workplace.
<P>
	I am very confident that the minister will be successful. He will 
succeed because he is dedicated to dialogue and consultation. He 
will succeed because he is facing the problems head on in search of 
a practical, efficient and permanent solution. Bill C-35 is an 
excellent example.
<P>
	Amending the Canada Labour Code is an important task because 
it sets the basic rules for the workplace for thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	Today we are taking a small step to improve the working 
conditions for some Canadian workers who are under the 
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. They are the ones at the 
bottom of the economic ladder. They work hard for their pay. They 
are proud workers. They participate in society and they contribute 
to society.
<P>
	That is why I support Bill C-35. I am confident that every 
member of the House of Commons will also show their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak for up to 
a maximum of 40 minutes, and I will try to stay within those limits. 
You know how unpredictable this is, but before discussing the 
minimum wage, I shall, if I may, be out of order and offer my 
congratulations to a friend who works with us at the leader's office 
and has now become a father-talk about a positive element. David 
MacDonald, who is well known here on the Hill, is now the proud 
father of a baby girl.
<P>
	That being said, my congratulations duly extended, we are now 
talking about a very serious matter. Our listeners know that when, 
as parliamentarians, we discuss the issue of minimum wage rates, 
we refer to three major factors. These are people who are less well 
off in society. There are people who often have no collective 
agreement, who lack this often elementary protection that puts it all 
down in writing. In that case they have to rely on legislation like 
the bill before the House today to amend the Canada Labour Code.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5896"> 5896 </A></B>
<P>
	These are people who work part-time and who in many cases 
have difficult working conditions and hold  down several jobs. For 
their sake it is certainly very important to try to impose a certain 
number of rules which according to the legislator set the absolute 
strict minimum.
<P>
	As we have said on several occasions, we believe that Bill C-35 
is a rather positive bill. It is positive, since it has six major 
characteristics. The first one is that to all intents and purposes, and 
I say this very carefully, the bill before the House today says that in 
every province where there are federally-regulated companies, the 
minimum wage rate will be aligned with the rate in effect in that 
particular province. The federal minimum wage was $4 and has not 
been increased since 1986.
<P>
	Of course the federal government, and that is one of its 
prerogatives, retains the right to establish an hourly rate for 
companies under its jurisdiction, should there be no minimum 
wage rate in effect in the province, but to all intents and purposes, 
the bill will put an end to this aberration which we have condemned 
many times in the past, which meant that two groups of workers 
within the same territory and doing the same job could not be 
getting the same hourly rate, which made no sense at all.
<P>
	Let me give you the broad parameters of Bill C-35. As I said 
before, and to make quite clear to listeners who have just tuned in, I 
repeat that the federal minimum wage is set at the hourly rate 
established by the employee's province or territory of employment.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Having said that, I think that, for the sake of clarity, we must 
bear in mind that the reality in terms of the Canadian labour market 
and the current minimum wage is a rather fragmented, uneven 
reality, since we are not in a situation where minimum wage rates 
are harmonized. Think that there are provinces where the minimum 
wage rate is barely above $4, while it is as high as $7 in generous 
British Columbia. But for this reality to be reasonably meaningful 
to our fellow citizens, I will nevertheless list the various hourly 
rates in effect in each province.
<P>
	Alberta has set its minimum wage rate at $5; British Columbia, 
whose financial situation is the healthiest, has an hourly rate of $7; 
Prince Edward Island, $5.40, as the minister, who was himself born 
and raised on this island no larger than Montreal, pointed out; 
Manitoba also has an hourly rate of $5.40; New Brunswick, $5.50; 
Nova Scotia, $5.50; Ontario, the very conservative province of 
Ontario, where a lot is happening these days, as you know from 
following the news, has an hourly rate of $6.85; Quebec, $6.70; 
Saskatchewan, $5.35; Newfoundland, $5.25; the Northwest 
Territories, $7; and the Yukon, $6.86.
<P>
	So, it was wise on the part of the government, as the federal 
legislator, to decide to bring its rate in line with the provincial 
rates, and that is an initiative we have applauded on several 
occasions.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that the bill calls for the general rate to 
apply, regardless of the profession, status, or work experience of 
the worker, which has not always been the case. In the past, 
exceptions were made possible because of characterizations like 
the ones I just mentioned.
<P>
	Also, and it was wise to provide for this, when workers are paid 
under a different criterion-there are places for instance where 
earnings are calculated by the piece, that is another 
possibility-they must receive at least as much as the minimum 
wage equivalent for the work in question.
<P>
	Fourth exception, where the wage rate set by the province is 
based on age, the highest rate applies, and we think this is normal 
and desirable.
<P>
	Fifth, as I said, the federal government may set the minimum 
wage rate with respect to employment in a province.
<P>
	Sixth, the federal government specifies the conditions under 
which and the occupations in which young people under the age of 
17 may be employed, but there may be no specific rate for them.
<P>
	As you can see, one of the changes introduced with this Bill C-35 
is that exceptions on the basis of age will no longer be allowed, 
contrary to what had been the practice until just recently, for fear 
that it would not meet the test of the Charter in eventual court 
challenges, as the chairman of the human resources development 
committee can imagine, he who, as we know, is very concerned 
about these issues.
<P>
	As much as we applaud this legislation and feel it should be 
supported, it still has some flaws. We still did our job as opposition, 
because the opposition must work on improving the government. 
Of course, it is a full time job. With all we have ahead of us, no one 
could work only part time on improving the government. If we 
want a better government, the opposition must work very hard and 
full time, and be able to introduce amendments.
<P>
	We proposed an amendment which the Liberals rejected with 
some weak arguments. We do not fully understand what drove 
them to it; Their justifications were somewhat vague. But we did 
put forward an amendment aimed at-it is still possible. Even if 
only 10 per cent of workers are subject to the Canada Labour Code, 
this does not mean we should not be concerned with them. Ten per 
cent of workers are subject to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Fifty per cent of this 10 per cent of workers are paid the 
minimum wage. This is another reality we must deal with. Since 
this is a federal jurisdiction, there are cases in which a worker may 
perform his duties in more than one province. There is the whole 
issue of trucking, of interprovincial transport.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5897"> 5897 </A></B>
<P>
	We have concerns. We wondered what would happen when a 
worker does not have a fixed workplace and the employer himself 
can assign a workplace in Ontario, Saskatchewan or Alberta. 
Would the employer not be inclined to choose the workplace with 
the lowest hourly wage rate?
<P>
	Because we are concerned with this social democratic aspect, we 
questioned the minister in subcommittee. I think the committee 
chairman will recall that some of our questions remained 
unanswered. That is why we felt it was our duty to move an 
amendment. So we put forward an amendment that was defeated by 
the Liberals.
<P>
	In short, we still did our duty and I am convinced that we 
uncovered a flaw in this bill which was minor but nonetheless 
worth bringing to the government's attention.
<P>
	But, to me, the most important issue in this fundamental debate 
is not so much the fact that the minister proposes a bill on 
minimum wage. It would have been interesting to put the issue of 
minimum wage in the context of impoverishment. This is the 
reality and we will keep repeating it as long as we sit in this House, 
because there are few people, with the notable exception of the 
official opposition, who are truly concerned about the plight of the 
poor. It must be understood that there have never been so many 
poor in Canada.
<P>
	No one in this House, whether from the government, the Reform 
Party or the Bloc Quebecois, can rise and say that, since the 
seventies, the Canadian and Quebec societies have become more 
affluent overall. It is not the case. Rather, there is an increasing 
number of poor, 4.8 million of them, in Canada.
<P>
	I thank the Speaker for showing concern about my health. It is 
true that I was not feeling well the last few days. I had the flu. Had 
it not been for my robust health, I would not have recovered. But I 
am here to talk to you and to protect the interests of the poor.
<P>
	Poverty is not disappearing. It is not diminishing. I am pleased to 
see the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, because I want to remind him that, while 
poverty is measurable, while it is a statistical data, it is also a 
human reality. Behind every graph, chart, figure and fraction, there 
are destinies, hopes, dramas and families.
<P>
	We are told there are 4.8 million poor in Canada, and it is agreed 
that a Canadian is considered to be poor when 56 per cent of his or 
her income is spent on the three basics, namely clothing, housing 
and food. As you know, poverty, like unemployment, is not a 
genetic trait.
<P>
	The labour, international trade and human resources ministers 
keep telling us about market globalization and interdependency, 
but the fact is that we have an unemployment rate which is 
chronically much higher than the average for OECD countries.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	And while the average rate of unemployment in OECD countries 
stands at 7.8 per cent, the Canadian average is 12 per cent, and in 
certain parts of large cities, 13, 14, 15, 16 and even 22 per cent.
<P>
	One day we would like an explanation as to why certain 
countries that are not on Mars but right here on Earth have achieved 
full employment, when it is still eluding us here in Canada.
<P>
	For the official opposition, one thing is certain and that is that 
there is no getting around the fact that two governments get in each 
other's way, and that when you are without a job, when things have 
taken a turn for the worse and you have lost your job because of a 
disability, or have just been laid off, there is no one place you can 
go for help. There are a certain number of programs you may turn 
to if you receive income security benefits, but not if you are on 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The only truly integrated labour market policy is one in which all 
related activities would be handled by a single authority, which can 
only be the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to come back to the issue of poverty. It is not a 
question of genes. The parliamentary secretary, who generally has 
little to say when we mention figures, but manages to find his 
tongue in committee, will agree with me that poverty is not 
something you are born to. It is not as though some people are 
destined to be poor, while others are destined to be rich. However, 
it must be admitted that certain decisions drive people into poverty. 
I would like to give you a recent example. This is not an example 
from 50 years ago, but is something quite contemporary and 
immediate, and has resulted in a cloud of shame descending on this 
Parliament, particularly to your right, when the employment 
insurance legislation was passed.
<P>
	The employment insurance reform is bad for two reasons. First, 
because it limits the accessibility of workers and of employees to 
the protection of unemployment insurance that they have paid for. 
It will be remembered, first of all, that the Canadian government 
has not, since 1992, contributed one red cent to the unemployment 
insurance fund, and it would be impossible to find comparisons 
within the OECD, to find any example of a country which has 
decided to disengage in such an irresponsible way from the 
unemployment insurance field.
<P>
	The fact is, that with unemployment insurance reform, benefits, 
coverage and duration are being reduced. What does this mean? It 
makes it clear that there is a link between the constitutional 
framework and Quebec's sovereignist project. What did Louise 
Harel, the Quebec minister of employment and MLA for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve have to say in the last referendum? ``We 
are investing $10 billion yearly for the Quebec labour market''. 
This is not a trifle, $10  billion yearly. It is even far higher than the 
average amount invested in the OECD countries. Despite the fact 
that we are investing more in work force policies within Quebec, 
including 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5898"> 5898 </A></B>
<P>
income security and unemployment insurance, we are faced with 
an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means that the continued 
unemployment is not a result of lack of money, or of resources. If 
there is this much unemployment, it is because programs have been 
poorly designed, because there is no possibility for a single 
decision-making centre to have an integrated labour market policy.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Think how wonderful it would be if, once a person was out of the 
work force, for all manner of reasons, more often than not reasons 
beyond his control, there were only one single centre of authority 
for that person, where he could be offered a broad range of 
programs and measures, where a true path back to work would be 
available to him. In other words, a given individual would be 
followed from the very beginning of his loss of employment, 
throughout the system, and right up until he obtained a new job, 
without any concern for federal-provincial overlaps, for this is 
where the damage is done.
<P>
	We have two decision-making centres which are not 
co-ordinated, which do not speak the same language, which do not 
take the same steps, which discourage people, and which make it 
impossible for Quebec to have a proper integrated labour force 
strategy.
<P>
	Still more serious is the fact that the policy proposed by the 
Minister of Human Resource Development is a one which 
contributes to destabilizing Quebec's public finances. I believe we 
must speak of this reality. Those listening to us have a need to 
know. With the restrictions that have been made within 
unemployment insurance reform, making it into employment 
insurance, 30,000 new households have been unable to qualify for 
employment insurance and have therefore had to apply for income 
security, which is a last resort.
<P>
	With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote an 
eminent economist known to a number of us. His name is Pierre 
Fortin. He is an economist with the UQAM. He is not a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois. He is not a member of the executive of my 
riding association. He has no sovereignist leanings. He is a brilliant 
intellectual and a respected member of the academic community.
<P>
	He was involved in drafting a report published under the title: 
``Pour un régime équitable axé sur l'emploi''. This report, released 
not quite a year ago, was very critical of the employment insurance 
system. I would like to quote from the report.
<P>
	It says: ``In 1995, approximately 120,000 people were either 
unemployed and recently excluded from  unemployment insurance 
or had dropped out of the labour market altogether as a result of 
these restrictions. Since it is usually estimated that 25 per cent of 
those who are not eligible for unemployment insurance end up on 
welfare, it is reasonable to believe that federal restrictions-and I 
will repeat this in an attempt to get the attention of the former 
parliamentary secretary, I feel sorry for him, but it is not our 
decision-it is reasonable to believe that federal restrictions have 
caused as many as 30,000 more households to go on welfare. The 
annual cost to the Quebec government would increase by about 
$240 million. The first estimates available indicate that the new 
changes in unemployment insurance announced for 1996 would 
add another 20,000 households to those already on welfare and 
would finally put the cumulative cost of these restrictions at 
approximately $400 million for Quebec''.
<P>
	Do you realize the tragedy behind all this? When you see the 
Minister of Finance with his grey hair and his unconscionable ego 
rising at the Liberal convention strutting like a peacock when he 
says that he made it, that he is about to achieve his budgetary 
objectives, there is something extremely troubling here which is 
almost dishonest, because the Minister of Finance did not tell us 
that, as he is about to achieve his budgetary objectives which were 
to bring the deficit down to 2 per cent of GNP, he did so with 
absolute contempt for the provinces, by offloading his problems 
and making the provinces poorer.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	That is the reality, and when Pierre Fortin tells us that the 
reforms proposed by the Liberal government will add an additional 
$400 million to the cost of welfare payments, this is the most 
despicable, pernicious, unacceptable and irresponsible example of 
what Canadian federalism has to offer. That is why we are a 
sovereignist opposition and why we intend to achieve our 
sovereignty.
<P>
	That being said, as long as we are in this House, as long as we are 
the official opposition, we will always be what the Reform Party 
and the government cannot be: the voice of those who are less well 
off in our society.
<P>
	In the time I have left, I would like to draw a thumbnail sketch of 
poverty. I said earlier that poverty was a very specific reality 
affecting 4.8 million Canadians. But not all are affected equally. 
There are some classes of people in society whose social status 
makes them more vulnerable to poverty and financial setbacks.
<P>
	For a very long time, seniors were seen as the poorest in our 
society. So much so that, when the Senate carried out a study on 
poverty in the 1970s, there was an old person on the front page of 
its report. I am not saying today that seniors are no longer poor or 
that there are no people who have trouble making ends meet, but 
the fact is that the face of poverty is changing. At this time, the 
poorest members of our society are young families headed by 
someone under 25. Canada's poverty rate is 17 per cent. If we had a 
sample of 100 people, 17 of them would fit the statistical definition 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5899"> 5899 </A></B>
<P>
of poor, in that they must spend 56 per cent of their income on 
clothing, food and housing.
<P>
	Well 44 per cent of young families headed by someone under 25 
are poor, compared to 17 per cent of all Canadians. So, if you are a 
family head under 25, the more family obligations you have before 
the age of 25, the better your chances of fitting the definition of 
poor, since 50 per cent of young families are poor.
<P>
	Even more so for single-parent families headed by a woman 
under the age of 65 who has a child under the age of 18. In that 
case, the poverty rate raises to 56 per cent.
<P>
	Also, and this is a fairly new reality, the scope of which we are 
only starting to realize, fewer members of our society are getting 
married. The number of singles is on the rise. Not so much among 
Canadians, but still there is a growing number of single people, of 
people living alone. And people who live alone and are single have 
about a 40 per cent chance of living below the poverty line.
<P>
	This profile should have been enough to convince the minister 
that it is not enough to table in this House a bill to bring the federal 
minimum wage rate in line with the rates in effect in the provinces 
and more should have been done.
<P>
	You will recall what the Liberals promised. In the last election 
campaign, the Liberals were talking about establishing a national 
child care system in Canada. They talked about guaranteed 
minimum income. Their generous spirit during the campaign 
translated into extremely cheap and restrictive policies and 
decisions regarding those people who are the less fortunate, the 
most disadvantages.
<P>
	I would like to address a number of myths concerning poverty.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In order to be clear, and since we can express them with 
numbers, let me say that, in 1994, poverty levels-these are the 
most recent ones established by the National Council of 
Welfare-in large urban areas were estimated at $16,511 for a 
single person and at $31,061 for a family of four.
<P>
	So, in 1994, a person living in a large city with a total income of 
$16,511 was considered to be poor. Similarly, a family of four, that 
is two spouses with two children, living on $31,071 was also poor. 
This takes us back to the sad picture that I tried to paint earlier.
<P>
	Let me tell you about a number of biases that prevail and that 
are, of course, promoted by the Reform Party, and sometimes, 
albeit to a lesser degree, by the government majority.
<P>
	There is this thinking, behind the proposed employment 
insurance measures, that poverty is first a personal matter, that 
people choose to be poor, that it is a deliberate choice, as if people 
deliberately chose to lose their jobs, to become unemployed, or to 
be laid off.
<P>
	I think there is something terribly hypocritical about the reform 
proposed by the government. It wants to impose penalties on 
people because they are unemployed, and asks them to find work, 
when we are not in a position to create enough jobs for all the 
people who want them. There is something profoundly 
unacceptable about imposing penalties on people who are looking 
for work.
<P>
	There is also this whole idea that the poor do not pay taxes, that 
they are wards of the state and that they are not contributing their 
fair share. This is interesting, because the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization has reminded us that most people living in poverty 
work part time, and that over 60 per cent of heads of families living 
in poverty and over 70 per cent of single people living in poverty 
pay taxes. In Ontario alone, it is estimated that these people 
contribute $160 million in taxes. So much for that myth.
<P>
	There is another myth that must also be dispelled, particularly 
now that the Canadian government has pulled out of the Canada 
assistance plan. Our viewers must know that under the Canada 
assistance plan, in existence since 1966, the Canadian government 
shared half the cost of funding provincial income security 
programs, and that terminating this program will not only 
destabilize budgets in the provinces concerned, but can only mean 
that there will be increasingly fewer funds available for those who 
have nowhere else to turn.
<P>
	There is this idea that people on income security are receiving 
way too much money, enough to meet their needs and then some. 
What has to be said, in the context of social programs and a debate 
such as this one today in the House, is that all Canadians on welfare 
are living under the poverty line. The highest welfare benefits are 
still 20 per cent below the poverty line as defined by specialized 
organizations. This is another myth that must be dispelled.
<P>
	Another point that must be mentioned is that, by adopting a bill 
like the one on employment insurance, the government is following 
a philosophy of auditing. The idea is that the unemployed, those 
receiving benefits, are cheats, and that this is a way to get money 
back, and thus a way to improve public finances, whereas studies 
have proven that, while not claiming there are no cases of 
fraud-for there are-they account for only about 3 per cent of all 
accounts.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	How can anyone dream of establishing a policy for putting 
public finances back on their feet based on a philosophy of 
auditing, one as shameless as the one  proposed to us by the Liberal 
government with employment insurance, while it knows full well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5900"> 5900 </A></B>
<P>
that barely 3 per cent of all claimants are involved in fraud, and 
knows equally well that the level for income tax fraud is 20 per 
cent?
<P>
	How is it that the government has not had the same enthusiasm? 
How can it be that the government has not exercised the same 
diligence in trying to get tax money out of the well to do, in trying 
to go after the richest of taxpayers? We know that there is a 20 per 
cent fraud rate at Revenue Canada. This would offer an opportunity 
to make some savings and remedy shortfalls. The government has 
preferred to attack the most disadvantaged rather than shoulder its 
responsibilities, so much so that the last budget informed us there 
would be fewer and fewer audit staff at Revenue Canada.
<P>
	The result of this is that prejudices continue, that we continue in 
a situation where wrong ideas are being entertained, and where 
there is no hesitation to go after the most disadvantaged, very likely 
the category of people who have contributed most to restoring 
public finances.
<P>
	There is one extremely important statistic in this connection 
which we ought never to lose sight of, which we ought never to 
forget, when attempting to design social policies. It is a statistic 
reminding us that, in Canada, income, or in other words wealth, is 
very unevenly distributed. If we look at the total incomes of 
Canadians, we find that the wealthiest fifth of the population of 
Canada receives nearly half of all Canadian income.
<P>
	The wealthiest 20 per cent of the population gets 50 per cent of 
this income, while the poorest 20 per cent gets only 3.4 per cent. In 
other words, the wealthiest fifth of the population gets 14 times as 
much money as the poorest fifth.
<P>
	If we really want to be serious about what we do in Parliament, if 
we want to do something useful, this is where we should start. This 
is real injustice. We know the statistics, we know the most 
troubling facts about the distribution of wealth, but the 
government's complacency, in its refusal to deal with the problems 
and its habit of proposing measures that are less than satisfactory 
have meant that our society is becoming increasingly poorer, that 
wealth is unequally distributed and that the wealthiest continue to 
get wealthier and the poorest get poorer.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I agree with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I seem to have the support of one of my Reform 
colleagues, which is certainly quite welcome, although as 
surprising as it is unexpected, but it certainly is inspiring to realize 
that when we discuss these things we can understand each other and 
convince our colleagues that certain things have to be done.
<P>
	I believe my time is running out. I would like to add that the 
National Council of Welfare, a very serious and non-partisan 
agency which has been around for quite some time, since it was 
founded by a constituent act in 1966, the National Council of 
Welfare reminded us that Canadian society has never been as poor, 
that wealth has never been as unequally distributed, adding that if 
we had wanted to, we could have wiped out poverty.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I would like to quote what the National Council said in its 1995 
report. It recalled the following facts: ``Despite the sombre reality, 
it is not utopian to think that we can win the war against poverty. 
Statistics Canada estimates that it would have cost $15.2 billion in 
1994''.
<P>
	I repeat: It is not utopian to think we can win the war against 
poverty. Statistics Canada estimates that it would have cost $15.2 
billion in 1994 to bring all the poor above the poverty line. This is 
an enormous amount but certainly not too much, in a country where 
the federal government and the provincial territorial governments 
spent about $350 billion in 1994 and where the value of all goods 
and services produced exceeded $750 billion''. We are living in a 
society where governments spend $350 billion and where we 
produce $750 billion.
<P>
	If we had had the common sense to pool our resources and put 
$15 billion into active measures to fight poverty, today in this 
House we would not only be discussing the minimum wage, we 
would also be able to say how proud we are that as legislators, 
co-operating with all partners, we were able to wipe out poverty. 
For this scenario to become a reality, however, it is not enough to 
have a debate. It is not enough to have a government. It is not 
enough to have a democracy. We need an ingredient that is 
extremely important and also extremely rare in a democracy, one 
that is certainly lacking in the government before us. I am of course 
referring to political courage. Because to raise this $15 billion, we 
must also do something about the distribution of wealth. And if we 
want to do something about that, the government would have to 
have the guts to put a minimum tax on the table, something the 
opposition has been asking for three years.
<P>
	However, a minimum tax means taxing a certain number of 
corporate citizens, who are of course friends of the present 
government.
<P>
	Since my time is up, I will say in concluding that we will never 
do enough to fight poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I support 
the overall intent of Bill C-35 because it makes at least a tentative 
move toward the elimination of outdated regulations. It is a step in 
the right direction. It shows the provinces that the Government of 
Canada is willing to recognize, at least in part, their ability to make 
sound financial and humanitarian laws.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5901"> 5901 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the bill has one glaring flaw. As I mentioned during 
second reading debate and as my colleague from Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia said yesterday, section 178(3) 
gives the cabinet the power to set rates if it disagrees with the 
rates established by the provinces or territories.
<P>
	We proposed an amendment which would remove this clause and 
give full jurisdiction over minimum wage rates to the provinces. 
Surprisingly, though, members of the official opposition did not 
support our amendment. I can only assume that they are really not 
in favour of giving more autonomy to the province of Quebec in 
labour matters. That surprises me. I have always been under the 
assumption that the devolution of powers was something that was 
very near and dear to their hearts.
<P>
	Government members also refused to support our amendment, 
showing that they are really not sincere about giving more 
responsibilities to the provinces. Instead, the government continues 
to waffle on the issue of decentralization. Like parents who try to 
prolong their kid's childhood, this Liberal government is refusing 
to acknowledge that the provinces have come of age. Not 
surprisingly, this is contrary to the red book promise.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Broken promise No. 14 reads: ``A Liberal government will work 
closely with provincial governments to reduce duplication and 
improve service delivery in all areas where governments are 
involved''.
<P>
	By clinging to the ``Father Knows Best'' tradition, the 
government is failing to live up to yet another campaign promise.
<P>
	With this bill, the government is implying that it wants to better 
the lot of workers yet it stubbornly clings to the old myths. It wants 
wage earners to believe that by retaining the right to set minimum 
wage rates that it has their best interests at heart. It is just like it 
wants workers to believe that somehow governments can create 
jobs.
<P>
	A study released this week by a Halifax based think tank 
concludes that large increases in regional subsidies to Atlantic 
Canada have had a perverse effect, retarding economic growth 
rather than spurring it.
<P>
	After 30 years of failure, people from coast to coast are 
recognizing that the policies promoted by this Liberal government 
have increased the debt load on Canadians and on the federal 
treasury, a double whammy. So much for red book promises.
<P>
	If the Liberal government is really sincere about keeping at least 
the red book promise or the throne speech pledge of cutting red 
tape and ending duplication, now is the time to show good faith and 
give the provinces the sole governance over minimum wage rates. 
If the spirit of co-operation really exists, section 178(3) can be 
deleted and a memorandum of understanding negotiated to ensure 
that provinces maintain reasonable  minimum wage standards. This 
would protect Canada's international commitments and free trade 
agreements.
<P>
	Today of all days, on the first anniversary of the Quebec 
referendum, the government should be aware of the need to initiate 
some form of decentralization of some federal powers. The fact 
that the Prime Minister ignored the unity issue last year almost 
resulted in the break up of the country. The government must now 
recognize that the status quo will no longer keep Canada together.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a plan which we think would be 
acceptable to all Canadians. In recognition of the need for 
decentralization, we developed a bottom up agenda for change that 
does not require amending the Constitution. The Reform Party's 
fresh start platform commits us to rebalancing powers, moving 
governmental responsibility closer to the people and strengthening 
Canada's federal nature and institutions.
<P>
	As long as the government insists on retaining the right to revert 
to cabinet decreed minimum wage rates, the Reform Party cannot 
support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to take part in the debate on Bill C-35, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	This amendment speaks to the type of government this is. It is a 
government that seeks justice, opportunity and recognizes that hard 
working Canadians need to be rewarded for the work they engage 
in. The legislation would automatically align the federal minimum 
wage rate with the general adult minimum wage rates of the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
	I am sure hon. colleagues were quite surprised to learn that the 
federal minimum wage as of July 17, 1996 had not increased in 10 
years. I am sure hon. members will agree that just about everything 
else increased during the past decade.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This legislation is most certainly overdue. It is time the federal 
minimum wage was brought into line with minimum amount 
workers under provincial jurisdictions receive for their labour.
<P>
	The federal minimum wage was $4 an hour until July 17, 1996 
when it was raised to provincial and territorial minimum wage 
rates effective at that time. I note that five provinces have increased 
their minimum wage rate since July 17.
<P>
	The minimum wage affects our most vulnerable workers, those 
who are most in need of receiving a reasonable hourly income, 
those hard working Canadians who are contributing to the 
economic growth of our nation. I really believe they deserve better.
<P>
	For the most part these workers are non-unionized. Passage of 
Bill C-35 will help protect Canada's unorganized workers. Since 
non-union workers make up  about two thirds of the Canadian 
workforce that is a substantial number of people. Of course in 
practical terms aligning the federal minimum wage to the provin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5902"> 5902 </A></B>
<P>
cial and territorial rates affects only a small portion of workers; all 
the more reason to ensure passage of Bill C-35.
<P>
	These men and women deserve to be guaranteed the same 
compensation for their labour as is received by their provincial 
counterparts. Furthermore, this legislation establishes a level 
playing field for all Canadian employers and employees with 
regard to minimum wages.
<P>
	Businesses will be protected nationwide from unfair 
competition, at least as far as payment of basic wage is concerned. 
There is no danger of us opening a Pandora's box of economic 
uncertainty. In fact, as hon. colleagues have pointed out previously, 
most employers under federal jurisdiction are now paying their 
lowest paid employees the equivalent of the provincial rate. 
Passage of Bill C-35 will ensure that this practice is applied across 
the board. It will benefit those workers who enjoy little or no 
bargaining power.
<P>
	As soon as the act comes into effect, all workers under federal 
jurisdiction will be paid the respective provincial or territorial 
minimum wage.
<P>
	Another positive aspect of this piece of legislation is that it gives 
further impetus to the government's desire to bring greater 
harmony to the federal and provincial laws governing the 
workplace standards. By aligning the federal, provincial and 
territorial minimum wage rates the rates will correspond more 
directly, more precisely with the realities of each region's 
economy.
<P>
	I believe it is important for hon. members to note that the 
provinces and territories govern 98 per cent of Canadian workers 
who are paid minimum wage. Those under federal jurisdiction 
represent less than 10 per cent of the Canadian workforce. That is 
one reason why the Minister of Labour did not choose to follow 
tradition and simply increase the former federal minimum wage 
rate. Had the minister taken this approach, before long provincial 
and territorial rates would increase and once again the Government 
of Canada would find itself lagging behind some of the provinces.
<P>
	Passage of Bill C-35 will resolve the quandary once and for all. 
Bill C-35 will ensure that every time a province or territory 
upgrades its adult minimum wage the government of Canada's 
minimum wage will follow suit.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure hon. members can see that this approach will be much 
more administratively efficient. Let us consider for a second that 
rules will be simpler. Eliminating duplication in minimum wage 
rates will mean less paper work. Federal, provincial and territorial 
government activities regarding minimum wage will be 
harmonized. Both management and employees will know exactly 
what  to expect when there is an increase in a provincial or 
territorial minimum wage rate. All businesses in the same region 
will be required to pay the same minimum wage for the same kind 
of work. Records pertaining to minimum wage for all workers will 
in fact be the same.
<P>
	Since I pointed out a moment ago most employers under federal 
jurisdiction already pay wages according to the prevailing 
provincial and territorial minimums, then it is simply good 
business practice to have a minimum wage that reflects local 
market conditions.
<P>
	To consider Bill C-35 from a socioeconomic perspective, the 
increase in the minimum wage that will result from this legislation 
is in fact fair and reasonable. By giving due regard to provincial 
and territorial economic conditions the respective increases simply 
reaffirm the right of workers to be paid the same minimum wage 
for the same kind of work.
<P>
	I think hon. members will find it self-evident that an attractive 
minimum wage adds to incentives for individuals to continue to 
work or to seek employment and thus a move toward 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	Helping the private sector to create jobs is a priority of this 
government and while admittedly only a small step, harmonized 
minimum wage rates with our provincial partners is definitely a 
solid step in the right direction.
<P>
	Furthermore, hon. members can be assured that the resulting 
increases to bring the federal rate in line with respective provincial 
and territorial rates will not result in a loss of jobs or encourage 
inflation. That is I think self-evident given the small number of 
federal minimum wage earners and the fact that virtually all federal 
jurisdiction employers pay provincial minimum wage rates.
<P>
	At the same time, the Government of Canada is not relinquishing 
its fiduciary responsibility under the Canada Labour Code. Should 
a situation arise where it became necessary, the government retains 
the legislative power to regulate a federal minimum wage for the 
entire country or in fact for a specific region.
<P>
	In closing on this subject matter, I would encourage all members 
of Parliament on both sides to support Bill C-35. This amendment 
to the Canada Labour Code I believe is complementary to the 
Minister of Labour's plans to modernize Part III of the Canada 
Labour Code. It is legislation I firmly believe is well overdue. It 
will demonstrate internationally that Canada is a leader in labour 
standards among industrialized nations.
<P>
	It is this spirit of governing that I think is welcomed by the 
people of Canada. I think Canadians have realized that this 
government where it sees social and economic injustices tries to 
address them through creating a better climate for economic 
growth, expanding opportunities for Canadians. There is no 
question we made some commitments to the Canadian people three 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5903"> 5903 </A></B>
<P>
years ago almost to the day when we sought to become the 
government.
<P>
	Look at some of the issues that we have had to deal with. For 
example, Canadians asked for no personal income tax increase. 
The government delivered on that promise. They told us to be 
unlike the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney which 
missed every single deficit target it proposed in every single 
budget. The government has in large part achieved the deficit 
reduction targets. We are heading toward a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The government has reduced its spending which was part and 
parcel of its agenda for change. It has created an environment 
conducive to job creation. Over 650,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. I wish the unemployment rate would fall 
even further, particularly as it relates to the high unemployment 
that young people in our country face today. The government has 
made some steps to alleviate the problem. We have increased by 57 
per cent, for example, the amount of money and investment we 
make with Canada student loans over five years. That is a $2.5 
billion commitment by the federal government.
<P>
	The government has doubled its commitment in summer jobs for 
students, fully understanding that summer jobs represent a very 
important part of employment prospects for young people. As they 
receive a summer job and participate in a summer job these young 
people are acquiring valuable skills and also earning money 
required for them to return to school.
<P>
	Above and beyond that, some of the programs I am quite excited 
about in relation to young people are Youth Service Canada and the 
youth internship program.
<P>
	The youth internship program is tied to growth industries 
through our national sectoral council initiative where we have 
identified 33 growth areas in our economy. These areas are creating 
approximately 50,000 jobs for our youth. That speaks to the type of 
job creation required to make sure sustained economic growth 
occurs in our country.
<P>
	I do not mean to belabour the point but Canada is viewed as one 
of the top G-7 countries. We are looking toward perhaps the fastest 
growth of any of the G-7 countries. Why is that? We have been able 
to increase our exports. We have been able to provide world class 
infrastructure for our companies.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister for International Trade 
have taken it upon themselves to market Canada abroad. The 
contracts that were generated in the trade missions to China, India, 
Pakistan, Malaysia and Latin America have brought home $20 
billion of new business. Every $1 billion creates approximately 
11,000 jobs in  Canada. Mr. Speaker, you would have to admit that 
it is really helping the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The government has been able to keep its promises. It is 
reducing the deficit, which is quite important to put the fiscal house 
in order. We are expected to rank first, No. 1, in economic growth 
of the G-7 countries in 1997. Jobs have been created to the tune of 
over 650,000.
<P>
	I am sure the members of the viewing audience from my riding 
of York North want to know how all of this manifests itself at the 
local level, which is usually how government policies are gauged 
on whether they are having an impact. I am happy to say that in my 
riding the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.3 per cent. That is 
well below the national average. Over the years we have been able 
to build the type of socioeconomic infrastructure that speaks to 
three major priorities: youth, trade and technology.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We have been able to equip the riding with a type of 
infrastructure that speaks to the creation of 21st century jobs which 
will be highly skilled, highly paid and will produce the high value 
added products we will need if we want to maintain our social 
programs and the type of quality of life to which the people in my 
area and indeed across the country have grown accustomed.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has helped our local economy. In my 
riding over 1,200 jobs were created as a result of that program. The 
program works because it addresses local realities. Working with 
provincial counterparts and the municipal governments we were 
able to set the local priorities and identify what we should do to 
make sure we modernize the infrastructure of the area with the 
hope of creating a better quality of life and enhancing job creation.
<P>
	I have already touched on the issue of youth. Many programs 
initiated at the national level have found their way back to the local 
level. Whether it is summer jobs for young people, the youth 
internship program or Youth Service Canada, these programs are at 
the local level.
<P>
	We need to understand the issue of technology. The government 
and its partners have understood the importance of developing and 
enhancing a technological revolution in our country. For example, 
we are leading the rest of the world with SchoolNet. We know we 
are leading the way when all schools and libraries will be 
connected. We know we are leading the way in providing good 
service and a good infrastructure for future generations.
<P>
	I have been closely involved with the social security review. We 
have done what I think was the proper thing to do. We have 
modernized our unemployment insurance program moving toward 
an employment insurance program that is much more active and 
less passive than it was in the past. We are providing tools for our  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5904"> 5904 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed workers which they will need to re-enter the 
workforce.
<P>
	When we look at the new employment insurance program we see 
things like wage subsidies; we see skills and loan grants. Greater 
opportunities are being created in an active way to ensure that

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill, 
which raises the federal minimum wage rate, has been long awaited 
by the people concerned. The federal minimum wage rate is now $4 
an hour, compared to $7 in British Columbia, $6.85 in Ontario, and 
even $5.25 in Newfoundland.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Needless to say, this minimum wage is extremely low, and it is 
high time that this so-called modern government adjusted it.
<P>
	What is interesting is that, in adjusting the minimum wage, the 
federal government has chosen-thereby breaking with 
tradition-to align it with the minimum wage rate paid in the 
province where the employee under federal jurisdiction works.
<P>
	This is extremely interesting because it shows how, with these 
different labour markets and labour laws, when the federal 
government does not do the same thing in other areas, workers in 
the same province end up with two different labour systems.
<P>
	As a result, a Quebec worker under federal 
jurisdiction-depending on where she works-does not have the 
right to preventative withdrawal from work, even if she and her 
doctor feel that staying in the workplace might be dangerous for 
her and the foetus. The only thing she can do is ask for unpaid 
leave. Quebec law allows her to start by asking to be transferred 
elsewhere in the business, and if the employer has no job to offer 
that does not present a risk to her and the foetus, she can stay home 
and wait for the birth while receiving benefits amounting to 90 per 
cent of her gross salary.
<P>
	My point is that the central government should align itself with 
the other labour systems and conditions set out in the Canada 
Labour Code. We will see what it does after the committee tables 
its amendments to the bill and what the minister does with them. 
The time when there could be two different systems in the same 
province is over.
<P>
	I should stress that the federal government's decision to align the 
federal minimum wage for the workers affected with the minimum 
wage in the provinces deserves to be acknowledged. This is a 
historical moment.
<P>
	Why? This is the labour relations professor in me, who sees 
values in tracing things back in time. It is in fact  interesting to note 
that, in the early 1900s, the federal government took steps to 
regulate labour conditions. In 1907, the Lemieux act was passed to 
try to impose a bargaining system in enterprises that may be 
generally described as public-oriented or public sector enterprises.
<P>
	The Lemieux act was challenged. Finally, the Privy Council in 
London-it had not been patriated yet at the time, in 1925, the act 
having been passed in 1907-ruled that the provinces should have 
jurisdiction over labour relations as well as the standards and acts 
dealing with the relationship between individual workers and 
businesses within the province.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Ever since, this area has come under provincial jurisdiction, 
based on the interpretation of the Constitution given by the Privy 
Council clearly stating that it should be so.
<P>
	There was one other time in our history when the central 
government attempted to interfere in this area. It must be 
recognized that it was for a good cause, at the days when we were 
still knee deep in the depression and, in the U.S., President 
Roosevelt was just starting to pull his country out of the slump, if 
not the recession, with his new deal, establishing the right to 
organize, a minimum wage and labour standards for workers. I will 
repeat that, in order to pull his country out of the slump in 1993, the 
President of the United States of America proposed what we would 
call today regulations.
<P>
	To pull Canada out of the slump, a severe slump, with job 
creation only starting to pick up-in fact, the pre-1929 level of 
employment was not be regained and clearly exceeded until the 
war-the Bennett government also came up, in 1935, with a series 
of measures including legislation on the 48-hour work week and 
other provisions of the sort.
<P>
	Basically, as I said, they introduced regulations to ensure that 
workers get a larger share of wealth so that, in turn, they could 
spend and get the economy rolling again.
<P>
	I point this out because, as we know, the current economic talk is 
to the contrary. So, when you look at history, it is somewhat ironic 
to see that the government is trying to overcome the current crisis 
by doing exactly the opposite of what helped us put an end to the 
Great Depression.
<P>
	The fact that workers do not get the same treatment in a 
province, depending on whether they come under provincial or 
federal jurisdiction, has a negative impact.
<P>
	I make this comment because, as you know, some challenge the 
very existence of minimum wage, or want it to be the lowest 
possible. It is interesting to note that, in a business, 
competitiveness must not be based on the cost of work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5905"> 5905 </A></B>
<P>
	If we accept that the price of hydro and the cost of basic 
resources should be the same for all businesses, it only makes 
sense that the work itself should also be paid the same price, and 
that competitiveness be based on the ability to organize, to choose 
good products, to develop them, to innovate, to identify markets 
and to benefit from them. Productivity should not be based on a 
form of discrimination affecting the price paid for work.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	So, this legislation is a step in the right direction. However, there 
is an issue that remains unresolved, namely the implementation of 
federal and provincial minimum wage laws.
<P>
	One has to realize that, even if there is a minimum wage act in 
effect, pressures can be exerted on workers so that they do not ask 
to be paid this minimum wage or, if one does not want to directly 
contravene the act, one can pay minimum wages to workers and 
then demand money back under the table.
<P>
	Such practices have been reported many times. We know they 
exist. So, any pressure to help restore the balance in favour of 
workers is welcome. It is important to note that consumption plays 
a major role in the economy.
<P>
	As you know, I worked very hard to make sure that all those who 
can work are able to find jobs and to ensure that job creation is a 
concern to all. However, when well-paying jobs are not available, 
people earning minimum wages, and also UI and welfare 
recipients, help the economy, since their money goes directly into 
it.
<P>
	I will just take 30 seconds out to greet you, Mr. Speaker. Is this 
your first time in the chair, Mr. Speaker? I am talking to you. I 
believe this is your first time in the chair.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> That is why I am greeting you. You have thrown 
me off my stride slightly, but I will try to interest you, and I will 
take this opportunity to say that when members speak in a House 
with the composition of this one, it is always interesting to have the 
Speaker take an interest in our remarks, even if he does not agree 
with them. I am quite aware that it does not matter whether or not 
the Speaker agrees with what we are saying, but I feel that his 
interest is very supportive for members who rise to speak and to try 
to defend the interests of their constituents and of the public 
generally.
<P>
	That being said, I will return to what I was saying about the 
federal minimum wage bill, which will bring the wage paid 
workers in areas under federal jurisdiction into line with that paid 
in areas under provincial jurisdiction. I was saying, then, that those 
who are not in agreement with a decent minimum wage should 
remember that all those without an income, wherever they may be, 
are largely responsible for driving the economy, particularly in 
slow periods. You do not invest in Honolulu on a minimum wage. 
Your investments are limited to paying your grocery bills and 
buying the necessities of life for your children.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to draw attention to 
something that is extremely troubling. In one of the latest 
publications of the OECD, the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, of which Canada is a member, one 
of 28 members, there is a table showing the percentage of low wage 
earners in all OECD countries. Believe it or not, Canada has the 
second highest, right after the United States. This is very troubling.
<P>
	Obviously, when you realize that the minimum federal wage is 
$4, you might say it is understandable. However, I know that this 
category of minimum wage earners is so small in number that it 
could not have had an impact; nonetheless, the fact that Canada is 
the second country after the United States with regard to the 
prevalence of low wages is significant.
<P>
	But worse yet, Canada is the country were the gap between 
incomes in the first quintile and the fifth quintile is the widest. This 
means that on a income scale of five, it is in Canada that the gap is 
the widest, wider that in the United States. This is what I noticed in 
that same table. I know that the OECD compiles statistics from 
data freely provided by member countries.
<P>
	This is an extremely disturbing fact, which makes this bill even 
more necessary, even though it is only a tiny drop in the bucket.
<P>
	This is not all. The parliamentary secretary stressed how 
important the reform he called ``updating the employment 
insurance'' was. I would like to mention two things. According to a 
report published yesterday by Statistics Canada, its second job 
survey-it conducts two surveys, one by phone to compile the 
monthly statistics and a more lengthy one using employers's 
payrolls-shows that in the past year the net job loss in Ontario was 
50,000 while it was 34,000 in Quebec, this according to payroll 
data.
<P>
	This is in blatant contradiction with the government's boastful 
pat-on-the-back attitude with regard to the economic situation. The 
truth is ordinary people do not believe the recession is over, no 
matter what statistics say. The truth is there has never been such a 
wide gap among Canadians in terms of income, as shown by the 
statistics published by the OECD.
<P>
	The truth is averages often hide gaps which might be extreme, 
which brings us back to basics, namely, the situation of those in 
need. This in turn brings us back to the need for job creation.
<P>
	I will not be able to talk long about the fact that the employment 
insurance premiums now required of SMEs  which were previously 
exempted for employees working less than 15 hours are having a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5906"> 5906 </A></B>
<P>
serious impact on these businesses, as is the case in my riding and 
as my constituents told me this week.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will say that this bill is long overdue, but that it 
is only a drop in the bucket to improve the situation of ordinary 
people and promote job creation.

<P>
	I rise today to discuss Bill C-34, important agricultural 
legislation that proposes the amalgamation within the various 
sectors of agriculture marketing. As my colleagues are aware, this 
bill will combine four separate agricultural acts and one program 
into a single act.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Reform generally supports this motion in principle. However 
there needs to be some amendments in order for the act to best 
assist farmers, financial institutions and other organizations that 
are affected by the act.
<P>
	We brought some amendments to the committee. By the way, the 
bill followed the new route that you, Mr. Speaker, so heartily 
endorsed. The bill went to committee prior to second reading in the 
hope that there would be more opportunity for amendments in 
committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5907"> 5907 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the amendments were not accepted by the 
government side. We were a bit surprised. We thought perhaps 
under the new formula at least some amendments would be 
accepted but they were discarded without any due consideration. 
We really do feel badly about that because some of them were 
excellent amendments. I believe they all were, but certainly some 
of them were.
<P>
	We have put three amendments forward today. Mr. Speaker, you 
correctly ruled that the first amendment cannot be considered 
because it did not receive a royal recommendation. That is 
unfortunate because the minister and government had the 
opportunity to grant it a royal recommendation and we could have 
at least debated this amendment in the House. I do not know why 
the Liberal government is afraid to debate new ideas in this House, 
why it would use the technicality of rejecting a royal 
recommendation to get itself off the hook.
<P>
	Our first amendment would have permitted in cases of 
emergency where an emergency advance was issued on an 
agricultural commodity, that $25,000 would be included in part of 
the $50,000 interest free portion of the cash advance. The rationale 
and the thinking of the Liberals on this issue is beyond logic. Here 
we have a bill which suggests that a $50,000 interest free cash 
advance be provided to producers on the first $50,000 that they 
accept in advance and that interest be paid on subsequent amounts 
advanced, up to a maximum of $250,000.
<P>
	If there is an emergency, if there is trouble in the industry, if 
there are dire situations, when the farmer is down and out, does the 
Liberal government extend any consideration? No, it gives them a 
knock out punch. The government says if there is an emergency 
situation, $25,000 will be advanced but it will not be interest free.
<P>
	If the government allowed the $25,000 to be advanced and said: 
``You pay interest but the next $50,000 will put you on par with 
other producers who qualify for $50,000 interest free'', that would 
be fine, but the Liberals did not see it that way. They said: ``If there 
is an emergency, we will just knock the farmers a little harder. We 
will try to keep them down and we will charge them more interest 
than we will charge farmers who are not facing an emergency''. 
This is blatantly unfair.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Liberals were afraid to debate this 
issue in the House, why the minister would not permit a royal 
recommendation to my first amendment that was tabled in the 
Notice Paper. He chose not to and he will have to answer and be 
accountable to producers for his actions.
<P>
	I want to get to the second and third amendments which were 
grouped together. In a nutshell, these two amendments eliminate 
the government purchases program. This program has not been 
used for years. The last time it was used was in 1985. It has only 
been used  once or twice in the last 20 or 30 years. It is a relic. It is a 
bit like the Conservative Party; it had its day, but it is gone.
<P>
	We asked the officials why the government purchases program is 
in the new legislation, the new reorganization of cash advances. 
They said they did not know why it was there but that maybe 
sometime they would have to use it. It is the same as saying that 
maybe sometime we will have to impose the speed limits on horses 
and buggies that are in the bylaws. We may just have to use that 
sometime.
<P>
	Knowing the way government works, I am sure they need a few 
bureaucrats in charge of the government purchases program even if 
it is not being used. Therefore they will expend some money just to 
monitor the situation. Of course that will be money that cannot be 
spent in more useful areas.
<P>
	The government purchases program provides the minister with 
wide ranging authority to buy, sell or import agricultural products, 
to stabilize domestic market conditions and to conclude sales to 
other governments or government agencies.
<P>
	I have heard members from the other side worry about vertical 
integration in the agriculture sector. If members want to talk about 
vertical integration, this is it. The government can be in total 
control: buy, sell, import products. This is not a good situation. The 
federal government has no business being in a government 
purchases program for agricultural products. It is not using the 
program. It is history. It is ancient. It should not have been included 
in the bill. All it will do is provide work for a few people in the 
department when they could be better expending their energies in 
another area.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Therefore we brought forward very reasonable amendments 
which would delete this part of the bill. Those two clauses are the 
only clauses which deal with the government purchases program 
and we believe they should be deleted.
<P>
	We talked about the wide ranging power that it gives to the 
minister. It also affords zero accountability. Although there are no 
resources budgeted to this program, the government has been 
unable to adequately justify continuing it by entrenching it in the 
new legislation.
<P>
	There is some unusual terminology in it which quite frankly 
could not be defined. They could not say what unusual market 
conditions were.
<P>
	Given the technology at the end of the 20th century as we 
approach the 21st century, any attempt to justify the continuation of 
this program is shallow to say the least.
<P>
	Ten minutes is not a lot of time in which to discuss the bill. 
However, we did talk about other areas of the bill as well as the 
government purchases program and the fact that the emergency 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5908"> 5908 </A></B>
<P>
advance should be interest free. We will have an opportunity to 
debate those issues further at third reading.
<P>
	We were concerned about the fact that the minister has the power 
to increase the contingent liability. We made the argument in 
committee that if the contingent liability needs to be increased, that 
means the industry is doing well. It does not mean there is a crisis 
or an emergency; it means that producers' income is increasing. We 
felt that there should be provisions in the bill which would make 
the minister more accountable to the industry and to the House with 
respect to the contingent liability.
<P>
	We were concerned about the fact that there was some inequity 
in the bill. Not all producers and organizations were treated 
equally. It seemed the problem was the Canadian Wheat Board. It 
has a higher default level than other producer organizations and 
administrators who administer the cash advances. Because it could 
not get its act together quickly enough, it was provided with special 
provisions to account for its difficulties. That of course is to the 
detriment of other sectors within the industry. When we favour one 
group we always hurt someone else.
<P>
	The penalty for default on Canadian Wheat Board advances was, 
I believe, based at zero per cent while others were higher. The 
Canadian Wheat Board was given a two-year period to get its act 
together. I would have thought that the Canadian Wheat Board, 
being the wonderful institution that it is, would have had its act 
together more quickly and would have been administering the cash 
advances on a more prudent basis.
<P>
	I would ask the House to consider the two amendments to 
eliminate the government purchases program. We believe it is the 
prudent thing to do. This is 1996. Why are we implementing 
something that should not be used and probably will not be used? 
However, it is in this piece of legislation and it requires the 
attention of the department. It requires consideration from time to 
time simply because it is in the legislation.
<P>
	I ask the House to consider supporting the two amendments 
under consideration at the present time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair. I have watched 
over the past eight years and have seen how well you follow 
parliamentary procedure and how good you are in that area. I know 
that you will be a bonus to the House and that you will administer 
your job in an extremely good manner. Congratulations.
<P>
	The motion before us is to delete clause 31 of the agricultural 
marketing programs bill. The deletion of clause 31 in effect deletes 
part III which deals with the government purchases program. This 
part provides the authority that is currently contained in the 
Agricultural Products Board Act. The only amendment being made 
to that act is the removal of the board to administer the act.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The government purchases program gives the government the 
flexibility to deal with special purchases, but only with governor in 
council approval. Authority of this nature is not available in other 
pieces of legislation. The authority would cover the following:
<P>
	To sell Canadian grown agricultural products to other 
governments or government agencies. This authority is very 
important when making trade deals with countries that are not 
comfortable in dealing with private industry within another 
country. Such marketing opportunities will be lost without this 
flexibility. The deletion of this authority will eliminate sales made 
to central planned economies and other countries where for various 
reasons the intergovernmental sales are required. For example, in 
1990 and 1991, $16.5 million of pork was sold to the USSR under 
this act.
<P>
	To remove the surplus product from a depressed market 
generally caused by unusually large production, to be sold back 
into the market at a later date when market stability has returned. 
For example in 1993 due to unusual weather conditions a large 
surplus of juice apples were processed into apple concentrate and 
sold into a different market through this act, allowing the apple 
juice market to stabilize.
<P>
	To provide emergency food aid to countries not named under the 
Canadian International Development Act. The act was used for this 
purpose as recently as 1990-91 and again in 1991-92.
<P>
	Under the act the government cannot sell the product for a lower 
price than the purchase price plus costs, without the approval of 
governor in council. Since there is no such budget attached to this 
part of the act, ministers through GIC approval would have to 
approve any funds for this part.
<P>
	The major changes and liberalizations in international and 
domestic trade still leave a need for programs of this nature to 
facilitate international transactions and to help stabilize domestic 
markets where unusual conditions exist. Therefore it is the 
recommendation of myself and the government to defeat this 
motion.
<P>
	With regard to the motion to delete clause 36, this clause 
describes the penalties that result from failure to provide 
information under the government purchases program. For the 
proper administration of this program, it is essential that the 
government be provided with sufficient accurate information to be 
able to determine the need to use this program in any particular 
circumstance. This clause is essential to ensure the provision of 
this information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5909"> 5909 </A></B>
<P>
	Clause 36 is linked to clause 31. The arguments for keeping 
clause 31 apply equally to the retention of this clause. It is 
therefore the recommendation of the government to defeat the 
motion.
<P>
	I want to correct a point that was made by my hon. colleague 
across the way when he introduced his motion. It was on the 
emergency funding of $25,000. That emergency funding would be 
rolled into the $50,000 under the present act and would well 
support any emergency dollars, plus give the benefit that is equal 
under the act consistent to all farmers in the country. I think a very 
great misinterpretation has been given to that aspect of the act. 
Quite frankly, I am not clear why the member did that.

	The House resumed from June 20, 1996, consideration of the 
motion and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the motion submitted by my colleague, the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, should be rejected.
<P>
	However, I will not criticize it too harshly because I would not 
want to curtail the new enthusiasm of the member for the renewal 
of our federation. I would like to tell the member that, even tough I 
cannot approve the substance of the motion, I agree wholeheartedly 
with the intention behind it.
<P>
	I can easily understand why my colleague from the official 
opposition believes it is worthwhile to renew the country. I am 
happy that he would make such efforts to represent the majority of 
Quebecers who support the renewal of our federation.
<P>
	A poll conducted last March for CBC and Radio-Canada showed 
that 60 per cent of Quebecers believe that premier Bouchard should 
work hand in hand with the federal government and the other 
provinces towards renewing the federation.
<P>
	Why is it that a majority of Quebecers believe that Canada is 
worth renewing? Because, year after year, the United Nations rank 
Canada as the first country in the world as far as quality of life is 
concerned and fifth among advanced countries for per capita 
income.
<P>
	For the past 30 years, from 1960 to 1990, Canada has been 
second among the G-7 countries in the area of economic growth.
<P>
	For three years now, Canada has had the second lowest inflation 
rate among the G-7 countries. Our inflation rate is lower than those 
of France, Germany and the United States.
<P>
	Since the election of the Liberal government in 1993, the overall 
unemployment rate has decreased and at least 650,000 new jobs 
have been created.
<P>
	The GDP shows that Canada's financial situation is improving 
more rapidly than that of other G-7 countries. In 1997, Canada will 
have the lowest total deficit to GDP ratio of all the G-7 countries. It 
will be lower than the one in France, in the United States and in 
Germany.
<P>
	Canada has the reputation internationally of being a tolerant and 
open country, which makes all of us very proud. Canadians are 
recognized all over the world for their commitment toward the 
values of justice, compassion and solidarity.
<P>
	As the French Minister of Culture indicated last May: ``Canada 
is an example of successful answers to questions that are being 
asked in each of our societies''.
<P>
	However, I do not mean by that that we should be complacent, 
far from it. In response to the desire expressed by Quebecers and 
other Canadians for the renewal and modernization of the 
federation, the Government of Canada has undertaken a wide series 
of initiatives. These initiatives will ensure us that the federal 
system will operate at its full capacity, thus allowing us to face the 
future challenges with much confidence.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	We have a firm renewal plan for the country and we are on the 
right track regarding our plans.
<P>
	Within the Liberal plan for the renewal of the federation, we are 
working toward a more effective balance of roles and 
responsibilities between the federal government and the provinces. 
At the premiers' meeting last June, our initiatives were well 
received by the great majority of provincial premiers and, in some 
cases, they were approved unanimously. Provincial premiers took 
action to follow up on these initiatives during the annual 
conference of provincial premiers in Jasper.
<P>
	We proposed to transfer the responsibility of all active 
employment measures funded by the employment insurance fund 
to the provinces, which, in many cases, want a greater control over 
manpower development. This provides the provinces the 
opportunity to manage the some $2 billion that the federal 
government spends each year on employment assistance measures. 
This means that, if they so wish, the provinces will be free to 
implement their own programs in areas such as wage subsidies, job 
counselling and placement.
<P>
	Our government is also willing to withdraw from mining and 
forestry development, thus allowing the provinces to develop their 
own programs in these sectors of activity, according to their 
priorities and to local needs. We also propose to transfer the 
administrative authority over social housing to the provinces, as 
well as the $1.9 billion used to fund this sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5911"> 5911 </A></B>
<P>
	Last May, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the 
Environment, including the Quebec Minister, decided to work 
toward a detailed multilateral umbrella agreement between the 
government of Canada and the provincial ministers of the 
environment. That agreement was to ensure a healthier 
environment for Canadians. A better clarification of the roles and 
responsibilities of everyone involved would help to reduce the 
operational costs of the private sector. Lower costs for the 
companies would not only ensure better protection for our 
environment, but would also mean more money for these 
companies to create jobs.
<P>
	We are not only focusing on national issues. We are also trying to 
meet the specific needs of each and every one of the provinces.
<P>
	For instance, in the weeks following the conference of the first 
ministers, the federal government and the government of British 
Columbia signed an agreement on a very important issue for many 
residents of that province. Both governments agreed to a detailed 
bilateral review of the roles and responsibilities of the federal and 
provincial governments in the management of the Pacific salmon 
fishery. Recently, the premier of British Columbia said that 
significant progress had been made and that the Prime Minister of 
Canada was to be praised for his contribution to this issue.
<P>
	All the initiatives I mentioned stem from our willingness to build 
a much more efficient federation. However, efficiency cannot in 
itself renew our federation. A modern federation needs to be 
flexible. And I am glad to say that we have also made progress in 
that direction.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer is a good example. 
Provinces used to receive federal transfers for social assistance 
under the Canada Assistance Plan and funding for health and 
post-secondary education under Established Programs Financing. 
These programs were subject to complex rules that determined, for 
example, which expenditures were eligible to a share of public 
assistance. In summary, the whole system was quite cumbersome.
<P>
	This is why, last April, the federal government replaced these 
two different types of transfer by a block fund called the Canada 
health and social transfer.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	This fund will give more leeway to provinces in the design and 
implementation of their social programs.
<P>
	Moreover, we have made a commitment to provide stable and 
predictable financing into the next century. The new transfer will 
help provinces plan health, welfare, and post-secondary education 
in an orderly fashion.
<P>
	We are making these moves to renew the Canadian federation in 
order to meet the expectations of the vast majority of Quebecers 
and other Canadians who want their federal, provincial and local 
governments to work in a spirit of co-operation to meet the 
challenges of the next century.
<P>
	With these comments, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup on his efforts to renew our 
federation. I hope his attitude will prove contagious with his 
colleagues in the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to be here to address you in the chair this afternoon, 
sir. I am pleased to take part in the debate on Motion No. 221 put 
forward by the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	As I travel throughout my constituency and performing my 
duties as a member in other parts of the country, I am amazed at 
how distrustful and concerned people are at the way politics are 
being carried out. One of the popular topics of discussion is 
integrity. People are determined that their leaders and their 
institutions be responsive to their needs and to their wishes. 
Presently Canadians are very distrustful. There is an air of 
cynicism that I find disheartening. People put little or no faith in 
the promises of politicians or the activities of political institutions.
<P>
	Every time an election comes around so do the politicians, 
making all kinds of promises that are sure to be broken when no 
longer convenient. That is the attitude that people express. People 
want their leaders and their political institutions to represent 
themselves accurately and to be accountable to the people they 
represent.
<P>
	That is why the debate today on the Senate is such an important 
one. The Senate is a political institution that has for far too long 
neglected the needs and the interests of Canadians. It is an 
institution that is accountable to political parties, nothing else and 
no one else. That must change. Our country needs servants of the 
people, not servants of political parties.
<P>
	The solution to the Senate accountability problem is not Senate 
abolition. The solution is Senate reform. For this reason, the 
Reform Party and I cannot support Motion No. 221, although we 
understand the frustration that motivates the presentation of this 
motion.
<P>
	Before I discuss the reason Reform cannot support this motion, 
let me give a brief background, if I may, about the Senate. Every 
large nation, such as Canada, with an uneven population 
distribution, must find a way to balance and effectively represent 
the interests of both the thinly populated and the heavily populated 
regions of the country in national decision making. To meet this 
challenge, the architects of Canada chose the classic federal system 
of government, that is, they established two levels of government, 
one national and the other provincial, with a division of powers 
between the two.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5912"> 5912 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	A democratic bicameral national Parliament was also formed in 
which the composition of the lower house, the House of Commons, 
is based on representation by population. The composition of the 
upper house, the Senate, is based on representation by region. 
Legislative proposals do not become law until they are approved by 
both houses.
<P>
	The purpose of the Senate is to represent the regions of the 
country, especially those sparsely populated regions which have 
fewer seats in the House of Commons than the more heavily 
populated regions such as southern Ontario and southern Quebec. 
Therefore if the Senate were abolished there would be absolutely 
no way of safeguarding the interests of the thinly populated areas 
of the country. That is the major reason that we cannot support 
Motion No. 221.
<P>
	I know the argument will be raised that the Senate does not 
represent the interests of the regions as it now stands anyway, so let 
us just abolish the Senate. I understand that frustration. The people 
who argue this point are absolutely correct about one thing: the 
status quo is not good enough.
<P>
	The Senate exists today as an ineffective and unaccountable 
institution. It does not balance the interests of the thinly populated 
resource producing regions of the country such as the west, central 
and northern B.C., the north, Atlantic Canada, rural and northern 
Ontario and Quebec. It does not balance these areas with those 
heavily populated regions of southern Ontario and southern 
Quebec.
<P>
	There are two reasons for the Senate's ineffectiveness and lack 
of accountability. First, the Senate is undemocratic. Its members 
are appointed by the Prime Minister and it has become the 
patronage heaven for old and tired politicians and political 
fundraisers. Senators are accountable to no one except their 
political party.
<P>
	Second, the Senate is regionally unbalanced. That is, almost 50 
per cent of senators come from the already more heavily populated 
regions of the country. How with our present Senate can the thinly 
populated areas of Canada like rural British Columbia have 
balanced representation with Ontario and Quebec? It is impossible.
<P>
	We have seen over the years many examples where decisions 
have been made by Parliament that have weighed heavily in favour 
of central Canada. Last year the federal government secured 
parliamentary approval for Bill C-68 on universal gun registration 
and the distinct society clause for Quebec. In the 1980s the national 
energy program, the Meech Lake constitutional proposals, official 
languages legislation and the CF-18 decision all received 
parliamentary approval. These policies and decisions completely 
ignored 
<P>
the interests and desires of many Canadians living in the thinly 
populated regions of Canada.
<P>
	The Senate is an ineffective body. However, as I mentioned a 
moment ago, the solution to the Senate's ineffectiveness is not 
abolition. Abolishing the Senate would leave no means of 
balancing and effectively representing the interests of both the 
thinly populated and the heavily populated regions of the country 
in the national decision making process.
<P>
	Most important, however, abolition of the Senate is not what 
Canadians want. I sent out a questionnaire in my riding earlier this 
year about the Senate. I asked people whether all future senators 
should be elected before being appointed by the Prime Minister. 
Eighty-four per cent of those who responded said yes. Let me read 
some of the comments which accompanied these responses.
<P>
	A lady from Eagle Creek, British Columbia wrote: ``The Senate 
should be much more regional in its make-up''. A person from 
Clinton, British Columbia wrote: ``The Senate has been stacked 
with people used to further the agenda of the government of the 
day, which has not always been good for the country''.
<P>
	A man from Williams Lake, British Columbia wrote: ``The 
Senate has proven to be ineffective''. Another person from 
Williams Lake wrote: ``An elected Senate would mean that. The 
Senate vote would be a truer vote than the one taken by the Prime 
Minister's cronies''.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	A couple from the 106 Mile Ranch in British Columbia wrote: 
``Stop political patronage''. A man from 100 Mile House, B.C., 
wrote: ``I feel that an elected, more equal, more effective Senate 
would be a good thing''.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada has been listening to these voices 
and the voices of many other Canadians who want their political 
leaders and institutions to be more accountable, who want the 
Senate to truly represent regional interests and who want the Senate 
reformed, not abolished.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada has developed a plan to help 
Canadians. This plan is detailed in our fresh start program. It is 
called a fresh start guarantee. This guarantee will give Canadians 
the tools to ensure that politicians and political institutions will be 
accountable to the Canadian people. These tools include recall, 
freer votes, referendums and citizens' initiatives. Most important, 
our fresh start guarantee will include a commitment to achieve 
Senate reform, not Senate abolition.
<P>
	Senate reform means a triple-E Senate, a Senate that is elected 
with equal representation per province and with effective power to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5913"> 5913 </A></B>
<P>
represent regional interests. To my Liberal colleagues, the Prime 
Minister even supports the  triple-E Senate reform. He said in his 
speech to the House of Commons in 1991: ``To meet the hopes and 
dreams of those who live in the west and in the Atlantic, a reformed 
Senate is essential. It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and 
equal''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me take this occasion to say how happy I am to see you 
in your place.
<P>
	I propose that Motion No. 221, tabled by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, be rejected for a 
number of reasons. However, let me say how pleased I am that by 
proposing an amendment to this fine institution the Bloc is 
recognizing the legitimacy of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Opening up the constitutional debate at this time, even for the 
purpose of abolishing the Senate, is far removed from the concerns 
and aspirations of ordinary Canadians. Indeed it is unfortunate that 
the Bloc is ignoring the real needs of its constituents who are 
looking for jobs, who want to achieve a decent standard of living, 
who are concerned about the future of social programs and who 
want their governments to work together constructively.
<P>
	On this side of the House we firmly believe that job creation, 
economic and social development should be the top priorities of all 
elected members. They are the top priorities of Canadians.
<P>
	Since the Liberals were elected we have kept our commitment to 
work toward the creation of a climate for opportunity for 
Canadians. We have put forward tangible measures to help make 
government more efficient, renew the federation, keep the country 
united and forge new partnerships with the provinces. All 
Canadians, including Quebecers, want change. They want Canada 
to work better. They want the different orders of government to be 
more efficient and to fulfil their respective roles more effectively. 
Much of it can be done without constitutional amendment.
<P>
	Accordingly, the government has made a commitment to 
modernize the federation step by step, focusing on co-operation 
with the provinces and territories to serve Canadians better. 
Canadians have said they want to see government roles and 
responsibilities clarified, and the government has responded. We 
are withdrawing from areas of activity that are more appropriately 
the responsibility of the provinces or the private sector, forestry, 
mining development, recreation and some aspects of transport.
<P>
	In the area of labour market training the government submitted a 
proposal to the provinces in May and this enables them to takeover 
responsibility for active employment assistance measures. The 
provinces can therefore, if they wish, manage the approximately 
$1.9 billion per year the federal government currently spends on 
active employment assistance measures and implement their own 
programs such as wage subsidies, income supplements, 
self-employment assistance and private sector job creation 
partnerships, as well as many other labour services such as 
screening and job counselling.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The framework we are putting in place will provide a maximum 
flexibility for the provinces, making it possible to meet local and 
regional needs more effectively.
<P>
	At this June's first ministers meeting, new avenues for 
partnership with the provinces were explored, including initiatives 
in the fields of social housing, freshwater fish habitat and 
environmental management.
<P>
	In the area of social housing, negotiations have started with the 
provinces including Quebec on the orderly transfer of social 
housing management and the billions in grants that go with it.
<P>
	In the sector of freshwater fish habitat, the federal government 
tabled a bill in the House of Commons on October 3 to amend the 
Fisheries Act. This bill will substantially modernize and update the 
legal framework for fisheries, conservation and habitat 
management in Canada. It will allow industry, including fisher 
people, to participate directly in fisheries management through 
partnership agreements. Discussions are under way with interested 
provinces.
<P>
	With respect to the environment, the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment adopted a work plan on May 31 
which was approved by the first ministers meeting on June 20 and 
21 to strengthen co-operation and eliminate duplication while 
maintaining the highest standards. Progress was made on 
developing a framework agreement, setting out principles and 
objectives for co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments. Progress was also made on negotiating two 
subsidiary agreements on effective inspection and high 
environmental standards.
<P>
	With the Canada health and social transfer we have also ensured 
that the principles of the Canada Health Act will be respected 
throughout the country. In this way we will ensure the universality 
of health insurance and social programs in line with our 
commitments and the values that Canadians cherish.
<P>
	The government has also for the first time in history made a 
commitment to limit its spending power. We have said that we will 
no longer use that power to establish new, cost shared programs in 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of the 
majority of the provinces. Provinces which do not wish to 
participate but which nevertheless choose to implement a 
comparable program will be compensated.
<P>
	The Bloc should acknowledge that our plans for renewal are 
serious, concrete and affect the day to day realities of all Canadians 
including those it represents.
<P>

<P>
	A bill has been tabled to bring all food inspection services, 
comprising 4,500 employees, under one body. This move is yet 
another step toward working more effectively with provincial 
agencies to set up a co-operative Canada-wide food inspection 
system that will lessen the regulatory burden on the food industry.
<P>
	Discussions are continuing with those provinces interested in 
this project and in other federal-provincial joint initiatives such as 
a national revenue collection body and a national securities 
commission.
<P>
	All our initiatives will help eliminate overlap and duplication, 
thus yielding substantial savings and more efficient services for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast want their government to make 
the country work better. They want their governments to put their 
public finances in order, improve economic growth and bring about 
an economic climate conducive to job creation. In fact, I am 
surprised to see that Bloc, in tabling this motion, is out of touch 
with the concerns of the very people it represents.
<P>
	For its part, this government is already working closely with the 
provinces and all its social and economic partners to explore new 
options and find new ways to do things so as to serve Canadians 
better and respond to their immediate concerns.
<P>
	I therefore consider the motion tabled today by the hon. member 
from Rivière-du-Loup to be inappropriate. For that reason, I call on 
the House to reject it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate. But 
first, allow me to congratulate you on your election to your 
position. I know that it was arduous but, nevertheless, I think the 
majority of the members of the House have recognized your 
qualifications, and I am happy to join with my colleagues in 
wishing you every success in your new duties.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	That being said, I repeat that I am pleased to take part in this 
debate. I know this issue is of great interest to you, Mr. Speaker, 
since, together with some of my colleagues, I have already had the 
opportunity to debate with you in this House the appropriateness of 
maintaining the institution we call the other place, the Senate.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the remarks made by some colleagues 
from the Liberal Party, the hon. member for 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, whose remarks I will get back to 
later, and the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury. 
Incidentally, in the case of my hon. colleague for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury, with all due respect I have for him 
in certain circumstances, if a rule of relevance applied in these 
debates, I think you would have interrupted him very early in his 
speech to call him to order because, from what I understood of his  
remarks, except for blaming the Bloc for putting forward the 
motion that is before the House, he confined himself to masking 
the facts with regard to the reform of our institutions, the reform of 
federalism.
<P>
	He set out a series of measures that, according to him, would 
have the advantage of improving the efficectiveness of our 
federation. The reality is altogether different.
<P>
	However, I want to get back to the issue we are debating now, the 
motion put forward by my hon. colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup that, in essence, asks for the 
abolition, the end of the Senate. First I want to congratulate my 
colleague on this initiative, since, contrary to what our Liberal 
friends may suggest, it answers an often repeated wish by all our 
fellow citizens in Quebec, for sure, but also in the whole country.
<P>
	When we talk to people back in our ridings, there are tens and 
hundreds who ask us to demand that the Senate simply be 
abolished. Why? For several reasons.
<P>
	First, the Senate's provincial counterparts-everybody 
remembers the legislative councils that existed in each and every 
province with basically the same role as the Senate-the legislative 
councils were abolished one after the other in all the Canadian 
provinces. The legislative council was abolished in Quebec in the 
late 1960s.
<P>
	What happened after the legislative councils were abolished in 
the provinces? There was no revolution, at least not in Quebec. 
Nobody started fights on buses or got in a state because the 
legislative council had been abolished. On the contrary, nobody, 
maybe with the exception of the members of these legislative 
councils and their entourage, realized in the end that these 
institutions had disappeared. We can also question the usefulness 
of that institution of the Senate.
<P>
	If we were to go back to the time when the Liberal members 
were in opposition and read their speeches, we would certainly find 
that some of them shared our point of view on the usefulness or 
lack thereof of the Senate.
<P>
	In the last years, the auditor general criticized repeatedly the 
workings of the Senate. He criticized the fact that some funds go to 
the maintenance of this institution.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Last May, I rose to speak on a motion by one of my colleagues 
who criticized the use of tens of millions of dollars to this end. Year 
in and year out, the institution of the Senate has a budget of over 
$40 million.
<P>
	There are now in our society people who cannot afford to feed 
their children or clothe them for school or other activities. Every-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5915"> 5915 </A></B>
<P>
day in Montreal, in all of Quebec's and Canada's major cities and 
even in the smallest ones, we see people having to go to food 
banks, to organizations which will feed them at least a minimum. 
Everyone  acknowledges that the economic situation we are living 
in at the present time is a difficult one.
<P>
	This very morning in Quebec, as we speak, yesterday rather, 
marked the opening of a summit bringing together all those 
involved in the socio-economic sector in Quebec. They will be 
spending three days discussing how to improve the situation of all 
of our fellow citizens, particularly those who are the least well off, 
in order to find ways of getting them jobs, in order to provide them 
with quality government services. During this exercise, which is 
being held in Quebec right now, but could be held anywhere in 
Canada, efforts will also be made to find ways of doing less harm to 
the disadvantaged during the process of putting our public finances 
on a better footing.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the unemployed and people on welfare are being 
asked to tighten their belts even more so that we can have a zero 
deficit, but when these good people come home at night and watch 
television, when they watch the newscast, they will realize that, at 
the federal level, we are maintaining an institution that although 
there are some senators who are competent and have experienced, 
and are trying to do a good job for our country, nevertheless, the 
most vulnerable in our society who watch this debate will realize 
that we are maintaining an institution which the vast majority of 
the population feels is completely useless.
<P>
	So the hon. member's motion is a very important one. And when 
we in the Bloc Quebecois ask for the abolition of the Senate, we do 
not want to renew federalism, we do not want to get involved in a 
process to renew the federation, we are simply making the point 
that money are spent on this institution could be better spent 
elsewhere.
<P>
	That is what we are saying to the federal government. Instead of 
cutting payments to the most vulnerable in our society, as we have 
seen in the last three budgets of the Minister of Finance who, year 
after year, has cut unemployment insurance and transfer payments 
to the provinces for welfare, post-secondary education and health 
care, we say again to this government: clean up your act and do 
something about your own institutions.
<P>
	So the motion moved by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is a piece of advice to the 
government on how to save money, and they can do that by 
abolishing the Senate. Take this money and let it be used to help the 
people who need it most in our society. That is how we should 
understand my colleague's motion.
<P>
	If hon. members would set aside partisan considerations and go 
to their ridings and listen to their constituents, they would hear 
from them, day after day and week after week, that this motion 
makes sense. I sincerely hope that the government will take this 
into consideration before the next election.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment 
to the chair. It is a much deserved appointment and I know you will 
serve this House and the people of Canada very well.
<P>
	Canadians have mixed feelings about the Senate. There are three 
attitudes: those who feel it should be abolished; others who say no, 
it should be maintained but elected; still others who are happy with 
the status quo.
<P>
	Let me remind everyone that this House cannot simply act 
unilaterally to abolish the Senate. That would require a very 
complex series of constitutional negotiations involving the 
provinces and could only be affected through an amendment to the 
Constitution. Therefore Motion M-221, which proposes that the 
government should abolish the Senate, is not something that we can 
do and it should be rejected by the House.
<P>
	I find myself wondering how many letters the members of the 
Bloc have received from their constituents recently demanding that 
they spend their time pushing for the abolition of the Senate. Are 
the cafes on Quebec's Grande-Allée or Montreal's rue St. Laurent 
abuzz with discussions on the future of the upper Chamber? I think 
not.
<P>
	I suspect that if the members sitting opposite to me listened to 
their constituents with a little more care they would find that the 
people in their ridings are much more interested in other issues: 
economic growth, job creation, government deficits, protecting our 
social programs and medicare, and relaunching the economy of 
Montreal to name a few.
<P>
	Their constituents would be pleased to know that the Liberal 
government shares these concerns, even if their elected members in 
the official opposition have become somewhat out of touch.
<P>
	Since elected, the federal government has been getting its fiscal 
house in order. During the election in 1993 it was clear that this was 
a major concern for all Canadians. We responded.
<P>
	According to forecasts the objective for 1997-98 of reducing the 
deficit to $17 billion or 2 per cent of GDP will be met, down $25 
billion from 1993-94 when the deficit we inherited represented 6 
per cent of GDP.
<P>
	Thanks in large part to the measures taken by the federal 
government to put public finances in order, interest rates have 
dropped 17 times in the last 17 months. Lower interest rates mean 
that more benefits will be generated than any program or tax cut 
could possibly bring in. For ordinary Canadians, this means that 
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5916"> 5916 </A></B>
<P>
someone renewing a $100,000 one-year mortgage will save over 
$3,000 a year. In addition, the lower interest rates have been a big 
help to the provinces in  reaching their deficit reduction objectives. 
Between January 1995 and June 1996 the provinces saved $1.3 
billion in debt servicing charges. Quebec alone saved some $625 
million.
<P>
	The Liberal government knows that Canadians want to work. 
That is why we have been working so hard with our provincial 
partners to promote a climate favourable for job creation. Our 
efforts I am pleased to say have met with success.
<P>
	Certainly there is more to be done. We all know that. But no less 
than 650,000 new jobs have been created in the Canadian economy 
since the government took office. Unemployment is under 10 per 
cent for the first time in half a decade. These are achievements of 
which all Canadians can feel proud.
<P>
	Internationally Canada's reputation as a country with low 
inflation is beginning to attract notice. In December 1993 the 
federal government and the Bank of Canada set a target to keep 
inflation between 1 and 3 per cent through the end of 1998 and we 
are on target.
<P>
	Having a good international reputation like this is vital for 
Canada's economy and that of the provinces.
<P>
	In recent years, exports have been the main engine of the 
economic growth necessary to decrease our unemployment levels 
even further. An important part of our strategy for promoting 
exports has been our Team Canada trade missions.
<P>
	Their value is widely appreciated. It is certainly hoped that all 10 
provincial premiers this time will be accompanying Canada's 
Prime Minister and a large delegation of Canadian business people 
on the next mission to Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.
<P>
	During the missions to date, Canadian businesses have 
announced 369 business deals worth some $20 billion. 
Furthermore, Canadians have had the opportunity to see what the 
federal government, the provincial governments and the private 
sector can achieve when working in a spirit of co-operation.
<P>
	Canadians want their country to work like this. They want their 
governments to work together efficiently and effectively to respond 
to their concrete everyday needs. I hear this all the time: ``Why do 
the governments of Canada not work more effectively together?''
<P>
	With the leadership this Prime Minister and this government 
have brought to bear on this situation, that is exactly what we are 
starting to see, and it is high time.
<P>
	This motion under consideration today does not address the real, 
everyday fundamental concerns of Canadians, including those 
Canadians in Quebec, their economic concerns. It certainly does 
not address the concerns of the member's constituents. Therefore, 
with respect, I cannot support the motion.
