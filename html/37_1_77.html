message that Canada is at the forefront of the new economy and is 
an important partner for Japan in many areas was well received. 
Consultations reinforced the bond which exists between the 
Canadian parliamentarians and Diet members.  Japan is a friend 
and a valuable partner to Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honour to present, in both official languages, the fourth 
report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, entitled “A Common 
Vision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was produced by our two subcommittees on the status 
of persons with disabilities and on children and youth at risk. 
It looks at ways of focusing government resources across 
departments to meet the needs of children and the disabled.  It 
makes recommendations on how the government should work 
horizontally rather than using the usual vertical silo approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is a good example of how an all party committee can 
work.  Our subcommittees are smaller and work more informally 
than the parent committee.  It makes for more productive 
interaction between MPs, between MPS and witnesses and, as this 
is a joint report, between committees.  I congratulate all 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have the honour to present, in both official languages, 
the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities entitled 
“Access to Higher Education and Training”.  The report is a 
follow up to a series of public hearings we held on access and 
mobility with respect to training, ranging from apprenticeships 
to the professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is our last report, I would like to thank all members of 
the committee, all witnesses who appeared before the committee 
this year and, in particular, I would like to thank the staff.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present, in both official languages, the fourth report 
of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled 
“Transparency in the Information Age:  The Lobbyists 
Registration Act in the 21st Century”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee conducted a statutory review of the Lobbyists 
Registration Act and many important ideas emerged from the 
hearing.  The Internet is changing the way policy is made. 
Lobbying aims at all levels of the public service, and government 
policy making has changed a great deal in the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the witnesses and the members of the committee. 
I also want to thank our clerk, Normand Radford, our researcher, 
Geoffrey Kieley, and all the staff for their diligence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to table, in both official languages, the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and 
Technology entitled, “A Canadian Innovation Agenda for the 
Twenty-First Century”.  This report is the committee's third 
report on innovation.  Canada's recent record in acquiring 
knowledge and producing highly skilled workers has been 
impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended two general avenues of pursuit: 
ensuring that more research and development is done in Canada and 
broadening current innovation targets to include indicators of 
commercialization and diffusion of Canadian and world research 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to thank all the witnesses, all the members 
of the committee and our staff, our clerk, Normand Radford, our 
researchers, Dan Shaw and Daniel Brassard, and all the staff for 
their diligence in ensuring that we could table this report 
today.

report of the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to table this report, which is an interim one.  We 
feel it necessary to point out that the bilingual services 
provided by Air Canada are of vital importance for Canadian 
travellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has expressed the wish that, if possible, the

report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
entitled, “The Future Role of the Government in the Grain and 
Oilseeds Sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that while agriculture as a whole is 
doing well in this country, there are serious concerns in the 
grains and oilseeds sector.  With that, our committee will be 
progressing in the fall to meet with producers to look at our 
various areas of Canada and hopefully bring back to the House a 
report on that sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 81(7) and (8) I have the honour to 
present, in both official languages, the second report of the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs on 
the plans and priorities of the estimates 2001-02 of the 
Department of National Defence.  Pursuant to Standing Order 109 
the committee requests a government response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report takes advantage of recent changes in the standing 
orders which gave committees the opportunity to comment on the 
future plans and priorities of the departments under their 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked by members of the defence and veterans affairs 
committee to note that time constraints prevented us from 
commenting on the plans and priorities of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs this year.  However it is our intention next

departments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-385, an act to facilitate micro credit 
for self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this private 
member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to encourage a greater availability 
of banking and other financial services to those with low or 
unstable incomes, and to increase the availability of credit in 
small amounts, up to $5,000, for small entrepreneurial 
enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill calls for an annual report to be published by the 
Minister of Finance showing the progress in improving micro 
credit by the financial institutions that agree to participate. 
The institutions that attain a certain level of activity could 
describe themselves as being recognized by the government as 
micro credit specialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would affect directly low income people for the 
purpose of increasing their ability to generate income.  These 
small loans, made at a reasonable and commercially viable rate of 
interest, would enable them to start or expand their own 
businesses and to work their way out of poverty with dignity.

for leave to introduce Bill C-386, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (breaking and entering). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today on 
behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to reintroduce my 
private member's bill that would amend the criminal code to 
impose a two year minimum sentence for repeat offenders of break 
and enter crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Break and enter crime is not only a property offence, it is a 
crime against a person.  It is a psychologically damaging crime, 
often leaving victims feeling personally violated and 
traumatized.  It has the potential to be a violent crime because 
every break and enter is a home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a victims' amendment to the criminal code because 
the result will be fewer victims brought about by imposing a real 
deterrent on professional break and enter criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also cut out what is the real source of revenue 
for career criminals and organized crime by breaking the cycle of 
using the proceeds of break and enter crime to finance other 
criminal activities.

private member's bill, an act to amend the criminal code, bail 
for those charged with violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would prevent a person accused of sexual assault with a 
weapon, aggravated sexual assault or criminal harassment, who has 
been identified by the victim or by a witness to the offence, 
from being released on bail.  The result would be that the 
accused would not be released unless the charge was withdrawn or 
the accused was acquitted at the trial.  This would be in the 
interest of victims.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CODE OF ETHICS FOR MINISTERS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK29">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-388, an act to regulate conflict of 
interest situations for ministers and to provide for a code of 
ethics for ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to regulate 
the conduct of ministers with respect to conflicts of interest 
during the exercise of their duties and post-employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for the introduction of a code of ethics, primarily 
based on the conflict of interest and post-employment code for 
public office holders and the code of conduct for members of 
parliament of the United Kingdom, which would henceforth be part 
of Canadian legislation.  Any breach could then be the subject of 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provides for the creation of the position of ethics 
commissioner, who would report directly to the House of Commons 
and who would have the authority to conduct investigations with 
respect to the application of the code of ethics and the 
provisions of this bill.  Moreover, this is a measure which the 
Liberal Party of Canada promised to implement in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the troubling events brought to our attention in the murky 
Grand-Mère affair, in which the Prime Minister would appear to 
have placed himself in a conflict of interest situation by 
contacting the president of the Business Development Bank 
regarding a loan for the Auberge Grand-Mère, which adjoined the 
golf course in which he had apparently previously owned shares, 
it appeared important to tighten up the legislative and 
regulatory framework guaranteeing the integrity which the public 
is entitled to expect from federal cabinet members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we must do if we are to restore our fellow 
citizens' high level of trust in their political institutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ) </B>moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-389, an act to promote 
shipbuilding, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill revives a bill introduced 
earlier, which was within an hour's debate of third reading.  It 
was Bill C-213 intended to promote shipbuilding.  This bill is 
the same as the previous one, except that an election has been 
held in the meantime.  I would remind you of the three components 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it would establishe a program of loans and loan guarantees for 
shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it aims to amend the Income Tax Act to improve the tax 
treatment of lease financing, which would apply to the area of 
ships as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it would provide for a refundable tax credit for ships, 
oil platform facilities and other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I waited until the end of the session to introduce this bill in 
the hope that the Minister of Industry would act on his 
commitment to introduce measures himself.  As it appears he will 
not be doing so, I am introducing this bill as insurance.

.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 49—<B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the tragic civil conflict in Sudan: (<I>a</I>) has the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs developed a comprehensive strategy to 
engage the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Army, SPLA, in constructive peace talks; and (<I>b</I>) has 
the minister developed a plan to work with the private sector, 
NGOs and other shareholders to rewrite the Special Economic 
Measures Act, SEMA, in order to provide unambiguous guidelines 
for Canadian companies wishing to invest abroad? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> We share the hon. member's concern over 
the tragedy of the civil war in Sudan and the terrible suffering 
this has brought upon the Sudanese people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a role for Canada to play in the search of a 
peace agreement among the warring parties. The government has in 
the past offered its good offices to the government of Sudan and 
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, SPLA, and will continue 
to explore this possibility. However, the problem is less the 
absence of a neutral venue than the lack of a genuine willingness 
by either party to negotiate in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has long supported the peace process sponsored by the 
intergovernmental authority on development, IGAD, and our efforts 
continue to focus on assistance to the IGAD process as a member 
of the IGAD partners' forum, IPF. Canada agrees with the IPF 
consensus that any new initiative to accelerate a negotiated 
settlement must not undermine IGAD and its principal achievement 
to date, namely the endorsement by both parties of the only 
currently viable basis for a negotiated settlement, the IGAD 
declaration of principles. It is important to emphasize that 
Canadian action is designed to complement work already underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the press release on Canada's Sudan policy of May 23, 2001, 
it was announced that Senator Lois Wilson, Canada's special envoy 
for Sudan, will be travelling to the region. She is expected to 
meet with high ranking figures in the government of Sudan and the 
SPLA, and these discussions should provide us with a better sense 
of the opportunities that exist for engaging the two sides in 
this conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the hon. member's query concerning the Special 
Economic Measures Act, SEMA, it should be pointed out that in 
general the international experience has been that unilateral 
sanctions are largely ineffective. Canada's own experience with 
sanctions has confirmed that multilateral measures are the most 
effective course of action. To amend the SEMA to allow for 
unilateral sanctions against Canadian companies abroad would 
undermine Canada's longstanding objection to extraterritorial 
measures by other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department continues to work with the private sector, NGOs 
and other stakeholders to look beyond sanctions at ways of shaping 
Canada's corporate presence abroad, including Sudan. On several 
occasions in the past few weeks we have organized large scale 
consultations with a range of interested parties to discuss ways 
of ensuring a positive international Canadian corporate presence. 
The Government of Canada values these exchanges of views and sees 
this as part of a permanent process of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to assure hon. member that Canada remains engaged in the 
search for a durable negotiated peace settlement in Sudan and is 
pursuing options which provide the best chance for success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a 
pleasure to rise to address the motion that our party has put 
forward, which will hopefully be supported by all members in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main intent of the motion is to improve the workings of the 
House of Commons.  It is also in the best interest of all of us 
here, including the government, the opposition and therefore all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we can change the system, we will not change much else. 
That means that unless we can improve our procedures and the way 
in which we make decisions, we will not really be able to do much 
to improve the lot of most Canadians as we deal with legislation 
and issues in the House.  We need to put in place legislation and 
policies and to make changes that make parliament work for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to a book that we have regarded as the 
handbook for the orders and procedures of the House.  The first 
principle in Beauchesne's <I>Parliamentary Rules & Forms</I> 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of Canadian parliamentary law are: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect a minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny 
of a majority; to secure the transaction of public business in an 
orderly manner; to enable every Member to express opinions within 
limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary 
waste of time; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration 
of every measure, and to prevent any legislative action being 
taken upon sudden impulse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything I say today will be based on that first principle of 
parliamentary procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making this change, we would trigger meaningful debates 
across the country on various issues.  The change I am referring 
to is to amend the standing orders in order to allow all private 
members' business items to be votable if a member wishes it to be 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that one of the problems we face in Canada 
is that we, as politicians, and Canadians generally, do not 
scratch below the surface on key issues.  Many issues are often 
left unexamined and this hurts all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for democracy to work and to work well we must be well 
informed so that we can make decisions intelligently.  Many 
Canadians may not realize how important the motion is but if they 
have ever tried to bring forth an issue through their elected 
representatives, they will realize the importance of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could play a very effective role in having everyone look more 
closely at the issues that affect them greatly and yet in our 
current system they are not examined in depth.  For democracy to 
work effectively, those people making those decisions must 
understand the issues, and this change hopefully would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a bit of an historical perspective before I 
go into the arguments for this because history can really help us 
understand why these changes are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My source of information is from the Library of Parliament.  It 
is a paper that was prepared by James Robertson for the 
subcommittee on private members' business.  I cannot go into all 
the details that he provided going back to 1867, but as we look 
through the report we see that private members' business has not been static. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1867 to 1962 the standing orders gave precedence to private 
members' business on particular days in each week. However 
successive governments found such a distribution inadequate for 
the conduct of their own legislative programs and regularly gave 
precedence for their own business via special and sessional 
orders.  What this means is that private members' business used 
to dominate the business of the House of Commons, but gradually 
that has been eroded.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda in private members' business has taken second place 
to what we do.  We need to bring more prominence to that issue. 
By 1955 government business dominated the agenda of the House and 
the standing orders were brought in to protect private members' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962 the House abandoned the allocation of a certain number 
of days each session for private members' business and instead 
set aside one hour per day for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the practice of considering private members' business 
for one hour on certain days was replaced by a single private 
members' day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983, however, the House reverted to the consideration of 
private members' business for one hour per day on Monday, 
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, with no maximum amount of time on 
Mondays and Tuesdays.  The omission of this part of the former 
rule meant that the amount of time provided for private members' 
business actually increased as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the late 1950s there were two criteria which determined 
the order in which private members' business was considered: 
their date of notice and, in the case of bills, their stage in 
the legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other secondary criteria, whose purpose was to distinguish the 
different categories of business from each other, also became 
important.  For example, in 1910 a higher precedence was accorded 
to unopposed private members' notices of motions for the 
production of papers while opposed motions of this kind continued 
to be considered with other motions until 1961 when they were 
given a specific category in the order of business and were 
debated on a designated day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to portions of this report in order to show that private 
members' business has not been static.  There have been changes 
throughout our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 there was a single draw of members' names held at the 
start of each session.  In the 1970s private members' business 
was organized by the government House leader's office.  That was 
criticized by many members as undue government interference and 
eventually the private members' office was established under the 
Clerk of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are back to the same situation now because the tradition has 
become such that only bills that receive the consensus of the 
private members' business committee are deemed votable.  We again 
find it almost impossible to bring forth items for debate and a 
vote when two or three members of the committee may not wish to 
bring them forward.  It has become a great source of frustration 
for many members of parliament.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER REPORT

<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I have just been 
advised that the information commissioner's report has been 
released.  The government has an obligation to table that report 
in the House of Commons but for some reason that has not 
happened.  There has not been an opportunity to bring forward 
this very important report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the past from the information commissioner and 
his predecessor that there is what appears to be a very nefarious 
attempt by the government to become less than transparent.  To 
not bring forward this report furthers that perception amongst 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully suggest that there is an obligation on the 
government to table this report so that the House of Commons and 
members of parliament will have an opportunity to examine that 
important report before the recess. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. member has 
inadvertently stated that a little differently than how he should 
have.  I agree that any report to have been tabled by the Speaker 
should have been tabled by the Speaker, if that is the case, but 
I am in no position to confirm or deny it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the information commissioner does not work for the 
government.  If the hon. member wants to change the act and make 
that official work for the government, perhaps there would be 
some enthusiasm for that, but the information commissioner is an 
officer of parliament, not of the government.  If the Speaker 
wants to table that information, we will be glad to receive it as 
well.

<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue the review of history and 
point out that in 1985 a very significant review called the 
McGrath committee tabled its report.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House does not attach any great importance to private 
members' business as it is now organized.  This is evident from 
the fact that members are seldom greatly concerned to claim the 
priorities they have drawn in the ballot governing the use of 
private members' time, and this is largely because private 
members' bills and motions rarely come to a vote. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a key point we are raising here today.  We are asking 
that all private members' business be deemed votable if the 
private members wish.  The committee said that its proposals were 
designed to achieve a number of improvements in the way private 
members' business is dealt with.  I do not have time to go 
through them all but there have been many changes since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business has eroded significantly in 
importance.  It is time to again review what we do and improve 
the whole area.  We have evolved to the point where minority 
rights are not respected.  By establishing the custom at the 
private members' committee that there be a consensus of committee 
members before an item is deemed votable we have again ensured a 
tyranny of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the best interest of the government, the opposition and 
all Canadians that we make significant improvements to private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much discussion has taken place in recent years on the topic of 
making parliament more effective and democratic.  We began this 
parliament by saying that we must improve the way we do things in 
this place and bring back more democracy.  A lot of controversy 
has taken place of late concerning pay and benefits for 
parliamentarians.  My question is this:  Why do we not focus more 
effort on doing our jobs well?  The rest will take care of 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members know, I along with many members have had great 
concerns that we as MPs lack effectiveness in representing the 
people of Canada.  Much of that is because of the lack of 
democracy in the House and the inability of MPs to speak freely 
on issues and vote on the merits of legislation rather than along 
party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that all private members' business be votable is 
predicated on the assumption that free votes on private members' 
business will continue.  Much of the debate in the House is 
meaningless because MPs do not listen to it.  Why?  It is because 
they are not free to vote based on the arguments presented.  They 
are told how to vote.  Why listen to the pros and cons of the 
debate?  Why listen to constituents?  Why even be here?  MPs do 
not even have to make the decision.  Someone else likely makes it 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making all private members' business votable would mean that MPs 
would need to pay attention.  They would need to listen to all 
the arguments, put their brains in gear and think carefully about 
how to vote because every vote would be a free vote.  Every vote 
would be theirs and theirs alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making all private members' business votable would be a huge 
change in this place.  It would probably do more to change the 
dynamics of parliament than any other change I could contemplate, 
other than of course making all legislation a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to send a serious signal to the citizens of Canada 
that we are here to do a job and do it well to earn our salaries, 
this would be one of the best ways to start doing that.  What are 
some of the consequences I would anticipate if private members' 
business were made votable and free votes were to continue?  Of 
course the role of backbench MPs would suddenly become much more 
meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it now stands, the Prime Minister and cabinet have all the 
means at their disposal to bring forth legislation and put in 
place initiatives they wish to promote.  However Canadians have 
many concerns and issues that are never addressed because there 
is no mechanism to do so.  We generally pay very little attention 
to issues not introduced by the government because we know they 
have little or no hope of being passed.  This would change 
considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are frustrated that they cannot advance issues through 
their elected representatives.  With these changes, MPs would be 
forced to be better listeners.  We would need to listen to our 
constituents and listen to debate in parliament.  It would become 
much more obvious if an MP was not on duty and doing his or her 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change I anticipate is that MPs who bring forward a bill 
or motion would need to do a lot more work in preparing to 
introduce it.  They would need to do their homework because they 
would likely only have one opportunity to put forth the issue in 
the life of the parliament, but one opportunity is certainly 
better than none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change is that the apathy Canadians have for politics 
and for parliament would diminish. 
The cynicism so prevalent throughout the land would decline as 
they saw and heard us doing our job.  There should be a much more 
serious attitude to the processes that go into making the laws 
and rules we all must live by in this democratic society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all private members' business is made votable there would 
need to be an assurance that it would then be properly and 
effectively advanced, not swept under the table by the government 
or the Senate or in any other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to where I started, that unless we change the system 
we will not change much else.  The process is most important.  If 
we do not bring meaningful democracy to the House we will not be 
effective in making the positive and meaningful changes people 
look to us to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would need to review the workings of the change because the 
devil would be in the details.  We would need a careful 
examination of all consequential changes that would need to be 
made if the motion were passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many private members' bills and motions could realistically 
be handled in the life of a parliament?  That is one question we 
would need to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question is how the items would be selected to ensure 
that the most important issues were advanced and the rights of 
each MP were respected.  I come back to the first law in 
parliamentary procedure, that we respect the rights of all 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must examine the cost of doing this.  We must review and make 
additional changes so the change has maximum effectiveness.  By 
simply passing the motion we would open up a complete study of 
how to make private members' business and all consequential 
changes more effective.  There would be a lot of changes and we 
would need to ensure the principle was respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all MPs to have the courage to make these key changes. 
Let us be willing to work harder to ensure this place does what 
it was originally intended to do in a democracy.  Let us make it 
more relevant to the lives of all Canadians.  By making the 
change we would trigger meaningful debates across the country on 
various issues.  That needs to happen here and across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by sharing some of my personal experience with 
regard to private members' business.  Since I was first elected 
to parliament in 1993 I have had a total of four private members' 
bills and eight private members' motions selected for debate in 
the House of Commons.  That is twelve private members' bills and 
motions.  Not one has been deemed a votable item by the private 
members' business subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my one hour of debate on each bill and motion I 
introduced motions asking for unanimous consent to have them 
declared votable and sent to the standing committee for further 
study.  All my motions were refused or deemed not votable by 
members of the government on the other side of the House.  Most 
MPs in the House have not had much better luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give hon. members some statistics I compiled as I was 
preparing for the debate.  In the 35th parliament, 207 private 
members' bills and motions were drawn.  Only 77 were made 
votable.  That is 37%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 36th parliament, the parliament before the last election, 
223 private members' bills and motions were drawn.  Only 58 were 
made votable.  That is 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far in this parliament, the 37th parliament, 60 private 
members' bills and motions have been drawn.  Only 12 have been 
deemed votable.  That is 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the process is structured that percentage will decline. 
We have a distinct pattern.  Fewer and fewer private members' 
bills and motions are being deemed votable.  Since the beginning 
of this parliament we as Canadian Alliance MPs have had 24 items 
drawn and placed on the order of precedence.  Only 2 of them have 
been deemed votable.  That is 8%.  These statistics show that the 
situation is getting worse over time, not better.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that concerns me is that at the committee we have 
developed the custom that all decisions be a consensus.  We have 
determined that all bills and motions which are deemed votable, 
which are drawn in the lottery and come to committee to be deemed 
votable or not votable, should receive the support of most or all 
members of the committee.  That flies in the face of Beauchesne's 
first principle: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect a minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny of 
a majority; to secure the transaction of public business in an 
orderly manner; to enable every Member to express opinions within 
limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary 
waste of time; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration 
of every measure, and to prevent any legislative action being 
taken upon sudden impulse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must go back to that.  We must ensure that the rights of 
every MP are respected.  That is the basis of democracy.  That 
must happen.  Unless we go back to that we will be wasting our 
time in a lot of the things we do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, an MP 
or a party introduces a bill surely with the prime objective of 
improving the living conditions and environment of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As no one has a monopoly on the truth, we have debates.  The aim 
of debates is to convince the members of the merits of the 
amendments and motions presented.  The aim is also to listen to 
colleagues who have suggestions to make or who say a given clause 
or paragraph of the regulations should be changed.  There could 
be amendments that produce solid regulations that have the 
support of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree with me that debates have no meaning if we 
have expended energy, effort and time and cannot measure them by 
means of a vote.  The vote determines whether the debate was 
properly held, whether the subject matter was treated properly 
and whether we have managed to convince our colleagues of the 
merits of the amendment to regulations, of the introduction of a 
bill or of the presentation of a motion.  I agree totally with 
those who say each member should be able to introduce a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree that every debate and every amendment 
must be consolidated with a vote at the end of the debate? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is 
that if the member who introduces a bill or motion wishes 
parliament to decide on it and have a vote, the right of the 
member should be respected.  The answer is yes, unless the MP who 
introduced the bill or motion does not wish to deem it votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pick up on something else my hon. colleague raised.  It 
was a very good point.  I appreciate that he is supporting the 
motion we brought forward.  The point he raised is that debate in 
the House is designed to convince colleagues that the position a 
member takes in debate is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the motion that would override the 
principles of democracy.  It would enhance democracy because it 
would allow minorities, through their elected representatives, to 
bring forth issues they feel are important to the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House listen to debate and engage in dialogue 
they will need to decide whether an issue deserves the support of 
the majority.  That is why the motion would enhance democracy. 
It would allow all of us to make decisions on matters that a 
private member has deemed important enough to bring to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a quick question for the hon. member who did such 
a good job of introducing this idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now criteria in place that are required of a private 
member's bill in order for it to be considered votable.  I am not 
sure what the number is.  The criteria include such things as the 
bill being of national interest rather than regional interest and 
a few other things.  In the past I think all bills sent to the 
committee did meet those criteria, but for some reason they were 
still not made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member have any idea as to why a bill that meets 
the criteria presently laid out in legislation would be refused 
by the committee?  Second, if the motion today were to pass would 
he agree or disagree that there should be some criteria in place 
in order for a bill to qualify for votability? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there used to be 11 
criteria that a private member had to comply with before the bill 
would be considered votable, or at least most of those points had 
to be complied with.  Now there are only five.  The member has 
mentioned one of them, that of national interest.  Also, if it is 
on the government's agenda already it is not be deemed votable 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to his question on why a bill is not deemed votable, 
it is almost impossible for me to guess why other members on the 
committee would not allow an item to be votable or would not 
allow it to come forward.  It almost appears to me as if the 
committee has become partisan.  The committee has been divided on 
government and non-government or right wing and left wing lines. 
If a certain issue comes up that is deemed to be on the agenda of 
the other side, it is almost impossible to get that item to be 
votable.  It may be very important, but it is almost impossible 
to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague for 
Yorkton—Melville, not only for his very good presentation this 
morning but for his championing of this cause over the time he 
has been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also a member of a party that very much promotes the 
democratization of the House of Commons.  In other words, members 
of parliament are here to represent their constituents.  The job 
of private members, whether they are backbenchers on the Liberal 
side or in opposition, is to represent the constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is this:  If every private member who 
introduced a private member's motion or bill had the opportunity 
himself or herself to determine whether or not it was votable, 
would that not drive the government bonkers?  The government 
would have to deal with a whole bunch of things that the people 
out there want but the government does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we have to 
respect the ability of each member in the House to decide an 
issue.  Maybe there is a concern on the government side that they 
would not be able to control the agenda in the House of Commons. 
However, if we sincerely believe in democracy we would have faith 
in the members in this place to make the right decision.  In 
fact, we have to put more of an onus on members to make those 
decisions in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put the responsibility on MPs to listen to the debate and 
to decide on the merits of a motion or a bill or whatever 
legislation is introduced, they will begin to realize that if 
they are to do their job they have to listen to the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion 
from the official opposition asking that the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs be instructed to draft by November 
1, 2001, changes to the standing orders improving procedures for 
the consideration of private members' business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all let me thank the hon. member across the way for 
this very constructive motion, which I and my party intend to 
support.  I think it is excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I perhaps neglected to indicate so at the beginning, but I wish 
to share my time with the hon. member for Durham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of private members' business draws on a long tradition 
in the U.K. house of commons which allowed individual members to 
propose legislative initiatives to reflect their own interests 
and beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's 1993 election platform made commitments to give 
members of parliament a greater role in the development and 
debate of policy issues. In 1994 the government implemented a 
commitment for more free votes in the House of Commons by making 
every private members' business item a free vote.  I want to 
congratulate the Prime Minister for this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also supported initiatives to increase the flexibility 
of private members' business so that it can respond to the 
changing interests of members and their constituents.  The 
government has supported the view of members to continue the role 
of the subcommittee on private members' business in administering 
the draw of private members' items and determining which of these 
items should be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members know, the current arrangement allows more items 
to be debated than would be the case if all items were made 
votable.  Let me explain that.  The reason for this is that a 
votable item is in effect time allocated.  It is pre-programmed 
in the standing orders with three hours of debate at second 
reading and three additional hours that can be used in either 
report stage, third reading or a combination thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make an item votable, then, displaces five non-votable items 
because of course it takes six hours or thereabouts to get it 
through the House.  I know that is a maximum of six hours. 
Sometimes they can get by more quickly.  I understand there was a 
case like that last week where one item, which I believe involved 
Sir John A. Macdonald Day, was passed in one day.  However, I 
still think the principle generally holds true.  There is a cost 
in terms of time, then, for making all items votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion indicates that there is an interest among members 
in studying the issue further, and I agree.  We are fortunate in 
having a considerable amount of work already done on the subject. 
As a matter of fact, I want to congratulate the subcommittee and 
of course the procedure and House affairs committee for the 
surveys on these issues carried out in 1997, in 1998 and again in 
2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 survey indicated that 48% of members said all items 
should be votable and 50% said no.  However, 70% felt that the 
system could be changed or improved.  I think that is what makes 
the motion today so valuable.  The 1998 survey was updated early 
this year and the Library of Parliament reported on the results 
in May.  Now 62% of members feel that all items should be made 
votable while 37% say no, so there has been a change of opinion 
in the membership.  In other words, there is a considerable 
shift, with 10% or so more MPs saying that these items should be 
votable.  Of those who said no, some felt that more than the 
current 10 items could be made votable.  The House procedure 
committee is continuing to study this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 1, the Special Committee on the Modernization and 
Improvement of the Procedures of the House of Commons tabled its 
report. As regards private members' business, the report of the 
committee chaired by the deputy speaker of the House reads, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great many of the Members who spoke during the debates in the 
House of Commons on March 21, 2001, and May 1, 2001, addressed 
the issue of Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the suggestions that were made were that 
all items should be votable; that all 
Members should have an opportunity to propose a votable bill or 
motion during the course of a parliamentary session... 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable support has been indicated for making virtually all 
items of Private Members' Business votable, but serious concerns 
have also been voiced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also dealt with this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the modernization committee's report is 
consistent with the text of today's opposition motion in that it 
asks the House procedure committee to consider the issue of 
making more private members' items votable and to report to the 
House on this matter.  As I mentioned, the procedure committee 
would benefit from the results of the modernization committee's 
report as well as recent surveys, such as the one I have 
described, indicating that a majority of members are now 
interested in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there would be a cost to making all items votable.  It 
may be that the cost is the proper price to pay.  That is fine if 
that is the determination of course.   As I said, that is 
something worth considering as long as we are not misled in our 
collective effort by thinking that there is no price to pay.  It 
would multiply exponentially both the number of private members' 
items and the number of them that are votable, because in a way 
one could be achieved at the cost of the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to thank the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, both for putting the motion and for amending 
it yesterday in a way that makes it acceptable, hopefully, to all 
members of the House.  It is clearly a matter of interest to all 
our colleagues in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a minister now so therefore I cannot propose private 
members' items, but there was a period when I could.  I was 
usually very fortunate in that draw.  For reasons that I cannot 
understand, my name was picked often in the process.  I also have 
been very fortunate in that some of the items I proposed actually 
were adopted by the House, so I can relate to the benefits of 
some of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that there is a statue on Parliament Hill in 
honour of Lester B. Pearson.  Many years ago that statue was 
sculpted and subsequently erected on the Hill pursuant to a 
motion I offered to the House.  Perhaps in the eyes of some this 
is but a small item, but I consider the Right Hon. Lester B. 
Pearson to be a very great Canadian.  I still do.  He is a hero 
to me.  I proposed the initiative to parliament and it was 
adopted.  It is a grand day when things happen on the Hill as a 
result of issues about which we feel profoundly.  I thought that 
this was important.  Other members might think that their 
favourite criminal code amendment is important, or their 
favourite rights issue, or their favourite issue involving a 
whole variety of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to pay tribute to members of parliament who 
propose issues.  The mere fact that they generate these debates 
means that the issues come back as part of government policy 
later.  I think of a number of colleagues on this side.  I think 
of the member from Mississauga who, through petitions, private 
member's initiatives and so on, has raised the issue of fetal 
alcohol syndrome.  I think of our colleague from 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot and his initiatives on 
access to information.  Several other colleagues have raised this 
issue.  I think of the member for Kitchener Centre and her 
efforts, which have now found their way into government bills, to 
stop people from gouging consumers through the postal system and 
through 1-900 telephone lines.  I think of the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his initiatives on competition 
policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many good ideas have come from both sides of the House through 
private members' items.  Some have found their way into law. Some 
have found their way indirectly into law.  Many of them have made 
this place better with the quality of debate they have produced. 
Again I congratulate the hon. member and offer him my support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I quickly jumped to my feet to ask the hon. 
government House leader a question because it is such a rare 
opportunity.  When he says he supports the motion I wonder if he 
is saying that he and his party will be voting for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, that is the intention 
of the government.  The motion is about private members' hour but 
it is not a private member's motion.  It is a supply motion so I 
can indicate clearly the government's position thereon, which is 
to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it is a subject that we addressed in our 
modernization committee.  I am sure all hon. members have read 
the report of the modernization committee and will know that we 
addressed many issues.  We had to report by June 1 but we could 
not complete it as a result of work being done by the 
subcommittee and others and so on.  We have addressed the issue. 
We welcome the opportunity.  We encourage the committee to 
continue working on the initiative to make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something was said by the proposer of the motion today which 
disturbed me a bit.  He sees a tendency to make less items 
votable.  That is very unfortunate.  I am sure it is accurate. 
That he has raised it, I am sure it is true, but it is 
unfortunate that I have not noticed that trend.  If that trend is 
occurring as we are now told it is, I believe that to be very 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we made the rule to have a maximum of 10 items votable, 
certainly none of us at the time ever envisioned that the number 
would be progressively decreasing.  That was not the purpose.  It 
was meant to identify a critical mass of items that would be made 
votable to ensure that there was a healthy mix.  I suppose the 
five party system we have now with the subcommittee operating on 
consensus with majority opposition and minority government 
membership is a rather strange construct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this is the opportunity to raise it.  Whatever the 
committee recommends, it must find ways to ensure that if not all 
items are votable, should that be the conclusion, the reduction 
in votable items should be arrested forthwith and the trend 
should be reversed toward making it what it used to be, at the 
very least, what I call the critical mass of votable items. 
Anyway, I do not want to give the conclusions of what the 
committee will do because it will report however it wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am concerned by the statistics given to us by the hon. 
member for Yorkton—Melville earlier this day.  I do not think it 
is healthy if those numbers are decreasing, particularly at the 
pace which he identified. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation for the 
hon. House leader's support of the motion and the government's 
expression of support for it.  I do know from my work in this 
place that there has been a lot of support for making more 
private members' items votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about cost.  I know there would likely be 
a cost to making more items of private members' business votable 
because we would need more time.  I am not sure when time would 
become available, but would there be support on the other side 
for making more time available in a week?  Would there be support 
for having the resources of the House of Commons made available 
to have more time for debate?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back in history, there was a lot more time given to 
private members' business.  As we moved away from that there has 
been a kind of apathy developing among members and Canadians 
generally.  Would more time be made available for this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is pretty hard to give 
a conclusion to that debate at the moment.  Having heard what we 
heard earlier, unfortunately the difficulty is that we are not 
even using all the votable time available to us now.  Getting 
into a debate on how much we need to increase it is rather 
academic because we are not doing that which we should be doing 
at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, it is a little early to arrive at that kind of 
conclusion.  I am looking forward to the report of that committee 
and to working in co-operation with the committee.  I am sure I 
will be doing so along with other House leaders when the time 
comes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
enter the debate on the excellent motion of the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville.  I share the frustration of many members of 
the House in dealing with private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed in the 35th parliament my own private member's bill 
actually made it not only through first reading but also through 
second reading and was referred to a committee of the House. Then 
we adjourned for an election.  After that I tried to reintroduce 
it and it was deemed non-votable.  It seemed like a ridiculous 
procedure to me, so I certainly look forward to changing some of 
the rules that deal with private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From listening to the debate I have a couple of questions.  The 
hon. member mentioned that in a sense there would not be a lot of 
rigorous machinery to make a bill votable.  It seems there are 
two issues involved in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who will be the judge of all this, but what 
happens if a bill is totally ludicrous?  In other words, we are 
all responsible for the House and for the image that the House 
portrays to Canadians.  If bills that were totally ludicrous or 
totally unacceptable to the general public were made votable in 
the House, it would reflect poorly on the institution of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand we now have a rigorous procedure to go through as 
to whether it qualifies as a private member's bill.  The hon. 
member seems to be talking about loosening up on that kind of 
jurisdiction, allowing almost all bills proposed by one member in 
one term to be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concern about that.  I am not sitting in judgment of 
other members' bills.  Every member who brings a bill forward 
certainly thinks that the bill has a great deal of merit, but I 
wonder on a collective basis whether we need to focus on some 
kind of filtration system, maybe not one that is overly onerous 
but one that exists just the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second issue I want to question.  I visited 
Westminster, the mother of all parliaments, in London. I 
discovered that a system has evolved there with private members' 
bills such that lobbyists or private interest groups, often 
commercial private interest groups, whether the pharmaceutical 
industry or whatever the case may be, have discovered that a way 
to promote their cause has been to select a private member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the private member is recompensed 
economically, but it would appear that is true.  The private 
member then becomes an advocate of the particular policy because 
it is very difficult to influence general government policy. All 
members of parliament are allowed to have votable private 
members' bills before the house.  For instance, if companies were 
trying to get their pharmaceutical processes approved in Great 
Britain, they may well choose a private member who would put 
forward a bill promoting their philosophies.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that what we are talking about today would lead 
to that kind of process.  I know members of parliament want to 
feel that they are important, but it could be that they are 
attached to private interest groups that possibly have other 
agendas.  In that case it would actually do the reverse of some 
of the things the member is talking about.  It would not actually 
enhance the democracy of the institution.  It may go in the 
opposite direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that all the time in the United States where private 
sector groups do what they can to influence congressmen and 
senators to bring forward legislation which is of interest to 
them in particular.  It is a lot easier to influence one person 
than a whole government.  If those agendas can be brought to the 
House of Commons and therefore to the polity and to the media, it 
is a great avenue to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would concern me that if we moved too much in this direction 
abuse could exist.  I am sure what the member is suggesting 
is that we study how we can make it work.  The House leader was 
talking about private members' bills that are looked upon as 
great successes.  I know the Prime Minister is often quoted as 
talking about his private member's bill to change the name of 
TransCanada Airlines to Air Canada.  I know all members of the 
House at various times have been involved in the private member 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, if we go back in time in the country, private 
members' bills were more common.  It seems that as the 
parliamentary system matured we moved more toward government 
bills taking the onus of the day than private members' bills.  To 
some extent the member is attempting to enhance the role of 
individual members of parliament.  I applaud that process.  We 
have to move toward more democratization of the House.  We have 
to improve the rights and responsibilities of members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say responsibilities because quite often it is easy to hide 
behind a party platform and not take responsibility for the 
thought process.  Lifting that veil comes with a cost to 
individual members who have to think out the process of their 
individual private members' bills.  Ideally they will have to 
confront the public with them and justify them.  I certainly see 
where the move toward a greater use of private members' bills is 
a good and positive move for the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has a monopoly on good ideas.  Sometimes we all think, 
whether we are the opposition or the government, we have a 
monopoly on good ideas, but there are a lot of good ideas in the 
country.  This process would open up that concept, allow more 
good ideas to come to the floor of the House of Commons and allow 
us the opportunity to debate them.  The member certainly has 
brought forward a compelling argument to proceed with greater 
democratization of the House.  I look forward to that debate 
going forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess another aspect is that there is a cost to people who 
want to put multiple bills before the House.  We can point to a 
number of members who have 30, 40 or 50 bills before the House. 
Obviously they will be at a significant disadvantage because only 
one of their bills will be votable.  There may be a cost benefit 
relationship there.  I do not know.  I suppose they put forward 
that many bills so that they could promote various causes.  They 
will have to find other ways to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members decline putting forward private members' bills 
because of the whole concept that they will not be made votable. 
They put much work and effort into the process only to 
discover that it is not votable.  It would be great if each 
member during the term of a parliament would have the right to 
put forward one votable private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly applaud the member for bringing the motion forward 
and look forward to supporting it.

hon. member made.  I would like to pick up on something that he 
said, and that is no one has a monopoly on good ideas in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has asked some very key questions and I do not want to 
pretend to have all the answers.  That is why we are having this 
debate and that is why a committee will likely have to deal with 
everything that members bring forward as a solution to the 
dilemma we find ourselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the concerns he raised are very legitimate.  If a bill is 
ludicrous and it is deemed votable, will that reflect on the 
institution of parliament?  It may but it will also reflect on 
the member who brings it forward.  His constituents, the people 
of Canada, will I think render a judgment on an abuse of this 
provision to make all private members' business votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of machinery would be put in place to examine private 
members' business?  The devil is in the details.  I said that in 
my speech.  We will probably have to have some kind of a system, 
and I do not know what it will be, to examine issues that come 
before the House so that there is not an abuse of the system.  I 
would welcome suggestions.  I do not have a monopoly on all the 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern for the abuse of the system is a legitimate concern. 
We have swung so far in one direction in having very little 
votable, that if we swing maybe all the way the other way, some 
other problems will develop.  We have to try to foresee that and 
prevent that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of 
co-operation, I think we are all trying to find answers to the 
same questions.  I raised some of the ones that occurred to me 
because of my experience in other places.  I am sure there are 
ways to resolve them.  That is our great benefit, that we can 
study what has gone on in other jurisdictions and hopefully can 
cull the bad parts of those practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our listeners, whom I could describe as 
uninitiated, one of the problems I have noticed here in the House 
is that sometimes, when we deal with rather obscure technical 
details, we have a tendency to address our speeches to each 
other, as parliamentarians, and forget that we are above all 
democratically elected representatives of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons that parliament agreed to cameras in the 
House of Commons and in certain committees was to ensure that the 
public, those acting as watchdogs over the work of their elected 
officials, could take in the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we should begin by explaining the process as it now 
stands, what this opposition motion is all about, and what could 
be changed, so as to help the public better understand the 
changes we might suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, a member from either the government or the opposition 
side may introduce a motion or a private member's bill, as 
opposed to a government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member, whether he is a Liberal member, as he is in this case, 
or a member from one of the other four opposition parties, may 
introduce a bill on any topic he wishes, subject, of course, to 
certain criteria, which I do not have time to go into here. 
Any member may introduce a motion or a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there are 301 members and the time allowed for 
consideration of these motions and private members' bills is 
quite limited, parliament has instituted a draw procedure so that 
all members have an opportunity to introduce a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly understood that in 2001 we could debate at 
length this draw procedure.  The names of members who want to 
table motions or bills at first reading are in a container, a 
sort of urn, or hat—well, not exactly—a sort of container 
from which the bills are literally drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, I have been thinking about a way to improve this 
procedure of the draw, because it might well be considered 
archaic, from another era.  Sometimes we like our old symbols 
here in Canada.  Sometimes they are holdovers from the monarchy 
or of the British system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best proof of that is the continued existence of the Senate 
here.  We still have a Governor General, and lieutenant governors 
in the provinces.  This is the product of a monarchy of another 
era, but at any rate we have not time here to go on at length 
on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came up with the system I consider archaic.  However, I 
cannot suggest anything better or more transparent or fairer than 
the draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the name of a member is selected, following the draw, the 
member may want his bill to be voted on.  There are members, 
though, who say when their name is drawn “I really do not care 
that much if my bill is voted on. I am happy to be drawn, to have 
my name drawn, but I only want to have an hour's debate on the 
issue, just to draw the attention of the House and of public 
opinion to it”.  That is the member's choice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that it is rare for an MP to decide that even if 
his or her name gets picked in the lottery his or her bill does 
not need to be voted on.  The bulk of members whose names are 
picked come before the subcommittee on private members' business 
where they have to plead their case, no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subcommittee is made up of representatives of all parties. 
I can say, as a member, it is not seen as a partisan committee. 
The same party divisions are not felt there as in the others, be 
they on environment, transport or Canadian heritage. One is not 
aware of the same partisanship, the same party lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each member of the subcommittee on private members' business 
listens attentively to the case being made by colleagues who have 
been selected, so that at the end of the process when all those 
whose names have been selected have been heard they can reach a 
consensus on which bill can be made votable and which not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill falls into the non-votable category, there is one 
hour's debate on it and then it dies at the end of the hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is deemed to be votable by the subcommittee on 
private members' business, then there are three hours of debate 
on second reading.  These three are not consecutive.  There is 
one hour on one day, a second on another, and the third later on. 
Once there have been three hours of debate, a division follows. 
That is, in a nutshell, the current procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the opposition motion suggests is, of course, that we 
should arrange things so that once all bills have been in the 
lottery and the subcommittee on private members' business 
procedure has been carried out—one of the rare committees, as I 
have already said, that is non-partisan and holds informed and 
consensual discussions—all bills should then be votable. 
However, if we want all items selected following a draw to be 
votable, we must basically eliminate the procedure involving the 
private members' business subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a major objection. Some of my caucus colleagues 
might have preferred the status quo, but we realize that there 
could be some improvement. All private members' business 
would become votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must devise a formula so that interested members can 
always have their turn. Neither the Prime Minister nor the 
ministers introduce private members' bills. If we eliminate these 
30 some people, it leaves 271 other members, not all of whom 
introduce bills or motions under private members' business. 
Technically, there is a considerable number of them and this is 
why the opposition motion provides that we should find a 
functional formula, a workable proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I will now make suggestions to improve things. As 
member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, 
I have a suggestion to make on behalf of my party, but we will 
also discuss other possibilities. Among the realistic and 
feasible suggestions to deal with this issue, there is one that 
is of particular interest to me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could set aside one day for private members' business, even 
if this means extending sitting hours on other days or beginning 
earlier on other days. On Mondays we start at 11 a.m.; on 
Tuesdays we begin at 10 a.m.; on Wednesdays, because of the 
caucus meetings, it may be difficult to start before 2 p.m.; on 
Thursdays and Fridays, the House begin its proceedings at 10 a.m. 
Since we would have one day of debates on private members' 
business and the government would in effect lose one day to 
discuss its own bills, it would certainly be possible to make up 
for the hours lost on that day during the rest of the week by 
beginning earlier or finishing later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would see Friday as the day for private members' business, 
motions and votable bills.  Fridays have become a bit of a joke. 
Those following the debates on Fridays can see that most of our 
questions are addressed to empty benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that on Fridays, 17, 18 or 19 of the 24, 27 or 28—I am 
not sure of the exact number—members of cabinet are missing on 
average; we can provide the statistics if members wish.  Answers 
to our questions are given by parliamentary secretaries who are 
absolutely, totally and completely ignorant about the issues our 
questions address.  I do not necessarily wish to imply that these 
parliamentary secretaries are themselves ignorant, but they are 
not familiar with the issues, with the result that Oral Question 
Period on Fridays, as any journalist following the business of 
the House can testify, is a farce, a circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, most members return to their ridings on Thursdays. 
Canada is a big country, and members are returning to the Yukon, 
Labrador, British Columbia and Newfoundland.  I do not have a 
problem with this but, as a democratic institution, are we 
effective on Fridays?  Unless I am dreaming, unless I am not on 
the same planet as my colleagues, is Friday a model of 
parliamentary efficiency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have been a member for quite a long time.  You 
know the answer, but I know you cannot reply to my question. 
In your innermost being, you are telling yourself that the member 
for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take the bull by the horns and improve how things are 
done on Fridays. 
If Fridays were kept for private members' business, there would 
be ample time, even if it meant changing sitting times, to 
accommodate more members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not drawn up any mathematical model or virtual timetable 
of what I am proposing.  It will be up to us, to our clerks, and 
those connected with the business of parliament to suggest how 
this should be done.  I personally would like to see the matter 
of Friday's sittings seriously re-examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader might come back with “Yes, but on 
Fridays we have time set aside for government orders.  How could 
that be handled?”  As I have said, we could start earlier or 
finish later the other days, so that at the end of the process 
the government would still have the same number of hours weekly. 
This is a non-partisan proposal, a realistic and practicable 
proposal I am making. The government might find this to its 
liking and would ensure that it was not deprived of its time for 
debating the bills it introduces in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The private members' business subcommittee did a survey.  My 
colleague from Yorkton—Melville is well aware that a majority of 
members recognize that there should be a new approach.  These 
colleagues recognize that this matter could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the results of the survey have not yet been officially tabled 
in the House, I do not want to discuss the results further.  I 
want to preserve the confidentiality of the work of the private 
members' business subcommittee.  I do not think I would run afoul 
of its confidentiality by saying that the feeling is largely 
shared by all of our colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What changes should be made?  What should the new approach be? 
It will be up to us to develop it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that a piece of business from a private member 
is foremost the expression of the member's deep values.  When a 
member is elected, in a way it amounts to telling him to take our 
words to the House.  A member is there as well to express the 
wishes of his riding, and he must not forget this role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this process, I introduced a bill that would 
enable mechanics to have the cost of their tools deducted from 
their taxes.  Unfortunately, 91 Liberal members changed their 
opinion on this.  Before the election, there was one attitude, 
after it, another.  It had been debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the bill was not passed.  I was lucky enough to 
have my name drawn. A colleague may come along with an 
interesting idea—no one has a monopoly on interesting ideas in 
this House—and could have it debated if the procedure were 
changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to voice my support 
for the member's suggestion that Fridays should be dedicated to 
private members' hour.  In fact, if the members so chose, I think 
the hours of sitting on Friday could be extended.  If the members 
want to debate private members' business they should not be 
confined to 8 hours.  They could do it for 10 hours or 12 hours 
so long as they wanted to carry on a discussion of private 
members' business.  I think that would be a very progressive 
thing to do and might take some of the pressure off making all 
private members' bills votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member opposite a very specific 
question, knowing that he has extensive knowledge of private 
members' business and the history of private members' business in 
the last couple of parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to have a 100 signature rule that enabled private 
members' bills to bypass the lottery.  What it meant basically is 
that if a member could get all party support or the support of 
three parties in the House then a private member's bill would 
bypass the lottery and go directly onto the order of precedence. 
It did not work.   We know it did not work.  There is a variety 
of reasons why it did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wonder what the member thinks about a situation 
whereby if all bills are votable, rather than requiring the 
lottery only to determine whether these bills actually come 
forward, perhaps in this case the 100 signature rule might work 
in fast tracking bills of exceptional value to the House onto the 
order of precedence.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by saying that I 
have no problem with the number of hours we sit on Fridays being 
increased, with the House beginning at 8 a.m. on Fridays or 
sitting for 12 hours in order to consider private members' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member has introduced a bill, it is in his interest to be 
there when it is debated.  If he is told that his bill will be 
called the following Friday at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m., the member 
will arrange to be there.  When we know the time in advance, we 
can adjust our schedules.  This could be one solution to 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it strange that the member raises the issue of the 100 
signatures. The private members' business subcommittee tabled a 
report recommending that the 100 signature rule be eliminated, 
and this was adopted by the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems we had came up as a result of one of his bills.  He 
is the very one who brought all this to a head.  Certain members 
said that their free and informed consent to the wording of a 
bill had been altered by amendments introduced by the member, 
with the result that the consent implied by the 100 signatures no 
longer necessarily obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the member is bringing up the matter of the 
100 signatures, because he is directly responsible. He can try 
to claim responsibility for the fact that everyone in the House 
wanted to drop this procedure, but it is not necessarily to his 
credit and I am not necessarily complimenting him. 
I personally would be trying to have the whole thing forgotten 
rather than drawing attention to myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could perhaps discuss using the 100 signatures to replace the 
draw.  We know that sometimes the 100 signatures resulted in 
bargaining.  Sometimes members were uncomfortable because it was 
for a fellow committee member and there was the issue of fair 
play after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are adversaries—I am not saying the fight is 
fixed; we know that our political opinions differ—we are still 
able to respect one another.  We ask for the respect of members 
whose opinions differ and we give them our respect in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes this made us uncomfortable:  “So and so is a member 
of my committee and I cannot turn him down”.  I can tell the 
member that it would be studied.  I do not know if that is the 
solution. As I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, perhaps 
the draw, although not perfect, is still the best way of 
deciding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member supported the idea that Fridays could be dedicated to 
dealing with private members' business.  That is probably a very 
good suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member support more time being allocated to 
private members' business if all bills were deemed votable?  If 
we had one hour Monday to Thursday and six hours on Friday we 
would actually double the time that would be allocated to private

evening, the hon. member were to take a fresh second look at the 
speech I just gave, he will see that it might be an excellent 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, my focus or deep motivation will be to improve the 
effectiveness of Friday sittings and to see that six, seven or 
eight hours are set aside on Fridays, because it has now become 
ridiculous to sit here on Fridays. We are totally inefficient. I 
have no problems with setting aside other hours during the week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by telling the hon. member that this is indeed 
an issue that transcends party lines. It has nothing to do with 
being a sovereignist, a federalist, a member of the green, blue 
or red party, or a right or left wing militant, not at all. We 
are here first and foremost to represent the people. We were 
democratically elected by our constituents and I take for granted 
that everyone here wants to further the interests of his or her 
constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
go back to the question, not the one which was just answered, but 
the previous one, and say that as a new member of this House I 
think it is important that a mechanism be put in place to ensure 
that all bills that may be debated really be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement to collect 100 signatures could result in 
something tantamount to lobbying, because one has to know as many 
members as possible to get signatures. If this were the case, a 
new member would prefer a draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased by the motion of the Canadian Alliance, 
because it would benefit all members equally, regardless of the 
number of signatures collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member: Does he endorse these comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond: </B>Mr. Speaker, indeed it had escaped my 
mind, but we had 45 new colleagues from all parties join us after the 
November 27, 2000 election.  My colleague from Châteauguay, who 
proudly and very effectively represents the people of 
Châteauguay, was one of these new members.  As a result, as a new 
member he may not necessarily share the ties we have forged with 
colleagues from all parties since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, the 100 signatures, is a kind of blackmail, a kind of 
begging, and I believe we ought to revert to the luck of the 
draw.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it seems appropriate, given that we are debating a motion which 
has as one of its goals a workable proposal for allowing all 
items to be votable, to remember that at one point in this place 
no private members' business was automatically votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that with particular significance given the fact that the 
Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa and the member 
for Burnaby—Douglas are in the House, and I am on my feet, and 
all three of us are the only surviving members of the class of 
1979.  When we arrived in this place, private members' business 
routinely came up for only an hour, was talked out and could only 
be brought to a vote then and there if there was unanimous 
consent. 
Generally that involved some kind of skulduggery on the part of 
people who were in the House at the time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the few occasions that things were passed with unanimous 
consent, they were certainly never voted on.  They were only done 
if they were unanimously agreed to, and that was an 
unsatisfactory procedure.  I say this for newer members of the 
House because perhaps it has been so long since that was the case 
that they no longer see the system that we now have as an 
improvement because what we have today has been the case since 
1986.  Fifteen years is a long time of doing things a particular 
way and we have found that it does not satisfy all members. 
There has been a recurring debate about the wisdom or even the 
possibility of all private members' business becoming votable 
items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP feel we can support the motion and intend to 
support it because we think it would be a worthy task for the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to come up with 
a workable proposal.  I register my skepticism about whether or 
not this can be done because it would seem to me that one of the 
things a workable proposal would involve, and this would be my 
concern with respect to making all private members' business 
votable, would be some kind of mechanism whereby the House would 
not be forced to divide on matters that would seem to be 
frivolous or not worthy of the consideration of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The McGrath committee in 1985 recommended the procedure we have 
now.  It was thought to be an achievement just to get six out of 
twenty items to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the other perspective behind that was that 
there needed to be some kind of filtering or discerning mechanism 
to make sure that what came before the House for lengthier debate 
and ultimately for a decision was worthy of that kind of 
attention.  Any kind of workable proposal would have to give the 
House, either by special committee, by negotiation or by some way 
that is not clear to me at this point, a way to make a 
discernment as to what should come before the House for lengthier 
debate and for a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the committee well in trying to do this.  We are 
certainly not against the idea because this is something we have 
all been working on.  It was part of the raison d'être behind the 
100 signature mechanism, which I was skeptical about at the 
beginning and which ultimately did not work for a variety of 
reasons.  Like a lot of reforms around here, they do not always 
work out exactly the way they are intended.  They have unforeseen 
consequences, and that was the case with that reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there has been a will, off and on, to try to come up 
with a better system than the one we now have.  I am not standing 
here today to say that the system we have is perfect, but I am 
somewhat skeptical as to whether or not we can come up with a 
better imperfect system than the one we have.  We shall see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the idea suggested earlier by a Bloc 
spokesperson, if I understood him correctly, about devoting 
Fridays to private members' business, the member thought that 
Fridays were not exactly a highlight of the parliamentary week.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he thinks the Fridays we now have are not the highlight of 
the parliamentary week, my fear for Fridays that would be used to 
deal only with private members' business is that they would make 
the Fridays we now have look exciting and well attended.  We have 
to be somewhat more realistic about the number of members who 
would stay in town so they could catch a private member's debate 
on Friday morning or Friday afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I am wrong about this but one of the things we need to do, 
which would be much better to do and to some extent we do it 
already, is to embed private members' business in the ongoing 
routine business of the House so that people are here and so that 
it happens in a context where members are available and do not 
have to make a special effort for private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is too bad in a sense.  One would think, given a lot of the 
rhetoric about private members' business from many members and 
from all sides of the House, that people would be rushing in here 
to deal with private members' business.  However anyone who has 
ever come to private members' hour knows that it is not 
necessarily the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on record my own reservations.  I am not 
necessarily speaking for my colleagues on this when it comes to 
the Friday analysis because it is not something we have taken a 
position on, so to speak.  I am not sure that the notion of 
devoting Fridays to private members' business would work as well 
as some people think it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the rhetoric that applies to developing a better private 
members' business model sometimes comes in the context of a 
larger argument for giving members of parliament more power as 
individuals.  That is where we really have to look in terms of 
enhancing the role of individual members of parliament, both 
individually and collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with regret that the modernization committee report which 
may be debated later today or tomorrow unfortunately did not 
really do that.  It did not change the balance of power in this 
place so that members on committees, for instance, both 
individually and collectively, would have more power over the 
government and the cabinet and would have more independence. 
Those are the kinds of things that are all critical to empowering 
the private member, to empowering the individual member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the McGrath committee made its recommendations on private 
members' business, the recommendations with which we have lived 
for the last 15 years, it made them in conjunction with another 
set of recommendations having to do with committees that have not 
been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have taken the full spirit of McGrath and implemented 
it so that it was not just in terms of private members' business 
but also in terms of committees.  Taking parliamentary 
secretaries or government coaches off the committees and keeping 
them off; giving members on committees, particularly government 
backbenchers, more independence from their whips so that they 
could not be removed at a moment's notice if all of a sudden they 
developed an independent thinking capacity or came to be critical 
of a bill or to see its inadequacies in a way that the government 
did not like; and changing the rules so that these people could 
not be yanked and replaced with others would go a long way toward 
giving individual members more power to do the kind of job that 
Canadians expect them to do when they come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any point in belabouring the debate.  We are in 
favour of the motion.  We hope the committee will be able to come 
up with a workable proposal.  Of course we will do our part when 
the committee is engaged in that task.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I just wanted to make an observation 
pertinent to the 100 signature commentary.  I think we all agree 
that it does not work. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I observed that one of the flaws in making all bills votable 
would mean there would be 264 MPs who would have the potential of 
having a votable bill before the House.  The problem with that is 
the reality is that the number of MPs who are actually active in 
private members' business and who have been activists is 
comparatively small.  If we suddenly say everyone can take part 
and have a votable item, we will have a lot of people coming 
forward with bills that perhaps have not been thought out 
carefully or they are just doing it because they have an 
opportunity to do it and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member that regardless of the 100 
signature rule, whether it works or not, surely in this context 
we need some sort of fast tracking mechanism, some sort of 
screening mechanism that will make sure that the House debates 
bills that are indeed worthy of the House's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member perhaps have a comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the member is 
trying to make a similar point to the one I was making.  Whether 
or not it should be exactly as he describes it is another matter, 
but I think we both agree on the fact that we want to see the 
House debate things that either a representative group of the 
House or the House itself in some way has decided is worthy of 
the House's attention.  It seems to me that that should be a 
guiding principle of whatever process we come up with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to express my 
appreciation to my NDP colleague for support of this motion.  I 
agree that we must change the balance of power and empower 
individual members.  He made that statement, and I could not 
agree more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He expressed a concern that the House may be forced to divide on 
matters that were frivolous and that we should have some kind of 
a mechanism whereby we would prevent those kinds of bills or 
motions coming forward.  My response to that would be that I 
would rather rely on the common sense of MPs in this place to 
decide whether something is frivolous or not rather than put in 
place a mechanism that could be used by others to control issues 
that come forward here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member: Why are we here?  Is it not to make 
decisions that matter to Canadians, that Canadians deem to be 
important?  Is it not incumbent on us to thoroughly examine and 
debate issues that are important enough to be brought forward? 
Should we allow government or certain parties to block certain 
issues from coming forward?  If we put a mechanism like that in 
place, would it not then be abused? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really cannot think of any examples of frivolous matters. 
Maybe the member would like to suggest that, but I would fear 
some kind of a mechanism that could be used to prevent issues 
from coming forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a legitimate 
debate here between people who want to err in favour of 
protecting the institution of parliament from being perceived as 
a place where things are considered and voted upon that really 
are not worthy of the place, and people who would err on the side 
of the individual rights of members of parliament to cause the 
House, not just to debate but to have to vote on anything that 
tickles their fancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, what if the member for Calgary West wanted to put 
forward a private member's motion that the honorary citizenship 
of Nelson Mandela once it is achieved be taken away?  It seems to 
me that this is something that a committee or whatever process we 
might set up should have the ability to rule out and should have 
the ability to say that is a frivolous matter and it is not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may have some opportunity in procedure to bring it up 
for debate, and that would be regrettable enough, but to cause 
the House to automatically have to vote on certain things that 
would bring the law into disrepute and there are also certain things 
that would bring the House into disrepute, I wonder whether or 
not we should have some kind of mechanism for that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I understand the dangers.  I understand the worry but 
that is what we have in terms of the subcommittee.  Although the 
subcommittee is like some courts, it does not have to issue an 
opinion as to why it chooses some things or not, which is good, 
because if it did then we would have all kinds of debate about 
the opinions of the subcommittee as to whether or not it was 
justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the system we have actually works not too bad in that 
respect, partly because the subcommittee does not have to give 
reasons.  We are not then embroiled in a continuous debate about 
the appropriateness of its reasoning on these matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to be able to rise in perhaps this next to last debate 
of this session of parliament, and to do so on a supply motion of 
the Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the motion itself, I will speak to that.  I agree with a 
lot of what is in the motion, and certainly the party I represent 
will be supporting it for any number of reasons.  I will get into 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I should mention is that I had hoped that the 
final supply day of the Alliance Party could have put a 
topic on the floor of the Chamber that was a bit more 
pertinent to the issues of the day.  I can think of any number. 
Perhaps Bill C-15 could have been one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sat in this Chamber and talked about the Minister of 
Justice not being prepared to split a justice bill, which I think 
each and every member of the House could accept, with respect to 
Internet pornography and stalking legislation.  It simply would 
be a matter of splitting off what I consider to be two areas of 
Bill C-15 which have no business being in the omnibus bill.  They 
are the issues of gun control and cruelty to animals, which are 
very specifically pertinent to me because I am a member who 
represents a rural riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That issue could well have been debated.  In fact, the 
government of the day could have been taken to task for not doing 
something that it should have done in order to get the 
legislation through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue of which the member is very cognizant, and he 
certainly is a member who is prepared to have a lot of political 
capital expended on it, is gun control.  We perhaps should have 
had the opportunity to have a debate on the floor of the House 
today, as it pertains to Bill C-15 as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that has not put a budget together for the 
House for almost a year and a half.  It will be two years before 
we have a budget.  That is a very important issue which we should 
be talking about today before we break for the summer.  However, 
what we are talking about is private members' business, which is 
important, but not as I understand it of the most prevalent 
importance as we head into the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say now that I will be splitting my time 
with my colleague, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He can take that particular 
concept from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding private members' business, I sit on the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and also on the 
private members' business committee, so I perhaps have 
some knowledge of which I speak.  That may be corrected under 
questions and comments I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue, as the learned member from the NDP knows, the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona who has been here since then, since 1979. 
We know there is an evolution with respect to private members' 
business.  We know that ultimately there will be refinements and 
changes to a system.  We as a society change over the years.  We 
as a House change over the years.  We as members of the House 
representing our own respective constituencies change over the 
years and require and demand more ability to stand in the House 
and speak on issues that are very important and prevalent to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about 1979 and referred to newer 
members in the House and not older members.  Obviously since 1979 
he would have to refer to himself as an older member. 
However, I have a lot of respect for the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  Being here for that length of time, he 
knows how difficult it is to move this House and governments of 
any guise, whether they be Liberal or Conservative, to make the 
necessary changes within the procedures of House affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who specifically believes unequivocally that all 
private members' business should be votable.  I can speak to some 
experience as recent as last week when I put forward a bill to 
the House which had been diligently worked on over the last 
number of months.  I felt very strongly about the bill because it 
specifically impacted my constituents.  It dealt with safety nets 
for agriculture because I felt it was very important that we come 
to some resolution on that issue.  I put forward a bill which in 
my opinion would have taken us in that direction.  Lo and behold 
the bill was deemed not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members from the Alliance Party and 
the New Democratic Party, and I spoke in favour of that piece of 
legislation.  Unfortunately, it was limited to one hour of 
debate, was not votable and died when I gave my final five 
minutes of comments.  That piece of legislation will no longer 
have a chance to go through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of my own personal experience but every member sitting 
in the House has had the same experience and can say the same 
thing.  They believe very strongly that with their particular 
issue it is important to have the vehicle, not only to debate in 
the House but also to give everybody the opportunity to stand on 
his or her feet and say yea or nay to that particular piece of 
legislation.  I would love to see the committee work toward that 
end, and we are.  The motion by the member for Yorkton—Melville 
would also assist us to work toward that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in committee we discussed suggestions to change the 
current model to allow all bills to be votable.  There was some 
difficulty trying to massage this through the necessary model and 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it was suggested that 264 members of the House 
could have a private member's bill that was votable.  What is the 
model?  Does each member of the House get one votable bill per 
parliament?  Perhaps.  This would mean there would be 66 per year 
depending on when the Prime Minister called an election.  That 
figure of 66 was based on an average of four years, but it could 
be three and a half or two and a half years.  We do not know. 
However we will use the average of four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey was conducted and it was found that not all members 
wanted to have a votable bill or motion.  Some did not wish to go 
through the process or they wished, for their own reasons, not to 
have that particular tool.  That is their decision to make. 
Nobody should be forced to have a votable motion or bill. 
However, in my opinion, those who wish to have a votable item 
should have the ability to have at least one that is votable 
throughout a parliament.  That can be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also suggested that there should be some criteria 
available to stop what others may consider to be frivolous.  What 
one person deems frivolous, another person may well deem very 
serious.  Criteria have to be established.  Currently within the 
guise of private members' business there are some criteria already 
established, but they have to be changed and massaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a fairly reasonable start to say that if a bill 
proposed by member <I>x</I> conformed to the list of criteria, 
then it should go forward as a private member's bill, votable 
within a parliament.  If for some reason a committee felt that it 
did not conform to that criteria, there could be an appeal 
process built into the system.  The appeal process could be to a 
non-partisan, all party committee.  It could be an appeal process 
from the Speaker or an appeal process from House leaders.  Maybe 
that would be the vehicle to use to make sure that the bill 
conformed to what we considered to be the criteria.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what I am saying is that anything is possible.  I think 
we all agree that members should have the right to have their 
bills voted on.  We all agree that there should be a move in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we have before us today says that the report should 
be tabled before parliament by November 2001, and I will add 
please.  The committee is working toward that.  The timeline may 
well be a bit limited.  As the member for Yorkton—Melville well 
knows, the wheels of this place move somewhat slowly.  Perhaps we 
will have a break this summer, perhaps not.  We may sit until 
August, who knows.  If that is the case, we can keep the 
committee going.  If not, the committee will break.  Only coming 
back in September does not leave a long time to have this report 
tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say the member is right and the motion is right. 
We will support it going forward.  Hopefully an evolution of this 
Chamber, this House, ultimately will come up with a solution 
whereby all members will be happy.  By the way, that solution may 
last for only a short period of time because not all members are 
happy with everything that is done.  We may well have to look at 
adjustments in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to thank my hon. colleague for that.  I assure him 
that I listened to every word he said.  He and I are veterans of 
the private members' process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville for bringing this forward today.  I think we 
are having a very good debate.  I would like to make a couple of 
comments and then ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, having experienced serve time, I guess, on the procedure 
and House affairs subcommittee on private members' business, I 
know that none of the members would want to leave the impression 
that the decision on whether a bill is votable is a partisan 
decision, because it is one of the few committees that does not 
have a Liberal majority.  It has one member from each party, a 
chair who does not vote and it operates on consensus.  I can say 
from my experience that given the job we were assigned to do,  I 
thought it worked quite well.  It was a case where the decision 
on whether an item was votable or not was a decision that was 
truly made by our peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point here I think some members might have been 
misinformed in some of the debate on private members' business, 
leaving the impression that this was a committee where the 
Liberals had the majority and the iron hand of the whip was 
dictating what was done.  That simply was not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue comes back to what the NDP House leader was talking 
about.  It comes down to a numbers game.  If we do not expand the 
hours for private members' business, and we do the math, we see 
that we need to have some kind of filter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first sat on that committee we had about 12 criteria, 
which were known to members, and members' bills were vetted. When 
members went to the Table for assistance in the drawing up of 
their bills, they followed those criteria.  When we changed those 
criteria from 12 down to 4, thinking that we were making the 
process more open, I think we threw the train off the rails.  I 
think that it then became a subjective process as opposed to an 
objective process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to support the motion, but I will be on the receiving 
end of this in the procedure and House affairs committee and I 
think what we need is an expanded set of criteria.  I think 
everything that meets those criteria should be votable, but we 
have to introduce some filters or the whole thing will break 
down, even with the best of intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in the hon. member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
absolutely correct.  In fact I have with me a copy of the list of 
criteria that were originally used.  There were 11 criteria, by 
the way, and they were very detailed.  I was listening to every 
word the hon. member said.  That comes from a committee meeting, 
Madam Speaker, and it is kind of an inside issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to follow 11 criteria.  That has been changed to five, 
whereby it does allow us certainly an ability to deal with those 
private members' bills and motions that come forward and perhaps 
do not fit or are perhaps, as the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona said, a little frivolous.  I think we can 
deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the private members' business itself, the member is 
correct:  where it is non-partisan it is dealt with by consensus. 
The problem is that we must choose a number from a number, like 
10 out of 30.  Every time I sat at that table and we chose the 
ten, the six, the five or the three that we had to plug the holes 
with, every member sat around that table and said “They are all 
worthy and I wish we could pick all of them”.  We could not 
because we only had three or four or five holes to fill and that 
was all we could choose, but they were all worthy.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are all worthy then let them be debated and let them be 
voted on.  That is what we are here for and that is what we are 
trying to achieve.  It is not simply that there are three, four 
or five holes to fill.  That should not be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have consensus within the private members' business 
committee itself as well within the procedure and House affairs 
committee.  Now we must try to work out the model itself so that 
it can be workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
express my appreciation to the PCs for supporting making all 
private members' business votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was raised as to why the Alliance did not put a 
more significant motion forward, such as Bill C-15.  The member 
should realize that we have been addressing the Bill C-15 issue 
every day in question period.  As to his suggestion that I should 
have brought forth the gun control issue as it relates to Bill 
C-15, the PC member misses the point of this debate, that is, 
unless we change the system we will be able to do very little to 
change what happens in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in opposition have been frustrated by the government's 
ability to block our initiatives.  We could debate Bill C-15 all 
day.  We could bring all our concerns forward.  It would probably 
have little effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However because of the change we are proposing today, if we have 
concerns we can bring them forward.  That is the whole point of 
this debate.  If we have concerns about certain bills we have 
very few mechanisms to address them, unless we change the way we 
do things.  That is what we are proposing here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I as well am pleased, as my predecessor the member 
for Brandon—Souris indicated, to take part in the debate.  I 
commend the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville for bringing 
forward this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the greatest respect for the work he does both in the 
House and in the committee, but I must echo some of the remarks 
of my colleague from the Conservative Party.  There is an issue 
that would have been very timely and that is the issue of Bill 
C-15.  I fully acknowledge what the hon. member has said, that 
this matter has been brought forward, not only by his party but 
by the Conservatives and perhaps by other parties as well.  We 
would very much have liked to see that piece of legislation 
enacted, legislation that is so important to Canadians and that 
would have such a profound effect on the law enforcement 
community in terms of bolstering its ability to combat 
pornography on the Internet, to combat stalking of children on 
the Internet, to bring in legislation to protect police officers 
from those who act violently towards them to try to disarm them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this legislation and more is packed together in the form 
of an omnibus bill.  For those who are not familiar with that 
term, it means broad legislation that brings together a number of 
different elements, albeit under the criminal code.  Some parties 
in the House, including the party of the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville, take great umbrage at and have great 
difficulty with the fact that cruelty to animals provisions and 
firearms provisions are included in some of the changes proposed 
by Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that this type of legislation in and of 
itself does not have to be examined.  The cruelty provisions in 
particular are such that we in the Conservative Party and others 
would like to see them examined.  That is why those provisions 
should be given greater scrutiny at the committee.  They should 
be severed out along with the firearms legislation, which has no 
connection whatsoever to stalking on the Internet or the 
perpetration of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill in its current form is difficult to accept from the 
opposition's perspective, because we may be vehemently opposed to 
certain elements of it and yet it is presented in such a way that 
if we do not take all of the legislation part and parcel, if we 
were to vote against it, we would be in the terrible position of 
voting against 90% of what we believe in because of the 10% we 
have difficulty with.  It is akin to going to a yard sale, seeing 
a box of items and wanting to buy 90% of those items.  There are 
a number of items that we do not want to have anything to do with 
and yet we are told to take it all or take nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are suggesting, and have suggested adamantly, is to 
simply sever part of that bill, to sever out part of that 
legislation, and we can completely pass the bill. 
We could pass the bill without delay.  It would go on to the 
Senate and could come into being before we recess.  Why are we in 
such a hurry to leave?  Some legislation we can pass very 
quickly.  MPs' pay is an example.  We can put that through post 
haste without any delays, yet this important legislation that 
would impact on peoples' lives is going to languish on the order 
paper over the summer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This supply day motion is on an important issue that is 
receiving attention in a number of committees, not only in the 
procedure and House affairs committee.  We had an opportunity to 
review this exact issue at a recent special committee that was 
chaired by the Deputy Speaker of the House.  This committee has 
been meeting over the past number of months and has now tabled a 
report which will be the subject of a debate in the House at some 
point in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the clock is running again and the government is 
champing at the bit to shut down the House of Commons.  In fact 
there was a motion moved today by the House leader for the 
government.  What that motion does, Madam Speaker, as you know, 
is essentially limit any real examination or any real opportunity 
on the part of the opposition to stand up and vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  I know the hon. member is not relevant, 
but the point is that again an opportunity has been stripped away 
from the opposition by the actions of the government House leader 
in saying that there will be but a single vote, that the 
government by way of a procedural manoeuvre will not allow 
members of the House of Commons to stand up and express on behalf 
of their constituents whether they support the government's 
spending.  The way in which this occurs is that essentially we 
will be passing $160 billion plus of spending on behalf of the 
Canadian people without the opportunity to stand up and vote 
individually on those various departmental expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unprecedented.  It is unacceptable.  It is undemocratic. 
However it is very much in keeping with the government's arrogant 
attitude toward Canadians and toward the House of Commons.  We 
have repeatedly seen the government stripping away the abilities 
that the hon. member seeks to point out in terms of private 
members' business, in terms of debate, in terms of votes.  We see 
it time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is another hon. member present here who is 
concerned about the transparency of government.  We have heard 
very recently about the information commissioner and his concerns 
that the public's access to information in the country is in fact 
being severely curtailed.  The ability to get at information 
through access to information has been limited.  We are being 
told that there will be more information deemed off limits, there 
will be lengthy delays when those requests are made and there 
will be fees attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current information commissioner and his predecessor as well 
expressed themselves in a very open way at a forum initiated by 
an hon. member opposite, the hon. member for 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, who has taken an 
extraordinary step as a backbench member of the government and 
initiated the opportunity to review the access to information 
procedures.  He is being told by John Reid and others that the 
government is in fact doing a great deal.  In fact the headline 
reads quite clearly:  “Liberal leadership to blame for weakness 
of access” to information.  We are being told quite clearly that 
the information law and the access will be weakened, that the 
“privacy watchdog predicts more limits, higher fees and longer 
waits” when it comes to this type of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this very much impacts on the rights and privileges of 
members on behalf of their constituents.  It impacts very 
directly on the functioning of this place, these hallowed halls, 
on our ability to do our jobs on behalf of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, it affects Canadians.  It affects the ability of 
Canadians to have faith in this institution and to have faith in 
the importance and the relevance of what it is that parliament is 
supposed to do.  In the bigger picture and in the grander scheme 
of things this is what I think we should all be concerned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most direct indication that public faith is waning and 
failing in the country is the last election, when there were 
record low turnouts.  Those low turnouts speak volumes as to what 
Canadians hold dear.  Unfortunately it is not our parliamentary 
system right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there is concern among members of our party and 
others that we engage in a debate on private members' business. 
It is an important part of the puzzle when it comes to improving 
the ability of members of parliament to do important work on 
behalf of their constituents, bring forward independent ideas, 
draft legislation and have it voted upon.  In relative terms that 
is the way the stamp of approval is placed on initiatives from 
both the opposition and government benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen continual resistance to these types of initiatives. 
We have seen continual attempts to strip away the powers and 
ability of the opposition to express itself through the Chamber 
and various other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We speak quite duplicitously about modernization and new ways in 
which members of parliament can be empowered and made more 
relevant.  The real truth or the real upshot is that we are 
seeing efforts by the government to strip those powers away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite may cackle and laugh because they are 
sitting pretty.  They know that if they vote in line with the 
government and follow instructions from the PMO they will be 
happy.  They will rush home with their pay pocketed, and away 
they will go back to their constituents to be quiet.  That is 
very much what the government wants.  It wants silence from the 
backbench and a muzzling of the opposition.  That is what this is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  What about silence now?  Sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  The hon. member who is yapping now 
knows nothing about silence.  He could not be further from it. It 
is unfortunate that we will not have an opportunity to debate 
these important pieces of legislation before the House recesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been the preference of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to bring Bill C-15 forward, split it, pass it 
through the Chamber and put it into law before the House 
recesses.  If we had an opportunity to discuss issues of health, 
taxation and all sorts of other issues that impact on the private 
sector we would be far— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I did allow a lot of 
leeway in terms of the content of the member's speech.  It is not 
up to the Chair to censor what is said by the member, but points 
of order are welcome. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is merely a question, not a point of order.  When I look at 
the reform of private members' business it strikes me that we run 
a risk if we start tweaking one place and have unintended 
consequences in others.  Does the hon. member not think it would 
be worthwhile in terms of the process of reform to address the 
issue of committees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a system that is functioning at a high level, a lot of the 
frustration people are expressing about private members' business 
could probably be addressed at the committee.  However for a 
variety of reasons, and these are not reasons or rules that we 
invented, the process seems to be that opposition amendments at 
committee do not generally see the light of day.  They therefore 
turn up in one form or another in private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think it would be worthwhile to address 
the issue, role, function and structure of committees and then 
pick up what is left in private members' business?  I feel we are 
trying to solve two problems at once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member opposite.  He makes an extremely good point. 
Committee work is perhaps the most useful and productive because 
it is often done away from the glare of cameras and in a more 
non-partisan and productive fashion.  However the member has hit 
upon a number of elements of the committee that are most 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reasoned, logical amendments are often brought forward by 
opposition members but the committee structure is controlled very 
much by the government.  This is not particular to this 
parliament.  It has happened in previous administrations as well. 
Parliamentary secretaries sit on the committees.  The chairs are 
hand picked by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the committee process becomes a microcosm or mini 
version of what takes place in the House.  Amendments, even those 
which would improve a bill immensely, are turned down.  They are 
voted down blindly because the whip comes down at committee in 
the same way as it does in the House of Commons.

for that.  It was the Progressive Conservative Party which, after 
having followed the instructions of the McGrath committee to take 
parliamentary secretaries off committee, put them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize the error of our ways and admit that we do not 
have clean hands.  However if there is now a willingness to 
change and improve the committee structure, we should by all 
means do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing the point forward.  It is 
an important issue in the greater context of how to improve the 
functioning of the parliamentary system.  The committee system is 
absolutely critical to any type of reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to once again rise in the Chamber to 
speak to the issue of parliamentary reform.  I will be splitting 
my time with the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam, a riding whose name is sometimes tough to get one's 
tongue around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be 
instructed to draft, and report to this House no later than 
November 1, 2001, changes to the Standing Orders improving 
procedures for the consideration of Private Members' Business, 
including a workable proposal allowing for all items to be 
votable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we all take a serious look at what we are 
attempting to accomplish here.  I particularly appeal to 
backbenchers of all parties.  The constituents of their electoral 
districts equally elected all 301 members of the House of Commons 
but only a select few are ever really provided the opportunity to 
enact legislation for the benefit of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers bring forth legislation from time to time.  It all 
gets passed as there is little substantial opportunity for 
members to influence the government to accept suggestions or 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Backbenchers must overcome private members' business rules when 
attempting to advance legislation of importance to themselves or 
their constituents.  To be successful they must have their names 
drawn in a lottery and then be able to convince the subcommittee 
in charge of private members' initiatives that the proposal 
should be deemed a votable item.  A member's bill or motion is 
then given three hours of debate and voted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand the limitations of time in this place to 
debate private members' initiatives.  Everyone with private 
members' business on the order paper has an equal chance to be 
drawn for debate, and that is just fine.  Over the past few years 
I have been successful a few times in winning the lottery, so to 
speak, which is the way we refer to it around here.  I have no 
problem with the system up to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a footnote I should point out that I had a bill deemed 
votable and passed by this place at second reading.  I got the 
bill to third reading in the last parliament but it died when the 
election was called.  I had to start the whole process again 
when we returned for this parliament.  There is some good news in 
that the substance of my bill in its entirety was incorporated 
into the recently passed Bill C-7.  However I have also had bills 
deemed non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill incorporated into Bill C-7 was the only time my name 
was drawn in the lottery in the entire 36th parliament, in spite 
of the fact that I had private members' business on the order 
paper about 99% of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After first being elected it took me a few days to get bills 
drafted and on to the notice paper.  I also fully appreciate that 
well over 200 backbenchers are in competition for the lottery. 
This goes to show how difficult it is to get one's name drawn. 
Mine was drawn once in over three years.  Some of my colleagues 
have told me that they have never been drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting drawn is just a small part of the battle.  It seems 
almost as difficult to subsequently get one's motion or bill 
deemed votable.  I have appeared three times before the 
subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.  Each time I made a very similar case on the merits of 
deeming my bill votable.  In each case my legislation met all the 
criteria to be considered votable according to House rules.  I do 
not know why the subcommittee approved one bill and disapproved 
the other two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not second guess the subcommittee.  It must be difficult 
for members to decide on the basis of a five to fifteen minute 
examination with the presenting member of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect that most, if not all, private members' initiatives 
meet all the qualifications for being votable.  Otherwise, why 
would members even try? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I will not question or second guess the subcommittee, I 
will point out some of the problems or questions that arise from 
a process that does little to enhance House procedure and 
reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the subcommittee has recently not been taking full 
advantage of its powers to declare motions and bills votable.  At 
times the full complement of items is not deemed votable.  The 
subcommittee can deem up to 10 items votable but seems to seldom 
go that far.  It apparently keeps some space in reserve but that 
does little to encourage members who are arguing for votability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to wonder about that when my legislation was unsuccessful. 
Why was my bill unsuccessful when there were vacancies on the 
votable list?  Does the committee determine votability on the 
basis of party affiliation or favouritism toward certain members 
of the House?  I am not saying it does but the question must be 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the subcommittee playing politics with private members' 
business?  We all know this whole place reeks of politics, so 
that too is a fair question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' initiatives can cover a multitude of issues, 
almost everything under the sun.  I often wonder how committee 
members can be up to speed on all issues of environment, finance, 
justice, health, technology or what have you.  How can members of 
the subcommittee know the importance or relevance of all 
initiatives presented to them on the basis of only a five minute 
presentation by the sponsoring member and the opportunity to ask 
a few questions?  How can they weigh the benefits of one 
presentation over another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament may be very capable individuals but I 
wonder whether we are expecting the unreasonable when we task 
them to decide on so many disparate issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions, concerns and others, I should imagine, raise 
the question of why we do not make all items votable that are 
selected through the lottery process.  Private members' business 
is the one avenue whereby all backbenchers can bring forth 
legislation of importance to their constituents and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we allow games to be played to obstruct private members 
from successfully pursuing the process?  If my experience is any 
example, I was provided three hours to convince this place of the 
importance of changing the young offenders' legislation.  As I 
said, I was successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another case I was provided only one hour to convince this 
place of the importance of changing the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act.  I do not know if I was successful 
because my proposal was deemed non-votable.  The House did not 
get the opportunity to deal with the matter.  Recently some 
collateral matters of that private members' bill have been 
receiving a great deal of public attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may all be criticized before long for sleeping at our posts 
because the subcommittee has spoken for all of us on one issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my other case I suggested that those who commit multiple 
motor vehicle thefts should face more serious consequences.  I 
specifically attempted to attack what is becoming more and more 
an organized crime activity.  Once again the subcommittee 
deprived this place of the chance to consider the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now briefly respond to skeptics who may think I am trying 
to mislead or entrap others into agreeing with my arguments. 
Deeming all items votable would not end the matter.  This place 
would still have the opportunity to vote on each and every issue. 
For various reasons we all support or oppose private members' 
proposals.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If we are forced 
to make difficult decisions that is good as well.  If we are to 
be paid at the level of senior executives we should expect to be 
forced to earn our keep, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When decisions concern what is best for the citizens of the 
country rather than what is best politically, they become much 
easier and simpler to justify.  It is that type of choice we 
should be considering with this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, the motion we are debating today merely proposes that 
the issue be sent to committee for further review.  We are not 
making the final determination today.  We are sending the matter 
on for more detailed and reasoned analysis.  It is in the 
interest of all members of parliament to improve our rules so our 
work may be more beneficial to citizens.  That is, after all, why 
we are here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected in November of last year, so this is my

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a conservative person and conservatives by nature are 
cynical people.  I subscribe to what George Will calls the “Ohio 
in 1895 Theory of History”, so named because in Ohio in 1895 
there were precisely two cars in the entire state and one day 
they collided.  That is a true fact.   Therefore, as a 
conservative, I am temperamentally inclined to worry and believe 
the worst.  However I must say that I have not been disappointed 
with private members' business. I was quite excited when my first 
private member's motion was drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are campaigning during an election we think people will 
want to talk about the big issues and the ideological divide 
between parties.  However, when we get to the doorstep and 
actually talk to people face to face, we realize that the issues 
they are most concerned with are the bread and butter issues, 
such as how much money they have in their pockets and whether 
they will be protected when they go to the park with their kids 
in the evening.  These are the core issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency one of those issues was leaky condos.  I 
drafted a private member's bill, put it in the pool and it was 
drawn and brought to the House.  I was very disappointed when I 
discovered it was deemed non-votable, as were the vast majority 
of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a broader issue here.  At the beginning of all 
political philosophy there is a stark question that is asked:  Who 
shall rule?   There are three basic answers, the first being, a 
few or many.  In a liberal representative democracy, the answer 
to that question is that the many shall rule but they shall do so 
through the few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the greatest single essay on representative politics, 
<I>Federalist No. 10</I>, James Madison said that representation, 
the delegation of decision making to a small number of citizens 
elected by the rest, is supposed to define and enlarge the public 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Harvey Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard 
University says, “the function of representation is to add 
reason to popular will”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, our delicate task is to listen to the 
wants and needs of our constituents.  Then it is to deliberate 
over the longings and desires of our constituents and decide how 
to advance those views as effectively as possible while acting in 
concert with our campaign commitments, party principles and 
priorities, and our private consciences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we have arrived at the point where we are prepared to act, 
members of parliament, other than party leaders and cabinet 
ministers, have very few legislative tools at their disposal. One 
legislative mechanism that we do have is the ability to draft 
private members' bills and motions which may be drawn by lottery 
to be brought to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our current parliamentary mode, because our institutions are 
so out of date, because of our warped view of what is supposed to 
be competitive federalism and because it is so disorganized, 
private members' business for members of parliament is a key 
element for citizens to feel that their representatives can 
represent their interests, or, if they represent their own 
personal interests they can be held accountable at the next 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from the prerogative of advancing the two different 
forms of federalism that can be represented by members of 
parliament in the House.  One paradigm is the Edmund Burke model, 
which is to say that members of parliament come to Ottawa to pass 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second view is that members of parliament come to Ottawa to 
be bugles for their constituents back home.  It is a very 
different paradigm and I want to refresh the House on that 
difference. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 3, 1774, Edmund Burke delivered a thank-you speech 
to some people who, upon hearing it, may have wished they had not 
done what he was thanking them for.  They had just elected him to 
Parliament.  His speech was to the voters of the bustling 
commercial city of Bristol.  After felicitously expressing his 
gratitude, he proceeded to, as it were, step back and put some 
distance between himself and those who had embraced him.  He 
said, “I am sorry I cannot conclude without saying a word on a 
topic” then on many minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told them that he rejected the popular theory that a 
representative should feel bound by “instructions” issued by 
his constituents concerning how he should vote in Parliament. 
This doctrine, he said, is incompatible with the duty of a 
representative...a representative should “live in the strictest 
union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved 
communication with his constituents”.  But all he was saying was 
that a representative should hear, understand and empathize with 
his constituents.  “Their wishes ought to have great weight with 
him; their opinions high respect; their business unremitted 
attention.”  But, he said, a representative does not owe 
obedience.  He owes something more than his “industry”.  He 
owes his “judgment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And not just his judgment about how best to achieve what his 
constituents say they want.  No, a representative is duty-bound 
to exercise his judgment about ends as well as means.  His job is 
not just to help constituents get what they want; he also is 
supposed to help them want what they ought to want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Burke was taking issue with something that had been said to 
Bristol voters by another man they had just elected, a man more 
pliable to them.  Burke noted, “My worthy colleague says his 
will ought to be subservient to yours.”  Burke tried to soften 
the blow of his disagreement by saying that if government were a 
mere matter of willfulness, an endless clash of wills, then 
“yours, without question, ought to be superior.”  “But 
government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment, 
and not of inclination; and what sort of reason is that in which 
the determination precedes the discussion, in which one set of 
men deliberate and another decide, and where those who form the 
conclusion are perhaps three hundred miles distant from those who 
hear the arguments?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were, he said, sending him to a capital, but not a foreign 
capital.  He was going to Parliament, not to “a <I>congress</I> 
of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which 
interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against 
other agents and advocates.”  He should not be guided by merely 
“local purposes” or “local prejudices.”  “Parliament,” he 
said, “is a <I>deliberative</I> assembly.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of parliament come to the House with the view that 
they are here to deliberate, act and pass judgment on what they 
think is in the best interest of the whole country and of their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an alternative view, a more popular representative 
view.  Mr. Trudeau had this view and many members of the official 
opposition have had this view for many years, that their primary 
responsibility is to come to Ottawa to represent primarily the 
views of the constituents back home as they best determine what 
that view is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with our current system of governance in Canada is 
that because the Senate is so detached from its responsibility of 
representing regional interests, and because the Governor General 
is not a national unifying figure because she is not given a 
mandate through the electoral process, the House of Commons is 
bound by the responsibility to represent the private interests of 
individual constituents, the personal views of members of 
parliament, the national aspirations of a grand vision for the 
whole country and the regional needs, desires and differences 
among the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for individual members of parliament to 
fulfil all those tasks within what is supposed to be a 
competitive federalist model.  We have been handcuffed into that 
because of the outdated institutions of the Senate and, in my 
view, of the Governor General, and the fact that this House of 
Commons is more often than not a rubber stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was faced with this on May 9 when my private member's motion 
was debated in the House.  When I was standing and speaking to my 
non-votable motion, there were so few members in the House that I 
half expected tumbleweeds to blow through because it was so 
poorly attended.  That is a reality.  If there is not going to be 
a vote, then private members' business debates on motions and 
bills mean nothing.  We are wasting, whatever it costs, about 
$100,000 an hour, to keep this institution running, and there is 
no point at the end of the line for having done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should know that once a member puts his or her private 
member's bill or motion into a pool it is drawn.  The member then 
has to appear before a committee.  The committee is known as the 
subcommittee on private members' business of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, whose chair must have 
the largest business card in the history of western civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make a private member's bill votable, the bill must 
meet five criteria, as the member for Brandon—Souris mentioned, 
and these criteria are entirely subjective.  The third criteria 
states that bills and motions should concern matters of 
significant public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to get a private member's bill or motion made votable, 
it must meet all five criteria.  The committee, which is 
dominated by the government, must give unanimous consent in order 
to make a bill votable.  One of those criteria, that bills and 
motions should concern matters of significant public interest, is 
defined by whom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in the last campaign people told me that they wanted 
me to go to Ottawa and address the issue of leaky condos because 
it was a significant local issue affecting over 10,000 people, so 
I did that.  I drafted a private member's bill and was lucky to 
have it drawn.  I then went to a committee where it had to be 
unanimous that my motion be made votable, and one of the criteria 
was that bills and motions should concern matters of significant 
public interest.  My issue was of relevance only to the lower 
mainland of British Columbia.  There was not one single British 
Columbian on that committee.  How would members of that committee 
know if they do not live with the constituents who are impacted 
by this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore emphatically support the motion and I am encouraged 
that it will pass tonight.  It is a step in the right direction. 
It should have happened a long time ago, and passing it will send 
the right message that we are undertaking the first steps of 
modernizing this institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Governmrnt Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I like the member's enthusiasm.  He has raised an important issue 
on behalf of his constituents.  It is a file that I am familiar 
with.  A member would certainly want to have local issues, 
particularly regional or issues that are not necessarily 
national, brought to the fore with the ultimate objective of 
making sure the government becomes aware and that action is being 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to comment on the problem that sometimes 
we have issues that are urgent in nature which require action in 
months.  Having been a parliamentarian since 1993 I have had a 
number of bills and motions before the House, a couple of which 
have been votable.  The process takes an awful long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time a bill or motion is drawn, goes through the process 
of getting votability and getting on the list, we get our first 
hour of debate.  We wait 30 sitting days to get the second 
sitting hour and another 30 days for the third hour and a vote. 
Then it goes to committee.  I actually had a bill that was tied 
up in the process for almost two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think we should be sensitive to making private 
members' items more relevant to long term policy rather than 
short term issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Madam Speaker, the two words in a 
democracy that constituents hate to hear most are the ones I will 
use.  It depends.  If I look at the sweep of private members' 
bills and motions that I have read and frankly the ones I have 
drafted, they are largely non-partisan bills that affect people 
locally.  I keep raising the leaky condo issue.  It is not a 
partisan issue.  One cannot take a clear position and say that it 
is driven by ideological concern.  Local issues that are an 
urgent need can be brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second private member's motion that was drawn was supposed to 
be debated on June 22.  It has been moved back to the fall. It 
would establish a law that would make it impermissible for the 
Prime Minister to appoint senators for provinces that have Senate 
election laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not time sensitive in the relative context like the 
droughts in Alberta or the water issue in North Battleford, 
Saskatchewan.  If it were established by the committee after this 
motion is passed and the member for Battlefords—Lloydminster 
asked me if we could swap slots, that would be an appropriate 
consideration the committee should take into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution that private members' bills and motions should have a 
local emphasis.  They should be local concerns.  Some of the 
issues I have raised in the private members' bills I have 
drafted, including the one that was drawn, are not issues of 
concern to Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills are drawn and deemed votable.  What 
frustrates a lot of us in the opposition, and I know it 
frustrates the hon. member as well, is that some private members' 
bills become votable.  The member for Notre-Dame-de- 
Grâce—Lachine had a private member's bill to create a 
parliamentary poet laureate. It was drawn and deemed votable. 
Meanwhile, 10,000 of my constituents are being taxed on repairs 
to their homes that are no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey had a private 
member's bill in the last parliament in which he asked the House 
to consider the creation and the designation of a national horse. 
That was deemed votable.  Meanwhile, private members' bills and 
motions to have an elected Senate or to give GST relief to leaky 
condo owners were deemed non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The examples are endless.  There is another one from the Bloc 
Quebecois that asked the House of Commons to call upon the 
Governor General to ask London to give an official apology to 
Acadians from 250 years ago.  I as a member of parliament from 
British Columbia, and there is not an Acadian within an eight 
hour flight of where I live, was in the House speaking to that. 
If that is an issue of concern for that member, I have to respect 
that.  It has to be debated and brought forward.

province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency I represent 135,000 people.  It is the third 
largest constituency in the country.  The province of Prince 
Edward Island has eight representatives for the one, myself, in 
British Columbia.  Because of that individual members of 
parliament like myself should have the authority to bring forward 
bills of local interest and get them on the national stage 
because sometimes the government will not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull—Aylmer, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
should point out to begin with that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak to the official opposition motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be 
instructed to draft, and report to this House no later than 
November 1, 2001, changes to the Standing Orders improving 
procedures for the consideration of Private Members' Business, 
including a workable proposal allowing for all items to be 
votable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this parliament six months ago, close to 
200 private members' motions or bills have been introduced in the 
House, which is evidence of the importance MPs attach to these 
initiatives.  As we are all aware, the private members' business 
subcommittee selects at random 30 of these items, which are then 
entered on the list of priorities for debate in the House.  At 
the present time, the standing orders allow a maximum of ten of 
these to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us point out that contrary to what people might think the 
work of the subcommittee is carried out in a totally independent 
manner and the government is not in any way involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have all proposals votable presents certain advantages.  The 
vote enables members to officially support or not support a 
proposal. This way any doubts members may have on the objectivity 
of the members of the private members' business subcommittee are 
eliminated.  To some members, this could increase parliament's 
usefulness in the eyes of the public and give it a more 
democratic face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As only ten proposals can be voted on, excellent proposals may 
be left by the wayside.  While the simple fact of raising a 
question is enough in certain cases, members more often want the 
House to decide.  That way we know more clearly what the House 
thinks of a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many disadvantages, however.  The number of motions 
and bills put before the House must manifestly be reduced, unless 
other changes are made to reduce the number of hours spent in 
debate. The effect could be to reduce the importance given to 
each, so that the more important ones currently voted on could 
receive less attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of the McGrath committee, mandating a committee 
of MPs to choose votable motions and bills was a fair and just 
way to proceed.  If all proposals are voted on, members will lose 
the latitude they enjoy at the moment.  They may in some cases 
want the House to debate a matter without holding a vote. They 
will not have this option anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the way the House manages private members' 
business is based on two broad principles.  First, members 
themselves run the process; the government is not involved in it 
in any way.  Second, the members are free to manage their 
business as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the members who feel that the vote is important, 
but does the best solution consist in making all items votable? 
Such a measure would ultimately create other problems for 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the opposition is suggesting that the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs take a closer look at these issues 
and submit its report no later than November 1, 2001, including a 
workable proposal allowing for all items to be votable. This 
suggestion is perfectly appropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has been reviewing these issues for many years, 
thus making it the guarantor of the fairness of the rules 
relating to private members' business, which are always very 
complex, and giving it a great deal of expertise in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the committee has made numerous recommendations 
to improve the management of private members' business and 
strengthen the rules that serve members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect the committee to determine whether all items should be 
votable and to look at alternatives, such as increasing the 
number of votable items, allowing a larger number of bills to be 
referred to a committee, or proposing other means to allow 
members to submit to the House issues that are of interest to 
their constituents and to themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support today's motion and I am anxiously awaiting the 
report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague on this side of the 
House.  I will make a comment with respect to his speech and use 
my remarks as a vehicle to address comments which have been made 
erroneously by some hon. members debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke is a member of the subcommittee 
on private members' business.  I am looking at the <I>Hansard</I> 
for Friday, June 1, which indicates the membership of the various 
committees.  I wonder if the hon. member would agree with me, 
since he is a member of the committee, that there are six members 
on the committee of whom two are Liberals and four are opposition 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of speakers, and certainly the most recent speaker, 
have indicated that the subcommittee on private members' business 
is dominated by Liberals.  I would like the record to clearly 
show, and the Canadian people to know, that only one-third of the 
members of the subcommittee on private members' business are 
Liberals and two-thirds are opposition members.  Would the hon. 
member agree that what I have just said is factual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague is right 
in stating that I am a member of the subcommittee.  He is also 
right in stating that there are two Liberals among the membership 
of the committee.  He is also very right in assuming that it is 
not a situation where Liberal members dominate the committee.  It 
is the contrary in the sense that there are two Liberals and four 
non-Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at liberty to divulge details of how we deliberate in 
camera at the subcommittee.  However I do not think anyone needs 
much knowledge in mathematics to realize that two versus four 
does not win very strongly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this will probably be my last opportunity to wish you well during 
the summer.  I hope all members have a relaxing summer, 
notwithstanding what some of our constituents might think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the motion is quite simple.  A lot of members in 
the House are pretty frustrated with the whole issue of private 
members' business.  I dare say that the frustration opposition 
members have expressed is probably matched by the frustration 
government backbench members feel.  Indeed I dare say that 
certain ministers feel somewhat frustrated in their ability to 
move departmental legislation forward. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that government is quite a large entity.  It takes 
a great deal of willpower on the part of individual members of 
parliament, or indeed ministers, to move a government on items of 
legislation no matter how seemingly simple or obviously correct 
they may be.  We had an example of that just last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is well framed.  It speaks to a frustration that 
exists in the House as to the relevance members feel in terms of 
their role here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually when a bill comes forward the government's easiest 
response is to say no.  It may say the bill would create too many 
complications.  The reasons it gives are sometimes devoid of 
logic or common sense, but no is the easiest answer.  That in 
turn creates an atmosphere of exasperation which spills over into 
cheap politics.  We say nasty things about one side and it says 
nasty things about us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will break out some of the ideas that are presently on the 
table and indicate why I think some of the problems exist.  One 
of the problems we must deal with is the dumb idea.  I say with 
the greatest respect that some of the ideas that go through the 
House affairs and procedure committee are just plain dumb and 
should not see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some ideas are awkward and create difficulties for the 
government.  That makes life for us on the government backbench 
somewhat more difficult.  I will use the illustration of the 
private member's bill with respect to tools for mechanics.  On 
the face of it, who could oppose such a bill?  It seemed 
plausible and sensible so why would we not support a bill of that 
nature? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took something of an ambiguous position on that 
bill and suggested in the end that the bill would favour one 
class of Canadian taxpayer over another and was therefore not a 
good thing to do.  It then sought to expand the category of 
person who would benefit from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such ideas can also bring us into difficulty on this side 
because votable motions such as that cost the government moneys 
in terms of credits or deductions.  They therefore limit 
government revenues and reduce the government's ability to move 
in other areas it might see as more preferable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members opposite that is of somewhat less concern, but for 
those on this side of the House it is of more concern.  That is 
why I think members on both sides tend to feel frustration. There 
are no real consequences when a problematic motion goes through 
the House, costs the government money and leaves it in a very 
awkward situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is always how members on both sides of the House 
will take responsibility for what they are doing.  As I say, for 
members opposite there are no serious consequences.  For members 
on this side, however, there are serious consequences. 
Ultimately we end up in a situation where we are intellectually 
lazy and do not weigh all the benefits.  When we are uninformed 
we frankly tend to make poor decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the so-called Kilger commission has done some 
work on this.  Every member believes that his or her ideas are 
the best and should be votable.  My idea of course is also quite 
brilliant and should be votable.  I am going through a level of 
frustration right now with my bill before the committee.  I have 
basically five minutes to convince some of my colleagues that my 
bill should be votable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is very simple.  It deals with fire safe cigarettes. The 
industry has known for years how to make cigarette paper less 
porous and tobacco less dense, the result of which is a fire safe 
cigarette.  If it is dropped on furniture it meets certain 
flammability tests and the whole place does not burn down.  The 
irony is that had that legislation been in place a number of 
years ago this building would not have burned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such legislation has been adopted by New York state unanimously 
so that cigarettes cannot be manufactured, sold or distributed in 
that state without meeting certain flammability standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response I get from the minister and the government is that 
we cannot do it for a variety of unacceptable reasons.  Needless 
to say, I think my idea is quite brilliant, and I have unanimous 
consent from those behind the curtains.  The chance of my bill 
actually seeing the light of day is pretty remote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the frustration that all of us face.  Setting aside dumb 
ideas and setting aside the problematic ones, even very good 
ideas have some difficulty getting out of committee and on to the 
floor of the House to be debated in some sort of reasonable 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the way the system is presently structured the determination 
of votability is based on things that quite frankly are 
irrelevant to the bill.  We end up lapsing into some sort of 
political speak, whereby members on the government side do not 
worry about embarrassing the government and members opposite 
worry that the only good thing is an embarrassed government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill will have some difficulties getting out of committee, 
not on the basis of whether it is a brilliant bill, a good bill 
or a bad bill, but on the basis of irrelevant political 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of thing turns Canadians off.  They send us here and 
expect us to be legislators.  They have good reason to question 
how we can be legislators if we set up a system of inertia which 
prevents good ideas bubbling up and being made available for the 
benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will be considering the motion, which I think is 
supportable.  As it goes forward and returns to consideration by 
committee, the system should be given some modification.  One 
possible modification might be that each member, once during the 
life of a parliament, gets an opportunity to insist that his or 
her bill be votable regardless of whether the committee thinks it 
should be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that members cannot have other bills before 
committee.  It does not mean they cannot argue before committee 
that they be votable, but they have the opportunity to decide 
unilaterally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed the speech of the member opposite.  It is 
interesting to hear today a number of backbench Liberals giving 
an indication that they will support the motion.  I thank the 
member for his speech, for his sentiments, and for his tangible 
support later on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If private members bring forward motions pertaining to the 
wishes of their constituents, does he have any fears that it 
could potentially bring them into conflict with their party and 
with loyalty to their party, which Liberals opposite have been 
very good at showing at various times throughout the seven years 
I have been observing it? 
To a fault they follow their party leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all let me deal 
with the member's reference to the wishes of the constituents. 
Some ideas that I receive from my constituents frankly should not 
see the light of day as they are awful.  I am elected as a member 
to exercise judgment.  There are ideas, however, that should see 
the light of day and that I should be able to advocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a government member the equation becomes somewhat more 
difficult because, first, we have to deal with the issue of 
confidence. When dealing with the issue of confidence clearly a 
government member cannot be seen to be voting against the 
government on a matter of budget or money bills.  It is certainly 
within the narrow confines of a budget and possibly even extended 
to money bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second difficulty is the area of platform.  If my party or 
the member's party ran on a platform and a motion is inconsistent 
with the platform, I would say that government members would have 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is the throne speech.  If an initiative is not 
consistent with the throne speech, I would say a government 
member would have some difficulty supporting the initiative. 
Having said all of that, we would have to argue a government 
member into having a whipped vote at that point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the debate on the Canadian Alliance supply day 
motion asking that all items of private members' business votable 
in the House.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House does not attach any great importance to private 
members' business as it is now organized.  This is evident from 
the fact that members are seldom greatly concerned to claim the 
priorities they have drawn in the ballot governing the use of 
private members' time, and this is largely because private 
members' bills and motions rarely come to a vote. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the observation of the McGrath committee in June 1985. 
It is as true or even worse today.  Of the private members' bills 
and motions introduced in the first session of the 36th 
parliament less than 16% were drawn and under 4% were votable. In 
the second session, just 9% were drawn and less than 3% were 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 37th parliament 8% of private members' bills and 
motions were drawn and only 1.6% were votable. That is less than 
2 out of 100 votable items.  The ratio of votable private 
members' bills for the Canadian Alliance is so far one-third of 
the average of the House in the current session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly something wrong.  This emphasizes a dire need 
for reform of the House of Commons to restore to private members 
an effective legislative function, to give them a meaningful role 
in the formation of public policy, and to restore the House of 
Commons to its rightful place in the Canadian political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago it used to be said that members of parliament 
were nobodies outside the House of Commons.  Under the arrogant 
Liberal government, members of parliament are nobodies inside the 
House.  MPs are rubber stamps and backbench MPs are used as pawns 
by the Prime Minister's Office where the power is concentrated. 
As a result, members of parliament are frustrated and many lack 
morale and initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Are you talking about Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Yes, backbench MPs.  The Liberals 
curtail, cut off and close debate.  They vote for time allocation 
more often than ever before. 
There are no more free votes in the House, particularly on the 
government side.  I bet that sometimes backbenchers do not even 
know what they are voting on.  Committees are a farce and a 
partisan exercise to keep backbenchers busy.  Their priorities 
are often wrong and their deliberations become good for nothing 
exercises.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question period has become a circus.  Some ministers are 
consistently in the habit of rejecting even the preamble to 
legitimate opposition questions.  There are no answers given to 
legitimate and serious questions.  Perhaps it is true to its 
name; it is only a question period and not a question and answer 
period.  It should actually be called the accountability period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tabled Motion No. 291 on the order paper calling for the 
name change.  I hope with a name change that the nature of 
question period will also change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens work hard to collect thousands of signatures on 
petitions highlighting important issues and demanding the 
government's attention.  After the petitions are tabled in the 
House they gather dust on a shelf rather than get a government 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debates have become a joke.  Decisions are already made before a 
debate even commences.  Rarely is there a quorum during a debate 
in the House.  Sometimes there are more pages than members in the 
House.  What good are take note debates without a vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The officers of the House are regularly snubbed by the Prime 
Minister's Office, including the auditor general, privacy 
commissioner, chief actuary, information commissioner and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has failed to hold his ministers accountable, 
even after boondoggles and serious unfounded allegations about 
things like cross burnings.  It is no wonder that the public's 
perception of the integrity and credibility of politicians is so 
low and that voter turnout has fallen in recent elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance strongly advocates parliamentary reform 
and private members' business is one of the serious issues.  The 
Canadian Alliance wanted every MP to have at least one votable 
item per session but the NDP opposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today debating the motion.  We are continuing our 
battle with the arrogant Liberal government to empower members of 
parliament but it will not.  Since I have been a member of 
parliament I have seen my party dragging the government along 
while it kicks and screams.  The Liberals are dragging their feet 
on this issue.  They talk the talk but they do not walk the walk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' hour occurs every day.  I have spoken on many 
private members' business items.  It is the purest form for MPs, 
representing their constituents, to truly speak on behalf of 
their constituents in an attempt to contribute to the legislative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs work hard with stakeholders to prepare their bills and 
motions.  The legislative branch of the House is involved in 
getting the bills drafted, translated and printed.  Members and 
their constituents have high hopes and expectations from a bill 
or a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an analogy.  When a baby cries, a mother 
sometimes gives the baby a pacifier.  The baby starts working at 
the pacifier with expectations that something will come out of 
it.  The baby actually gets nothing, even after a lot of work. 
Eventually the baby shuts up and remains busy.  After some time, 
both the mother and the baby understand each other's role and, as 
a routine, both become habituated to the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what happens with private members' business.  It 
is an exercise to shut members up and keep them busy for some 
time with false hopes.  It becomes a vain exercise with both the 
government and the members knowing their roles and what outcome 
to expect.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Veteran MPs know the usual outcome.  They have a lower standard 
of expectation and aim for highlighting issues just for publicity 
purposes.  This can bring media attention to some of the issues. 
That is the best outcome to be expected from private members' 
business rather than it becoming a law.  The government keeps 
members busy and this bars them from lobbying the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no use for private members' business unless it is 
votable, adopted in the House and some concrete action is taken 
as an outcome.  That is why the official opposition is trying to 
get the government to realize this and help change the procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to make laws.  We are legislators.  We should be 
working on legislation and voting on legislation.  When an MP 
goes to the trouble of working the legal beagles in the House to 
the point where he or she develops a private member's bill, the 
bill deserves debate and a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When was the last time a private member's bill was passed? 
Rarely, hardly ever.  In the last parliament I submitted sixteen 
different private members' items, four of which were bills.  I 
even had two motions for the production of papers.  So far during 
this parliament I have half a dozen motions and almost as many 
bills prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am not optimistic about having the government debate 
and vote on any of the items that are important to the people of 
Surrey Central.  The Liberals will try to ensure that the voices 
of Surrey Central and other members in the House are muted.  My 
whistleblower bill cannot even get to debate stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is very disappointing.  The Liberal chair of the 
subcommittee has control.  Unanimous consent or unanimous 
agreement has to be reached before an item can become votable. It 
does not work.  Members on both sides of the House are 
frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking forward to making meaningful change in the House. 
One of the initiatives in that change is that private members' 
items have to be votable.  There is no use debating when we 
cannot vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour to be able to enter into this important 
debate.  I was curiously interested in the comments of other 
members who thought that we as official opposition would have 
used this occasion, the last supply day motion before summertime 
when we go to work in our ridings, for a substantial debate on 
some big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues listed was the splitting of Bill C-15 into its 
component parts so that we could deal with problems important to 
Canadians and to parliamentarians in a reasonable manner. Those 
problems could be solved instead of playing political games with 
them as the Minister of Justice is prone to do.  Other issues 
were mentioned as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a reasonable response to that charge.  With the passage 
of this bill I hope it will do something very important for 
parliament so that the work of members will be enhanced and all 
those problems will have another avenue in which they can be 
addressed through private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way private members' business is run right now is 
disgraceful.   We spend many days in the House.  Today is the 
77th sitting day of the House since the election.  During that 
time we have spent most of the time debating government bills but 
some time on supply day motions and some time on private members' 
business.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member who spends a lot of time in the House paying 
attention to what goes on here, I have observed that probably the 
best ideas and the ones that are most relevant to ordinary 
citizens come from private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times the government brings forward legislation which 
obviously is designed simply to facilitate the work of government 
bureaucrats.  Ideas bubble up through the departments to the 
minister.  The minister says to go ahead and draft a bill to be 
presented in the House.  With the government having a majority, 
we go through the motions of debating it but it is automatically 
passed.  Many of those things are administrative in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are others where frankly the government totally 
misses the boat on the aspirations of ordinary Canadians with 
respect to everything from taxes to the justice system, to the 
way parliament works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we have brought forward today will further the work 
of parliament.  Hopefully it will enable us as parliamentarians 
to do a much better job than we have been able to do because of 
the restrictions placed upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the public who may be watching television today 
should know that private members' business is not a very high 
priority of the government.  As a matter of fact, the present 
standing orders relegate private members' business to the least 
desirable hours of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday it is the first item, the assumption being that it is 
difficult for members to get back here after having been in their 
ridings on the weekend.  Thus private members' business is 
considered while there is nobody here.  I resent that because it 
is very important.  Members should be here to hear the arguments 
and the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday private members' business is 
taken up in the very last hour of the day when members are off to 
receptions and other meetings.  They are tired and finished for 
the day, so there is not a very great number of members who pay 
attention to private members' business on Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday it takes place again in the very last hour of sitting. 
That is the day when anyone who happens to be left in Ottawa, not 
having gone home on Thursday, might be here for a debate.  In any 
case members are eager to go and most of them are totally unaware 
of private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made it a point to pay attention every day to the goings 
on in the House, including private members' business.  As I have 
said, my observation is that the best ideas, the most relevant to 
Canadians, are brought forward by ordinary members who go to 
their ridings on the weekends.  During the weeks when we are able 
to meet with our constituents we get ideas and bring them back as 
private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an issue which I have not yet formulated a private 
member's bill on.  I do not know whether there is any point.  Not 
long ago a person said that he had to quit his job to look after 
his ailing wife.  If it were his handicapped child he would get a 
tax credit, but because he is doing it for his wife there is no 
tax credit.  Would that not be a perfect private member's bill? 
We could include a recognition that some people have to do this 
for members of their family who are ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a little mathematics, as I am prone to do.  I looked at 
the total number of bills and motions introduced during the time 
I have been in parliament.  I was first elected in the fall of 
1993.  Since then, according to the numbers I was given, there 
have been 4,136 private members' bills and motions introduced. 
Some of them were repeats.  Many bills and motions are prepared 
which are never selected in the random draw, so members 
reintroduce them after prorogation of the House or after an 
election.  Of those 4,136 private members' bills, only 11.8% were 
selected in the random draw.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something about the random draw.  When I was 
a kid at camp many years ago we had a rule.  When we went for 
meals no one was allowed seconds until everyone had a first.  I 
think we should use that principle here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here since 1993.  I have had private members' bills 
in the hopper.  My name has been there but I was not one of the 
lucky ones to have my name drawn.  Therefore I have not been able 
to put forward a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that the system should be changed.  At some point in 
time all currently elected members of parliament should be put on 
a random order list.  I would be willing to provide the 
computerized process to do that, if necessary.  Everyone would be 
on the list and no one would get back on it until he or she gets 
to the bottom.  It would go sequentially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are interrupted by an election or there are members that 
resign for some other reason, their names would be taken off the 
list and be replaced by other members' names being added to the bottom 
of the list as they are elected.  I would like very much to 
support that notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that every bill should be votable.  I do not have 
the fear of some that the House of Commons will become irrelevant 
or that members will waste their time.  If we had a rule that 
each member could only have one bill or motion before all other 
members have had one, we could be assured that no member would 
waste that opportunity.  They would put up their very best bill, 
their very best motion, to have it debated and voted upon.  If it 
is a dumb motion or dumb bill the House would rule on it and it 
would be defeated, provided that we have a free vote on such 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern.  If every bill is votable I fear the 
government will start interfering and will start pushing party 
discipline on the outcome of the votes on private members' 
business.  Some private members' bills could serve to be a slight 
embarrassment to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have used up my speaking time, but I look forward to questions 
and comments which I am sure will come after question period 
today.

parties adhere to the recommendations of the Mitchell commission,

all acts of terrorism and violence; second, the cessation and 
desisting from all acts of incitement, for it is this teaching of 
contempt, this demonizing of the other, particularly that which 
is government sanctioned, where it all begins; third, the 
ending of the culture of impunity and the bringing of the 
perpetrators of acts of violence and terrorism to justice; 
fourth, the institutionalization of security co-operation between 
the parties so as to pre-empt acts of violence and incitement; 
fifth, the promotion of a culture of prevention through the 
institutionalization of confidence building measures; and sixth, 
the recommitment to direct negotiations between the parties as a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, less than nine months ago the health minister

immigrants for HIV and hepatitis B.  As of today that advice was 
rescinded and the Department of Health is now recommending that 
Canada admit HIV positive immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the Minister of Health.  Why 
the flip-flop?  Are we putting the health of all Canadians at 
risk? 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have now brought the policy of this country in line with that 
of many others with which we compare ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy recommendation we have made to the minister of 
immigration is simply that we have mandatory testing for HIV and 
certain other diseases for anyone who would immigrate to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If persons are HIV positive they are counselled, informed and 
provided treatment if it is required.  It is non-discriminatory. 
It is in the interests of public health in Canada and we have 
confidence that we have given the right advice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, conservative estimates state that the annual cost of 
caring for a Canadian HIV patient is about $200,000.  There were 
some 200 HIV positive immigrants allowed into Canada last year. 
That is $40 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister of immigration expect the already 
overburdened health system to cope? 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me clarify the policy for the member 
opposite.  There will be mandatory testing for all of those who 
want to come to Canada as immigrants.  That testing is important 
because it leads to counselling and treatment.  However we are 
working with the provinces to determine who will be admissible to 
Canada.  Those decisions will be made on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the member opposite that just as the 
Minister of Health said, consistent with other countries that 
accept refugees, there will be no inadmissibility bar for 
refugees, spouses, partners and dependent children.  That is the 
right thing to do.

that oppressed its people because of their colour, because of 
their origin, and denied them justice, equality and freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accepted an invitation to speak to a joint session of the

revenge but of reconciliation and forgiveness.  That was in 1990.

new South African state based on freedom and equality for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think that Canada is also grateful to Nelson 
Mandela for his role in history, for opposing injustice and for 
striving to right an enormous wrong and thus setting an example 
for the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he said at his own trial by the apartheid regime for opposing 
its prejudiced laws in 1964: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against 
black domination, I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and 
free society in which all persons live together in harmony and 
with equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live 
for and achieve.  But if needs be, it is an idea for which I am 
prepared to die. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for us and for the world and South Africa, it was 
and is an ideal which he lived for and achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by quoting our Prime Minister, who said about 
Nelson Mandela: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...he is a living symbol of the two historic movements that have 
defined the 20th century:  equality and democracy..few people in 
our time—or any century—have so symbolized the spirit of 
freedom that lives within every human being. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that at the start of the 21st century 
the House should honour Nelson Mandela unanimously by voting in 
favour of the motion now before us.  In doing so we confirm the 
values that we as Canadians hold dear:  values of inclusiveness, 
equality, justice and freedom, values which provide the 
foundations for the fabric of our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing this we show this parliament is worthy of honour by 
honouring a great man of this 21st century and every century, 
Nelson Mandela.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I look upon this opportunity to 
represent my party in support of this motion as a distinct 
honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Mandela on a couple of 
occasions.  I acknowledge and thank the member for Markham for 
originating this overture to this esteemed gentleman.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1991, I was part of an eight member international 
delegation of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to South 
Africa, partly to acknowledge Mr. Mandela's release from his 27 
year detention in prison and partly to observe and share thoughts 
with representatives and parliamentarians to South Africa's 
return to full democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, our delegation members had the honour of 
meeting Mr. Mandela as he welcomed the first official visit of 
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in 30 years to South 
Africa after a hiatus from 1961 to 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA delegation leader at the time was the Hon. Clive 
Griffiths, president of the legislative council of western 
Australia.  In his remarks at official ceremonies acknowledging 
this new beginning for South Africa, a ceremony which also 
included remarks by Mr. Mandela, Mr. Griffiths quoted Thomas 
Jefferson in his remarks, saying that compromise was all three of 
the main principles of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated that apartheid may have delayed but failed to 
destroy the destiny of South Africa to choose its system of 
government and that what we were bearing witness to was a 
transition from a racial oligarchy to a colourblind democracy. 
In these remarks, Clive Griffiths was really acknowledging Nelson 
Mandela as we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are practising compromise, tolerance and virtue, as did Dr. 
Mandela, who emerged from his 27 years of imprisonment without 
vindictiveness and in a spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his positive forgive and forget attitude, Nelson Mandela 
surely delivered his people and country from further racial 
strife after suffering a lifetime of apartheid.  This serenity is 
what we are honouring here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Mr. Mandela's remarks following Mr. Griffiths' introduction, 
I observed a sense of peace in Mr. Mandela's heart and soul. 
There was no room for recriminations of the past, nor should 
there be today.  The virtue of peace that Mr. Mandela bestowed on 
his country as it made the transition is a virtue we all should 
emulate.  To give credence to this virtue, the House has moved to 
confer honorary Canadian citizenship on Mr. Mandela.  What a 
dignified and fitting manner in which to emulate the peace of this Nobel 
peace prize recipient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I watched and listened to Mr. Mandela on that July day in 
1991, I was naturally moved.  Not only was I a personal witness 
to an historic world event and occasion, I was witness to the 
testimony of a man who had been through the terrors of apartheid, 
imprisonment and reprisal.  He stood there at that moment devoid 
of any vengeance.  What a testimony to the human spirit and 
faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues, in Mr. Mandela's spirit of forgiveness 
and reconciliation, not only to honour this indomitable gentleman 
but to honour this institution and this country with his 
citizenship in it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are few true heroes in this world.  When one comes along, 
he is readily recognized.  Nelson Mandela is one such hero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He came out of prison after 27 years, strong, firm in his 
convictions, a modest man, close to his people.  He is an example 
of courage and determination, but also of wisdom and 
intelligence.  He became president of South Africa at a time when 
violence could have exploded at any moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His autobiography provides us with a better understanding of the 
greatness of this man, the liberator of his people, who forgave 
those who had imprisoned him and oppressed his people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We who are elected by the people know what they expect of us 
under far easier circumstances that pale in comparison with those 
faced by President Mandela.  Mandela's true successes are easily 
seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He represents humanity's hope for a better world.  If our 
children, today's youth, can hope in the future, it is because 
they have in Nelson Mandela a tangible and contemporary example. 
It is that hope, and that commitment, to which we pay tribute 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is comforting to think that our civilization is still capable 
of generating men and women of this calibre.  While those of us 
in the western world like to think that we are in the forefront 
of the great emancipators, it is stimulating to realize that an 
African, Nelson Mandela, sets us an example and shows us the way 
in this long march toward freedom.

today to support the resolution to grant Nelson Mandela honorary 
Canadian citizenship. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly on 
the motion before the House.  I think it can be said that for 
most members, and I would have thought all members, of the House of 
Commons the occasion on which Nelson Mandela addressed us in this 
Chamber would have been one of the absolute highlights of our 
parliamentary careers.  I know I speak personally when I say that 
will always remain so for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His message to us on that occasion and his wonderful 
autobiographical account, <I>A Long Walk to Freedom</I>, both remind 
us why Nelson Mandela, through his words and deeds, has been 
embraced by the whole world as a symbol of courage, hope and 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote briefly from words of a South African journalist 
and broadcaster who put together a wonderful little pocketbook of 
the words of Nelson Mandela.  In 1998 she wrote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Nelson Mandela is the world's role model.  A towering figure of 
strength and forgiveness, he has been able to do the almost 
impossible:  unite the bitterly divided people of the country of 
his birth.  In doing so, he has been taken to the heart of both 
the mighty and the dispossessed the world over. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a political note, I do not think I was the only member who was 
shocked and saddened by the refusal of one of our colleagues to 
enter into that very spirit of tolerance, of reconciliation and 
of peace, and endorse the resolution to make Nelson Mandela an 
honorary citizen of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an occasion for us to call up the spirit and 
inspiration of Nelson Mandela, and to remind ourselves that 
for Nelson Mandela the struggle is never won and that one must 
always go on reaching out for greater understanding of all of our 
fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, I hope all members of the House, including those 
who were not prepared to come up front immediately, will 
understand the importance of rewarding honorary citizenship to 
Nelson Mandela and be moved by that same spirit today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a very personal note, I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that one of 
the absolute high moments of my adult life was the very brief 
conversation that I was privileged to have with Nelson Mandela 
when your predecessor invited us into his chamber to do that.  On 
that occasion I had the opportunity to ask Nelson Mandela a 
question that I am sure had been put to him thousands of times. I 
asked him how it was possible, after 27 years of wrongful 
imprisonment, for him to be able to emerge without rancour, 
bitterness and without being bent on revenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His answer was simple.  He said “We had a nation to build, we 
had much work to do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us always be infused by that speaker.  Let us do honour to 
the contribution made by Nelson Mandela, but let us also honour 
this place and this nation today, with one voice and in that 
spirit of unity and reconciliation, by endorsing the call for 
Nelson Mandela to be made an honorary citizen of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary-Centre, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud and happy to support, along with my colleagues in the 
House, the motion of the member for Markham to make Nelson 
Mandela an honorary citizen of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is intended to recognize his extraordinary efforts 
and leadership in his quest for democracy for South Africa and 
respect for the rights and freedoms of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget my first meeting with Mr. Mandela in Lusaka, 
Zambia, only a week after his release.  I was at the time the 
first member of a western government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is not the right country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B> It is the right country. 
As I said, it was in Lusaka, Zambia.  I know my geography and 
history, perhaps even better than the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in Lusaka, Zambia, where Mr. Mandela had his first meeting 
in exile with the members of the African National Congress.  It 
was not possible for them to meet in South Africa.  It was one 
of the elements of the apartheid regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me most was his behaviour.  He was not bitter.  He 
was not full of vengeance.  He was full of hope. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 11, 1990, the unforgettable day of his release from 
prison, Mr. Mandela could have, with one flick of his wrist or 
one misstated word, triggered a revolution and his country would 
have been in flames.  He did not.  He did the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will always remember is that he recognized that the most 
turbulent element of that society at the time were the young 
people who had fought at his side and on his behalf, who had 
forgone their formation and their training to be supporters of 
his while he was in prison.  His words to them were to put the 
past behind them and to build immediately for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke at the Soweto rally two days after his release, and I 
think it is well for this House to remember those words.  Mr. 
Mandela said to the young of his country: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the policy of the ANC that though the school and the 
entire education system is a site of struggle, the actual process 
of learning must take place in the schools. I want to add my 
voice, therefore, to the call made at the beginning of the year 
that all students must return to school and learn.  We must 
continue our struggle for People's Education within the school 
system and utilise its resources to achieve our goals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, he was saying that the young people of that 
country should not reject the system that had rejected them. 
What they should do instead is embrace that system, improve it 
and move it forward into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us who met Nelson Mandela can help escape personal 
reactions.  I have to say to the House that the single, most 
dramatic incident in my political life was precisely in that 
meeting in Lusaka when he came out to meet the African National 
Congress in exile.  I was there because Canada had chaired the 
commonwealth committee on Foreign Ministers on 
Southern Africa and I was the chair of 
that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that a question was put to Mr. Mandela that invited him 
to be highly critical of the Afrikaner who had imprisoned him for 
all those years.  His answer was “we have to understand how 
difficult this is for them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was overwhelmed by the generosity of a man able to come out 
of prison and out of the conditions he had endured, who could 
speak for generosity and understanding of the other side.  Yet it 
was precisely that capacity that made it possible for people who, 
for reasons of colour, of hatred, of ignorance, had been on other 
sides in South Africa, to come together in that extraordinary 
rainbow coalition to try to establish a nation that could thrive 
into the future. 
It goes without saying that in that tolerance and in that 
generosity there are extraordinary lessons for us in this diverse 
but much easier country than South Africa.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela acknowledged Canada's efforts to end apartheid. 
When he spoke in these Chambers on June 18, 1990, he said of 
former prime minister Brian Mulroney: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been greatly strengthened by your personal involvement in 
the struggle against apartheid and tyranny, and the leadership 
you provided within the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the 
Group of Seven and the Francophonie Summits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our efforts however pale in comparison to those of Nelson 
Mandela.  We should all be proud to have Nelson Mandela declared 
an honorary citizen of this free country, Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as my colleagues know, I was born in the African country 
of Tanzania and am therefore no stranger to life in a society 
where there are racial strains and tensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully we are free to debate the granting of honorary 
Canadian citizenship to one of the great figures in recent 
history in a Chamber where there are no racial strains or 
tensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one have been very grateful to be accepted in Canadian 
society as a member of a visible minority.  It is particularly 
validating that I have been chosen by thousands of people to be 
their representative in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is Nelson Mandela an international symbol of resistance 
to prejudice and injustice, he is also a symbol for peace and 
forgiveness because, following his release from prison when he 
became the president of South Africa, he made the country's 
transition from apartheid to democratic qualities a peaceful one. 
Here was a man who was hounded by police for 10 years and then 
imprisoned for 27 years as he struggled on behalf of the 
non-white majority for freedom from apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was banned from all public activity, as the forces arrayed 
against him used everything under the laws they had written to 
maintain apartheid.  A lesser mortal would have emerged from this 
ordeal either a broken man or a bitter man intent on revenge 
against his oppressors.  However Nelson Mandela was not a lesser 
mortal.  He preached peace and reconciliation and in the end was 
jointly awarded the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can attest, as one coming from Africa, that Africa has 
suffered tremendous racial discrimination.  Discrimination robs 
one of his dignities.  It should not have a place in any 
civilized society.  Mr. Mandela fought for human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a society growing increasingly comfortable with the idea 
of a cultural mosaic.  We all are free to practise our religion, 
maintain our cultural identity and live side by side with people 
born on the other side of the planet.  Canada is recognized in 
the world community as a peaceful place where we can pursue our 
dreams both individually and collectively.  We not only have two 
official languages, but all the languages of the world are spoken 
in our homes, shops and neighbourhoods.  We too are an example of 
tolerance, forbearance and peaceful co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue for me is not the qualification and achievements of 
Mr. Nelson Mandela, but rather the lack of process by which 
parliament grants honorary Canadian citizenship.  It seems to me 
that such an honour should be not granted without a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future I would suggest establishment of an all party 
committee that would first set up the ground rules for why and 
how honorary Canadian citizenship should be granted.  Once this 
has been accomplished, the committee would meet when required to 
consider qualification for such status and to discuss and ponder 
the qualifications of nominees, and whether a particular 
individual should be accorded such an honour. 
It is my belief that all members of parliament would be proud to 
serve on such a committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would then bring forward its recommendations to 
confer honorary citizenship in the House of Commons. 
Once conferred, it would be clear to one and all that the status 
of honorary Canadian citizenship had been granted with the 
blessing of every Canadian from every corner of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week I attended the ceremony to honour Raoul 
Wallenberg, a hero who saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust 
during World War II and who died in a Soviet labour camp.  It is 
lamentable that so few Canadians know the history and the heroism 
of Raoul Wallenberg.  Had his honorary citizenship been subject 
to parliamentary discussion and decision as I suggest, perhaps 
millions more Canadians would know and honour the memory of 
Raoul Wallenberg today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about informing Canadians about the great 
achievements of Mr. Mandela.  If we are going to honour our 
world's heroes, let us do it out in the sunshine so all Canadians 
can share in the tribute and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying that Nelson Mandela has 
already taken his place among the world's historic figures.  He 
is as deserving of praise and high honours as any individual who 
has ever graced the pages of our history books.

tabled by the member for Markham to award honorary Canadian 
citizenship to a great hero of democracy, Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, only one person has been given this honour: Raoul 
Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of people 
from Nazi death camps during the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot ignore the symbolism of this motion a few hours before 
passage at third reading of Bill C-11, an act respecting 
immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee protection to 
persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela is an example for those who lead the fight for 
democracy in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1944, he joined the African National Congress, the ANC. In 
1948, the National Party won the election in South Africa. Its 
platform was unequivocal “The Black man in his place”. From then 
on, the policy of apartheid got tougher and introduced one of the 
most racist and undemocratic regimes in modern history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela was once asked when he decided to fight for 
freedom. He replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say exactly when I became politically active, when I 
knew that I would spend my life fighting for freedom. Being an 
African in South Africa means that we are politically active from 
the moment we are born, whether we know it or not. African 
children are born in hospitals reserved for Africans; they go 
home in buses reserved for Africans; they live in neighbourhoods 
reserved for Africans and they go to schools reserved for 
Africans, that is if they go at all. When they grow up, they can 
only get jobs that are reserved for Africans, rent houses in 
townships reserved for Africans, travel in trains reserved for 
Africans— 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I never had a defining moment, a revelation, a moment of 
truth. It was the accumulation of thousands of insults, 
humiliations and forgotten moments that led me to revolt, that 
gave me the desire to fight a regime that held my people captive. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1955, the ANC adopted the charter of freedom which, in 
addition to criticizing apartheid, proposed the creation of a 
democratic and non-racial South Africa. At the end of that same 
year, Nelson Mandela was arrested for high treason, an offence 
punishable by death. He and 91 other ANC members were put on 
trial, a trial that was to end with their acquittal in 1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1961, the ANC decided to take up arms to fight apartheid 
by setting up an organization known as the “spear of the nation” 
and led by Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1963, Nelson Mandela was again arrested and charged 
with treason, conspiracy and sabotage. He was to come out of 
prison only 27 years later.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, Nelson Mandela became president of the ANC.  His 
negotiations with the president of South Africa ended the racist 
system of apartheid.  In South Africa's first free election in 
1994, Nelson Mandela was elected president, a position he held 
until 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making him an honorary citizen, parliament is paying tribute 
to the exceptional contribution this man has made to democracy 
and, through him, to the rightful struggle of those throughout 
the world who are fighting for democracy and equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However how can we ignore the paradox of Motion No. 379 and 
Bill C-11?  Tomorrow, the act respecting immigration to Canada 
will make a future Nelson Mandela an undesirable citizen in 
Canada. 
If Bill C-11 had been in effect 40 years ago and Nelson Mandela 
had sought asylum in Canada, as a member of an organization for 
the subversion by force of any government, to use the wording of 
clause 34, he would have been inadmissible. He would have been 
sent back to South Africa and accordingly to prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I thank the member for Markham 
for his initiative.  Democracy and the equality of all citizens 
are the paramount values in our society, but democracy is all 
the more precious for being fragile.  We are all responsible for 
keeping it alive.  Many have given their lives for this ideal. 
Charles de Montesquieu, an 18th century philosopher, wrote “To 
love democracy is to love equality”.

a citizen of South Africa, but a citizen of the world and 
hopefully soon to be an honorary citizen of Canada.  Canada would 
indeed be the first nation to recognize Nelson Mandela as an 
honorary citizen.  I think it is appropriate that we take that 
historic step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud that my colleagues in the New Democratic Party in 
this and previous parliaments, and indeed before the founding of 
the NDP in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, worked 
tirelessly along with people in the church movement, the labour 
movement, social movements and in many other movements in 
solidarity with the struggle against apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to acknowledge the contribution made by the 
former prime minister, Prime Minister Mulroney, as well as Prime 
Minister Diefenbaker, in helping to free Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall, as I am sure all members who witnessed it would, 
watching television on the 11th of February in 1990 as Nelson 
Mandela took those historic steps out of prison.  I also had the 
privilege, along with the Deputy Prime Minister and others, of 
meeting Nelson Mandela when he came to Canada later that year. He 
has dedicated his life to justice and to ending the scourge of 
racism and institutionalized racism.  His biography <I>A Long 
Walk to Freedom</I> tells his incredible story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege in 1994 of joining in the official Canadian 
delegation to witness the first free and democratic elections in 
South Africa.  What an extraordinary experience it was.  I was 
with the member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget one occasion as we witnessed the voting in a 
small village outside East London.  A young man came up to the 
voting station with an elderly woman in a wheelbarrow.  He 
indicated that he had been pushing this woman, his mother, 
for many kilometres.  They had come down from the mountains.  I 
asked him what drove him to take this incredible step.  She 
pulled out a rumpled piece of paper, and it was a photograph of 
Nelson Mandela.  She said “I've waited my whole life to vote 
for this man”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of inspiration that he provided not only to his 
own people but to people around the world.  Indeed, last August 
my partner Max and I had the privilege of travelling to South 
Africa and visiting the prison just outside Cape Town on Robben 
Island, where Nelson Mandela was in prison for 27 long years.  We 
saw the rock quarry where he was forced to break rocks and we saw 
his tiny prison cell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the opportunity to meet with some of his fellow 
prisoners.  What an incredible story they had to tell, a story of 
courage and of vision.  What an inspiration to people around the 
world, that spirit of reconciliation, the spirit of forgiveness 
and healing, as my leader said, after 27 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Nelson Mandela was described by the member for Calgary 
West and indeed by the House leader for the official opposition 
as a communist and a terrorist.  As for communists, Nelson 
Mandela himself has acknowledged that the South African Communist 
Party played an extraordinary role in the struggle against 
apartheid as indeed did the government and people of Cuba and 
Fidel Castro, so we take no lessons on that at all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would also like to point out the irony to which my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois referred, that there are 
provisions in Bill C-11 which would have kept Nelson Mandela out 
of Canada.  This is unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say again on behalf of all of my 
colleagues in the New Democratic Party what an honour it is to 
recognize this outstanding citizen of South Africa, of the world 
and, hopefully soon, of Canada with the highest honour our 
country can bestow, the honorary citizenship of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to rise to speak on this motion today.  It was 
very much an honour for me to be one of the seconders of the 
motion and it is certainly an honour to support it.  I compliment 
the member for Markham for bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to listen to all the members.  Many of us here 
have met Nelson Mandela.  It seems that we all remember that 
first meeting very clearly.  I am one of those very fortunate 
people who has met Nelson Mandela and I remember exactly the day 
that I met him.  I remember the circumstances.  He had just been 
released from 27 years in prison.  He came to Canada at Canada's 
invitation to speak to all of us in a joint session of the House 
of Commons and the Senate to encourage us to support his 
opposition to apartheid and to support democracy in his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I met him it struck me that this man had just come 
out of jail after 27 years.  I was 45 at the time and would have 
been 17 when he went into jail.  I thought of all the things that 
I experienced in that time between the age of 17 and the age of 
45 years, and I thought of all of that part of his life that he 
missed while he was breaking rocks in the prison on Robben 
Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an incredible experience.  We met him at the airport and 
he treated us like the heroes.  He treated us with the respect. 
It was an awesome experience which I will never forget.  He 
exuded confidence.  He came across as the most humble person and 
he treated us like the honourable people, when it should have 
been the reverse.  It was truly an experience.  As we can see, 
every person here who has met Nelson Mandela will never forget 
that visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that visit Mr. Mandela went to Toronto, where tens of 
thousands of Canadians went out in the streets to meet him, just 
to say hi, show respect to him and listen to his words.  He was 
given a hero's welcome in Toronto.  Here in the House he 
addressed a joint session of the Commons and the Senate, an 
honour usually reserved for heads of state, and of course at that 
time he was not a head of state.  He would be later on, but in 
1990 he was not, having just come out of prison.  Apartheid was 
still in place.  Even with all the things he was put through, in 
the House he showed the same humility and urged us to continue 
the battle to help him eliminate apartheid in his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had an outstanding career, a career of outstanding 
accomplishments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members who spoke before me referred to courage and 
vision and those are good words to describe Nelson Mandela.  He 
was and is a man of courage and vision, which has certainly led 
to his stature and reputation around the world as one of the 
world's citizens who has set an example for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela has done an incredible job of creating firsts. He 
established the first black law firm in South Africa.  He was the 
first democratically elected president of South Africa.  He was 
one of the very first student activists in South Africa.  From 
the time he was a very young person he was outspoken and 
committed and a very effective activist, so effective that he was 
even expelled from school, which started a long and interesting 
career in activism for him.  Nelson Mandela has received 50 
international university honorary degrees as well as being 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nelson Mandela raises the bar for all of us.  He raises the bar 
for all humanity.  We totally support this motion and we will 
welcome Mr. Mandela as an honorary citizen of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a privilege and pleasure for me to join in this debate and 
support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one involved in the anti-apartheid movement for 20 years and 
who served as Canadian counsel for Nelson Mandela, I would like 
to pay tribute to the historical contribution of Nelson Mandela 
to Canadians and people the world over.  The conferral of this 
honorary citizenship will have enduring resonance and inspiration 
as Raoul Wallenberg has had in being our first honorary citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly summarize what I mean by this historic 
resonance and inspiration that this conferral of honorary 
citizenship will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Nelson Mandela is the metaphor and message of the 
struggle for human rights and human dignity in our time.  If 
apartheid was the ultimate assault on human rights and human 
dignity, if South Africa was the first post-World War II, 
post-Nazi country to institutionalize racism as a matter of law 
and to seek to do so under the cover of being a western 
democracy, then Nelson Mandela's struggle was the ultimate in the 
struggle for human rights and for human dignity and against 
racism and against bigotry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Nelson Mandela is the metaphor and message of the long 
march toward freedom, of the struggle for equality, of the 
struggle for democracy.  The three great struggles of the 20th 
century are symbolized and anchored in his personal struggle in 
South Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Nelson Mandela is a metaphor for nation building, for 
building a rainbow coalition, for taking diverse peoples, even 
antagonistic peoples, races and identities, and welding them into 
a rainbow coalition for nation building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, he is a metaphor for hope, how one person could endure 
27 years in a South African prison and emerge not only to preside 
over the dismantling of apartheid but to become president of 
South Africa and to build that nation.  I do not know of any 
other example in the 20th century that can serve as such a source 
of inspiration and hope, particularly for the young people of our 
time, those who are imbued with cynicism, those who believe that 
this kind of inspiration does not exist any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, he is a metaphor, as in his Soweto speech, of education 
as a linchpin for peace, of education as a precondition to a 
culture of peace and against a culture of contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, he is a metaphor for tolerance, for healing, for 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the entire historical record, what we have is a 
person who is one of the great humanitarians of the 20th century 
and whose contribution to the struggle for human rights, for 
democracy, for peace and for equality will endure and inspire all 
in this country and the world beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Pursuant to the order adopted the other day, 
it is my duty to put the question to the House.  Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my friend from Elk Island on 
his normal loquaciousness and eloquence on the subject of 
empowering individual members through the private member's bill 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to have a vote for parliamentarian of the year, I am 
sure that the member for Elk Island would rank in the top two or 
three.  I am sure members opposite would agree that he is one of 
the most diligent, thoughtful and hardworking and one of the most 
present of parliamentarians.  He is always here and always 
participating in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, it is really quite disturbing to learn, as the 
hon. member just instructed us, that in his several years in this 
place he has not once had an opportunity to have a private 
member's bill come forward and be deemed votable, or even 
debatable as I understand it, because of the absurd arbitrariness 
of the luck of the draw system we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if he could expound on that.  Has he 
in fact brought forward private members' bills on the order 
paper?  If so, why have they not been allowed to be debated in 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I had an experience where I had a private member's bill 
on the non-controversial subject of opening the national archives 
for research purposes for access to the census records of 1901. 
Unfortunately, a government member, I am sure on the instruction 
of the minister responsible, moved an amendment to my motion that 
essentially gutted it and rendered it effectively meaningless. 
All of the work I had done, dozens of hours of work, and all of 
the tens of thousands of letters, phone calls, faxes and e-mails 
from Canadians expressing concern about the issue and support for 
the bill, was vitiated by a dilatory motion introduced by a 
government member and passed by the government, which had the 
effect of completely gutting and undermining my private member's 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague from Elk Island would also reflect on 
whether he believes that private members' bills, should they be 
deemed votable, should be protected from such dilatory 
legislative manoeuvrings on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his very kind statements at the beginning of his 
remarks.  I do not know, perhaps I have some pathological 
problem, but I actually do enjoy debates.  I always have.  One of 
the greatest regrets I have is that too often in the House we are 
debating with empty chairs.  It is really difficult to change 
hon. members' minds when we do not even know what their views are 
in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say just a few things about this matter.  First, 
I have had a private member's bill on the list.  Of course as the 
hon. member knows, if one has even just one bill, his or her name is 
on the list.  My name has never been drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had two private members' bills.  One is urgent and it has 
never been drawn.  It deals with the issue of dates.  If we use 
only numbers for expressing dates, what does 2/3/1 mean?  Is it 
February 3?  Is it the 2nd of March?  Is it the year 1?  Is it 
the year 2002?  Is it the year 2003?  My bill is a very important 
bill and simply provides for removal of the ambiguity if people 
use numbers only.  My second bill is a very important one, and 
that is the one that states Canadian taxpayers should not have to 
pay income tax on money they earn for the sole purpose of paying 
taxes.  That has to do with exempting from income money people 
earn in order to pay their property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are two very important bills.  I have never had the 
opportunity to even debate them let alone get them voted on.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on his statement regarding amendments. I 
have often thought about this, not only on private members' 
business but also on supply day motions.  One thing we started to 
do was split our time for our first speaker so our second speaker 
could make an amendment of little consequence to prevent the 
other side from making one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in our first term here there was an occasion that 
just blew my mind.  We put a motion and the government made an 
amendment that stated “all the words after the word “that” be 
deleted and replaced by”, then it put in its own motion.  It was 
our supply day motion but the government totally gutted it by 
deleting the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes private members' motions have errors so it is 
necessary to make technical amendments.  I would like to see a 
change so that the only amendments permitted for private members' 
business would be those that would be put by permission of the 
movers.  In other words, if the mover can be persuaded that the 
motion will not pass, unless it is amended, because of a technical 
problem, then obviously that member would go along with the 
amendment and it would be in order.  However, if the mover did 
not approve of it, then the amendment would be out of order and 
the original motion would stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for giving me the opportunity to speak 
about those two issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I believe very strongly that this is one of the most 
important motions that has come before the House since I have 
been here.  I believe this one measure, more than any other 
element of parliamentary reform, would empower individual MPs and 
hence their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  Because the whip, the Prime Minister's 
Office or the leader's office cannot control the private members' 
legislation or motions that members bring before this place.  It 
is precisely those motions which can reflect issues that the 
political class and the centre of authority in the PMO on that 
side refuses to have brought forward for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many sensible bills come before this place, but many deal with 
issues which are not on the political agenda of the government or 
for whatever reason, on the political agenda of party strategists 
on the opposition side.  No single step would do more to empower 
us than to give every MP at least one votable private member's 
bill.  There is no good reason this ought not to happen because 
if each of the 300 MPs had a votable motion or bill that could 
easily be contained within the period of time for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are leaving the House two weeks before the parliamentary 
schedule indicates.  There is plenty of time.  We could extend 
hours, sit earlier, sit later or sit longer to debate issues 
which are of importance to Canadians and to this parliament, 
which are not brought forward on government orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want it on the record in questions and comments, and my 
colleague may want to reply, that on behalf of my constituents I 
firmly support this motion and I would hope that members 
opposite, as private members not as partisans, would accept this 
as a sensible incremental reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I understand that the so-called modernization 
committee had given near unanimous approval for this, except for 
one House leader for a minor party.  That is unfortunate.  I 
understand that even the government was commendably prepared to 
give support to a step of this nature to empower members through 
more votable private members' bills. Therefore, we are almost 
there.  I would appeal to the House leader of that minor party to 
reconsider why it is that he is being a roadblock to major 
parliamentary reform in this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I concur with what the member 
for Calgary Southeast has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back during my years here and I had the questionable 
privilege for a time of being on that infamous subcommittee of 
private members.  I always felt ill at ease because of the very 
subjective criteria that were used.  There was really no way of 
properly evaluating bills that should be votable or should not. 
I understand that the criteria are now somewhat different but 
still very subjective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember with fondness the leadership of the member for 
Mississauga Centre who at that time was chairperson of that 
committee.  We were able, through some sleepiness on the part of 
the Liberals, to bring through some amendments to the way private 
members' business was conducted.  One of the very significant 
ones of course was that the voting would begin in the back rows 
so that the members in the front row— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  With unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, it was with unanimous 
consent when there were no Liberals in the House and we were able 
to sneak that through.  It was a coup of major proportions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members in the back no longer had the luxury of waiting for 
the members in the front to vote to see how they should vote, so 
they actually had to think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we dealt with the issue of pay raises for members of 
parliament.  In my speech on that topic I said that I had a 
motion to amend that particular bill.  I suggested that all 
Liberal members should be eligible for a raise in pay if they 
could say what it was they voted against when they voted against 
my amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am always delighted to be received with such enthusiasm by my 
colleagues across the way.  It is particularly interesting today 
how we are all just getting along so wonderfully well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we just listened to would have to be considered a 
pretty historic debate in this place and in this country.  I 
would not even call it a debate.  Perhaps it was a coronation, a 
very justifiable and proud moment for all Canadians.  This place, 
which is the representative body for all Canadians, and the 
government have made the decision to confer our citizenship, 
something that we all believe in so deeply, to Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly interesting to see the carryover.  I will 
try not to spoil the glow of euphoria which seems to be here 
because it is close to the break in session.  However, there are 
some things I feel I must point out in relationship to this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say right at the outset that I am delighted to vote 
in favour of the motion.  I made that decision, contrary perhaps 
to the beliefs of some members opposite, before I discussed it 
with anybody in my caucus or in my government.  I looked at it 
and said that it made sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had one private member's bill in four years drawn out of the 
lottery, which is very frustrating.  That one was drawn in the 
first three years of the parliamentary session, and I have yet to 
have another one drawn in the first year of the new session.  In 
four years I have submitted eight or so for consideration.  It is 
a lottery and I have never been very lucky at those kinds of 
things like gambling or buying lottery tickets, so it carries 
over to getting my private member's bill brought to the front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my name was drawn, the private member's bill I picked was 
one that would have created national standards for apprenticeship 
training from sea to sea to sea, in every province and in every 
territory.  It seemed to make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we do have a program called the red seal program, which 
recognizes apprenticeship programs across the country.  However 
it does not recognize the different categories of apprenticeship 
or provinces and the territories.  People may be qualified to 
work in a particular trade in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and 
Newfoundland, but they are not qualified to work in that same 
trade with that same training in Ontario or Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples of that.  It just seemed to me to be 
awfully silly when one of the roles of the national parliament 
was to fund post-secondary education.  Where we have perhaps gone 
off base is that we do not look at apprenticeship training as 
post-secondary education, and we should.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A ticket to practise as a carpenter, an electrician, a plumber, 
a pipefitter or any of those is as equally important and 
valuable, and in many cases more so, as a university degree. 
When people need a plumber, they do not care if that person has a 
university degree as long as he or she is capable of fixing 
whatever the problem happens to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was astounding to find out that our standards were all over

a private member's bill, so I drafted the bill and put it 
forward.  I waited patiently for my name to be drawn from the 
lottery and after three years it finally was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was then told that I had a five minute opportunity to go 
before a committee, which would then make a decision, after 
hearing from me, on whether my motion would be votable in the House 
of Commons.  There was never a question about having a debate. As 
we know, a member is given the opportunity in private members' 
hour to come here and line up speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I had support in just about every corner of this 
place, with the exception of the official opposition, because it 
transcended provincial boundaries.  This is one of the 
fundamental problems when dealing with private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic policy during the selection of private members' bills 
to be votable is that priority is given based on the fact that 
they should transcend purely local interest, not be couched in 
partisan terms and cannot be addressed by the House in other 
ways.  They also should not be part of the government business or 
the normal, ongoing routine that the government might be 
undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my case it was not.  In fact I attempted to have the 
government adopt my private member's bill as government 
legislation.  There were problems in the bureaucracy.  Why?  Even 
the bureaucracy thought that I was transcending provincial 
boundaries and interfering in the jurisdiction of the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about that.  It is extremely frustrating.  My private 
member's bill was a bill which, if this motion were in place, would 
have come on the floor of the House of Commons for a vote. In 
my opinion, notwithstanding opposition from the official 
opposition, I think it would have carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not asking that we take over apprenticeship training.  I 
recognize that in the province of Ontario, for example, 
apprenticeship training works extremely well with our community 
colleges.  It is a very successful and fundamental program.  I 
believe more and more people should be, and I hope are, 
encouraging their sons and daughters to look at this as an 
opportunity for a different career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lord knows, we do not need more lawyers.  We have plenty.  We 
also know that only a certain segment of our society perhaps will 
be doctors.  However we have a terrible shortage of skilled 
tradespeople within the construction industry across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the foreseeable future, the boom appears to be very lively 
for construction, whether it is something as fundamental as new 
housing or whether it is in infrastructure and trying to repair 
the damage which has occurred in our large communities as a 
result of the neglect in funding infrastructure over the last 
several years, as we all worship at the altar of tax cuts and 
reduced government.  We have seen a deterioration in the quality 
of life as a result of all levels of government.  The federal 
government, I admit, and provincial governments have cut back on 
the things that are fundamental and necessary to build good 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my motion had been allowed to come here perhaps we would be 
seeing more people entering the trades and more qualified people. 
We would have had an opportunity to increase this priority and 
provide information to young people on their opportunities.  The 
red seal program works to a certain degree and national building 
trades across the nation have instituted some good educational 
programs.  However even they are having difficulty in getting 
their message across.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, my private member's bill had the support in writing 
of many unions across the country that thought it was about time 
the national government established national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would something as seemingly sensible as national standards 
for apprenticeship training fail to survive?  It failed to 
survive because of the attitude, perhaps not partisan but 
certainly parochial, taken by members of the committee.  I 
cannot, will not and would not name names because the process has 
been internal and I respect the fact that those people work on 
the committee.  However the committee interfered in provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that by passing the opposition day motion we can move 
away from the attitude which permeates the caucus, what is left 
of it, of the official opposition.  It has an attitude that if it 
is federal it is bad and that if it is Ottawa it is too big and 
interferes with what it wants to see happen in Alberta or British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the weekly caucus meetings of the Alliance, the 
official opposition, are modelled after the show <I>The Weakest 
Link</I>.  We understand that they are having a problem.  We 
understand also that <I>The Weakest Link</I> appears to be their 
leader.  I do not want to be unfair but I want to talk about the 
fact that the members have become very myopic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Is 
the hon. member splitting his time?  I think his time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  No.  We are still on a 
20 minute speech and 10 minutes questions and comments.  The hon. 
member has another 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry you must put 
up with us for another 10 minutes but I will try to be gentle. 
One of the things that underlies the differences we have in this 
place is the constant criticism of the role of MPs.  It is almost 
like a sport.  It is done to try to denigrate the role of MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my submission that we have spent too much time over the 
past several months dealing with certain faux pas on all sides. 
If we turn on <I>Canada AM</I> at six o'clock in the morning all 
we hear about is the latest group to leave the opposition caucus 
or perhaps the latest member on the government side who has said 
something he or she regrets or wishes to apologize for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a body politic are being distracted on all sides of this 
place by the nonsense that is going on internally within our own 
caucuses and undermining our ability to represent our 
communities.  I say that in a spirit of non-partisanship which I 
am not normally prone to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In a show of non-partisanship with the member from Mississauga, 
this is his opportunity.  My point of order is this.  Given that 
the supply motion will pass with the seemingly unanimous consent 
of all parties, I ask for unanimous consent of the House to make 
private members' Motions Nos. 293 and 361 votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it should be obvious to 
anyone watching, if there is anyone watching, that the strategy 
of the opposition is to try to distract me.  However let me 
assure opposition members that they have failed for four years 
and will continue to fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a point to make that they apparently do not want to hear. 
When people stand in this place and continually assail members of 
parliament and say, to quote many of them, that we are trained 
seals or that we vote mindlessly, they know it is not the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of opposition members being expelled 
from their own caucus for rebellious attitudes.  We have seen 
more discipline invoked on that side of the House in the last 
couple of months than we have seen on this side of the House in 
the last seven or eight years.  Free votes are the standard 
within the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the private member's issue is not so much the 
government.  The current process is pretty standard.  We have a 
former cabinet minister in the Manitoba legislature with us.  I 
am sure he would agree that legislature had a similar process, 
although maybe not a lottery.  We had a different one in Ontario. 
However, private members' business was never taken seriously 
unless it was some kind of spectacular motion, outrageous bill or 
wonderful solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a private member's bill when I was an MPP in Ontario.  I 
had found out, quite to my surprise, that kids were spending 
their lunch money on lottery tickets for professional sports 
games.  I found out quite by accident.  I was lining up to make a 
purchase in a store in my community and a youngster in front of 
me was asking what the odds were on Monday night football.  When 
I asked what in the world that was about I was stunned to find 
out there was no age restriction on the purchase of lottery 
tickets to bet on professional sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore put forward a private member's bill.  I asked the 
premier at the time to support it.  It passed in three sessional 
days with unanimous support from all parties in the Ontario 
legislature.  In a record vote, in record time and with record 
numbers, we put an age restriction on the buying of lottery 
tickets to gamble on professional sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every once in a while an issue comes along that makes sense. 
Everyone was shocked by it, including Bob Rae, the premier of the 
day.  If I had gone the normal route and had not been able to 
seek unanimous consent it would have taken weeks, months, perhaps 
never, to get my private member's bill approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolute good sense, I hate to use the word common 
sense because it has been wrenched away from some of us in 
Ontario, in putting forth a motion like the one here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share some statistics.  It is interesting that the 
opposition party talks about democracy in this place, allowing 
free votes, not using closure and all those things.  I see the 
former leader of the current opposition party, the old Reform 
Party, is with us today and it is nice to see him here.  When he 
was leader of that party five of his MPs were suspended and 
several others demoted from their caucus positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the current leadership of course we all know of the gang 
of eight.  It may have swollen to 12; I missed the press 
conference today that I was so anxious to see.  Eight members 
have been booted out of caucus because they dared to speak out 
against their leader.  How can they or any one representing that 
party stand in their places, demand openness and accountability 
and accuse our government of using discipline too much while that 
party boots out eight members? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be as many as 12 members if the discipline reaches 
some of the higher profile members who spoke out, such as the 
member for Edmonton North, the first Reform member elected here. 
The minute she spoke out in opposition to the leadership there 
was a pretty loud pause as party members said that maybe they 
should not kick the mother of the Reform Party out of caucus. 
They backed off but now others have joined in.  In many ways it 
is a sad thing to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members might not believe that I think it is sad. 
However I spent five years in opposition in Ontario.  I happen to 
think the role of Her Majesty's loyal opposition is critical and 
very important to the functioning of any parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition spends its time setting up a firing squad, 
getting in a circle and shooting inwardly.  I do not know what it 
thinks it can possibly accomplish by that.  It then comes here 
and tell us it has the solution.  It says it will allow free 
votes and release all its members from any kind of party 
discipline.  It then turns around the next day and boots half 
them out of caucus.  Obviously the Canadian people would see, 
shall we say, inconsistencies in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson:</B>  Don't embarrass yourself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Time will wind down, I am sure, and it 
is in the control of the Speaker.  He will let me know when my 
time is up and the hon. members will have their opportunity if 
they so choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also share that between 1990 and the year 2000 in the 
Alberta legislature, with the obvious involvement of the current 
Leader of the Opposition, closure was used 36 times to cut short 
debate.  The current Alliance leader admitted that at one point 
closure was invoked after one hour of debate.  It was done not in 
response to filibustering on the part of the opposition but to 
prevent the possibility of delay.  That is astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alliance members then have the nerve to come into this place and 
be obstreperous in an attempt to stop good legislation from going 
through.  They stand and cry foul because the government has put 
in place a plan to ensure the legislation passes and carries the 
day.  It is mind boggling.  It is curious beyond belief to think 
they can stand there with any credibility whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will try to be non-partisan and not get too 
excited.  I congratulate the member on his motion.  I support it 
and hope it passes.  I am confident it will.  I think it will 
make the lives of all members on all sides much better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I heard the member across the way saying something.  He 
was going in all directions and discussing all kinds of things, 
so it took me a while to figure out what he was trying to say.  I 
picked up a couple of points and will ask him to clarify them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member alluded to his own private member's bill in the 
Ontario legislature and how it was, he said, passed in three 
days.  However I am sure it was less than the pay increase the 
government moved through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said how great his bill was.  The hon. member has been on the 
government side and could have easily worked hard to make sure 
the private member's bill was improved here.  I would ask him if 
it is the practice of the Ontario legislature to have every 
private member's bill votable.  If it is, I commend Ontario for 
having a good democracy.  Perhaps the member can tell us about 
that.  Are all private members' bills in the Ontario legislature 
votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must admit I am not 
100% sure.  Let me tell hon. members why.  As I recall the 
private member's motion I passed was supported unanimously. 
Certainly other private members' bills came forward.  The Ontario 
legislature does not have a lottery.  I can tell the House that. 
Members do not have to sit and wait forever to get on the docket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are substantially smaller numbers in terms of the members 
of the legislature.  The Ontario legislature has 103 members 
versus our 301, so it is a bit easier to manage.  However all 
votes are votable on Thursday morning if members can get their 
items through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What members of the Ontario legislature do not need to do is go 
before a committee of all members of the house and argue that 
their motions should be votable.  Members must make sure their 
motions fall in line with the law, so they go through the legal 
department. 
The lawyers check it over to make sure it is in proper form and 
it can be put forward.  I would honestly have to check as to 
whether or not it is a standard procedure to have them all 
votable.  My memory, which fades as I grow older, tells me that 
most of them were voted on, and I think it is a standard 
procedure.

Mr. Speaker, what a disappointment.  A mind is a terrible thing 
to waste and so is a seat in the House and 20 minutes of 
parliamentary time.  The member stood up and started and closed 
his remarks by saying that he would be non-partisan on a motion. 
I had just commended the government for supporting this 
initiative, as had the member for Elk Island, and what did we 
get?  It was like a Texas bull; a point here, a point there and a 
whole lot of bull in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot even answer a simple question about his own 
legislature.  I do not know if he even showed up there. Whether 
or not private members' bills are votable, does he not agree that 
this ought not to be a partisan issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite talk all the time about the need for 
parliamentary reform.  We know that in the shadows and in the 
corridors they talk about their frustration with the great 
concentration of power in the Prime Minister's Office.  This is 
not a partisan comment.  It is a systemic problem that applies to 
governments generally, not just this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we finally get the opportunity to actually take back some 
power from the executive and put it back into the hands of the 
legislators, like the member from Mississauga, we get instead 
this kind of partisan rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think it would be more constructive and 
helpful if all members were to treat these questions in as 
non-partisan a fashion as humanly possible and if we work 
together to improve the practices of the House?  Does he not 
believe that it would be a significant improvement in 
parliamentary democracy and would empower us to better represent 
our constituents if we had votable private members' bills? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the after 
dinner speaker.  Compared to my normal approach, I thought I was 
very non-partisan.  I do not know what they are upset about.  I 
thought I was quite gentle and balanced in saying that I support 
the motion and I congratulated the member.  It is just so hard 
not to fall into the trap, and I am sorry I did, of pointing out 
to Canadians the differences that occur between what members 
opposite say and what they actually do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that they have a caucus that is imploding before the 
very eyes of all Canadians and the infighting is detracting them 
from doing their job in this place, which is to support motions 
like this.  I say to the member who just asked the question that 
if members of his party could show me just once in one speech 
where they were non-partisan, maybe it would rub off and they 
would see a little more of it from me.

hon. member speak in the House.  I stumble when I say that at 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about discipline in parties, particularly 
our party, the opposition, and he claimed that we wrangle in our

</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth speaks volumes on the other side when we actually see 
what takes place on the government benches.  When there is a 
votable private members' business item in the House, all the 
members on the other side vote with the government regardless of 
how they feel.  Discipline speaks volumes on that side and very 
rarely do we see those hon. members stand in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they feel that a private member's bill from this side or any 
side is worth supporting, do they actually put their money where 
their mouths are and stand?  How many times has the hon. member 
actually voted in favour of an item of private members' business 
during the time that he has been here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I always find it curious 
that people get upset when someone comes to Ottawa under a 
particular banner, in their case Reform, now Alliance and in our 
case Liberal.  I am a member of the Liberal team and people should 
never be shocked that I support my team.  It is most interesting 
to use the analogy of someone playing on my hockey team and 
shooting the puck into my net on purpose.  I do not want that 
player on the ice any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty fundamental in our system that the vast majority of 
us, perhaps with the exception of the member for Wild Rose who 
wins 90% of the votes, come to this place as a result of the 
allegiance to the party for which we run.  In fact individual 
members will influence between 5% and 8% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as no shock to any member that we wind up 
supporting the particular party for which we were elected in this 
place.  I object to the criticism that we would not support 
things that are unusual or different.  Many of my members over 
here have voted for private members' bills against the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the motion today would eliminate that issue 
and should eliminate it so that we can all stand and vote on what 
are private members' bills.  That is why they are called private 
members' bills.  We on all sides of the House should be able to 
make up our own minds on how we vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to the motion dealing 
with private members' business.  I would also like to indicate 
that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Provencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite interesting to listen to my friend on the other 
side speaking about partisan politics and saying that they do not 
talk partisan politics.  The problem is that when he starts on 
the rhetoric it is necessary for us to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about setting the record straight, I would like to say 
that the motion we are debating was introduced and brought in by 
my hon. colleague sitting next to me.  I commend him for doing 
so.  I know he was on the committee and was extremely frustrated 
with the way things were going so he introduced this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what my friend on the other side said about all the 
problems or little turbulences my party is going through, I would 
like to tell Canadians that we have been elected to represent 
them in parliament and to hold the government accountable and 
that is exactly what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the motion dealing with private members' 
business is to ensure that members of parliament from all parties 
have the right to stand in parliament to speak on behalf of their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona asked the member a 
question about how many times he had voted independently, he gave 
us a great analogy of playing on a hockey team.  As Canadians 
have said time after time, and if he goes back to his riding and 
polls his constituents perhaps they will tell him, they want him 
to speak on their behalf. 
That is what he has been sent here for, not this team business. 
There are no goals to be scored here.  We have to stand up and 
represent our ridings, and that is what my colleague from 
Edmonton—Strathcona was asking of my friend on the other side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the issue of private members' business.  This is my 
second term in the House.  I am very grateful to my constituents 
of Calgary East that sent me here to debate issues they feel are 
important.  Based on that we try very hard to introduce private 
members' bills.  It is one of our vehicles as members of 
parliament who are not in government or who are not ministers to 
bring the concerns of Canadians to the floor of the House.  It 
was brought in over the years so that members of parliament could 
democratically represent their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my first term as a rookie MP I submitted a lot of private 
members' bills.  Lo and behold not one was chosen.  For four 
years I have stood on this side of the House and I could not 
address those issues.  When I was returned to the 37th parliament 
I reintroduced the same bills and two of my private members' 
bills were selected in the lottery system.  I thank God for 
having my bills selected because it is only through His hand that 
these bills were selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was preparing my private member's bill I consulted 
Canadians across the country and received their input. Those 
Canadians who felt these were important issues got excited.  One 
of my bills dealt with emancipation day to recognize Canada's 
contribution to the abolition of slavery.  Members of the black 
community were extremely excited and happy.  They gave me full 
support.  They even came here from Toronto to recognize this 
important day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had a private member's bill dealing with a minimum 
sentence of two years for repeat break and enter offenders. Over 
the last parliament I went across Canada.  I spoke on radio talk 
shows.  I received the support of Canadians, including the chiefs 
of police of Toronto, Saskatoon and Calgary, the police 
association of Calgary and the Canadian Police Association. There 
was a huge amount of support from all those groups.  When I 
brought my bill forward I thought it would be a non-partisan 
event and that it would be debated in the House of Commons so 
that Canadians would know on which side of the issue the 
government would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee that was set up to select private members' 
bills said that my bill would not be votable.  Suddenly all the 
hard work and excitement and all the associations that provided 
support meant nothing.  With it saying no, all I could do was stand in 
the House to speak to the bill for 10 minutes.  I spoke for 10 
minutes on the bill.  I might as well have gone home and spoken 
in front of a mirror because there was nothing I could do about 
it.  I was angry.  I spoke, sat down and said goodbye to all the 
effort that was put into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reintroduced that bill in the House today.  Unless we change 
the system the same thing will happen.  All the groups that work 
hard to bring issues to parliament will not have their voices 
heard because the government has a different agenda.  The 
government's agenda is not to represent every Canadian.  It is 
running the country and it has a different agenda, but as members 
of parliament we can bring issues forward through private 
members' bills.  We spend a lot of time getting support.  Then we 
come to the House, and why is it that three or four people decide 
whether or not a bill will be votable?

</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend on that committee felt frustration arising out of it 
and brought forward the motion we are debating today.  I was very 
pleased, in one degree, when I listened to the government House 
leader say he will support the bill.  All the other parties have 
said they will support the bill, so let me say that I am 
literally looking forward to returning to parliament in September 
when private members' bills are votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I can go out there and work hard as I can to bring a bill 
here and I can tell Canadians, yes, it will be brought to the 
House, it will be put to a vote and we will vote on it.  If the 
members over there on the government side and other members feel 
this is an important bill and vote for it without following party 
lines and not playing at teamwork, this will become a House that 
will gain the respect of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague speak in 
regard to private members' bills and I have to agree 100%.  I 
also agree with my colleague who brought forward the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too had the misfortune of sitting on the private members' 
committee.  I sat there and saw good bills from all parties in 
the House brought forward.  I watched the committee members 
bargaining away and heard them saying that bills could not come 
forward because they were too controversial.  I myself had the 
same frustrations with some of my own bills.  As a matter of fact 
I sat there in front of the committee on a bill regarding 
separation and had the committee tell me that the bill was too 
political to bring forward in the House of Commons.  The 
committee said it was too political.  This is supposed to be the 
most political House in the land and yet my bill was too 
political to be brought forward for debate in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to agree with the hon. member when he says that if this 
comes forward tonight—and it should pass—finally we will have a 
House that will truly represent the people, the constituents and 
the wishes of all parties in the House to see some good 
legislation come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member think it has taken so long for the 
frustration level to build up in members from all sides of the 
House?  This is the hon. member's second term and my third term. 
Why has it has taken so long for this to come forward in the 
House?  Does the hon. member have any answer for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can speculate.  It 
served the purpose of the government.  As I said, the government 
has a different agenda and the government controls this whole 
situation.  By not allowing bills to become votable, by going 
through the committee, the government could control what is going 
on.  We have seen that happen all year.  It was one way for the 
government to have total control of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ex-leader, the MP from Calgary Southwest who is in the 
chamber today, has stated on many occasions that the House has 
become dysfunctional.  As a matter of fact he has indicated his 
desire to leave politics because, as he has said, the House has 
become dysfunctional.  He is a member whom Canadians highly 
respect, a member who has worked tirelessly for the country, and 
who, as the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, has 
firsthand knowledge of how dysfunctional the House has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer my colleague, that is why Canadians were losing 
respect for the chamber, because it was dysfunctional and 
everything was controlled by the government, by a small 
government and a concentration of power in the PMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first step.  I can speculate that the reason it is 
the first step and the government has agreed to this is that 
because finally even Canadians outside have spoken out and have 
said they need some substance out of the House.  They have said 
“We have given them a pay raise.  They had better deliver”.  I 
am glad that we have been given this opportunity to work for 
that.

the member talks about this place being dysfunctional.  Would he

individual MPs or all of the problems that are occurring within

question and I thank the hon. member for asking it.  Today this 
motion, this hard work, was put through by my colleague working 
as the official opposition.  That is what we are doing over here. 
That is what our job is as the opposition and we are doing it. 
That is why today we are debating the motion.  I remind the 
member that the motion came from the Alliance, not the Liberals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on the supply motion because I 
believe private members' business is a vital tradition in 
parliament and I believe that we need to revive the spirit of the 
tradition in order to maintain the confidence we have in our 
democracy and in our parliamentary system.  Despite some of the 
cynicism we hear, people are still convinced that it is through 
parliament that true democratic reforms come, and we need to 
ensure that we revitalize our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my remarks by citing a 1985 report of the 
McGrath committee, which was established to make recommendations 
in the House in respect of House reform.  I will quote from page 
2 of the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the private member is to count for anything, there must be a 
relationship between what the private member and the institution 
of Parliament can do and what the electorate thinks or expects 
can be done. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a connection among the member, the institution and the 
electorate.  This is a fundamental point of what we are trying to 
do here, I think.  The people of Canada elect us their 
representatives to the House of Commons and they have the 
expectation that each of us will be permitted to be productive 
and useful members with ideas and initiatives of our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members are authorized to be little more than voting 
machines or seat warmers, it not only feeds into our own cynicism 
about what we are doing here but more significantly it fosters 
public cynicism, pessimism and mistrust in parliament and in 
politicians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of parliament for about six months and, if 
one does not guard against it, I think cynicism can overwhelm 
one.  Except for minor variations with government bills, we know 
exactly what will happen time and again.  The government 
introduces a bill, we debate it, we sit through committee 
testimony and we propose amendments, which are usually shot down. 
We debate it some more and then we vote and the government bill 
passes.  This is a fact of life when we have a majority 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served in a provincial legislature.  I understand the need for 
majority governments to control the agenda, to move certain 
issues through.  I understand and respect it, but the realities 
of a majority government to me present all the more reason to 
revisit the procedural aspects of private members' business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the two are inconsistent.  The agenda of a 
government is a legitimate thing, but there is also the agenda of 
private members.  Private members are the backbone of the House. 
The executive is here to serve the private members, but in our 
modern age parliament has been stood on its head.  In order to at 
least regain some balance, this initiative by my colleague from 
the Canadian Alliance is crucial.  I think Canadians expect it of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills and motions now are not effective.  Yet 
they are really the only way that a member outside of cabinet, 
whether on the government side of the House or on the opposition 
side, can advance his or her own proposals and initiatives. 
Government business is government business and that is fine, but 
private members' business should not be dictated by government, 
directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the process is that we have a subcommittee of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which includes 
just six members in the House who determine what private members' 
bills will be heard.  All initiatives of members outside of 
cabinet are governed by only six individuals, and the consent of 
those six individuals must be unanimous to make it votable.  Six 
individuals control the entire private members' agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of the 37th parliament, Alliance MPs have 
had 24 items drawn to be placed on the order of precedence, but 
only 2 items have been deemed votable.  In the second session of 
the 36th parliament, there was a total of 772 bills and motions 
introduced.  Only 70 of those were drawn and of those only 21 
were made votable, only 21 private members' bills out of 772. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we continue to go back to our constituents and tell them “I 
want to represent you and I want to represent the concerns in my 
constituency”.  Yet six members in the House, unless we acquire 
unanimous consent, will shut down the voice of my constituents 
each and every time, only six members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this happen?  Let us say I get an idea in my head.  The 
member from Mississauga might not think it is a good idea but it 
is an idea nonetheless.  I get an idea in my head, I call 
legislative counsel to draft the bill, the bill goes on the order 
paper, it is drawn to be placed in the order of precedence, it is 
debated, it is dropped from the order paper, and we never hear 
about it again if this six person subcommittee has not already 
decided that we ought to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the criteria for the votable items?  I do not know.  I 
am just a private member.  I am only here to represent my 
constituents.  I do not know what criteria this secret committee 
applies.  Who influences these criteria?  Who tells these six 
members how this is done?  I do not know and I also do not know 
if the House will ever find out.  We can draw up all kinds of 
lists and say this is what we will do, but who influences the 
agenda?  Because if that agenda does not come before the House, 
we know that the government influences that agenda.  As long as 
the government does not think it too controversial or too 
divisive or too embarrassing, it might allow it.

the public, away from the eyes of the electorate who have a right 
to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is somebody from your own party on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  They say even a member of my own party is 
on that committee.  Yes, and we are not allowed to say in the 
House why certain things are not made votable.  Can I stand up 
today and say in the House why a certain thing was not made 
votable?  We cannot say it in the House.  Those are the rules and 
the Liberal members know that.  I cannot say it was a New 
Democrat who shut down a matter that was non-votable.  I am not 
allowed to say it to the members.   I am not allowed to say it 
here in the House.  We all know that, so let us not pretend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the best way to reflect the democratic nature of our 
parliament is to make all private members' bills and motions 
votable.  I think we could reduce the number of bills, but I say 
we should let them all be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to stand in support of this motion and I would ask all of 
you to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I ask the hon. member to address 
his comments to the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sorry that the member has such a cynical view of what happens. 
In fact some of the information he has presented has cast a light 
on this that quite frankly is not a fair reflection. For 
instance, he gave the example that only 21 private members' items 
in the second session of the 36th parliament out of 772 were 
actually votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the second session of the 36th parliament had private 
members' business on every required day.  There was only room for 
that many, for 72.  We could have had a million bills put in and 
it would not have mattered.  We could only deal with 72 during 
the second session of the 36th parliament.  In fact, 21 out of 
the 70 were votable.  That is as prescribed by the rules of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also asked about the criteria.  The criteria are 
published.  He also talked about some secret committee.  There 
are two members of the government and four members of the 
opposition on the committee.  It is not just somebody controlling 
it.  They happen to be our representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made one statement that I really disagree with.  He 
said that private members' business is ineffectual.  I want him 
to answer this question.  Does he know what Bill C-204 was in the 
last parliament?  Does he know it was never drawn?  Does he know 
that it was never voted on?  However, does he know that it was in 
the last throne speech and that we now have parental leave for a 
full year because a private member had an idea and put it in a 
bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, why would I want to get up 
and do anything but praise the one member who had an idea and who 
was lucky enough to get it through this maze? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this member did not tell the people of Canada in his 
question is that even if the bill meets all the criteria, it 
still does not mean it is votable.  There is still a huge element 
of discretion, the discretion that is influenced by political 
thought and political correctness, by questions like “Is this 
divisive?  Will this be embarrassing?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not disagreeing with the member.  These are my observations 
after being here for six months.  Maybe I am mistaken.  Maybe I 
will grow to be just as cynical as he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that the government presently has a very 
effective means of presenting its agenda and getting it through 
the House. 
Every government bill is votable unless the government itself 
hoists it.  However, that is called government business.  Why can 
private members' business not simply be the business of private 
members?  If a private member is lucky enough to get the bill 
into the House, it should be votable unless that private member 
deems it not to be votable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened carefully to the words of the hon. 
member for Provencher, and I must say that he made several points 
of interest to us in his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his final remark about not knowing the criteria, I would 
state that, just by chance, I have them here before me.  I would 
like to make a comment and then ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1999, in a report to the House, the standing committee 
on private members' business established the new list of criteria 
for selection of votable private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five points.  What is important is that, in the House 
of Commons, it is his party that ought to inform him on this, or 
he ought to contact the committee to find out what the criteria 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should he not get these directly from the House of Commons or 
from his party? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I have already 
answered that.  I do not have any dispute with the criteria, but 
if the member is saying that these criteria will determine that 
these items are in fact votable, he is wrong.  My understanding 
is that even if every criterion is met an item is still not 
votable.  There is still that hidden amount of discretion.  As 
hon. members, as private members on both sides of the House, we 
need to maybe narrow down the number of bills but make them all 
votable so that the exercise is a realistic one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been sitting here listening for the last couple 
of hours to three years of my life being bandied about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite who introduced this motion and who I respect 
greatly knows that I spent two years as chair of the committee, 
in 1996-97, and that I just spent the last year chairing it. 
Despite what members think, the easiest thing in the world for me 
would be to vote to make everything votable, tomorrow, tonight, 
whenever we vote on it, because it would get rid of a very tough 
job that I am forced to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I honestly have not made up my mind how I will vote 
because I do not believe it will help the private members' 
process to make everything votable.  I sincerely believe it will 
diminish the process.  It will make it partisan.  It will make it 
irrelevant.  I have to learn to get over that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, excuse me, but I forgot to say that I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has developed and improved since the 1980s.  Several 
people have referred to the McGrath report.  We brought in 
modifications in 1997-98.  Although the party opposite takes 
credit for slipping that through the House, some of those 
modifications sprung full blown from my head, one of which was 
voting from the back rows down because it took the obligation 
away from the back rows of both sides of the House to follow the 
front rows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We streamlined the criteria so that members can bring in private 
members' bills that do focus on one province or one area.  Before 
it was not allowed.  We brought in and tested the one hundred 
signature rule because people were very frustrated with the 
lottery.  We brought in another one that no one has referred to 
all day, which is an obligation for a committee to report back 
within six months so an item could not be deep-sixed at a 
committee.  Otherwise it is deemed brought back in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made amazing progress and I would like to take some 
credit for that.  That is why I am not sure.  It is like the old 
adage “Be careful what you ask for because you might get it”. 
We may find out that it is not what we really wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the lottery, I think we will be dropping it because 
of the confusion.  People do not realize when they sign in the 
hundred signature rule whether they are supporting the concept of 
the bill or signing to get it to go through without the lottery 
or signing it because they think an item should be votable.  We 
have had some confusion on that, as members know.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria, as I mentioned, have been diminished.  They are 
down to five simple criteria, one of them an improvement that 
says if the member is from out west the member can bring in an 
issue that is strictly for the west and the member's item will 
not be thrown out because it does not apply to the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern that a lot of the private members' bills we see 
now are reruns of government bills that passed through the House. 
Gun control has come up many times in the lottery.  I do not know 
how many times the House could take another run at a bill like 
that.  We would be opening ourselves to a lot of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would need to filter the bills no matter what is 
decided. If the House decides that they should all be votable, 
they will still have to be looked at using some criteria that we 
have talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of making everything votable has been the subject of 
two surveys, one in 1998 and one in 2001.  What has been 
consistent in those surveys is that people are disaffected. 
People do not like the system.  In 1998, 71% were unhappy with 
the system. This year 77% are unhappy.  In 1998, 48% wanted 
everything votable and this time we have 62%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is also important to note that only 109 
people out of 301 responded from the House.  Seventy-five of 
those people have tabled bills.  Fifty-six have had them drawn 
and 36 have had them made votable.  I do not know where the 
statistics I have been hearing bandied about came from, but fully 
33% of those bills have been votable, which is exactly what we 
were asked to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two-thirds, two or maybe three bills before 1993, ever 
became law in this country.  One was the Prime Minister's, which 
named Air Canada.  Another in 1993 was my opponent's, whose bill 
banning hookah pipes was passed, which I am sure has had a 
devastating effect on the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a dozen passed and made into law since 1993.  So 
despite the bleating to the contrary that the Liberal government 
has been restricting democracy, I think we have done very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I sound like I am taking this personally, I am.  I have spent 
a lot of time on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members will be very concerned when they see that with 
the 312 hours allocated we could get 104 bills and motions 
through in three and a half to four years.  How would members 
choose those bills?  We would have to go back to the nasty old 
lottery.  The opportunity for whipped votes would increase 
because there is far too much for people to pay attention to in 
the House.  If everything is made votable, I think the adage 
after a while will be “if it is proposed by the opposition we 
will vote against it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would reduce the significance of the bills because anything 
could get through.  As for the ones that do get through now in 
this nasty process that has been described, everybody pays 
attention to them because they have already come through one 
hurdle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members choose to introduce motions and bills, as the 
member for Mississauga South mentioned.  They never make it into 
votability, but the concept gets introduced.  Somebody pays 
attention to it.  Even though it was not votable it got an hour 
in the House and sometimes the government pays attention to a 
good idea even if it was not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that we would get into the old U.S. style 
system whereby paid lobbyists and huge corporations will be 
forcing members to put bills into the House as their private 
members' bills with threats or with the rewards offered by 
companies that have a lot of money.  I think we can see that 
happening in the States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned members would need a screening process, because I 
cannot understand after living this for three out of the last 
seven and a half to eight years how it would be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members would also have an obligation to put bills forward 
which would reflect small, noisy, highly skilled lobby groups in 
their ridings.  Members might not agree with them.  Members can 
see that when they put in petitions.  Some of the petitions 
members put in they agree with.  Some petitions members have hard 
time putting in, but it has to be done.  Members might also be 
subjected to intense lobbying by single issue groups in the 
ridings that say they know there is one bill that is votable and 
they have one they want put in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact we have been royally dissed today, I would like 
to thank everybody who has served on the committee.  It is not an 
easy task.  I actually had one of my own members of my own 
government kick my door and leave marks all over it because he 
was angry that we did not make his bill votable and he thought I 
had something to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tough job.  I compliment the members of the opposition 
because it is not always unanimous, but it is by consensus, and 
it is based on criteria and, yes, it is subjective.  However, I 
think we function well and I am very proud of everybody who sits 
on that committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the process already ongoing, we have a survey and 
the results.  We have the Kilger committee looking at 
parliamentary reform.  I really believe the motion itself is 
redundant because it asks that all private members' bills be made 
votable, and we have heard from the government side that it is 
ready to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I care very much about private members' business. 
That is why I have been cautious since we started the review in 
1997.  If I did not care about it I would say that we should just 
let it go because it does not matter.  I am very concerned that 
members will get a package that they do not really understand. 
They will not know what happened to them.  They will not 
understand how difficult it will be to fight off the lobbyists, 
the heavy groups in their ridings that will try to force them to 
do this or that and stand up in the House of Commons and 
sometimes fight for things they do not understand or believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe each bill will become less and less important 
as more bills are introduced without any screening process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to take exception to a couple 
of things the hon. member said, and I respect very much the work 
she has done.  However I believe we can make it work.  If it 
works in other jurisdictions, why can it not work here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard an example given by her own colleague who had 
experience in the Ontario legislature, where all bills and 
motions that went through were deemed votable.  If it can work 
there, why can it not work here?  Are we somehow that much 
different that it cannot work here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She expressed the concern that there would be too many whipped 
votes.  I maintain it must continue to be a free vote in order 
for it to be meaningful and that we must take more of an interest 
in the issues that are before the House.  This has the potential 
to revitalize parliament.  Therefore, we should try to make it 
work, and we can make it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the bills or motions not deemed votable even when all 
the criteria are met?  Obviously, they are not and that is a 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, if an issue arises that the government has had in the 
House, would that not indicate that Canadians still had a concern 
about that issue and that we should still listen to those 
concerns?  I do not think that is an argument for not bringing an 
issue to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a huge respect 
for the member who just asked the question, but I will correct 
him anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Mississauga West was not absolutely sure 
if all the bills are votable in the Ontario legislature.  Since I 
have never been a member there I am not sure either.  Therefore, 
I do not think we can use that as an example of something that 
works because we are not absolutely sure if it does turn out that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whipped votes are a serious concern of mine.  It is not 
because we are whipped on this side of the House on private 
members' bills at all.  We are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a perfect example, I would cite the bill put forward by the 
member for Davenport, which is very difficult for the government 
to cope with right now.  I am sure when we selected that as a 
votable bill we were less than popular with our side of the 
House.  However the labelling of genetically modified foods was 
an issue of significance to the whole country.  The committee, in 
a non-partisan way, made that votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am not concerned that it is going to be whipped 
that way.  I am concerned that we will have a volume of material 
come through that will be a little bewildering.  If it is assumed 
that we will be able to force 301 members to pay close attention 
to every bill, I cite the fact that we had 109 responses out of 
301 on a survey that was very carefully worded, very carefully 
put together and hand delivered to every office. We will have a 
really hard time ensuring that.  I am not just being pessimistic, 
I am legitimately concerned.

a very difficult position.  I had the opportunity to serve with 
her when she was chairperson.  It was an interesting challenge 
and very frustrating, yet at all times she managed to sort of 
keep her head and keep us moving forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the actual choices, basically our motion today 
would take away from her and her committee the right to scuttle a 
bill before it comes to the House.  In other words, we are saying 
that all private members' business should be votable and it would 
be then the duty of the member to make sure the criteria was met 
so it would have a reasonable chance of passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she agree with that?  Does she support the motion we have 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I already have 
mentioned, I am having trouble with it because I am more 
pessimistic than the member is.  I legitimately believe a year or 
two from now we will look at this and say oops.  It is like the 
100 signature rule.  I am not optimistic about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not I will support it will be one of those moments 
when just before the vote comes to me, I will make up my mind in 
a non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Elk Island mentioned, he also sat on the 
committee under my tutelage.  I was very pleased he was there. 
He is a very mathematical person and liked to give things points. 
It was a very subjective committee, so I admire him for not 
killing me in the process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
supporting the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business has been a big part of my career as a 
parliamentarian.  Since 1993 I have had the honour of having over 
20 bills and motions presented and tabled in the House.  I also 
had about eight items selected in the lottery.  Half of them 
turned out to be votable.  I have had some success, and it was 
very rewarding.  However the best outcome one could have for a 
private member's item is not going through the whole gyration and 
cycle and having the government adopt the item and implement it. 
That is what is most important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact that is exactly what happened in the last parliament 
with Bill C-204 extending parental leave to a full year from six 
months.  My bill was sat there for six months and never got drawn 
in the lottery.  However the government decided to proceed on it 
and included it in the throne speech and the very next budget.  It has 
now been implemented and is a very important and valued program 
for Canadians.  The bill itself never got a moment of debate in 
the House other than on the budget.  There are many ways to look 
at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we will support the motion, one of the things I would like 
to do is open the envelope a bit and propose to the House another 
way to do this.  I do not believe that everyone can have a 
votable item.  It is just not practical.  I do not believe that 
everyone is interested in having a votable item either.  Our 
history shows us that a very small percentage of House members 
even care to participate in private members' business.  They have 
other responsibilities and are not prepared to do the work that 
is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members who wish to participate should submit their names.  I 
do not how many that would turn out to be.  Then we could have 
one lottery only to determine the order in which the members 
would bring forward their items.  All we establish is their 
placement on the list so members can plan for when their items 
will come up.  I think that is the best way to ensure we include 
members who want to participate, and to establish an order, which 
has to be done somehow.  A lottery seems to be as fair as 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the issue of the private members' committee business, 
the credibility issue is something that will be very difficult to 
deal with.  I believe the committee should continue to exist but 
it should be there to ensure that items meet the published 
criteria.  The committee should say yea or nay.  If it says nay a 
communication should be passed on to the member proposing the bill 
or motion that the criteria has not been met.  That is its 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we determine votability?  Members who have been to the 
private members' business committee and have done their three 
minute dog and pony show know that there very few questions are 
asked.  In fact, very few substantive questions are asked because 
the members are dealing with dozens of items. 
They cannot be prepared themselves.  They cannot do the job.  It 
really is not doing anyone's bill justice quite frankly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members know that private members' items cannot be complex 
animals.  They have to be quite focused and quite specific 
because we do not have a lot of time to grasp the attention or 
the interest of the House to support it.  It has to be somewhat 
focused.  We can see by those that have been successful over the 
last few years in the parliaments that many of them are quite 
straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one I remember and thought was excellent had to do with 
employment insurance benefits and what happened to someone who 
was called on jury duty.  The old law said people would lose 
their EI benefits because they were being paid for jury duty.  It did 
not make sense because jury duty paid $10 a day and employment 
insurance paid something different.  I thought it was an 
important bill.  It was a small one but an important one because 
it was an inequity situation.  I think those are good, solid 
types of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the votability, I like the process that we went 
through recently.  We operated under a committee of the 
whole procedure whereby members who were interested assembled 
around the Chair in somewhat informal fashion.   I would like to 
see members whose bills or motions have met the criteria and have 
been approved by the committee come to the House, do their five 
minutes and give their best reasons and arguments why their item 
should be votable.  They would then be subject to questions and 
comments from anyone who wanted to participate.  A record and 
transcript would be available for people who were interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members could ask questions if they did not understand something, or 
if they thought the motion was off base or thought it was a great 
idea.  There would be some feedback, which we have never had.  We 
would then have a process.  Members would determine whether an 
item was worthy of taking up any more of the House's time and 
whether, was worthy of additional hours of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could take that committee responsibility and put it as part of a 
committee of the whole.  We could let members stand in front of 
their peers, make their best case and ask their peers to consider 
it.  I think in one evening, with a five minute question and 
comment on a five minute or three minute presentation, we could 
probably do six bills and motions in one evening.  We could then 
have a vote on a scheduled day of votes to determine the items 
with which we would proceed.  It would be open, transparent and 
fair.  Members would have to do their work to earn the support of 
their colleagues for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business should have the same status as 
government bills.  The process we go through has a subsidiary 
role in terms of importance in how it is dealt with in the House. 
Once this Chamber decides an item should be votable, it should be 
accorded all the attention that any other government bill 
should have.  That would mean if members wanted to debate it for 
more than two hours or three hours they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, when a bill goes to committee then comes back, it should 
not have to go to the bottom of the list and wait 30 sitting days 
before it can be brought up again.  It should depend on when the item 
should be called and there can be rules there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with many members that private members' business ought 
to be accorded the same weight of importance in this place 
because it is important not just for the members proposing it, it 
is also important to the people of Canada because their 
representatives are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of process basically puts the challenge to members. It 
is an important challenge not to be frivolous, not to abuse the 
process, because if we come forward here and put items in front 
of our peers which are not meritorious of taking up the House's 
time people will develop a reputation.  We know that to get a private 
member's item or anything passed in this place a member must earn 
the respect of colleagues on all sides.  Members pay a price when 
they play partisan and petty politics in this place and do things 
that they should not.  When they embarrass this place, they 
should not expect to earn the respect of the House for their 
bills or their motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge is to us all.  I think we are looking for 
transparency, but I do not think we should try for a panacea 
whereby everyone gets everything they want.  That is just not 
possible. 
Let us be reasonable and professional.  Let us be members of 
parliament and make decisions based on merit.  Those who do good 
work and earn respect and credibility within this place are the 
ones who will be successful in parliament.

Speaker, the member has participated very enthusiastically in 
private members' business, not only in the process but also in 
promoting his own private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to votability he said that some members did not 
want to participate and never prepare private members' bills or 
motions.  That would certainly reduce the number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was proposed earlier today during debate that we might 
increase the number of hours allotted per week to private 
members' business by adding an hour first thing in the morning 
and another in the evening.  Another suggestion was to have all 
day Friday devoted to private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Friday were devoted to private members' business, would that 
not make it very difficult to ever promote the idea?  Most 
members would take Friday as a day to go back to their riding as 
many of them do that now for legitimate reasons.  It would mean 
that we would be trying to promote the idea of private members' 
business without members being present to hear the debate.  When 
it would come time to vote it would be very difficult.  Could the 
member respond to that idea and how we would handle it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the principle that I would 
prefer to follow would be that private members' business be 
accorded the same attention as government bills.  I would not 
want to ostracize or somehow categorize private members' business 
as something bunched together and brought forward on a day when 
somebody might not be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If private members' bills are to be given the credibility and the 
respect they deserve, they should be built into the calendar so 
that they get regular attention in the scheduling of 
parliamentary business.  I would have some difficulty in 
suggesting that we do this on Fridays.  It would be contrary to 
the spirit of equality between the status of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had a funny idea.  We talked 
a bit about MPs getting a raise in salary.  There is no doubt in 
my mind that increasing the authenticity of private members' 
business by making things votable would do something to justify 
paying a member of parliament an executive level salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my hare-brained idea.  What would happen if we were to 
tell members that a random roll call would be taken at some time 
every month during private members' business and receipt of one's 
salary for that month would be dependent on the member being in 
the House during private members' business?  It is a hare-brained 
idea but maybe it would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member speaks 
for himself.  I would like to take the last moment that I have to 
reinforce the basic principle that although I would like to have 
all members have everything they want, good bills require special 
attention, research and a lot of work.  I do not believe that all 
bills and motions introduced in this place meet that standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to earn respect for the work we do on our private 
members' bills and motions, there must be a mechanism which 
demands excellence in the work done.  It would be reflected in 
the quality of the bills and motions brought forward if the 
standard were set high enough to warrant private members' 
business having the same status as government bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Yellowhead.  It is a great pleasure to rise today to address the 
motion put forward by my hon. colleague from Yorkton—Melville. I 
wish to unequivocally state my 100% support for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the vast audience out there in TV land 
watching the debate, I will begin by explaining what private 
members' business is and why it is so vital to our democratic 
process that the mechanism be strengthened from its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our parliamentary system the vast majority of time, resources 
and attention is devoted to government legislation. Bills 
introduced by ministers of the crown further the political 
agenda of the government of the day.  However we as members of 
parliament are elected by our constituents to represent them 
here, rather than to represent this place to them, and to raise 
their issues of concern.  As most of parliament's time is devoted 
to government legislation, our opportunity to act in a 
legislative capacity on behalf of the people we represent falls 
to the one hour of debate each day that is allotted to private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give our audience an appreciation of the frustration that MPs 
feel over private members' business and the process through which 
it is chosen, I will briefly review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of bills and motions are introduced in the House of 
Commons.  Each one represents hours upon hours or in some cases 
days and weeks of research and work, but most never see the light 
of day.  In order for a bill to actually be debated in the House, 
an MP's name must first be drawn from a lottery.  The competition 
is fierce.  There are 301 MPs with just one hour a day, one item 
per day, and approximately 135 sitting days per year.  The math 
should be evident to everyone, particularly to my hon. colleague 
from Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When and if a member's name is finally drawn, he or she can put 
forward a bill for debate and then the real challenge begins. 
Having beaten the odds and come this far, the bill in question is 
still not even eligible for a vote in the House of Commons.  This 
means that we end up using the precious little time we have 
available to debate motions and bills which simply disappear upon 
the expiry of their one hour debate.  Such non-votable bills and 
motions have absolutely no chance whatsoever of becoming law. It 
is debate for debate's sake and in my opinion it is a waste of 
valuable time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as members of parliament want our issues to come to a 
vote, we must appear as witnesses before a special subcommittee 
to plead our case and argue why our bill or motion should be 
granted one of ten designations of votable status.  The rules of 
the House explicitly ensure that most private members' business, 
if debated, does not get to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse for opposition members, many of whom 
naively look to private members' business as their sole source of 
parliamentary effectiveness, the government maintains a majority 
of members on the subcommittee that decides which precious few 
bills become votable and which ones get to be a waste of valuable 
time.  The government can use this majority to ensure that issues 
which run too contrary to the government's own vision have no 
chance of being subject to a vote in the House of Commons and 
therefore becoming law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very lucky items which, against all odds, are drafted, 
tabled, drawn, argued and finally awarded votable status go 
through a slightly different process.  They get three hours of 
debate, one hour at a time, separated by about 30 sitting days, 
which means that in reality it takes about half the year just to 
get through the first stage of debate and come to an initial 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very exceptional circumstances when the government cannot 
force its own MPs to vote to kill a private member's bill, it has 
other levers to kill private members' bills more quietly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if a bill passes second reading and is referred to a 
committee for further review, the government uses its numerical 
dominance of the committee to simply see to it that the item on 
the agenda mysteriously never comes up for consideration before 
the House has prorogued.  The bill is thus buried in committee 
and never seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, another famous tactic, one which the government employed 
against one of its own members in the last parliament, is strong 
arming its committee members to debate every clause of the bill 
and report the bill back to the House as a blank piece of paper. 
This actually happened, as the member for Mississauga East can 
attest.  It is one of the greatest affronts to representative 
democracy that we have seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, failing even such draconian measures, if a private 
member's bill hypothetically manages to pass all stages of debate 
in the House of Commons, it must be brought forth for debate in 
the Senate.  The Senate is faced with the same issue of whether 
or not it is to be given votable status in the other place.  Our 
colleague from Scarborough Southwest has fallen victim to this 
sort of game in the previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, these measures are not even necessary.  The whole 
private members' process is so drawn out that most bills and 
motions end up dying somewhere on the order paper when an 
election is called.  I hope this summary serves to illustrate the 
absolute futility of the current private members' process.  A 
mechanism which should be the greatest tool of parliamentarians 
becomes a joke.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current structure originates with the McGrath report of 1985 
which established the votability rules and the lottery system 
that created the order of precedence for debate.  The McGrath 
report summarized the state of private members' business when it 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House does not attach any great importance to private 
members' business as it is now organized.  Our proposals are 
designed to achieve a number of improvements in the way private 
members' business is dealt with.  They would tighten the 
conditions of the ballot, widen the scope of private members' 
legislation, and ensure that some private members' bills and 
motions come to a vote. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that the democratic bar was already so low that a 
major objective of the single and greatest private members' 
business reform had to be to ensure that some private members' 
bills and motions came to a vote.  The low bar has meant that the 
reformed system, with some minor subsequent reforms, has led to the 
mediocrity with which we operate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single greatest impediment to the effectiveness of private 
members' business is votability.  While other matters of 
procedure also require attention, I would argue that by the very 
act of making all private members' legislation votable we would 
be forcing the House to take private members' business seriously. 
Members would attend the debates and consult their constituents 
over the issues put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the defenders of the status quo the same arguments tend to 
resurface.  I will recount just a few.  First, non-votable bills 
are useful because they raise awareness of issues.  This argument 
is uneconomical.  Why not raise awareness of important issues and 
give the House the power to pronounce upon them without having to 
repeat the process at a later time?  Private members' business is 
scarce enough as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if all bills were votable, fewer bills would be 
considered because of the differential in debate time between 
votable and non-votable items.  This argument is also an 
obfuscation.  I believe that all members of this place would 
gladly see a reduction in the debatable time to a standard one 
hour if it meant their bills would have a hope of actually coming 
to a vote.  This solution would increase the number of bills 
considered in the current structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a democratically elected majority government should have 
control of the legislative agenda and not cede it to opposition 
members.  Such an argument is an insult to opposition members and 
government backbenchers alike.  The regional cleavages in Canada 
dictate that if private members' business is shut down then 
certain regions are effectively shut out of the legislative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore I would argue that if a government is scared of 
ideas and of free votes in the Commons it is no longer deserving 
of the right to govern.  How much more legitimate can a 
government be than if it allows absolute freedom to debate and 
freedom to vote while still maintaining the confidence of members 
of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does general votability work?  I want to point to a few 
examples.  The Quebec standing orders state that apart from being 
referred to a committee before second reading “the general rules 
pertaining to bills shall apply to private bills”.  The Alberta 
standing orders state that “the standing orders relating to 
public bills apply to private bills”.  The Ontario rules state 
that the speaker is to put the question at 12 noon each Thursday 
for all private members' bills considered that week.  They all 
get a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to look upon today's debate as a 
golden opportunity to restore an important pillar of democracy to 
our assembly.  In an age where power is increasingly concentrated 
in the Prime Minister's Office, and where party whips dangle 
carrots of travel or promotion in exchange for obedience, we must 
stand guard against allowing our House of Commons to become a 
technical afterthought to elite decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as individual members have the power today to support the 
motion and take back a part of the democratic power that has been 
bestowed upon us by our constituents and is a vital institution 
of the Westminster parliamentary system of which we are proud to 
be a part. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I hesitated for a moment to ask questions or make 
comments because I wanted to give others an opportunity to 
participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enjoyed the speech from our rookie member and congratulate him 
on having such insight into private members' business. 
Does he have any comment with respect to what people in his 
riding are saying are the issues and what they would like him to 
bring forward?  Does he think that if the motion passes today, as 
we anticipate it will, it will enhance his ability to represent 
his constituents?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course the answer is yes. 
I came here with fewer illusions than some members because I had 
worked as an adviser on the Hill before being elected.  I 
realized that private members had limited influence on the major 
agenda of the day.  It struck me that it therefore made sense to 
try to be as good a constituency representative as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are any number of local issues that might not come to the 
attention of ministers and the ministry.  It is only natural that 
issues which are important locally would not emerge at the 
national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite a couple of issues of interest.  I will bring before 
the House, among other things, the issue of one of the highways 
that goes through my riding, Highway 7.  It has come to be known 
as the killer strip due to the large number of fatal accidents 
that occur on it.  It is a two lane highway with a very high 
traffic volume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of level crossings is an area of federal jurisdiction 
because rails are within federal jurisdiction.  Every town in the 
Ottawa valley has level crossings.  The funding formula for 
providing warning signs is arcane and hard to work with.  In my 
home town of Carleton Place the street I live on has low traffic 
volume and uses wig-wags.  The major street in town uses only 
lights to warn of a coming train.  This sort of thing has 
recently led to a fatality in the Ottawa valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues of importance on a different level. 
Religious freedom in China is of great importance to me and to 
some of my constituents who are practitioners of Falun Gong. Some 
of them have friends or relatives in China who have been arrested 
for practising their faith.  These are some of the issues it 
would be nice to put before the House and see come to a vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to be able to speak to the motion. It 
alarms and amazes me.  I have only been here six months.  When I 
talk to my constituents back home and explain to them that we can 
come into this place, discuss private members' business or any 
business and not be able to vote on it freely or even at all, it 
is absolutely unbelievable in their minds.  It is very difficult 
to explain it to them.  What I have seen and witnessed in this 
place since I have been here has increasingly impressed upon me 
how dysfunctional it can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to think a bit outside the box.  We think we are taking 
a large step today by saying private members' bills should be 
votable, but how radical is that?  We should go a little further 
and say private members' bills should not only be votable but 
freely votable.  If something very specific and of importance 
comes before the House that we can debate and vote on, we should 
be able to vote on it in the best interest of Canadians.  That is 
who we are truly representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be the first step toward parliamentary reform, and 
parliamentary reform is something this place cries out for. 
Canadians cry out for it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to represent a party that believes in democracy, 
free votes and the ability to debate openly.  Sometimes that 
causes trouble and is a bit messy, but that is fine.  We admit we 
do not have all the answers.  However Canadians need to be able 
to vote freely for the government and be represented freely. This 
opportunity is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply day motion is a very important step in the process. 
Canadians will learn to recognize and understand that.  I sense 
that there is support.  As a new member I am alarmed that we did 
not get here sooner.  It amazes me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we do in this place, as I discern from what is 
happening in the seats around me, is forget whose chairs we are 
sitting in when we come into this place to speak, debate, talk or 
put forward motions such as private members' bills. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members forget that while a seat may have their name on it, it 
should not.  I think this one does.  Yes, my name is right here, 
but this is not my seat.  It is not the seat of the Canadian 
Alliance people who voted for me.  It is not the seat of people 
from whatever side, Canadian Alliance members or anyone else, who 
voted for me.  It is definitely not the seat of the Prime 
Minister, and we see how much power is in that seat.   It is the 
seat of the 100,000 residents of my constituency.  That is whose 
seat this is and that is who sits here.  It is not I.  We forget 
that so easily in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I discern what happens around this place, I would suggest we 
change those signs because so easily we forget exactly what we 
are doing here and who we are representing.  As a newcomer here 
that is my first take as to what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wonderful that we have the opportunity to put forward 
private members' bills because the government does not have a 
monopoly on insight, good ideas or brainpower.  Private members 
have an obligation to represent the people who send them here. 
Putting forward legislation on behalf of those people is an 
absolute right of representative democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would in some ways clearly rectify the oversight of 
the current system.  Why it has not been here up to this point is 
something I must ask myself.  Is it that the government is 
fearful that members from the other side of the House might 
upstage it with quality legislation?  Is it that the 
government does not trust the public to bring forth worthwhile 
legislation?  Perhaps it is that the government is fearful 
that when good legislation comes forward it will not have time to 
steal the ideas for itself and introduce them on its own time. 
This is, as we have heard from a previous speaker, exactly what 
has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting on private members' business is a minor change on the 
road to parliamentary reform because so much needs to be reformed 
in this place.  I think Canadians are crying out for reform in 
many ways.  We sense that when we see the number of people who 
failed to exercise their right to vote in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we can put forward bills is a bit of a fail-safe 
to the government's claim to ultimate power.  However the 
government should not be alarmed at that.  It can vote down 
private member's bills any time it wants.  Private members' bills 
are not a threat to a government in power but they give Canadians 
an opportunity to speak in an effective and fruitful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this is just one step toward many reforms that will take 
place in the country.  We should recognize that one of the things 
we should be doing here is realizing whose seat we are in.  We 
should be able to vote freely not only on private members' 
business but on all business in the House.  I am dreaming, and I 
think Canadians are dreaming, of the day that will take place. 
Perhaps it will come sooner than some of us might imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business over the years has been an important 
mechanism in the federation.  It is not something new.  The fight 
over private members' business has been happening for 130 years. 
As a government comes to power, backbenchers seem to duel about 
whether private members' business can come forward.  The 
government at times pushes back private members' business only to 
have the pendulum swing again in the other direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those times when we have an opportunity to push 
back the agenda because the pendulum has swung too far in the 
opposite direction.  What a golden opportunity it is for the 
House to represent Canadians in a more effective way.  The time 
has come to push back.  I believe there is an appetite for it in 
the House.  I am certainly pleased at what I hear colleagues in 
all parties in the House saying about the bill.  I look forward 
to what that will mean to this place. 
It is one small step in a journey we all need to take together.

The motion would go a long way to facilitating that.

introducing it and congratulate every member who will vote for it 
in the House.  It is one step in a journey that is long overdue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to stand in 
the House and say how insightful it is to hear from what we like 
to classify in the House as a rookie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my third term and sometimes we lose sight of why we are 
here.  When the member mentioned that his seat belonged to his 
constituents, all 100,000 of them and not just those who voted 
for his party, it brings back the reason all of us from all 
parties of the House came here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it necessary to make private members' business votable? 
It is in many cases the only opportunity backbenchers ever get to 
put forward their ideas.  We know that.  The member asked why it 
has not been done before.  He asked what happened and why it had 
taken so long.  He mentioned that the government might be fearful 
it would be unable to take some of the ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I think he was right.  That is one of the 
reasons. I can honestly say that I hope the government takes all 
the ideas.  I do not think there is any such thing as stealing, 
borrowing or anything else in this Chamber.  I know we joke about 
sending brown envelopes over.  I would gladly send the government 
brown envelopes every night if it would adopt the ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My big fear is that private members' bills would not truly be 
independently voted on but would be guided by partisan interests. 
Could the member say whether that is a fear of his too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's question 
begs another question:  Why is all business in the House not 
voted on by the people we truly represent, the 100,000 people in 
our constituencies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a question Canadians are having a difficult time getting 
their minds around.  If something is put forward in the House and 
it is a good idea, it must garner the support of 50% plus one of 
301 members.  If it is good for Canada it is good for Canada.  If 
not, it will not achieve the consensus of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hurt ourselves badly by the process in place now.  Surely we 
can start on private members' business, which is very funnelled 
and focused on specific ideas, and open it up to an open vote in 
this place.  If it is good for Canadians it is good for 
Canadians.  It is not about party politics.  It is about leading 
the country.  Our job here, as I discern it, is to be leaders in 
the country.  I would challenge hon. members to do that.

comments by members of the other political parties.

ones. My name gets drawn rather often because it is true that I 
present a lot of motions, but that is not the issue, since our 
name stands only once for the draw.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When my hour was up around noon, I immediately went to 
the clerk's office and I again presented my motion.  It was a 
Tuesday and, the next day, during the afternoon, the motion I had 
brought forward had a new number.  There was a draw and again I 
won; I chose this same motion.  Recently I have been lucky and 
my name has been drawn twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion because solutions must be found.  It is 
true that some members have presented motions for four years and 
their motions have never been drawn.  A solution must be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have trouble with is the way the decision is made about whether a 
motion or bill is votable or not. 
We must go before a committee made up of members from all 
political parties. At the very end, we have five minutes to 
explain what our bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a decision is made, but it all depends on how the 
discussions went: outside the House we are all friends, but 
inside it is like a hockey game, and it is not easy. In 
committee, if just one member is opposed to the bill, it cannot 
be a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I experienced that recently. I presented a bill concerning the 
posting of the gross price of a litre of gas before taxes. When I 
look at the criteria set in April 1999, this bill, which 
reflected the public's wish—because we always serve our 
constituents and all Canadians—was perfectly in keeping with 
what the public was asking for with respect to the price of gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find troublesome is the fact that decisions are made by 
friends or colleagues, members who are against us within the 
House. We should testify before an independent committee made up 
of three people who have experience in the House of Commons and 
to whom we would explain for five minutes what our bill is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a decision is made, the reasons why it is or is not a votable 
item should be put into writing, specifying under which criteria. 
We never get a written decision, as it is all done verbally, as to 
why our item is votable or not, and we are never told why. All of 
a sudden, we are out of luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather troublesome, because all the members of this 
House work very hard. They put a great deal of effort into 
finding solutions to everything that affects Canada. This is why 
I am saying that we must find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased by the motion put forward today by the Canadian 
Alliance member, because it calls on the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs to use its great expertise in this 
area, precisely to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even you, Mr. Speaker, have examined reports and tried to find 
solutions Today, we are back at it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote in favour of this motion this evening and I truly 
appreciated the comments made today.

member with regard to his comments.  I too have been lucky on the 
order of the draw, but I also know the frustrations of 
having just five minutes to go before a committee to justify why my 
bill should be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to work on both sides.  I sat on the 
committee on private members' business.  I know full well the 
frustration of seeing people come to the committee who have spent 
months putting their private members' bills together.  Then we 
drew five or six bills which should have been made votable, but 
we only had a time slot for one.  Therefore we had to say that 
five would be non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly feel the motion we will be voting on today will 
answer all of these problems.  Does the member concur that these 
problems can be addressed through the simple measure we put 
forward today?

here by November.  There will always be something somewhere that 
needs improving, but this evening, with the motion brought 
forward earlier today, we will improve things.  That is what 
counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find a solution together to improve things so we can say 
to the other members “Go on, introduce bills, bring forward

bitter following the committee's decision because the members 
of the committee do good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the second time I appeared before the committee I 
was in good humour and said “I do not want my motion to be 
votable.  I wish you a good day and will let you continue your 
work”.  I was not in a bad mood.  However, it is true there are 
always things to improve.  The member is right. There will always 
be something to improve. Perhaps this will happen even next 
December.  I appreciated the member's question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate 
today.  Some weeks ago it would have seemed strange that we would 
have an opportunity to spend time debating an issue like this in 
the House.  I congratulate the official opposition for putting it 
on the table so we may exchange views on making some improvements 
in the way we do our business here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that the opposition day motion, which is the 
format we are following today, is one of approximately six 
opposition motions which have been adopted since we came back to 
the House from the last election.  It seems a rather high number 
to me but it is a tribute to both the quality of the motions and 
perhaps the reduction in partisanship applied in considering 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what colleagues will do with this particular 
motion, but it certainly is an attempt to improve the role of 
private members' business in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity and privilege of chairing the 
procedure and House affairs committee, which in a bit of an arm's 
length way looks after some of the private members' business 
procedure, and the infamous private members' business 
subcommittee which up until now selected private members' 
business for votability.  The particular task of chairing or even 
serving on that committee is a mission of real dedication.  It is 
not an easy task because inevitably a few members are pleased 
with the results and a larger number are displeased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We try to circulate our colleagues on both sides of the House 
through the subcommittee as quickly as possible so they are not 
too bruised and battered.  It is an exercise in politics and in 
trying to make the procedures work.  The motion today suggests 
that there may be another way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to some of the opposition speeches today, I 
suggest we should be careful.  We really should be careful about 
stereotyping members on both sides of the House.  Not every 
person on this side of the House thinks the same way, acts the 
same way or deals with policy issues the same way.  The same is 
true among the membership on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member opposite looks at the government's side and sees 
all the government members voting together, as so often is the 
case on a government bill, I understand why they would tend to 
stereotype us as being one huge group of MPs that simply gets up 
and votes en masse for a bill.  However in many cases it is never 
100% clear before we all come into the House how our members will 
vote.  There is always a lot of political pushing and shoving 
in our caucuses before we come in to vote, as we all try to 
convince each other to vote in particular ways.  This is not 
strange to politics.  It is very much part of the job we have 
here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today properly reflects the important historic role 
of private members' business.  The member for Yorkton—Melville 
who moved the motion has pointed out that private members' 
business was actually the main stock of business of earlier 
parliaments.  We do not have to go back too far.  It was a few 
generations ago.  It was out of private members' business that 
all bills tended to evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time the government agenda dominated and the private 
members' business portion was squeezed into smaller procedural 
portions of the day, the week or month, as the case may be.  I 
suppose that is the bad news for a private member.  However, the 
good news is that as an element of parliamentary business, 
private members' business has never been lost.  It is still alive 
and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to this House in 1988, it was my perception 
that private members' business, as a living entity, was virtually 
on life support.  I recall a private member's bill, involving 
tobacco use, quite extraordinarily being passed.  There might 
have been another one passed one a year later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the House and the government since those days have 
actually accorded a wider berth to private members' business.  I 
am sure someone is keeping track of the fact that there are now 
quite a few private members' bills and motions that have been 
adopted by the House, as have opposition day motions, as I 
pointed out.  There seems to be a modest freeing up of 
partisanship, time and procedure for private members' business 
and the whole envelope of non-government business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been very healthy.  I see members in the House who have 
had private members' business adopted.  I was fortunate in that 
regard at one point in time.  I was very proud of the item that 
was adopted by the House, and the thumbprint of that work exists 
to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island indicated that he had counted some 
4,000 pieces of private members' business since 1993.  That is 
huge.  That bundle of work by members of parliament on both sides 
of the House is actually a breeding ground for creative, fresh 
public policy.  Yes, the government does cherry-pick from that 
pool of creative work.  However, of those ideas put forward by 
members to the House as part of the public record, not all but a 
lot become part of public policy debate or actual public policy 
that is adopted in one way or another.  That is positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also government votes on private members' business these days 
are not whipped.  It is a free vote that has created some 
interesting voting patterns, but it has been healthy.  The Prime 
Minister made that commitment and has kept to it.  It is a very 
interesting evolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal is that all private members' business items become 
votable.  As I mentioned, with 4,000 pieces of private members' 
business since 1993, there would be a need to ration the volume 
in terms of House time.  We could not have fit in 4,000 items 
over the last seven or eight years.  It is just too much. For 
that purpose we have been using a lottery.  It is not very 
pretty, it is not very rational, but members seem to accept it. 
Perhaps that is not the proper tool. Maybe we should 
change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have found it necessary to ration for quality or 
relevance.  That is why the subcommittee reviews 
the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion is that we do not need to scrutinize for quality 
or relevance as we can let the House do that.  There are a number 
of private members' business items that members do not believe 
will go too far.  Is it appropriate to accord House time to a 
private member's business item that a member happens to like but 
knows will not go anywhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the rationing mechanism that we are searching 
for, I would point out that the 22nd report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is before the House and 
gets rid of the 100 signature rule.  We are looking for a 
replacement. The opposition day motion, if adopted by 
the House, would undoubtedly trigger an exercise that would 
produce a mechanism to treat private members' business 
appropriately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise on the 
particular item today.  I will be splitting my time with my 
Canadian Alliance colleague from Wild Rose who will be wrapping 
it up at the end of the hour.  I would like to read the text of 
the motion into the record again.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be 
instructed to draft, and report to this House no later than 
November 1, 2001, changes to the Standing Orders improving 
procedures for the consideration of Private Members' Business, 
including a workable proposal allowing for all items to be 
votable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our viewing audience and those looking in, the important 
part of the motion is to come up with a workable proposal 
allowing for all private members' business items, meaning the 
motions and the bills introduced by individual MPs, to be 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my Canadian Alliance colleague, the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, for bringing forward the motion. We should 
not be surprised as he has brought forward many other fine things 
on agriculture, opposition to the gun bill and so on.  I commend 
him on the common sense proposal he brought forward that 
hopefully will have the support of members on all sides of the 
House when the vote is taken.  I also commend the members for 
Scarborough—Rouge River and Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik on 
their comments.  They made some thoughtful and supportive remarks 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business for those of us in this place is 
indisputably valuable because it ought not to be on party lines. 
MPs have a greater latitude to vote freely, which is not 
generally the case with government business.  There is that sense 
that if we do not vote a government bill forward then it is a 
lack of confidence.  I believe that is a myth, a problem, and 
hopefully we will bring that down some day.  As it stands, 
private members' business is not a perceived threat to the 
government.  It is not perceived as a vote of non-confidence in 
the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we have before us in terms of all private members' 
business being votable would improve private members' business. 
Without a doubt it would give a backbencher a more meaningful 
role.  Backbenchers from the government side and from opposition 
parties could put forward sane and sensible proposals called for 
by constituents throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposals would have a good chance of being adopted on a 
non-partisan basis.  It would be good for members of parliament 
and backbenchers in the sense that they would be forced to listen 
to debates carefully since they would be voting freely and not 
necessarily with their parties.  They would have to form an 
opinion of their own rather than some ministerial department or 
critic crafting a particular recommendation. It is good from that 
point of view as members would have to assess, engage and think 
through the merits and implications of a particular item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also encourage Canadians to vote for a local candidate 
because of his or her views and not just for a national party. 
That would be good for democracy in that it would engage more 
people because the individual who is going forward, be it a 
nomination within a party and subsequently at election time, 
would likely be putting the ideas he is a strong proponent of 
into the form of a private member's bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would in some sense revolutionize the process. That is probably 
not too strong a word in the sense that it would engage more 
constituents and more of the public across our country in 
democracy.  Many have grown cynical and apathetic and I think 
this would be a way of turning that around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also respects the democratic rights of constituents because 
private members' business is currently the only real way that an 
MP's constituents can have direct input between elections into 
actual legislation.  Some might say if individuals are close to a 
minister they could have input in that way, but I think it would 
be fair to say that over the course of the last number of years 
it is the Prime Minister's Office that controls it.  It is even 
questionable how much influence various ministers around the 
cabinet table exert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very deep way private members' business would give the 
opportunity of direct input from constituents via their members 
of parliament.  We must improve it if we can.  Making private 
members' items votable is an obvious improvement because 
democracy demands that we actually vote on something.  It makes 
sense that if there is something coming forward we should be able 
to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the prime minister of the day could call for an 
election campaign to run a certain length of time.  Individuals 
throughout the country could simply present their ideas.  If, when 
everyone reached an end point, which would be election day, there 
were no vote, there would be nothing.  In this respect it only 
makes logical sense that if there are items put forward, debated 
and so on, they should be voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The follow-up is that the current system is undemocratic.  How 
could there be democracy without any voting?  The problem of 
items not being made votable has worsened in the past while.  In 
the second session of the 36th parliament 30% of drawn items were 
made votable, but in this session it is only 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not belabour the lack of democracy because it has been 
mentioned by others.  Some even see the subcommittee's decision 
making as being rather arbitrary.  Some go further to say it is 
an unfair selection process.  With regard to the stated selection 
criteria, there is a grid that we are supposed to fall into line 
with to make items votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that most members following that criteria can make an 
item such that it would be votable.  Yet it comes down to a 
judgment call by a small subcommittee that operates on a 
consensus basis.  It is incomprehensible.  It is ineffable to 
some of us why some are not made votable.  We need something 
changed in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own experience was that I had 100 signatures of members of 
parliament voting for something that I brought forward.  It was a 
freedom of conscience bill, Bill C-246.  I assumed that it would 
be a matter of a vote at the end of the day.  That was the whole 
point of gathering the signatures.  Something went sideways on it 
and the process was suspended.  I did not have the vote as I 
assumed I would after having collected so much support across the 
House of Commons.  It was only the waste of time and energy that 
went into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talk about drawbacks but there are ways that we can 
respond.  Some say that there would not be enough time for House 
business if every item were votable.  The time for debate can be 
reduced on each item.  The number of items drawn can be reduced. 
The time allotted to private members' business can be increased. 
There are all kinds of ways in which we can respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If silly items are sometimes introduced, the individual 
probably pays the price politically.  However that has been very 
rare.  The House would obviously vote against those frivolous 
things.  I think any of these things can be addressed.  In my 
view there is no concern that cannot be responded to in terms of 
making all items votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support the motion the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville put before us today.  I encourage my colleagues 
on all sides of the House to give it due consideration and have 
it put forward for the fall session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not have the full amount time so I will try to be 
as fast as I can.  There are a couple of things I would like to 
point out.  I am certainly behind the motion and I congratulate 
my colleague for bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some private members' business that has been 
successfully voted on in this parliament. There was a bill 
from the member for Winnipeg North Centre regarding labels on 
alcoholic drinks and a warning of the dangers of drinking while 
pregnant.  I believe it was voted on and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first session of the last parliament the member for 
Winnipeg Centre had a private member's bill on the retrofitting 
of government buildings for energy efficiency, which passed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second session of the last parliament the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst had a private member's motion pass regarding the 
study on benefits for seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago when John Nunziata was sitting on that side of 
the House he brought forward a private member's bill to eliminate 
section 745 of the criminal code and it was passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga East brought forward a private member's bill 
forward proposing consecutive sentencing for certain sexual 
crimes and it was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley brought forward a 
very good private member's bill on drunk driving causing death 
and mandatory sentencing of seven years and it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my recollection, there have been many more private members' 
bills that have been voted on in the House of Commons. However, 
the problem I see is that I do not believe any one of them have 
ever been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that section 745, which was introduced in 1994, is still 
in the criminal code.  It is still the faint hope clause. 
Nothing was done after the House accepted it.  Members wanted it 
to pass and to become law but it never did.  I was on the justice 
committee at the time.  I saw John Nunziata's private member's 
bill come to the table of the justice committee and die because 
it was never brought forward for debate or discussion at the 
committee level.  Even though I was a member of the committee and 
I asked hundreds of times to get the issue up for discussion and 
debate so that we could call witnesses and get it into law, it 
was ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hesitate to interrupt the hon. member but he should know that 
there were changes to section 745 in the bill and those are on 
the record.  Compromises were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Mr. 
Nunziata's bill was to eliminate section 745 and it was never 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also consecutive sentencing.  The courts have the 
capability of doing that but the sentencing bill that was passed 
in the House made it mandatory for the courts to give consecutive 
sentencing.  Lo and behold, one day I saw consecutive sentencing. 
It really made me feel good that the courts of the land finally 
brought it in.  It was in the case of a farmer who had two counts 
against him for selling his wheat across the border.  He was 
sentenced consecutively for each count.  I was in the courtroom 
and saw that.  What a disgraceful thing to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these good bills, which the highest court of the land 
agree to and that should come to pass, never come to pass.  What 
kind of an outfit do we have running the show here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gets direction from all members on all sides of 
the House to bring in some legislation to implement the very 
things that we all agree should happen. Why does it not happen? 
What kind of government do we have that would ignore a decision 
made in the highest court of the land? We already know it ignores 
the people across the land but for it to ignore very important 
decisions of the House of Commons blows my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that at the end of this day government members will 
vote for the motion.  I am pleased about that.  It is a great 
idea, but I wonder how old I will be before it is ever 
implemented.  That scares the daylights out of me.  This outfit 
is very ineffective and is not functional.  If it does not start 
listening to the people across the land and to its own members, 
who the devil will it listen to? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>VOTE 1—NATIONAL DEFENCE—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to rule on the 
point of order raised by the hon. member for St. Albert 
concerning vote 1 under National Defence of the operating 
expenditures in the main estimates for the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his argument the hon. member states that the estimate should 
be ruled out of order because in his view and that of the auditor 
general the expenditures related to the development of the 
Downsview Park site, approximately $2 million of the $4.8 
million, are not a valid charge against National Defence vote 1 
and that the Department of National Defence should not be funding 
Downsview Park from its operation expenditures.  If the 
government wants to develop and operate Downsview Park, it should 
introduce legislation accordingly, then seek the appropriate 
funding through the estimates rather than through National 
Defence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before beginning, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
raising the matter and I also want to acknowledge the 
contributions of the hon. Minister of Transport, the hon. House 
leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the hon. Leader of 
the Government in the House, the hon. opposition House leader and 
the hon. member for Athabasca on this point. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his point the hon. member for St. Albert stated that in the 
1994 budget the government announced the closure of Canadian 
Forces Base Toronto at Downsview and indicated that it was to be 
held in perpetuity as a unique urban recreational green space. 
For the project to go ahead, the government issued an order in 
council authorizing Canada Lands Company Limited to incorporate a 
new crown corporation, Parc Downsview Park Inc., as a subsidiary 
of Canada Lands Company Limited pursuant to the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also stated that management of the Downsview 
lands has been transferred from National Defence to the Canada 
Lands Company and that National Defence still continues to hold 
the title to the lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, initial funding to the Parc Downsview Park Inc. was 
provided for from an existing National Defence vote.  The 
government issued an order in council authorizing the transfer of 
the first parcel of land to Parc Downsview Park Inc. pursuant to 
the Federal Real Property Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties to this complaint, that is, the hon. member for St. 
Albert, the Minister of Transport (formerly the Minister of 
National Defence), and the auditor general, are in agreement on 
several key elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as all three have noted, the Department of National 
Defence continues to hold title to the lands in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in its 1994 budget, approved by the House, the 
government announced its intention to close certain Canadian 
forces bases, and referred to the National Defence budget impact 
paper tabled with the budget, which spoke of the intention to 
hold the Downsview site “in perpetuity and in trust primarily as 
a unique urban recreational green space for the enjoyment of 
future generations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as the auditor general has noted “each step in the 
founding and development of Downsview Park was completed in 
accordance with the relevant governing legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the House has previously, in 1999-2000, given its 
approval for the allocation of funds to operations and 
development of Downsview park. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These facts are not in dispute.  The minister has informed the 
House that in addition to retaining title to the lands, the 
Department of National Defence maintains ongoing activities on 
the Downsview property.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his report takes the position in 
paragraph 17.73 that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—if the Government of Canada wishes to set up an urban park and 
invest...public funds therein, it should have...approval from 
parliament to do so. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes the position that it has the necessary 
approval, having received parliamentary approval first on its 
budgetary policy of 1994 and second on its allocation of funds in 
1999-2000.  I note the observation in the auditor general's 
report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate and purposes of Parc Downsview Park Inc. are fully 
consistent with those of the parent corporation, the Canada Lands 
Company Limited, and the other current and past subsidiary 
corporations of the parent, for example, the CN Tower and the Old 
Port of Montreal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is, there is no departure here from previous government 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a disagreement between the government and the auditor 
general with respect to the extent of the existing authority of 
the Department of National Defence to allocate funds to Downsview 
Park.  However, on the basis of the evidence submitted by the 
hon. Minister of Transport, it seems that the House has up to 
this point sided with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs met on March 13 of this year to consider the 
main estimates, my understanding is that no questions were raised 
pertaining to Downsview Park and the committee elected not to 
present a report in the House.  In this regard, therefore, the 
Speaker can find nothing out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also seems evident that the government and the auditor 
general are not in agreement concerning certain of the 
government's accounting practices.  If this is indeed the case 
and if it is something hon. members wish to investigate further, 
that would be for the House or its committees to pursue.  It is 
not a matter for the Speaker to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I see no clear evidence that any procedural 
irregularity has occurred, and accordingly I rule that there is 
no point of order here.  I thank the hon. member for St. Albert 
as well as those who contributed to the discussion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the arguments presented for and against Bill 
S-15 proceeding in the House, I want to provide the procedural 
context against which I have to consider this point of order.  I 
ask hon. members to bear with me as I present the following 
extracts from pages 701 to 703 of Marleau and Montpetit so as to 
situate the issues raised by Bill S-15 in the larger context: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manner in which Canada deals with public finance derives from 
British parliamentary procedure, as practised at the time of 
Confederation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is on page 701.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole law of finance, and consequently the whole British 
constitution is grounded upon one fundamental principle, laid 
down at the very outset of English parliamentary history and 
secured by three hundred years of mingled conflict with the Crown 
and peaceful growth.  All taxes and public burdens imposed upon 
the nation for purposes of state, whatsoever their nature, must 
be granted by the representatives of the citizens and taxpayers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is on pages 701 to 702.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, the Commons were content simply to have grants of 
Supply originate in their House.  However, over time the Lords 
began “tacking on” additional legislative provisions to Commons 
“money bills”, by way of amendments.  This was viewed by the 
House as a breach of its prerogative to originate all legislation 
which imposed a charge either on the public or the public purse, 
and led the Commons in 1678, to resolve that: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aids and supplies and aids to his Majesty in Parliament, are 
the sole gift of the Commons; and all Bills for the granting of 
any such aids and supplies ought to begin with the Commons; and 
that it is the undoubted and sole right of the Commons to direct, 
limit, and appoint, in such Bills, the ends, purposes, 
considerations, conditions, limitations, and qualifications of 
such grants; which ought not to be changed or altered by the 
House of Lords. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is striking that over 300 years later a virtually identical 
formulation is found in our own House of Commons Standing Order 
80(1) which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aids and supplies granted to the Sovereign by the parliament 
of Canada are the sole gift of the House of Commons, and all 
bills for granting such aids and supplies ought to begin with the 
House, as it is the undoubted right of the House to direct, limit 
and appoint in all such bills, the ends, purposes, 
considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of 
such grants, which are not alterable by the Senate. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same principle is captured in an early source on Canadian 
procedure, Bourinot 4th ed., at page 491, which states, and this 
is a translation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general rule, public bills may originate in either house; 
but whenever they grant supplies of any kind, or involve 
directly or indirectly the levying or appropriation of any tax 
upon the people, they must be initiated in the popular branch, 
in accordance with law and English constitutional practice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the constitution itself enshrines the ancient English 
practice whereby the elected representatives of those who will 
be affected by any tax measure should be the first to examine 
such a measure and accept or reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In matters of taxation, the House is provided with priority over 
the Senate.  The Constitution Act, 1867 provides, in section 53: 
“Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or for 
imposing any Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of 
Commons”.  The standing orders provide that the House may only 
consider taxation measures that have been initiated by a 
minister through the usual ways and means procedures. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have judged it necessary to offer this rather lengthy, but by 
no means comprehensive, review of the history of our financial 
procedures because I believe that the question of the primacy of 
the House of Commons in taxation matters lies at the very heart 
of our parliamentary practice and is, of course, central to a 
ruling on this point of order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully appreciate the frustration exhibited by passionate 
proponents of the aims of this bill who want to give the House an 
opportunity to debate the merits of the bill.  They may balk at 
arguments about procedure, calling them obtuse or arcane, or 
technicalities irrelevant to debate on public policy in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever sympathy I as a member or a citizen may have for those 
views, as your Speaker I am bound to be the guardian of the 
parliamentary rules and precedents that guide our deliberations 
and it is against that standard that my ruling must be made. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us return to consider the specifics of the matter at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader's complaint is twofold:  first, that 
Bill S-15 originated in the Senate rather than the House and so 
violates the priority of the House in matter of taxation; 
secondly, that Bill S-15 was not preceded by a ways and means 
motion, an essential preliminary to the introduction of a tax 
bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who spoke in defence of the bill claim that the bill does 
not in fact seek to impose a tax but rather a levy desired by the 
tobacco industry for a purpose which the industry considers as 
beneficial to itself.  If this argument is accepted then the 
major impediment to the bill has been overcome, for as Erskine 
May, 22nd edition at page 781, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levies upon employers in a particular industry for the purpose of 
forming a fund used to finance activities beneficial to the 
industry are not normally regarded as charges— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is, taxes.  It is this issue, the distinction between a levy 
and a tax, which will provide the key to the ruling. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have re-examined with care previous cases where levies were 
imposed.  As the House knows, there have been very few bills 
involving levies, and fewer still which gave rise to procedural 
discussion. 
I have studied the examples cited by the hon. member for 
Lac-St-Louis, namely: the 1997 Act to amend the Copyright Act<I> 
</I>imposing a levy on blank tapes in favour of performers and 
recording artists; the 1987 Canada Shipping Act imposing a levy 
against shipowners to deal with oil spills caused by tankers and 
other ships; and the 1985 Canada Petroleum Resources Act 
imposing a levy to support an environmental studies research 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that none of these bills gave rise to any challenge 
regarding financial procedure, but it is also true that all 
these bills originated in this House, a point I would ask hon. 
members to keep in mind. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief review of the history of Bill S-15 may be helpful here 
since it was mentioned by many hon. members rising to present the 
case for the bill going forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predecessor to this bill is Bill S-13, introduced in the 
36th parliament where much the same objection was raised to that 
bill.  On December 2, 1998, Mr. Speaker Parent ruled that since 
the bill proposed a tax, did not originate in the House of 
Commons and was not preceded by a ways and means motion, it was 
not properly before the House.  He declared first reading 
proceedings null and void and ordered the item withdrawn from the 
order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the same issue, that is, the establishment through an 
industry levy of a foundation to prevent the use of tobacco 
products and actively promote non-smoking by Canadian youth, is 
now before us, though in significantly modified form. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill has been redrafted with a view to addressing 
the procedural difficulties identified in Mr. Speaker Parent's 
ruling and so make the new bill, Bill S-15, conform with House of 
Commons practice and procedure.  Supporters of Bill S-15, led by 
its Commons sponsor, the hon. member for Lac-St-Louis, argue that 
the modifications made to the text of the bill are sufficient to 
ensure that it is now properly before the House and may proceed. 
Let us now examine the arguments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT106"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT106"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1850

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intention to deal with all aspects of the 
distinction between a tax and a levy, or the various ways in 
which the two may be confused.  For instance, while a levy may 
not raise funds that find their way into the consolidated 
revenue fund, that is not an issue in the present case, and we 
will therefore set it aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it is admitted that the bill provides benefits to 
others besides those in the industry, but benefits of this kind 
are not prohibited in a bill which imposes a levy, and that 
question need not detain us here. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central issue in the case before us is whether or not the 
levy contained in Bill S-15 is imposed for purposes beneficial to 
the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make this determination it is necessary to turn to 
the bill itself.  Indeed several members have enjoined the Chair 
not to go beyond the text of the bill or to engage in speculation 
concerning matters not dealt with directly in the clauses of the 
bill.  The Chair has accepted this advice in the spirit in which 
it is given.  I intend to confine myself solely and exclusively 
to a consideration of the procedural issue which is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's supporters contend that the moneys raised to finance 
the work of the foundation constitute a levy, not a tax, because 
the creation of this foundation is beneficial to the tobacco 
industry.  Pointing to the preamble of the bill as well as to 
part III, clause 34, which states the specific industry benefits 
of the bill, they argue that these declaratory statements 
constitute compelling evidence of a levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such is the case then there would be no problem with the bill 
originating in the other place.  As Mr. Speaker Parent said in 
his ruling on Bill S-13, and this applies equally to Bill S-15, 
the central issue is whether or not the charge imposed is imposed 
for a purpose beneficial to the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill S-13 no industry benefits were indicated in the text of 
the bill as they now are in clause 34 of Bill S-15.  However a 
recitation of benefits in the text of the bill does not 
necessarily resolve this issue, particularly where it is clear 
from clause 3 that the bill also has a purpose that is beneficial 
to the public which would support the view that the charge 
imposed by the bill is a tax and not a levy.  In that case 
significant impediments would remain, for as Erskine May 22nd 
edition explains at page 779: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern legislation, however, frequently makes provision for the 
imposition of other types of fees or payment which, although not 
taxes in a strict sense, have enough of the characteristics of 
taxation to require to be treated as “charges upon the people”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think any reader of the terms of Bill S-15 would agree that it 
serves two purposes.  One is a public purpose, that is protecting 
young persons against possible adverse health effects derived 
from the use of tobacco products.  The other is an industry 
purpose, namely attracting the benefits indicated in the bill 
derived from the industry supporting and being seen to support 
its public purpose. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ruling on this point of order, the Chair must determine which 
of these two purposes is the primary purpose of the bill so that 
it can decide whether the charge imposed by the bill can be seen 
as a levy or must be considered as having “enough of the 
characteristics of taxation” to be considered a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary that accompanies Bill S-15 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment incorporates the Canadian Tobacco Youth 
Protection Foundation, a non-profit corporation established on 
behalf of the tobacco industry, whose mandate is to prevent the 
use of tobacco products by young persons in Canada. 
A levy would be imposed on tobacco manufacturers in order to 
provide the Foundation with the necessary funds to carry out its 
objects and activities. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the provisions of the bill has satisfied me 
that this summary is in general an accurate account of the 
purpose of the bill.  This aim is, in the words of the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Louis, a public policy objective, a 
conclusion further supported by material submitted by the hon. 
House leader of the official opposition, that is, advertisements 
by tobacco manufacturers in support of Bill S-15 which state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole purpose of Bill S-15 is to protect the health of 
Canadian children.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based upon my reading of the text of Bill S-15, I am satisfied 
that the bill seeks primarily to attain a public policy end and 
only secondarily seeks to attain benefits to the industry.  The 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis has asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is a foundation created by an industry under suspicion because it 
carries out objectives that are completely different from those 
of the industry itself? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reply is that the foundation to be created is in no way 
suspect, but the fact that legislation is required to establish 
that body and to provide it with funds remains profoundly 
troubling if I am to be persuaded that this bill is primarily an 
initiative that is of benefit to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question could be asked:  What prevents the industry itself 
from simply raising prices on its products so that it can fund 
the work of such a foundation?  Why is legislation required to 
achieve that end? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is not my role to comment on such measures one way or 
the other, I must recognize that there is very broad public 
support for measures to reduce and even eliminate youth smoking. 
This is, in my view, germane to the issue of distinguishing 
between public purpose and industry purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept on their face the statements in the preamble and in 
clause 34 spelling out the benefits to the tobacco industry of 
the enactment of this bill. 
Neither am I judging what has been called “the substance of (the 
bill) or the moral or ethical considerations of why the 
foundation is being created”.  Nevertheless, I remain unable to 
regard Bill S-15 as anything other than a bill which seeks to 
attain, as its principal aim, a reduction in youth smoking by 
the imposition of a tax on the tobacco industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The declared benefits to the tobacco industry in Bill S-15 are 
expressly set out in clause 34 but it still causes the Chair 
considerable difficulty, for while it states the benefits which 
the proposed act seeks for the tobacco industry, clause 34 does 
not actually provide any of those benefits.  It is purely 
declaratory in nature.  In fact I have not been able to identify 
in the bill any dispositions that provide for the alleged 
benefits to the industry other than those which provide support 
exclusively to what is acknowledged as being a public policy 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an example of what I mean.  Among the 
declared benefits listed in clause 34 is the claim in section (i) 
that in the bill: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the basis is laid for 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) a greater tolerance of the industry to the extent that its 
products are used in a legal market, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) reasonable limits on regulation of the industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even accepting at face value that these two items would be 
beneficial to the tobacco industry, I can find no measures in the 
bill to promote greater tolerance or to touch in any way the 
current regulatory regime or limit the government in any manner 
with respect to the regulation of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply stated, I can find no indication that the declared 
benefits in clause 34, insofar as they are benefits to the 
industry, are provided for in the operative clauses of Bill S-15. 
The use of a levy must be one where the industry benefits sought 
are, if not direct, at least clear to a reasonable person.  I do 
not speculate on whether or not these benefits would or would not 
accrue to the industry subsequent to the adoption of this bill, 
but in my view the bill itself does not provide for them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have sought to do in this ruling is not to innovate or 
set a new standard, but only to make explicit those factors 
that, in my view, have always formed the basis of our practice 
when distinguishing levies from taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker, I have to be concerned with where the bill 
originates, for I am charged with defending the privileges of 
this House, particularly in a case such as Bill S-15 involving 
the constitutional primacy of this House vis-à-vis the other place 
in respect of the imposition of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, in my judgment, the strict standard for accepting as 
legitimate a proposed levy has not been met.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker, I am not blind to the irony of my position.  In 
judging Bill S-15 to be imposing what amounts to a tax to fund an 
initiative with a worthy public policy objective, I will, in 
effect, be blocking that initiative.  However to do otherwise, to 
give Bill S-15 the benefit of the doubt and turn a blind eye to 
the public purpose for which the levy on the industry is being 
imposed, would be to shirk my duty as Speaker of this House.  It 
would be to leave open the possibility that the primacy of this 
House in respect of taxation, as well as the financial initiative 
of the crown in this House, would be compromised to where they 
had meaning in form only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I must conclude that the levy provided for in part 
IV of Bill S-15 constitutes a tax.  I am therefore obliged on 
both procedural and constitutional grounds to order that the 
first reading proceedings on Bill S-15 be declared null and void 
and that the bill be withdrawn from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I trust the Chair will indulge me in a point of 
order I would like to lay before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of order that I draw to your attention is a rather 
extraordinary and draconian occurrence that has occurred in the 
form of a motion that was moved by the government House leader 
this morning using the provisions of Standing Order 56(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being very well versed in the standing orders, Mr. Speaker, you 
would know that this pertains to the use of an order which 
permits the government to, in effect, move a motion that has not 
received unanimous consent and therefore invoke what is commonly 
known now as the 25 member standing rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not use inflammatory language lightly in this regard, but I 
truly believe, and I urge the Chair to find, that there has been 
an abuse of process that occurred which is tantamount to a breach 
of the rules and the intention and interpretation thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me draw your attention to the final 
paragraph of the motion that was moved by the government House 
leader.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, during the consideration of the business of supply this 
day, if a division is requested on any motion to concur in any 
item or items in the Main Estimates, immediately after the taking 
of the said division, the questions on all subsequent motions to 
concur in any item or items in the Main Estimates shall be deemed 
to have been carried on division. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The germane part of that is “shall be deemed to have been 
carried on division”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In French, these final words are “soient réputées adoptées 
majoritairement”.  This translates into “shall be adopted by 
the majority”.  This is the passage that is most offensive and 
most odious and, I would suggest, shakes the democratic process 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of this is to decide in the alternative all questions 
related to the estimates, some $166 billion, no small sum of 
taxpayer money.  This is certainly not a routine matter that is 
contemplated in Standing Order 56(1).  Rather, it is a 
substantive decision of the House to authorize the spending of 
public money in the amount of $166 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting offence is such that the House has been denied its 
right to vote on the expenditure of public money.  There has been 
a coup d'état, a raid on the treasury by the government House 
leader.  He is neutering every member of the House and the people 
we represent by moving this motion.  This is a blatant assault on 
all members' privilege and, I suggest, as such is tantamount and 
a motion that has not been moved in a previous parliament since 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stay focused on the narrow issue of the use of 
Standing Order 56(1).  The minister is entitled to move his 
motion on matters related to “any routine motion” which is the 
definition in clause (b) which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this Standing Order, “routine motion” shall 
be understood to mean any motion, made upon Routine Proceedings, 
which may be required for the observance of the priorities of the 
House, the maintenance of its authority, the management of its 
business, the arrangement of its proceedings, the establishing of 
the powers of its committees, the correctness of its records or 
the fixing of its sitting days or the times of its meeting or 
adjournment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This final clause in the motion moved by the government House 
leader has the effect, not of applying a previous vote of the 
House to other questions but of carrying these motions. 
In other words, it is possible that the House could vote the 
first item of the estimates but the remainder are deemed to have 
been carried on division.  That decision simply does not fall 
within the framework of Standing Order 56(1).  It has the effect 
of authorizing the government to enact the supply bill, and this 
is the key point, without the vote of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that 25 members do not object cannot be used to take 
the keys to the treasury.  Substantive questions in the House are 
decided by a majority of votes in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader will be quick to point 
out that it was a previous government that enacted Standing Order 
56(1).  Let me pre-empt that feeble argument and that feeble 
attempt to distract from the real issue here.  I will simply 
state that it was wrong then and it is certainly wrong now, and 
to use it in this expansive way further exaggerates the harm.  It 
was never intended to be used in such a broad and repressive 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Speaker, as the Speaker well knows, is to 
protect the rights of the minority.  This is central to the 
success of your office.  It is a high office you 
hold and one in which we place great trust.  If this process is 
allowed to stand then the government can do all its business in 
one day and dismiss parliament with the back of its hand.  The 
government, in its haste to take the money and run, has crossed 
the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Speaker to rule that this motion is a nullity because 
it has been used to bypass the proper procedures of supply and 
because it decides questions that do not fall under the 
categories of matters that can be moved under routine 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the alternative, I would respectfully request that the 
Speaker, given the gravity and the effect of such an expansive 
and abusive use of this form of closure, hold in abeyance his 
ruling until such time as he might have occasion to review all 
the details and precedents which support this point of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to take much 
time to review this.  It is quite obvious, and I think most 
members would agree, that the member does not have a very 
legitimate point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has identified that Standing Order 56(1) gives the authority 
to utilize this particular article for the management of the 
business of the House, the arrangement of its proceedings and so 
on.  Therefore, it is applicable to a very broad range of usage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member supports his argument by reading from the French 
text of a motion that I moved in English, translating it himself 
back to English and using that definition as being the one that 
is applicable.  The Speaker will know that has absolutely no 
value in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion I moved is the one that I moved, not the translation 
that I provided to colleagues across the way for matters of 
convenience.  I could have moved it in French, of course, and I 
can move it in English, but there is no rule in the House that 
says I have to move it in both.  I did not.  I moved it in one 
language and the only one that I moved it in on this particular 
occasion happens to be the one in English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member across the way is probably still feeling the 
pressure as a result of question period today, but I will not be 
provoked by that.  I will continue to refer to and respond to 
what has been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has referred to the unprecedented usage of the motion.  The 
motion has been used on several occasions in the past.  Standing 
Order 56(1) has been utilized in the management of the House to 
do such things as pass several readings of a bill in one day.  It 
has been used to introduce a bill and pass it at all stages in 
one day.  It has been used in bills that involve a charge against 
the crown.  It has been used to provide greater compensation, 
including to members of parliament as early as a few days ago. It 
has been used on a post office bill to settle a labour dispute, 
and so on.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been alleged that this could be used to in some way 
eliminate the opposition and get all bills through in one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit to those who came before me for devising this rule 
and it was not even the same government.  It was the government 
of which the leader of the member across was a member when this 
rule was devised.  It provides that any 25 members can stop its 
use, which ensures that the minority will be protected.  That is 
why in a Chamber of 301 members, 25 members can actually prevent 
the use of this particular device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  It does not help small parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says that 
is not the appropriate threshold or some such.  I did not design 
that rule.  This House in its wisdom provided that rule with that 
number in it.  I am not here to question the wisdom of the size. 
It is there.  I am only here to argue that it is appropriate to 
use the rule as it was designed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is alleging that this device is being utilized to 
pass supply.  That is factually inaccurate.  The hon. member 
knows that this particular device today is a reference to the 
amendments that were put on supply.  I do not know if it makes a 
major difference but it still makes his point incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the motions regulating business of routine proceedings 
of the House clearly include the management of the House 
business, debatable motions for instance, such as those in 
Standing Order 67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that the application for the motion 
was made in consultation with many members in the House and it 
was moved appropriately.  Unanimous consent was sought 
previously, thereby notifying the entire House of my intent to 
use it later in the day.  Several minutes passed, perhaps 15 or 
20. Bills were moved, private members' bills of all and sundry in 
between, explanations thereof and only then did I move the actual 
motion pursuant to Standing Order 56(1) under motions.  At the 
time that I did so, the House was certainly fully aware that it 
was my intention to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member cannot claim that he was unaware.  I do not 
think anyone else in the House would claim that they were unaware 
or unwilling.  The usage was done in proper form pursuant to what 
we have done before.  Certainly the allegation that the motion 
was used in a way that is unprecedented just does not hold 
water.  It was done in a way to manage the business of the House 
in a quite legitimate and appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  That is false.  The minister is dead 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The hon. member can respond, heckle and 
disagree, and that is his prerogative, I suppose, providing the 
Speaker wishes to tolerate it, but it does not make what he says 
factually correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I submit that this rule was used quite 
appropriately today for the management of the business of the 
House.  Heaven forbid, I am not defending Brian Mulroney. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has raised a 
legitimate concern.  I would ask the Chair to reflect on some of 
the things that he has raised.  Standing Order 56(1) has its 
limits.  Those limits are described in section (b) of the 
standing orders and in Marleau and Montpetit.  They give examples 
of motions that have been moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all of these have been raised, I will not go through entire 
arguments, other than to say that Standing Order 56(1) was not 
intended to usurp the constitutional duty of the opposition.  It 
was not intended to offset the important balance between the 
government and opposition.  It was meant to allow the progress of 
routine business.  The minister's motion is much too important 
and substantive to get rammed through without debate or 
amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for 
raising this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to consider the argument that he 
made, particularly with respect to whether or not there is 
something in the nature of the way this standing order was used 
today that separates it out from the way it has been used in the 
past, the argument that the hon. member made for instance with 
respect to the use of this motion in respect of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader argued that because it is only 
amendments to supply, it is not supply.  However I think that was 
a very weak argument in itself.  If it is amendments to supply, 
it has to do with supply, and therefore, Mr. Speaker,  it merits 
your judgment as to whether or not the use of this standing order 
with respect to supply is in fact a new use of this particular 
standing order and one that is not in keeping either with 
practice or with your own understanding of that particular 
standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would certainly want to indicate that I do 
not consider it consultation that somebody gets up to do 
something by unanimous consent, fails to do so and then some time 
later seeks to do it through this particular standing order.  It 
may constitute some kind of notice but it does not constitute 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is clear that again we are meeting a Liberal 
deadline.  There is some kind of cabinet retreat or something on 
Thursday and Friday, so we are faced with the use of this 
particular standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been willing to make its own sacrifices.  It 
dropped Bill C-6.  It does not want that any more.  It also 
dropped Bill C-27.  This has been one of the more unproductive 
sessions. Not only did we lose all the things that the government 
said it was going to do when it called the election, but it did 
not even get around to the things that were dropped, because now 
we are dropping them for some other Liberal deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you want me to get to the point of order, Mr. Speaker, 
and I will.  It seems to me that what is at stake here is the 
nature of this particular standing order itself.  I remember when 
it was brought in, I believe in 1991.  At that time I remember 
speaking to this particular change in the standing orders.  If I 
remember correctly, I think I referred to it as a sort of 
parliamentary uber-menschen clause, and the way in which the 
government saw itself, as Raskolnikov in <I>Crime and 
Punishment</I>, rising above the ordinary moral limits, as 
Raskolnikov did in <I>Crime and Punishment</I>, by killing the old 
lady just to show that he was not bound by ordinary morality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the Liberals doing the same thing as the Tories did 
in 1991, showing that they are not bound by any kind of ordinary 
parliamentary morality or notion of what would be proper due 
process or procedure.  They are quite prepared to just use 
whatever kind of authority they have at their disposal, which is 
what they did this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may say that 25 members could have stopped it. 
Certainly the parties that have 25 members will have to ask 
themselves why they did not.  However this particular standing 
order was designed in a parliament where all parties had 25 
members or more.  Here again we see a kind of carryover from a 
previous parliament, that is to say, the parliament before 1993. I 
am sure when this was set up it was understood that all parties 
had at their disposal at least 25 members.  The smallest party in 
the House was the NDP and we had 44 members.  To say 25 members 
at that time was at least leaving open the possibility that if 
any one party objected, this would not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a situation that is quite different, and certainly 
that standing order should have been changed by now. However, 
there are a number of other things in our standing orders that 
are still out of kilter because we have standing orders that were 
written to serve an entirely different parliament and entirely 
different political circumstances, that is to say, the political 
circumstances that existed prior to 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask you, to reflect on whether or not there 
is an opportunity here for you to rule, given the different 
nature of this parliament and of the previous parliament, that 
there is not something about this standing order that you might 
find unacceptable. 
Clearly it now has an effect on the rights of smaller parties 
which it did not have at its inception.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You, who are charged with the protection of the 
rights of minorities in this parliament and the rights of smaller 
parties, may want to consider whether you could make some ruling 
or give some advice to the House as to whether this particular 
standing order should be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing so, Mr. Speaker, if your recommendation were to be 
followed, providing you make such a recommendation, we could 
remove from the standing orders something which is kind of a 
blight on our parliamentary life here: The fact that the 
government has this kind of power which it can use and has used 
on a number of occasions and which really makes a mockery of a 
lot of the so-called power that the opposition has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a parliament in which no one party had 25 
members except the government. Would it then be okay for the 
government to just deem everything to have been passed on 
division?   I know this is a bit of a reductio ad absurdum 
argument but nevertheless that exists.  That is a possibility 
within the standing orders if the Canadian public were to elect a 
parliament in which only the government had more than 25 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  It almost happened in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  As the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle 
said, it almost happened in 1984.  I still want to call him the 
member for Yorkton—Melville.   Twenty-five years is a long time 
for someone to have the name Yorkton—Melville, but we have to 
get used to the new one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the parliament of 1984 there were 40 Liberals and 30 New 
Democrats.  It could well have been 20 New Democrats and 24 
Liberals or something like that and then what would we have had 
if we had this kind of standing order?  It was bad enough that we 
had that many Tories, I must say.  The fact that we had that many 
Tories led us to the situation that we find ourselves in now. 
They became so full of themselves that they could not tolerate 
any kind of minority opinion or criticism so we have this 
standing order in front of us, a creation of the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to hear the contrition.  We are glad to hear the 
confession.  We are glad to hear that they now realize that this 
was wrong, but would it not have been wonderful if they had 
realized that the first time I spoke to this rather than 10 years 
later? 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
take it that we have had a bit of a fessing up about the genesis 
of Standing Order 56(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to the attention of the House for 
your consideration four points in relation to this item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be the third ruling the Chair will be 
asked to make today.  It has been a busy day for the Chair and 
our sympathies to you for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of this rule, which is really what the Chair has 
to deal with here, I think what the member opposite is alleging 
is that in some way the element of the order passed that provides 
for what we are going to be doing in voting later on tonight does 
not involve the management of our business, to take the words 
from the rule.  That is the one element of Standing Order 56(1) 
that I think we are dealing with.  We are dealing with the 
management of the House's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggests that the business of supply is special and 
that it goes beyond the management of our business.  The whole 
business of supply to be sure is special and unique in terms of 
the things that we do around here, but I suggest that we are not 
managing all the supply procedure here.  What we are doing is 
managing the stream of voting that would occur in amendments to 
the supply bill. 
I point out that the order we have adopted does not prevent a 
vote at second or third reading of the supply bill tonight.  It 
deals with all of the amendment motions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT112"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are actually managing here is the voting. I 
would like to point out that the context that we are dealing with 
as we vote these days in the House is actually quite a bit 
different from the context that existed many years ago when this 
rule was put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members will recognize that when the House votes now, as we 
have been voting for a number of years, there are many 
applications of votes.  Our whips in the House routinely, and I 
use that word advisedly, apply votes.  That is a significant 
change in context for the House.  When we as a House routinely 
apply votes, I suggest that the management of our business does 
include the management of the application of these votes.  Like 
it or not we apply votes now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days ago I think I noted the government whip actually 
applying a vote for a member who was not even voting with the 
government.  This business of application of votes is now part of 
our routine and the motion that we have adopted intends to manage 
the flow of the application of votes. I suggest that is 
consistent with Standing Order 56(1) which refers to passing 
motions for the management of order of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona has suggested that the 
minister had to consult before he moved the motion.  The standing 
order does not require consultation.  The standing order requires 
the denial of unanimous consent.  That is precisely what was 
denied when the minister moved his motion earlier.  He did not 
have to consult.  He only had to find a denial of unanimous 
consent.  Therefore the precedent for the application of rule 
56(1) was certainly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion is that because we now have parties with less than 25 
members that is somehow relevant to the interpretation. I suggest 
it is not.  The rule is clear.  The number of members required to 
force a vote or to deny the motion is 25, not 12.  The fact that 
we have parties that have 12, 13 or 14 members is irrelevant. The 
rule is clear.  We are not in the business of rewriting the rule 
here for the smaller parties.  If we wish to do that later we 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that the suggestion that this is out of 
order is not correct.  It certainly raises an issue, but on the 
face of Standing Order 56(1), for the reasons discussed around 
the House, I suggest that this motion and this manner of 
disposition is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think the Chair has heard enough on 
this point at this time to deal with the matter before the House 
for the time being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough himself, 
in his remarks at the outset, suggested, this is a matter that 
the Chair could take under advisement and deal with at some later 
time and that is exactly what I intend to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as today's proceedings are concerned, the Chair is 
satisfied that the motion was adopted this morning without 25 
members rising in their place and without objection at that time 
as to the procedural acceptability of the motion.  The matter has 
come before the House at this late hour and, in my view, the 
motion has been adopted and will apply for tonight's proceedings, 
and we will leave it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is quite prepared to review the terms of the standing 
order involved and the interpretation which might be given it in 
the circumstances because, as the government House leader pointed 
out in his list of occasions on which this rule has been used, 
some of the usages might appear at any reasonable glance to go 
beyond the terms of the standing order itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is prepared to have a look at the standing order, to 
look at the usage and to also look at the possibility that the 
modernization committee, which must have studied this matter, 
might have had something to say on it.  I will examine its report 
again with interest, but I do not believe there was anything in 
it concerning this particular standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is always concerned for the fairness of the 
applicability of rules to all hon. members in the House and of 
course will want to reflect on the submissions made today.  I 
will take them under consideration and will come back to the 
House, since we are likely adjourning tomorrow, at some time in the 
distant future.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to take part in the 
debate tonight with respect to the main estimates of the 
government, particularly as they relate to Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say at the outset that as Minister of Health and speaking 
on behalf of my colleagues in government and those professionals 
with whom I work at Health Canada, we never forget that we in our 
own generation are custodians of an achievement of enormous 
value, the Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an achievement that is more than simply a government 
program.  It is a national undertaking that reflects the values 
and priorities of Canadians.  We are committed to strengthening, 
to preserving and to promoting that system.  That is the purpose 
for which we ask for the resources that are included in the main 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we discuss Health Canada and Canada's health care system, 
perhaps the most important point of departure and the matter I 
would first like to mention in addressing this issue in the House 
tonight is the agreement that was reached among the governments 
in the country just a few months ago with respect to the present 
state and the future of Canada's health care system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago we negotiated with the governments of the 
provinces an agreement on the future of our health care system. 
Last September, the Prime Minister signed an agreement with the 
provincial premiers which contained two key elements, the first 
of these being more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have added considerably to the federal transfer payments to 
the provinces so that they will have the resources on hand for 
health care delivery.  In fact, we have added 35% over the next 
five years to the transfer payments to the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These considerable amounts will put the provincial governments 
in a position to meet their responsibilities in the coming years 
for providing on the ground health services throughout the 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second key element was the areas on which we reached 
agreement in order to improve and strengthen our health care 
system.  Clearly, our system is facing major challenges at this 
time.  As a government, we have agreed on some significant steps 
in order to face these challenges. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is with respect to the shortages of doctors and 
nurses, whether it is with respect to finding new and innovative 
ways of providing frontline services to Canadians in communities 
where they live, whether it is with respect to renewing equipment 
available in the health care system, or broadening the 
accessibility of home and community care, or increasing the use 
of information technology, or promoting health as opposed to 
simply curing illness, all of these key elements were included in 
the agreement reached among governments just a few months ago.

to make sure that we pursue the common ground we have reached, 
that we act on the agreement of last September and carry forward 
toward its objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the cash transfer, apart from the elements of 
agreement, apart from the work we are now doing in common, there 
are other aspects of last September's entente that I would like 
to draw to the House's attention and report upon.

the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since last September $1 billion has been available to the 
provinces to purchase MRIs, CT scans, new X-ray equipment, 
lithotripters, surgical suites, whatever it is in the way of 
medical equipment that might be needed on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, for example, my own home province, that amounts to 
almost $400 million that has been available since last September 
to be used by provincial governments in buying new equipment.  It 
is ironic that we would have read recently about the shortages of 
MRIs here in Ottawa or elsewhere in the province when the 
provincial government has access to almost $400 million and has 
had for some months.  Naturally we urge our provincial partners 
to use that money for the purpose for which it was intended and 
apply it toward the purchase of new medical equipment to meet the 
needs of Canadians wherever they may live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second targeted fund of the three was $800 million which we 
made available to fund innovative new practices in making 
frontline services available.  What that means is access to 
doctors and nurses by Canadian families where they live and when 
they need those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are used to the system of family physicians practising in 
private offices on a fee per service basis so that during 
business hours during the week they are there to see patients. 
However, we all know that the need for a physician when someone 
is ill or injured does not end at the close of the business day. 
We also need to have access for families in the evenings, 
overnight and on the weekends.  It is for that reason that the 
country has been moving toward different ways of making primary 
care or frontline services available, such as community health 
centres, shared practices, looking at new ways of paying doctors, 
and having teams of doctors and nurse practitioners to respond to 
community needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada wants to encourage provinces to pursue 
these innovative new approaches.  It is for that reason we have 
set aside $800 million in the primary care fund which we are 
providing to provincial governments to fund innovative new ways 
of meeting these frontline needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now blocked out the criteria with respect to how that 
money will be provided to provinces and the objectives we are 
trying to reach in making it available, and I believe it is going 
to be a source of improved services in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third dedicated fund from last September is $500 million to 
encourage the adoption of new information and communication 
technologies in health care.  What does this mean?  It means two 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it means telemedicine to make the services and the 
opinions of specialists available to Canadians in remote or rural 
areas.  It means telemedicine so that there can be 
teleconsultation in psychiatric services.  It also means 
teleradiology, taking an X-ray or an MRI in the northern part of 
a province and transmitting it digitally to an expert or a 
specialist in a major urban centre where it can be read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second purpose is electronic patient records so that no 
matter where we travel in the country our medical information is 
available to health care professionals who need it to provide us 
with services.  If we are ill or injured, God forbid, and arrive 
at a hospital, information about our case which is taken by the 
emergency room physician, the admitting doctor, the family 
doctor, the specialist, the home care worker or the pharmacist 
can all be shared in one electronic record that is instantly 
accessible.

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That way we would avoid the repetition of tests and the 
repetition of the history.   We would avoid miscommunication 
between patient and provider.  We would make sure that everybody 
is aware of things such as allergies that the patient might have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way of modernizing health care, of making it better 
for Canadians, and these targeted funds will help to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last element of the September agreement that I want to 
report to the House on has to do with accountability.  I believe 
we are all in agreement on all sides of the House that we have to 
be accountable to taxpayers for the moneys we spend.  In health 
care that is no less true, yet in health care there has never 
been a systemic way of looking at the outcomes in the health care 
system to assess whether taxpayers are getting their money's 
worth.  It is for that reason that the agreement among all 
governments provides that starting in September 2002 there will 
be regular reports to Canadians that measure the performance of 
the health care system and tell Canadians in plain language on a 
regular basis how it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that on indicators such as accessibility of frontline 
services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, accessibility of home and 
community care, and readmission rates of hospitals to test 
whether they are discharging patients too soon, we will be 
measuring what happens and reporting to Canadians regularly. That 
will provide a way for Canadians to know how this health care 
money is being spent, now at $100 billion a year in Canada, and 
it will provide a way for us to determine where the weaknesses 
are in the system so they can be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add just one other matter.  During the election campaign 
of last fall the government also undertook to create a citizens' 
council on quality care, which means taking the quality control 
function out of the hands of government and putting into the 
hands of Canadian citizens.  It means creating a council to which 
we will appoint Canadians from across the country who will 
monitor the regular reports we make to make sure they are 
objective, complete, accurate, readable and usable by average 
Canadians in their homes.  It means a citizens' council on 
quality care which will itself report on how the health care 
system is doing and will monitor quality in health care services. 
That is an important way in which we will make the health care 
system accountable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude let me touch upon just a few other things we 
are working on at Health Canada which members will see reflected 
in the estimates before the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first touch upon health research.  This is an area where 
the Government of Canada has long been seen to have a unique 
responsibility.  Since the 1930s when we created the Medical 
Research Council, research has been a federal domain.  Provincial 
governments are also active but the federal role has been 
recognized and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago we replaced the Medical Research Council with the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research.  The House adopted Bill 
C-13 to create the institutes.  Since the adoption of that 
legislation a year ago much has happened.  We have appointed the 
president, Dr. Alan Bernstein of Toronto.  Dr. Bernstein and his 
board of directors have been hard at work.  They have named the 
first 13 institutes, the original slate of institutes.  There are 
now institutes of health research on everything from cancer to 
mental health to diabetes.  These 13 institutes each have 
appointed scientific directors.  Those scientific directors, with 
their advisory councils of experts, are putting together 
strategic research plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as we have created these institutes, the 
Government of Canada has more than doubled the amount of money 
that we make available each year for health research.  It is now 
over half a billion dollars and I can tell the House that it is 
on a trajectory upward, so that we can meet our commitment to 
Canadians to double in the course of the coming years the amount 
that this country spends on research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institutes of Health Research are off to a good 
start.  Around the world they are earning Canada a reputation for 
excellence.  They are attracting the best and the brightest to 
stay in Canada or to return to Canada and do their health 
research here.  I believe those institutes hold the promise of 
advancing the frontiers of medical and health knowledge and of 
accelerating the discovery of or treatments and cures for 
diseases and illnesses that afflict Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also report to the House with respect to some of the 
other initiatives in which we are now engaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker earlier tonight made a ruling with respect to Bill 
S-15 which has to do with tobacco.  I would like to briefly 
mention what we are doing in that regard because tobacco is the 
number one public health issue in the country.  Every year 45,000 
Canadians die prematurely because of tobacco use.  That is more 
Canadians than those who die annually as a result of car 
accidents, suicides, murder and alcohol combined.  It is a tragic 
toll and we can do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent indications are that smoking rates are coming down in 
Canada but they are not coming down fast enough.  There are 
troubling numbers about young people, especially young women, who 
are starting to smoke.  We adopted a strategy with many parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobacco Act, which the House enacted in 1997, increased 
taxes. Recently we brought taxes up on cigarettes because that 
helps, especially among youth who are price sensitive.  We are 
making sure that the public is aware of the dangers of smoking by 
informing them of the health risks and about the strategies of 
tobacco companies that try to encourage people to smoke and 
continue to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to with the tobacco issue.  Members will see 
that we are devoting $480 million in the course of the coming 
five years to this strategy, including major investments in media 
campaigns to increase the awareness among Canadians, especially 
young Canadians, of the dangers of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch upon two or three other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The availability and the quality of health services in rural 
areas has been a preoccupation of mine for some time.  The fact 
is that almost one-third of our population lives outside the 
major centres.  About nine million people live in communities of 
10,000 persons or less.  If we look at the demographics in rural 
and remote Canada, we find that the population generally is older 
than in urban centres.  The health statistics are less 
encouraging.  There are more illnesses and more injuries. Yet at 
the same time, where the needs are greater, services are often 
less accessible.  Whether it is ambulances or emergency rooms, 
family physicians, nurse practitioners, specialists or equipment, 
rural Canadians do not have the same access as urban Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the grave concerns I have about two tier medicine in 
Canada is not between the rich and the poor, but between the 
urban and the rural Canadian.  For that reason, two years ago I 
opened the office of rural health at Health Canada.  Although we 
can say the delivery of health services is a provincial 
responsibility, and we respect scrupulously provincial 
jurisdiction, nonetheless it is a national challenge to ensure 
that the promise of the Canada Health Act is fulfilled for all 
Canadians, not just those who live in major urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appointed as executive director of the office of rural health 
a physician who practised in rural Canada and a former member of 
the executive for the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada.  We 
set about putting together a national strategy to deal with this 
challenge.  We convened a national conference on rural health at 
the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George.  We 
set aside $50 million in budget 2000 to fund pilot projects at 
the rural level.  We brought together people from across the 
country to work with us to find ways of making the accessibility 
of services more appropriate in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the answer lies in telemedicine and using modern 
technology.  That will help a great deal, but it is not the only 
answer.  It is also a question of attracting physicians and 
nurses and keeping them in rural Canada.  It is a question of 
overcoming the sense of professional isolation that often drives 
doctors away.  This is something that we have to work on because 
we cannot abide a situation in which one-third of the population 
is denied access to quality care in Canada.  Working with my 
provincial partners, I intend to continue in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few moments remaining I might simply mention the organs 
and tissues initiative with which members are familiar.  The 
House committee on health made such good recommendations, all 
which I accepted.  We are changing nutritional labelling to 
provide more information to Canadians about the foods they eat. 
We are making medical marijuana available on a compassionate 
basis for those who are ill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we have the draft bill with respect to cloning and 
assisted human reproduction which I put before the health 
committee on May 3.  That committee is working and will return 
with recommendations in the months ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is important, challenging and exciting work.  I turn 
to it with a sense of obligation to the House and Canadians to 
make sure that we preserve and strengthen Canada's health care 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our population is aging and I see two 
problems looming.  One is that a lot of older people will either 
choose to be treated at home and to go through an illness in the 
comfort of their own home or in some cases there are no hospital 
beds for long term patients because a lot of illnesses suffered 
by elderly people are long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister have any plan or vision for how these 
individuals can be realistically treated without simply 
transferring the burden of their care to the family or having 
unqualified, or unsuitable or unreliable assistance that really 
does not meet the needs of the patients and families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is about patients who do not need to be 
hospitalized but do need some kind of care.  Increasingly there 
are no facilities to which these patients can be moved, so 
hospital beds are taken up unnecessarily, and these patients 
simply have no where to go and no one to care for them.  This is 
not only a problem today but will be an increasing problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister tell the House about his vision, plans 
and what he is doing about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill is right.   with an aging population and the 
differences in the way the practice of medicine is now being 
carried out, the focus of care is shifting from hospitals to the 
community.  In fact, 25 years ago almost half of all health 
spending took place in hospitals.  Today it is less than a third. 
We can see it for ourselves.  People go in at nine in the morning 
for surgery and come out at four in the afternoon.  We remember 
in our youth that people used to go into the hospital for a week 
or two when they had their appendix out, or some other such 
operation.  That is one aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is that as people age, more of them want to 
stay at home.  I can speak personally and say that in the last 
five years both of my parents died of cancer.  They chose to die 
at home.  In 1994 and 1995 my sisters and I had to find out about 
home and community care.  We had to look in the yellow pages 
under H to find out what we could about home care.  It was not 
easy. We found there were gaps in what was covered and what was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to rationalize this and accept that the Canada Health 
Act, which covers only services in hospitals and by doctors, was 
written at a time that was different.  Now there is a whole range 
of home and community care that is unaddressed.  The provinces do 
their best to try to cover it.  Some have very elaborate home 
care programs, like Saskatchewan and British Columbia.  With 
others it is less consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member's question, I can say that the 
Government of Canada has to work with provinces to find a way to 
make home and community care an integral part of medicare because 
it is just as medically necessary for aging seniors to get care 
at home as it is for people to get the care in hospitals.  It may 
not be provided by doctors, but whether it is nurses or home care 
workers it is just as important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to work with my provincial colleagues and partners to 
find a way to address this increasing need.  I think it can be 
done.  A couple of years ago I suggested a national home care 
approach which was not well received.  Perhaps the atmosphere at 
the time was not very positive.  Since the agreement of last 
September, I think the atmosphere has improved enough to continue 
those discussions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two quick questions for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to last September's agreement, which was signed here 
in Ottawa.  He neglected to tell us that all the premiers asked 
him to provide for indexing in the transfer payments.  Why did he 
not agree to this request? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would also ask him if he could tell us the per diem 
salary or remuneration of the chair of the task force he set up 
to review the Canada Health Act, former premier Romanow?  Could 
he tell us what he gets daily? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I referred to the agreement 
we negotiated a few months ago here in Ottawa.  I am very proud 
to have been part of this effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it was an important moment in history when all 
governments, including the government of Quebec, regardless of 
their affiliation, their ideology, agreed on a single substantial 
document and on health care priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember well when the Premier of Quebec was there with the 
Prime Minister of Canada.  After signing the agreement, Mr. 
Bouchard said “That was important, and I would like to thank the 
Prime Minister of Canada for his patience and for the agreement 
we have just reached”.  I was very proud and I think it was 
something important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards Roy Romanow, the chair the commission we set up, I 
cannot say this evening exactly how much he is being paid, but I 
can assure the hon. member that his work is vital to the future 
of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will examine thoroughly our needs for the next ten or fifteen 
years in the health care system.  Mr. Romanow, as the premier of 
Saskatchewan, managed a system for 10 years.  He is well placed 
to provide valuable advice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK306"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the minister about the follow up to 
the September 11, 2000 accord.  Today is June 12, 2001, nine 
months since the September accord was approved.  If a woman can 
have a baby in nine months, then surely the government can 
produce something concrete in terms of promises made at that 
time.  In particular, I would like to ask the minister about the 
commitment to deal with the critical shortage of health care 
professionals and nurses that is rampant across the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accord promised to ensure that each jurisdiction would have 
the people with the skills to provide appropriate levels of care 
and services and commits governments to work together to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing on that front has happened since September 11, 2000. The 
government has made a lot of promises, but failed to act on a 
very fundamental issue for ensuring quality health care.  When 
will we see action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have seen action on a 
number of fronts, and I am happy to respond in detail to my hon. 
friend's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this year's transfers to the provinces reflect the 
agreements of last September and the increased amounts.  This 
year Ontario, to use my home province as an example, will receive 
an additional $1.2 billion from the Government of Canada in the 
transfers available for health.  It is interesting to note that 
when the province of Ontario tabled its budget a few weeks ago, 
an additional amount of $1.2 billion was made available for 
health.  In other words, the Government of Canada is contributing 
exactly what the Harris government is increasing for health 
spending this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member speaks about the availability of doctors and 
nurses, which is of course the very first thing that the Prime 
Minister and the premiers listed in the priorities that were 
identified for government action.  I am happy to report that we 
have made progress there, two things among many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the health ministers agreed and published a national 
nursing strategy some months ago which reflects the hard work of 
the nursing profession and the provincial governments in sorting 
out ways to deal with the shortages in nursing care in Canada: 
addressing the underlying problems of working conditions; 
increasing enrolment in the nursing schools; and addressing some 
of the grievances that the profession has had with respect to its 
position in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to doctors:  Three years ago total enrolment in 
medical schools in this country was about 1,570 places.  Next 
September it will be 2,000.  We are going in the right direction. 
I could go on but I think my friend has the general idea. 
<P><A NAME="LINK307"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the minister has to do with the fact that he wants 
to allow those who have AIDS to smoke marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister speak tonight about tobacco and the effect 
it has on our health.  Is the minister looking at legalizing 
marijuana?  I did some research on marijuana.  As soon as people 
smoke one cigarette it goes into their brain cells, stays there 
for nine days and then continues to build up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is looking at legalizing marijuana, has he done 
any research on its side effects?  Could he assure Canadians that 
we do not have to worry about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has been good 
enough to speak succinctly about her concern in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, my focus has been on the medical availability of 
marijuana for compassionate purposes.  As hon. members know, we 
have now published proposed regulations to govern the way in 
which those who are ill or dying can get access to marijuana if a 
doctor feels it can help relieve their symptoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of either decriminalizing or legalizing 
marijuana, as the member knows the House created a special 
committee by resolution some two or three weeks ago which I 
believe has now been named and which will soon begin sitting. 
That special committee has been asked to look at the whole 
question of Canada's policy toward the non-medical use of drugs. 
That issue will come before the committee.  I think it is 
important not to prejudge the outcome.  We must let the committee 
do its work and hear the various points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a subject on which there are varied opinions, even within 
the hon. member's party.  I think the committee should listen to 
the evidence, hear the various viewpoints and come back to the 
House with recommendations that can be debated here so that we 
can ultimately make a decision based on the facts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK308"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
from the outset I want to elaborate on the points made by the 
Minister of Health in his speech. The minister refused, however, 
to answer a question from the Bloc Quebecois member about Mr. 
Romanow's salary. Even more strange is the fact that, during the 
some 20 minutes that he spoke, the Minister of Health did not 
mention the Romanow commission. He did not say anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about his government's accomplishments, about rural 
communities, the September agreement, the citizen's council and 
the non medical use of marijuana. That was fine. I told myself 
“He is going to talk about the Romanow commission”. It is 
supposed to be the key to the future, the country's vision in the 
area of health. But nil, not a word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, because we put the question to him several months 
ago, that the minister is not comfortable. It gives him a rash 
when we talk about the Romanow commission. He does not like it. I 
understand. This is a man who seems to have some vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have imposed on him an unemployed premier who is too young to be 
appointed to the Senate, because the Prime Minister appoints 
senators whose average age is 72. Mr. Romanow must wait a few 
more years. So that he does not remain idle, the government put 
him in charge of a royal commission of inquiry. His salary is not 
known. He is on his own, looking after his own business.

health care in this country.  He seems to have solutions to the 
problem, yet it is entrusted to a royal commission.  That is a 
waste of money.  For 18 months or 2 years, there will be nothing 
forthcoming from this government in the area of health.  What 
the Romanow commission will manage to do, once the Liberal Party 
has changed leaders, is to serve as the party's political 
commission in the next election, at the taxpayer's expense. 
Otherwise it is pointless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to be struggling with this.  While not 
wishing to put words in his mouth, of course, I am not sure the 
Minister of Health was in agreement with that.  If it had been 
one of the ideas he had come up with, he would have referred to 
it this evening. When the minister was talking health with his 
colleagues, did he mention the royal commission?  Not at all, 
not a word, it must be forgotten if possible.  We get the feeling 
there are little domestic squabbles on the government side. 
I thought the minister would refer to the commission when he 
spoke.  The fact that he did not speaks volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister probably senses a cabinet shuffle coming that will 
end up with him in Canadian heritage, instead of having to live 
with a royal commission of which he is not fond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the health point of view, we need a vision, but having a 
vision requires knowledge of what is going on in the field. 
In Ottawa we have the good fortune to have 301 men and 
women who have been elected by the voters in their ridings and 
who are, I hope, at least in this corner of the House, connected 
with the people in their ridings.  If that connection exists, 
then one knows what the problems are. 
If one knows what their problems are, and if one is lucky 
enough to have been gifted with average intelligence, one can 
find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health, and 
there is one in the other place as well.  The minister does not 
seem to be lacking in intelligence; he is capable of identifying 
the problem.  He is someone who does not appear to be afraid of 
talking to his provincial colleagues, or so it would seem.  He 
was asked about the water issue.  He was told “There is a problem 
with water.  Today, in many places in Canada, people cannot drink 
a glass of water without running the risk of being poisoned and 
without endangering their health”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was told “Keep pushing. The House passed a motion on this”. 
He seems to be pushing with his provincial colleagues, and we 
think it is fine. If the problem is known, let us get on with the 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister mentions the September agreement, he is 
putting a spin on things. I am sorry to use this expression, but 
it is very well known here.  A spin is a way of presenting 
reality from a different angle.  With the present Minister of 
Finance, we have got used to hearing that the government will 
invest $500 million, $2 billion, $300 million over five years and 
that the tax cut will be $8 billion or $5 billion over seven 
years.  The timeframes are always long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Health tells us that the government is 
going to invest $800 million in new equipment, this is not 
annually.  This is what it would take annually to make up the 
ground lost.  It is for the entire duration of the agreement, 
unindexed, as the NDP member pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal share of the cost of replacing medical equipment 
over a number of years is $800 million.  We number more than 30 
million in this country, so this is not much per capita.  In the 
more remote or rural areas, medical care costs more because 
additional incentives are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been out of new ideas since 1993.  With a 
few exceptions, it does not know what it is going to do the next 
day.  Why?  Because the Prime Minister is like that.  He has 
said “Bring me a problem, I will fix it”.  That is it. 
Sometimes he fixes it, sometimes he does not.  Most of the time 
it is fixed all wrong, and health is one of these problems. 
Things have been discussed in Canada for years, but for often 
political, reasons, they are totally rejected.  The government 
refuses even to discuss them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the initiatives involving tax points, the government 
says “Ah, no tax points.  We want nothing to do with that.  We 
gave you your cheque.  You have your money.  Do your bit.  When 
you run out, come back and see me.  Knock at my door, and, if 
you are nice, I will give you some”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long talked about tax points across the country, 
regardless of political stripe.  What we are saying as well is 
that tax points assure the provinces of stable funding.  Of 
course, once again, this does not resolve all the problems.  We 
have to talk about equalization. 
We agree that it is less to the advantage of the poorest 
provinces to take tax points than to have an amount of money that 
is the same for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough of ad hoc funding for the country's health care 
system.  That is what it is.  When the provinces want to develop 
new initiatives, the federal government will tell them “There are 
five basic principles in the legislation we are thinking of 
changing.  That is perhaps why we appointed a former premier, who 
could perhaps not be appointed to the Senate but could perhaps 
come up with solutions.  So, wait for the commission to submit 
its report, that is in at least two years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not planning. In the meantime, people are tearing out 
their hair trying to find ways to keep cardiologists in the 
regions and to attract family doctors in the provinces.  We see 
this in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health does not seem to know what is going on in 
Quebec.  The government introduced a policy concerning the 
principle of family doctors being available seven days a week 
throughout Quebec, but the Minister of Health said that anything 
outside normal store hours was perhaps excessive.  He should 
perhaps take a look at initiatives such as those in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation should be reviewed and modernized.  The 
government is afraid.  It feels that five principles are enough 
and it would rather interpret.  The government is afraid of 
talking about private sector health care. 
As far as the private sector is concerned, we will recall that 
the future former leader of the official opposition had held up 
a little sign during one of the debates in the last election 
campaign that read “no two tier health system” because he was not 
capable of explaining this clearly enough and people did not 
believe him.  He therefore felt obliged to write it down on his 
little sign, thinking that then he would be believed, but it did 
not make much difference.  The private sector is already a 
presence.  It is a presence in both health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very far away from here, to give an example of what is 
happening with increasing frequency in the health field and will 
continue to happen, a new school was recently opened in one of 
the municipalities in the Outaouais region.  This happens 
because of heavy development in a given area.  That school was 
built by the private sector.  The school board and the 
government signed a 25 year lease and will operate the 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The school's bricks and mortar were put in place with private 
sector funding, but its soul remains the responsibility of the 
school board and the department of education.  We will be seeing 
more and more of this, yet the government is afraid to raise 
these questions and has struck a royal commission to find 
solutions to all our problems.  Even if they are saying over on 
that side that they have solved a problem, there are still more 
unsolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I praise the Minister of Health's handling of the 
hepatitis C compensation issue.  It is not working properly, 
however.  I thank him because I want to give credit where credit 
is due.  He is prepared to act on this but speed is of the 
essence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a supposed agreement on financial compensation, along 
with a law practice that is supposed to be handling it, but 
there are still problems.  The payments are delayed, 20% 
or 40% of them.  Very few people have received all their money. 
The minister has some responsibility in this. 
The government and parliament have some responsibility in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one better say the problem is resolved because the people are 
no longer on Parliament Hill with placards demanding 
compensation.  It is not resolved or it is only partly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I repeat, when the minister does something good, 
I tell him.  When he does not do what he is supposed to, I tell 
him, as well, with respect.  So it is important to resolve this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another matter to be resolved at some point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from New Brunswick raised the issue of marijuana. 
It is not enough to be for it or against it.  The government has 
been talking about this one for years.  They will settle it. The 
minister said “I will make marijuana available for medical 
purposes”.  This is the compassionate element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no pot on the market that meets the 
government's standards.  There is none, and it have 
no system.  It has given no thought to the criminal 
code.  It has given no thought to the problems involving the 
various laws governing the country, the provinces and the 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have another problem.  The government is forced to go to 
court, and the people it wanted to help are arrested by the 
police.  So that is not resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee on the non-medical use of drugs was just set up and 
I have the honour and the privilege to sit on it. I must say that 
I hope people will be patient. If we are ready to show compassion 
for the sick, we will have to show compassion for those who sit 
on that committee, because its mandate is very broad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also have to target the problems. What is the 
committee's mandate? Its members will define it in the fall. We 
will work hard to ensure that this mandate is as clear as 
possible so that we can take a stand on the issue and on 
plausible and easily feasible solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we deal with the drug issue by saying we will find 
solutions? The NDP member for Vancouver East sits on that committee. She 
represents, the poorest part of 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the part of 
Vancouver that is not shown on postal cards. It is her riding. 
There are problems. We must tackle this and find solutions to the 
problems of heroin users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this also be included in the committee's mandate? Maybe 
yes, maybe no. Some will say “Instead of legalizing other drugs, 
perhaps we should deal with those who have serious problems with 
existing drugs”. This is probably what the committee will look 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I would like to talk a little bit about what 
will happen this evening. Unless something out of the ordinary or 
some miracle happens, this is the last evening of the first 
session following the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an election, people thought, after all, it had only been 
re-elected for three and one-half years or I should say three 
years and five months, that the government would come up 
with some good ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, things are something like at an auction, going 
once, going twice, going three times, sold.  It takes three times 
to get a bill passed.  The first time, no go, then there is an 
election.  Then there is the second time, and in mid-mandate, 
there is the throne speech.  This puts everything back to square 
one.  Then things start all over again for the third time, but 
now there is a general election.  Going once, going twice, going 
three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times has the endangered species legislation come up? 
It is endless.  Then there is the young offenders legislation. 
Here we go again, changes, modifications, then it gets blocked in 
the Senate.  Then an election comes along.  Soon another change will 
be coming: the Prime Minister. Then there will be another throne 
speech.  We get nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the health field, there is even less progress.  This evening 
we in the opposition had the opportunity, with the means 
currently available to us I must add, to get some important 
messages across regardless, messages that open up some 
discussion.  Perhaps we should vote for part of the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say what the public would say to us “At the rate you guys 
are getting paid now, it won't hurt you to sit overnight from 
time to time”.  We stop, but at the same time we are getting a 
message across “The job is not over.  Our work on important bills 
is not over.  We would like to get on our way.  No problem.  I 
want to get home, but that is not the right idea”. 
However there are some important points that are not settled.   Any 
MP will be prepared to stay here in order to solve a really 
important problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I will wish you, Madam Speaker, as well as all 
members, a good summer, and a healthy one.  As far as health is 
concerned, however, we are on our own. Unfortunately, I do not 
think that the government can help us on that.

in the world delivering services because of a government that 
hands over money for the health of all Quebecers and Canadians a 
little bit at a time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the member for the clarity of his remarks about the 
government.  I appreciate what he said about the Romanow 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he share my point of view?  I could provide him with a copy 
of the document, if he likes. I asked the Library of Parliament 
for information about what the provinces had done in the way of 
commissions of inquiry or task forces on the future of health 
care systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will not be surprised to learn that, between 1993 and 
the present, seven provinces have themselves formed commissions: 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Quebec and 
Ontario.  So, seven out of ten provinces have already done what 
the federal government wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the provinces are doing this, because they 
are the ones providing the services. They are responsible for 
organizing the health care system so that care can be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree with me that we do not need a commission 
such as the one proposed by the federal government, because this 
is not its primary responsibility second, because we know where 
the needs are and how the health care system must be reorganized; 
and third, because money is a large consideration, but not the 
only one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Ottawa last September, the premiers asked that 
transfer payments be indexed.  Was the government willing to do 
this?  Of course not. 
Does the hon. member share this point of view? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, several provinces are 
experiencing that problem. They consulted the service providers, 
namely the doctors, nurses, volunteers, staff members and 
administrators. These men and women are familiar with the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They must make hard decisions on a daily basis. At the same 
time, they have to come to Ottawa to beg. They are asking the 
federal government to restore at least the 1993-94 level. Perhaps 
tax points or a new equalization system might help some 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is known, and the provinces took their 
responsibilities. There may be some exceptions in various types 
of services, but I will talk about one province, mine, 
Quebec. I am not necessarily a friend of the government in 
office but the fact remains that regardless of political 
stripe some things that are done in Quebec deserve our 
attention. The federal government wants to reinvent the wheel 
with the Romanow commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask people on the streets, in Quebec and elsewhere in the 
country. They do not care at all about the commission. The Bloc 
Quebecois member is right. Money may not be everything, but the 
right choices must be made and it is a lot easier to implement 
them quickly with money. This is why we are asking for a fair 
redistribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is right, we must talk about the Canada Health Act, but in 
the meantime, can we help with the financial situation of the 
municipalities? What credibility can the commission have when we 
do not even know how much Mr. Romanow's is paid to sit on the 
commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians may not have all agreed on our increase, but 
everyone did agree that the non-taxable part was not right and that 
it had to be transparent. A royal commission of inquiry is set up 
and we do not even know how much the commissioner is paid per day 
or what his expense account is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is absolutely right. At one point, the work was 
done and what we must do next is to implement the solutions put 
forward by those who provide the services, namely the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to ask a question of the Conservative 
health critic because we are dealing with a very critical issue, 
that is the future of medicare, and the appropriate level of 
expenditure by the federal government for support of our 
universal public health care system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT124"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context it would be remiss of me not to note that the 
erosion of medicare and the slide to privatization actually began 
under the Conservatives and under the direction of Brian Mulroney 
where we were on a path of seeing all cash transfers to the 
provinces for health care dry up by the year 2001.  The Liberals 
came along and put in a cash floor in terms of transfer payments 
but really levelled the playing field to the lowest possible 
denominator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect that the Conservatives have had a re-thinking 
around this issue of transfer payments and the need for cash to 
the provinces.  I would like to know what the current position of 
the Conservative Party is with respect to the level of funding 
from the federal government to the provinces and whether that 
party would be prepared to commit some of the $15 billion in 
surplus, if it had a chance, to health care to ensure medicare is 
sustained and to actually move our system toward the revamped, 
reformed system we are all talking about. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, I remind my colleague that 
Mr. Romanow, who is chairing the commission, was probably one of 
the worst premiers in terms of cutting health care and creating 
huge problems for the system in his province, as with labour 
relations and with other fields.  On this I think that 
regardless of stripe choices were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As concerns the public health system, we want to keep a public 
system with the broad principles of the Canada Health Act.  What 
we said in the election, in 1997 and 2000, is that this had to be 
brought back to the 1993-94 level, which had been agreed on, and 
then move to stable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we talk of tax points and renegotiating the system 
of equalization payments, so that the richer provinces, like the 
poorer ones, may have stable funding within the whole transfer 
system, be it in health care, education, social assistance or 
other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, they said they had to increase, but by how much.  There is 
no question of drawing an amount out of a hat.  The provinces 
have already identified criteria.  First, there is the question 
of economic growth that accompanies equalization tax points. That 
is important.  There are richer provinces and there are poorer 
provinces.  This is why one of the elements in the transfer must 
be the aspect of economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Population is another important consideration.  We are also 
saying that distances must be taken into account.  Urban centres 
like Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City can afford 
different quality services. There should be a rating that takes 
the geographic and demographic dispersal of a region into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of population aging.  In some 
regions and in some provinces the rate of aging is much higher, 
requiring a more targeted inflow of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To these transfers, but first to these transfers in terms of tax 
points and equalization, these calculations, should be added a 
different approach understood by all the beneficiaries of the 
health care system in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank our colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska 
for sharing his comments with us.  I was going to thank him for 
his suggestions as well, but I did not find any of those in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are criticisms of the health system, as he says.  He tells 
us that there are still problems and I think the Minister of 
Health has said the same himself, that not everything has been 
said or done in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague because he has provided our viewing 
audience with an opportunity to make a comparison between the 
health minister's words and what our government has accomplished, 
as summarized in a sober yet eloquent manner by the minister, and 
the inconsistencies of the opposition critic's words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us we lack vision, yet at the same time he faults us 
for striking a royal commission to address the problems and come 
up with a long term vision of the ongoing problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally inconsistent.  We have indeed taken steps to 
meet this challenge of providing a long term vision for Canada's 
health care system.  The opposition critic has carefully omitted 
any reference to research, an area of great success.  Our 
government's investments in health research will make it possible 
for there to be a thorough renewal of our country's health 
services and health care in the years to come.  That is vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the opposition critic fault us, if he is 
able, for our investments in research and in health in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Very briefly, Madam Speaker, I thank the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health and give him 
greetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for a government to cut an arm or a leg off the 
provinces and then offer them an arm or a few toes.  This is 
pretty much what happened with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1993-94 cuts, the total percentage of federal funding 
we are seeing today is not huge.  The government cut because it 
wanted to fight the deficit.  Perhaps it should have cut 
somewhere besides health care.  Then the government found itself 
investing much more publicly than in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not oppose health care research.  We oppose people who 
waste time looking for solutions that have already been found. 
This is why we are asking so many questions on the idea of a 
royal commission of inquiry, when, if I listen to the 
parliamentary secretary speaking for his minister, I will not 
criticize him here, he surely has a vision and the tools he needs 
to find solutions to the health care problems we face.  We do not 
need a royal commission to do so.

that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Yellowhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, we are debating the estimates this evening. 
The portion of the estimates we are debating is the portion 
allocated to the health department.  The health department budget 
is $2.7 billion for the current fiscal year.  I am sure it will 
go up because the department has a lot of work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The estimates of $2.7 billions were examined by the health 
committee.  There were no suggestions from the committee for a 
change in the $2.7 billion allocated to the health department. 
The accountability for the spending of those moneys of course 
continues to be a subject of some debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health department has come under scrutiny in two areas: one 
by the auditor general and the other t through a series of fairly 
well-publicized missteps on the part of the department.  I would 
just like to talk about those briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, last fall's auditor general's report had five chapters 
relating to the health department.  It had a number of criticisms 
on how the department operated and a number of suggestions on how 
the department could be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems highlighted in the auditor general's report 
was Health Canada's non-compliance with the Canada Health Act. 
There was also a problem of information on the federal 
government's total contribution to health care.  The auditor 
general in fact said that the federal government did not know its 
exact contribution to health care because it was wrapped up in 
the health and social transfers.  The auditor general recommended 
that the federal government find some way to identify exactly 
what the federal government spent on health. 
I suppose this would at least be helpful in election campaigns 
when the federal and provincial governments are running competing 
ads as to who pays what and how much.  My hon. colleague who just 
spoke mentioned some of those issues as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general was also concerned about research and 
development.  The minister suggested, and was very proud of the 
fact and well we should be, that the funding for research and 
development was growing and that it was scheduled to double. 
However the auditor general said that the collection criteria and 
evaluation for projects to be funded by government research money 
were not consistently applied and suggested that they needed to 
be worked on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also looked at first nations' health and 
found that although he had given a pretty bad report card to the 
federal government on its handling of first nations' health in 
1997, he found that in the year 2000 the department had “not 
made sufficient progress to correct the deficiencies in any of 
the programs under review”.  He recommended again a sustained 
effort to implement his recommendations.  We have not seen a lot 
of improvement over the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course first nations' health has been a serious concern for 
our country.  All of us feel that the federal government is 
certainly letting down first nations people in this very critical 
and important area.  We could speak for 20 minutes just on the 
problems with first nations' health, its mismanagement and the 
problems there, but time does not permit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also reviewed federal health and safety 
regulation programs.  There were concerns about the need for 
reliable risk assessment and sufficient allocation of financial 
and human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the auditor 
general found that it had not properly resourced its food 
inspection programs based on risk, that actual levels of 
inspection were lower than expected in some cases and that the 
department lacked important information on the incidence of food 
borne illness in humans.  This was hardly reassuring in light of 
the fact that there have been concerns about certain food related 
illnesses that could affect our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also looked at the regulatory regime of 
biologics.  This is something that the committee is studying as 
we speak, and I believe that study is going ahead well.  However 
the auditor general emphasized the need for the department to 
develop clear criteria in determining which approach would be 
appropriate for a given situation as far as regulating and 
supporting the work of the new biotechnology industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that parliamentarians carry out their duty to 
provide oversight on the spending and administration of a great 
deal of money.  In the case of the health department, that 
amounts to $2.7 billion each and every year.  That is a lot of 
money.  Since the government's total budget is well over $150 
billion, it is important that parliamentarians do not just 
sleepwalk their way into approving these estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the nearly eight years that I have sat in the House 
as a parliamentarian, I have not seen one single line of any 
estimate changed in any way by the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either it suggests that the officials of each and every 
government department, and there are many, are pretty much 
infallible in their allocation and administration of these 
billions of dollars, or it suggests that the House is somewhat 
remiss in not being more involved and more proactive in the 
oversight of the administration of the spending of these moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine very many democracies where members have this 
kind of responsibility.  For eight years, and I assume it has 
been even longer although I do not know because I have only been 
here for eight years, not one budgetary line of a single 
department has been altered, improved or changed made by 301 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first response to that observation is that we need to do a 
better job in overseeing the administration and spending of this 
money, particularly when we see in practical terms the 
administration falling short of some requirements that were made 
clear by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are deficiencies in our health system.  We see it in 
mercury levels in fish, in approval of drugs, in water safety and 
a whole bunch of areas where Canadians expect some protection and 
help.  When we see deficiencies we need to look at the allocation 
of moneys to correct those deficiencies rather than just hoping 
they will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at the estimates I suggest that we need to do a 
better job.  There are things that we could do to better allocate 
funds than the way they are allocated today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member noted that the auditor general had indicated some 
concern about the amount of moneys transferred to the provinces. 
The member knows very well some of the mechanics that it goes 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned as well that the combination of tax points and 
cash transfers are relative to specific computations.  The 
provinces do not colour code dollars.  They receive a bulk 
transfer and what they spend it on is in their domain.  That is a 
matter of concern because the federal government has to be the 
protector of the Canada Health Act which has five principles: 
universality, accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness and 
publicly funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised a very good point with regard to the estimates 
process.  She indicated that the health committee had reviewed 
the estimates with officials and that no recommendations were 
made.  Having been on the health committee and having served on 
other committees, I know how difficult the process is because it 
is a very specialized area of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member care to comment on a suggestion that has been 
made as part of the modernization of parliament that the review 
of estimates process be consolidated into one committee? This 
committee would be composed of people who were specifically 
interested and had the background, training and interest to 
review estimates.  The main standing committee could then shift 
its emphasis to a review of the planning and priorities area 
which is more generally of interest to members of the Standing 
Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, with respect to money 
to the provinces, the auditor general's concern was not that the 
federal government sent money to the provinces or that the money 
then became the domain of the provinces, but that the federal 
government was unable, with any certainty, to indicate the amount 
of money it actually contributed to the health care program. 
He felt it was important for that to be quantified, and for 
obvious reasons, then there could be debates on whether it was 
sufficient, on how it was being spent or on any of those things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT129"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT129"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2045

<A HREF="#LINKT128"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also has to be some accountability.  If the federal 
government wants to hold itself out as the guardian of the Canada 
Health Act, then it needs to have some guarding capability and 
some accountability measures.  An example of that would be the $1 
billion being spent on new equipment, which the minister just 
mentioned.  When asked about whether that money was actually 
spent on new equipment or whether provinces were simply using it 
to buy equipment they had already ordered, therefore being of no 
net advantage to patients or to citizens, all he could say was 
that the government was working on a report card from the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A shell game seems to be going on.  The government says that it 
is guarding the act and giving out all the money but when we ask 
how much and how it is being spent, it passes the buck by saying 
that the money is going to the provinces.  It cannot be both 
ways.  Either there is a guardianship and some actual investment, 
which means that it can show something for its investment, or it 
is simply a loose arrangement and nobody knows the results of the 
investment.  We need to be honest and not try to either claim 
credit or assign blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other item is this idea of a review of estimates committee. 
I hate to agree with the member opposite, because it goes against 
the grain a little bit in this place, but on first blush it seems 
to be a very sensible suggestion for about three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, not all of us are bean counter types.  I know my hon. 
colleague is a very well respected and competent chartered 
accountant, so I use the term bean counter types in the most 
positive and complimentary sense.  It is true that some people 
have those sorts of skills while others do not.  Some people 
attend Harvard and others attend MIT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is some coherence and consistency in attacking the 
estimates rather than having a kind of hit and miss depending on 
the time, the commitment and the agenda of a particular 
committee. All the estimates would presumably be given the same 
level of scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we could then hold someone's feet to the fire.  Instead 
of saying that none of the committees really came up with much, 
we could look at the review of estimates committee and ask why 
everything was kind of waved through without so much as a 
critique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with my hon. colleague that it would be a very good 
proposal to look at.  Unless someone educates me better, I will 
be supporting that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK314"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member for Calgary—Nose Hill makes the 
important link between the estimates we are debating tonight, 
which deals with the Department of Health, and various reports by 
the auditor general relating to activities pursuant to Health 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like to ask concerns the indepth 
investigations by the auditor general on the safety of our food 
supply in Canada today.  The member will know that the auditor 
general has been fairly critical about both the Health Protection 
Branch and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in not 
appropriately resourcing their programs to ensure the 
precautionary principle is applied at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few days we have heard concerns raised about mercury 
in fish, mad cow disease, salmonella and other major issues. 
Would the member support the idea of more money being taken from 
the surplus and being put into the Health Protection Branch to 
ensure adequate resourcing and an independent science capacity so 
that all attempts necessary to protect Canadians at risk in terms 
of the food supply can be taken?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is 
obviously yes.  Canadians trust us and our government departments 
to protect their interests.  They are buying food with confidence 
because they believe we know what we are doing.  If there is a 
deficiency to any extent in protecting the interests of 
Canadians, particularly with respect to the safety of the food on 
their supermarket shelves, then we need to fix it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is really a privilege and an honour to be able to 
speak this evening to the main estimates on health.  I have been 
involved in the health committee since I have been a member, 
which is a short time, but I have come to understand some of the 
problems and complexities of the system from being involved in it 
quite a while before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really taken by what I am hearing this evening, 
particularly from the Minister of Health with regard to the state 
of the health of our country.  When I really assess what is going 
on in health, a very rosy picture is being painted, but clearly 
all is not well in the state of our health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost every day we can pick up a news report that shows 
disturbing problems that are happening.  Some of them were just 
mentioned by the hon. member:  mad cow disease, problems with our 
food inspection agency and the fears we have about some of our 
food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost every day we can pick up something that will give us an 
example of the problems.  Yesterday there was a report dealing 
with orthopedics and arthritis care.  The average waiting time 
for hip and knee replacement surgeries in this country is six 
months, while some must wait well over a year.  In fact I had a 
lady in my office yesterday, who is well known by many of the 
members in this place, who has been waiting for a year for knee 
surgery and now has to wait another 15 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All is not well.  The reason for some of the shortages is that 
there is an obvious shortage of manpower in this area.  One 
hundred and fifty orthopedic surgeons are required to supply the 
need that we have today, and that is without taking into account 
the demographics of our society.  It takes 10 years to train a 
new orthopedic surgeon, so we can understand the dilemma that we 
are in and that it has not happened overnight.  We are in serious 
problems with regard to human resources in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little alarmed when the minister suggested that all we 
needed to do was to put a few more dollars into health research 
and that would attract the best and the brightest minds to our 
health care system which would sustain the system over the long 
haul.  I do believe that is true and I do not think Canadians are 
buying that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, Canadians are wondering if the medicare system 
will be there for them when they really need it.  These hard 
questions are being asked about the long term sustainability of 
the system. We talked about some of the problems: the long 
waiting lists, the shortage of doctors and nurses and the 
obsolete equipment.  We talked about the numbers of dollars that 
are going into the equipment, $500 million up to April 1 and then 
another $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk to radiologists they say that none of this equipment 
is getting into their hospitals.  They are using equipment that 
has to be taped up with duct tape.  I have farmed for many years 
and I know the value of a good roll of duct tape, but I do not 
believe that it should be used on our medical equipment.  They 
are telling me that they have to move switches up and down 
repeatedly before some of the archaic equipment can be turned on. 
Third world countries will not even accept some of this stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suggesting that we do not have a problem and that we do not have 
a crisis is putting our heads in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Peter Barrett, the outgoing president of the Canadian 
Medical Association, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The serious problems facing medicare today can be labelled a 
health care crisis.  For patients waiting for health care 
services, it is a personal crisis. Doctors and nurses on the 
front lines know it is a crisis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will increasingly become more of a crisis as the weight of 
the demographic age of the baby boomers hits the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this did not happen overnight.  The removal 
of the dollars in the mid-nineties has caused major problems that 
are now coming to bear upon a system that has been neglected for 
far too long.  It is time we paid some attention to this because 
our health care system is about to pay the price for some of that 
neglect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems with the federal government's overall leadership 
and the funding of health care in the country are mirrored by a 
number of problems within Health Canada itself.  A more direct 
subject of debate could be added, as several problems within 
Health Canada have come to light just in the time that I have 
been in parliament or as more light has recently been shed on the 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has mismanaged funding with regard to the Inuit. 
Aboriginal people are repeatedly highlighted in the auditor 
general's report.  There are problems with the Virginia Fontaine 
Addictions Foundation that raise serious questions.  We have 
raised this in the House.  There are many problems with 
overprescription of drugs within our aboriginal communities, 
overprescriptions from which people have died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister talked about drugs.  Many problems have also 
arisen from the diet drug Prepulsid.  There was the Vanessa Young 
inquest.  Sixty-nine recommendations came out of that inquest. 
The minister suggested in the House that he would implement all 
of them.  It is definitely an acknowledgement that we have a 
problem in the system when every one of the recommendations will 
be looked at or implemented.  That is what he said, so obviously 
there is a problem related to drugs and the process within Health 
Canada itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on with a number of problems but I do not have much 
time so I will move on to another area of federal incompetence. 
It has to do with the compensation for hepatitis C victims.  We 
know about the tainted blood.  Members mentioned it earlier.  We 
know that it is a major problem.  We know that almost 50% of the 
money is left over and yet there are thousands of patients who 
were infected and who have not been able to access the funding 
for hepatitis C victims.  They really need that funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to look beyond the problems.  The hon. member 
across the way suggested that there are some problems but that 
solutions are what is needed.  I would like to ask him and the 
entire House to start thinking outside the box when it comes to 
health care, because arguably we have some very serious problems. 
Just the introduction of the Romanow report is an acknowledgement 
that hopefully we will start to think about some of the 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let us talk about accountability within the system.  If I 
asked Canadians who they think is looking after the dollars in 
the health care system now they could not tell me.  I am saying 
to Canadians right now that they could not tell me.  It is not 
the politicians, I can tell Canadians that, and it is not the 
regional authorities in most of our provinces because I have been 
there. They deal with the health care dollars within their global 
budgets, or the funding formulas and access to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have some blank cheques in the system and until we 
address them the system will never be able to sustain itself over 
the next 40 years because of the baby boomers and the technology 
that is coming along.  I am saying that we need to look at the 
accountability of both users and providers within the system.  We 
need to stop playing games with the health care dollars that are 
so precious and dear and that the taxpayers of the country work 
hard to earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we acknowledge what we can do about 
accountability by having users and providers more accountable.  I 
hope I get a question or two on that because I will not have time 
to explain it as I want to get on to my other idea, which is 
something that that I think is very imperative.  We have talked 
about it since the 1970s but have just paid lip service to it. It 
is the area of health care prevention and promotion, because 
health is much more than health care.  We have been crisis 
managing health care in the country for so many years that we 
have to absolutely stop doing it or we will never sustain it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long run we have to think outside the box and start 
asking ourselves questions.  When we have an epidemic of obese 
students within our educational system, why are we not talking to 
the educators of this country?  Why are we not talking to them 
with regard to solving some of the problems that are going to hit 
the system because of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was talked about with regard to the tobacco industry.  We 
know that if we can stop teenagers from smoking, if we can stop 
them before the age of 20, we will win the battle against tobacco 
addiction.  Why are we not talking to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the number one reason we hospitalize people in this 
country is mental illness.  Why are we not talking to industry 
and thinking outside the box? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to say that we do have a problem in 
health care.  We can come up with some solutions if we work 
together.  I would offer my assistance in doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK316"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
the member opposite for outlining a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member wanted to be asked a question on accountability. 
I will ask the question so that the member can elaborate further 
on the blank cheque to the provinces.  In what ways could we make 
the provinces accountable or have them monitor health care?  That 
is a good question.  I would like to hear more of the member's 
suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that, what does the member think in regard to the 
accountability of passing on that spending?  Various provinces 
have passed on expenditures or transfers from the federal 
government in various amounts.  Various provinces spend different 
proportions on health care.  Some of the provinces will be in 
very good shape soon, such as Alberta, which I think will be out 
of debt soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, I am glad the member mentioned the point of recruitment. 
It is a very important point.  I was glad to hear the minister 
mention some plans in that respect.  However, I know the Alliance 
is interested in taxes and I am curious about something.  Does 
the member think that because we have made the largest tax cut in 
Canadian history, although of course it could always be more, it 
will help keep health care professionals in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
his questions.  This gives me an opportunity to explain a little 
more about what I did not have time for in my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to accountability, I think we miss the boat when we 
get bogged down by the question of whose jurisdiction it is, of 
whether it is a federal or provincial jurisdiction and whether 
the dollars are federal or provincial dollars.  We have to 
understand that they are all taxpayer dollars from taxes paid by 
Canadians.  That is what is so critical about accountability. 
Accountability does not come with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability comes when we move Canadians, the users of the 
system whose hard earned dollars pay for a system of health care 
that they are so proud of, closer to the system and give them the 
opportunity, the education and the understanding to be able to 
access the system appropriately and to feel accountable to it.  I 
believe that every time they access services they should have an 
account of what is paid on their behalf.  The paradigm would 
suddenly shift.  Instead of thinking that health care is just 
there and they can use it without any responsibility, they would 
then have an understanding of who is using it.  Something else 
would happen:  doctors will start treating patients a lot 
differently when they know that the patients know exactly what is 
being paid on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is how we start bringing accountability into the 
system.  That could be a federal jurisdiction because it is a 
broad plank and a broad idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not solve health care problems with one silver bullet. 
If we thought one silver bullet would do it we would have used it 
a long time ago.  We would have fired that bullet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start with a broad plank and then start building from 
there.  That is how to bring accountability into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to taxes, we absolutely need to lower the taxes to 
hopefully give ourselves a little more competitiveness so that 
hard earned dollars go farther in this country.  We have put a 
sign up that Canada is open for business, but will it solve the 
problem of the brain drain of our professionals going south?  It 
is maybe a step in the right direction, but we have to do a lot 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make a fatal error in Canada with our human resources by not 
negotiating when physicians are going through the educational 
system.  That is when they need our help.  That is when they are 
vulnerable.  We should negotiate then as to exactly where they 
will come out and serve, not after they get a degree.  Any head 
of business will tell us that negotiations happen when both sides 
need each other, not when one side does things in isolation or 
afterwards.  The brain drain is a big problem.  Human resources 
is one of the major problems and it will not be solved overnight.

in Canada?  Is he in favour of national standards for health care 
whereby we are treated the same from coast to coast to coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is from Alberta where there was the experience of bill 11 and 
all the protests in his province.  It would be interesting to 
know where he stands on some of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think I can 
answer that in one minute.  It is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we get suckered into a false debate in the country when 
there is a private-public debate.  We have been suckered into 
that debate throughout the country.  The member used the example 
of Alberta and bill 11.  That is exactly what Alberta 
experienced.  It ended up being a neutered bill.  That is not the 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the absolute phobia about user fees, I do not think we 
have to go to user fees.  I think we need to open up the books 
and bring Canadians closer to the system.  The member mentioned 
user fees in a glib way and I am a little cautious about that. If 
user fees or some other incentives become necessary, I think 
Canadians will tell us.  I do not thing it is something we should 
debate right now.  We have to go plank by plank initially.  Those 
are short answers and I could go on but my time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK318"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Winnipeg North Centre who is the very eloquent spokesperson for 
the New Democratic Party on all matters concerning health care. I 
would not want to take more than half the time so that she has a 
chance to put our position on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important debate we are having here this evening. 
I suppose there is nothing that defines us as Canadians in terms 
of our collective character and differentiates us from the 
Americans more than our national health care program.  Canadians, 
when asked what they are proud of about Canada, will say many 
things but many of them point to health care and public health 
care is a very important part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say at the outset that I am very proud of the role my 
party historically played in terms of getting health care into 
the country.  I remember the debates when I was a teenager.  At 
that time there was the great doctors' strike in 1961 in 
Saskatchewan when health care came in.  The premier at the time 
was the CCF premier, Woodrow Lloyd.  The CCF of course was the 
predecessor of the New Democratic Party, the NDP.  I remember the 
fear among a lot of people at that time when all the doctors in 
the province went on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the then leader of the opposition, Ross Thatcher, 
protesting that the legislature was not called back to deal with 
the issue.  He actually kicked the doors of the legislature.  In 
the political history of our province there is a very famous 
picture of the Liberal leader, who I would say was a very 
conservative Liberal leader, kicking the doors of the legislative 
assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that was really the opening of the floodgates for 
national health care in the country.  Not long after that we had 
the appointment by prime minister John Diefenbaker of the Hall 
commission under Emmett Hall.  It recommended a national health 
care program based upon the Saskatchewan model, which was a 
publicly administered, single payer type of system in the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the prime ministership of Lester B. Pearson, and under 
Paul Martin Sr., who was a minister at that time, and through the 
pressure of Tommy Douglas and the NDP caucus in the House of 
Commons at that time, we finally got national medicare in the 
mid-1960s in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party first promised national medicare back in 1919. 
It took from 1919 until the mid-1960s to actually become a 
reality in the country.  That is how slow these Liberals move, at 
a snail's pace or like molasses in January.  It was the prodding 
and pushing and the role played by Saskatchewan that made this a 
very popular idea right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the time came when the political support was there and 
the public opinion was there.  The federal government finally 
moved, under what was a very progressive Liberal government under 
Lester B. Pearson, quite the contrary to what we have today. 
Today we have the most conservative Liberal government in the 
history of our country.  I am sure we would all agree with that 
if we compare it to the governments of Lester B. Pearson and 
Pierre Trudeau. 
In many ways this government is more conservative than Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government was between 
1984 and 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-1960s we finally got medicare in this country.  We 
finally got a national program.  We finally got a single payer 
system in this country that is now the envy of many people around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberal government do in its budget?  In February 
1995 it took an axe to medicare.  It cut medicare and transfers 
to the provinces.  It cut them so radically that every province 
in the country was suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the government of Roy Romanow, who is now 
head of the commission on medicare, was the only provincial 
government, contrary to what my friend in the Conservative Party 
said a few minutes ago, that backfilled dollar for dollar the 
loss of federal dollars from the provincial budget and the 
provincial caucus to maintain what we had in our province of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those cutbacks have hurt the system very severely.  We 
had the health care accord of September 11, 2000, right before 
the election, which injected more federal money into health care, 
but even under that accord we are still well behind where we 
would have been if the cutbacks had not come in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just three weeks ago we had a economic statement by the Minister 
of Finance.  In that economic statement he announced that we had 
$15 billion in unexpected surplus in the country and that every 
penny of that surplus was applied to the national debt.  If we 
had a system like some of the provinces do, where we had a 
special fund set up into which this surplus money would go, then 
those of us in parliament could have a national debate as to 
where that money should be allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had polled the Canadian people as to whether or not they 
wanted all of that $15 billion put into the national debt or 
whether they wanted some of that put into health care, education, 
the farm crisis, infrastructure or the aboriginal problems in 
this country, I am sure that the Canadian people would 
overwhelmingly and massively have told us to spend a huge portion 
of that on the health care and educational problems the ordinary 
people of this country face.  However, that did not happen.  It 
did not happen because that is not the priority of the government 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to debating the estimates, debating supply, it is 
very important for us to remind the government and the ministers 
across the way that they made a decision, first, to cut back 
radically on health care, putting many strains on the system and 
putting many parts of the country into crisis.   Now, when we 
have the funds to do better, when we have this $15 billion 
surplus, the government chooses to put every single penny of that 
surplus to paying down the national debt.  That is on top of 
announcing last fall before the election, in another economic 
statement, that there would be tax cuts of $100 billion for the 
Canadian people, many of those tax cuts helping wealthy people 
and the big corporations of this country that do not need those 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a large percentage of that money should have been spent 
in health care and education and on the human deficit in this 
country.  In 1995 when those cutbacks were made, when people 
fought against the deficit that had been run up, mainly by the 
Tories, by accepting the cutbacks in the social programs, there 
was the creation of a human deficit in Canada.  Now that we have 
some fiscal dividends it is the people of this country who should 
reap some of those benefits through health care programs, 
education and social services as we fight and combat this human 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two biggest failures of the government across the way are 
the environmental record of this country and the gap between the 
rich and the poor, which is once again growing instead of 
narrowing.  A large part of that is due to the cutbacks in social 
programs in Canada and health care is a very important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we go from here?  I think we have a very good system. 
We have a very important system.  We have a system that many 
Americans would like to see emulated in that country.  Some 40 
million Americans are not covered by health care or medicare at 
all.  We have a system that is based on the concept of a single 
payer, that is, the provincial governments, with the help of the 
federal government, pay the health care bills in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the system of public administration.  In that system of 
public administration we know there is some flexibility in terms 
of some things being private. 
Hospitals will sometimes privatize or contract out the food 
service, the catering service, the laundry service or some other 
services.  However, it is important within that context that 
everything be publicly administered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the member from the Canadian Alliance in Alberta, to me 
this debate is not irrelevant in terms of public versus private. 
It is extremely important that we keep a public system, a single 
fare system and have it publicly administered on behalf of every 
Canadian.  If we do not, we will create a chequerboard health 
care system with the richer provinces having a better system than 
the poorer provinces.  We could end up like some countries in the 
world, such as the United States, where wealthier people, because 
of the thickness of their pocketbooks, have access to a better 
health system than the ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that we keep that system publicly 
administered in a single tier system for every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to develop a pharmacare program so that the price 
of pharmaceutical goods and drugs is not a deterrent for people 
when combating an illness.  We also need a good home care 
program.  In both these cases the federal government should 
provide some leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying we have to maintain national standards for 
home care, for daycare and pharmaceutical care.  Within those 
national standards we have to have the flexibility of the 
administration of a system by each province that fits their 
unique characteristics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK319"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle has stood in the House before and talked about 
this very negative option as he sees it, and that is paying down 
the debt is not a realistic option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have over $550 billion of debt.  In 1995-96 the debt to 
GDP ratio, that is the debt in relation to the size of the 
economy, was about 71.2%.  It is now around 55%.  The norm would 
be somewhere around 40% or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at investing in social programs, the government 
last September at the premiers conference invested some $21.4 
billion in health care, post-secondary education and other social 
programs, which was the largest single investment the government 
ever made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $15 billion that automatically went toward paying down the 
debt at the end of the last fiscal year was the surplus.  The 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle is a member of the finance 
committee.  I am sure he knows the procedure that whatever the 
surplus is it goes to paying down the debt.  That will save 
taxpayers $2 billion a year in debt service charges.  That will 
mean more resources are freed up to invest in health care and 
post-secondary education, to cut taxes and to invest in 
innovation, training and skills development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the member such an aversion to paying down the debt?  We 
still have a debt in Canada of about $550 billion which is far 
too high?  Why is he so negative on paying it down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, my answer will be very 
short.  I have nothing against paying down the debt.  The debt 
has gone down from 71% of GDP to 55% of GDP, as the parliamentary 
secretary said.  It is going down very rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about balance.  There will be a tax cut of $100 
billion over five years.  There will be $21 or $22 billion going 
to health care and social services over five years, and a big 
hunk of money going to the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at any poll, Canadians have said overwhelmingly that 
there is not a balance and that more money should go to health 
care, education, social services, infrastructure and the farm 
crisis.  In other words, it should go into a people's agenda. 
That is the only place where I differ from the parliamentary 
secretary.  It is a matter of priorities and balance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK320"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the member made mention in his address that the 
government in the mid-nineties took an axe to the health care 
portfolio.  I made mention of that in my remarks as well.  I also 
made mention of some of the repercussions which we are suffering 
now. 
I think we concur on that and we have to guard against that ever 
happening again.  That is why we are suggesting we have a long 
term plan for the finances of health care and that we have a 
sustainable five year budget so that can never happens again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that all we really need to save the health 
care system is to throw more money at it.  If that is not the 
case and I misinterpreted that, exactly what would he see as some 
of the solutions for health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not say that the 
solution was to throw more money at it.  We need more funding to 
sustain the system and make sure it is equalized across the 
country with national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Romanow commission is looking at ways of enhancing and 
making medicare more cost effective and beneficial for the 
Canadian people.  There are efficiencies that I hope we can find 
to put into the system.  However throwing more money into the 
system is not the answer, but we need enough money to make sure 
they system is sustainable in terms of the hospitals, salaries 
for doctors and nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think any independent analyst would say that the cutbacks 
were just too severe in 1995.  It pushed many of the provinces 
deeper into debts and deficits.  Many provinces closed hospitals 
and cut back on their systems.  I think the government went too 
far at that particular time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is extra federal funding, but part of the 
problem is making sure we are more efficient in terms of 
delivering a health care system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK321"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle.  He made some very good points.   I believe 
he feels as passionately about the health care system and about 
making sure it is universal, acceptable and accessible for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to ask him a question with respect to Roy 
Romanow, a pre-eminent Canadian who I believe was a brilliant 
choice on behalf of the government.  The Prime Minister of course 
made that appointment, which I think stands in good stead for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the member optimistic or pessimistic on Mr. Romanow's 
appointment and what he would do in this very important study? It 
is my understanding that he will cross Canada and consult with 
stakeholders, Canadians and other interested parties on this very 
important area.  Before he answers I would like to say I am very 
optimistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, Mr. Romanow has been a 
friend of mine since 1967.  I just spoke with him yesterday, and 
I am sure he will do an excellent job and make a valuable 
contribution like Mr. Emmett Hall did back in the 1960s. 
<P><A NAME="LINK322"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have been trying to contain my feelings and save 
up for this opportunity.  Now there is only 10 minutes to put 
over six months of concerns on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on two areas pertaining to Health Canada. 
There are two pillars of health care in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first pillar is our national health insurance system which 
is the envy of the world and a model that ensures access for all 
citizens on a universal basis to accessible, quality health care 
that is now facing serious decline and erosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar is our national health safety system which 
emerged out of the thalidomide crisis in the 1950s and has served 
Canadians well over the last several decades.  It is also under 
serious threat from underfunding and lack of leadership by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases these pillars of medicare are crumbling.  They are 
crumbling because of Liberal government neglect, lack of 
leadership by the present Minister of Health and a failure to 
ensure that some allocation of funds from this budgetary year, 
which is showing a $15 billion surplus, be allocated to those 
very important cornerstones of Canadian public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not only dealing with a lack of adequate resources and a 
failure of the government to put a pittance of the $15 billion 
surplus toward these important areas, we are also dealing with a 
government that has failed to show leadership and provide 
national standards and national direction in two fundamental 
issues facing Canadians today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in his comments this evening was quick to point out 
with some pride the $21.1 billion contribution by the federal 
government following the September 11, 2000 accord for health 
care.  However, the minister failed to point out that we are 
talking about $21.1 billion spread out over five years to cover 
health, education and social services.  We are talking about a 
restoration of funds by the federal government to bring us up to 
1994 levels which ensures that the federal government is involved 
to the tune of 15%, a long way from the 50:50 division that 
existed in the past for medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government failing to ensure our medicare model 
is sustained and supported, it is contributing to the erosion of 
that system and allowing, through its passive response and 
inaction, the slide toward privatization and yes, two tier health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister this evening stood in the House and tried to 
suggest he was making great progress by announcing a performance 
report, which would come into effect in the year 2002, and a 
citizens council on quality health care. These are two ideas 
which we will not sneeze at.  They are important contributions to 
the debate, but they do not address the need for action.  They do 
not address the concerns raised by the Canadian Federation of 
Nurses Unions when this organization pointed out the government 
promised, with the September accord, to deal with the nursing 
shortage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promised to deal with the drug pricing problems. 
It promised to deal with home care, and there has been no action. 
It has failed to address the Canadian Nurses Association 
recommendation for some contribution toward a recruitment 
strategy to deal with the crisis that is looming for all 
Canadians and the fact that at this rate we are in all likelihood 
going to face a shortage of 113,000 nurses by the year 2011. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed to deal with the suggestions from the 
Canadian Health Care Association that called upon the government 
in March of this year to allocate significant new resources to 
ensure we dealt with the shortfall of health care professionals 
and help provide the kind of quality care Canadians needed and 
deserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not deal with the recommendations of the 
Canadian Medical Association that presented to the government a 
comprehensive document entitled “Looking at the Future of 
Health, Health Care and Medicine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not dealt with the serious problems facing 
Canadians in terms of accessing necessary medications.  It has 
not dealt with the recent report in March of this year by the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information which pointed out that 
almost six million Canadians had inadequate insurance for 
prescription drugs, or that 10% of the population had no drug 
insurance at all and another 10% were under insured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not dealt with the concerns that are at the 
root of our erosion of medicare and will not commit to fulfilling 
promises made long ago to have a national home care plan, a 
national pharmacare plan and a major reform at the primary care 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need resources now to ensure that we can sustain medicare and 
reform it in terms of the community based preventative health 
care model we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar pertains to health protection. 
We raised serious questions about mad cow disease in the House 
this week.  The answer from the minister was appalling and needs 
to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that on April 4, we asked questions of 
Health Canada officials pertaining to mad cow disease. 
Specifically, I asked if it was possible that deer and elk killed 
on our highways were slaughtered, rendered and entered into the 
feed that went to live animals?  Dr. André Gravel said there was 
a remote chance.  I also asked if it was possible, under present 
regulations, for cow blood to actually get into the feed that 
went to live animals.  Dr. Gravel said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister appeared before the health committee on April 26 
and pretended or claimed that he knew nothing about that and said 
that they were taking all necessary precautions.  Yesterday in 
the House, the minister stood and said to all Canadians that 
Canada was BSE free and that they were taking all precautions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case.  The minister has not put all the facts 
before the Canadian public.  He is not taking the necessary 
precautionary steps to ensure Canadians are protected from the 
very serious threat of mad cow disease or, if I can refer also to 
issues raised previously, mercury in fish, or salmonella 
poisoning or the uncertainty around genetically modified 
organisms in our food supply today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has hacked and slashed our health protection 
branch starting in 1997 under the present Minister of Health.  It 
has not fully restored our scientific capacity.  It has not 
ensured that we have independent research.  It has not taken 
steps to protect Canadians in all instances in terms of our food 
supply, the drugs Canadians need or any other area for that 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise all this not to engage in fearmongering as the 
government is so wont to classify it.  I raise it because if we 
do not take steps now to deal with these threats we will pay a 
price down the road.  We will pay a price in terms of human 
health and in terms of our agricultural industry.  This is about 
protecting our farmers and the health of consumers.  It is about 
trying to convince the government to act now before it is too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reprehensible for the Minister of Health to stand whenever 
he is posed a question and suggest that the opposition does not 
know what it is talking about, that it does not have all the 
facts and that everything is just A-okay.  We know from many 
reports, especially the 3,000 page report just released by the 
minister's own departmental officials, about the problems of BSE 
and the potential threat of mad cow disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious, comprehensive study which suggests we do not 
know the incubation period for transmission of the pathogen and 
do not know the source of the problem.  We do not know that cow's 
blood, gelatine or other animal products which are put into feed 
and then fed to live animals will not transmit the disease to 
human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to look at this serious issue, take 
all precautionary steps and ensure we have regulations in place 
that protect Canadians at all costs.  We are asking the minister 
to look beyond the inadequate advice he is getting from his own 
departmental officials and look to the world, to the European 
Union and to other countries that are now realizing the 
importance of taking all necessary steps to protect the food 
supply.  We must ensure the health of Canadians is not 
threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two pillars of Canada's health care system, universal health 
insurance and our nationally acclaimed health safety system, have 
held the country in good stead.  They have ensured Canadians have 
access to quality care and have protected Canadians against the 
worst threats in terms of tainted food, problematic drugs or 
unsafe water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that is the most basic thing the government can do. 
Surely this is the time and the opportunity for the government to 
invest a portion, just a portion, of the $15 billion surplus into 
quality health care and into the health, well-being and future of 
our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I would like to make 
a comment, if hon. members will indulge me.  We are dealing with 
estimates today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK323"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
understand your point, but an evening debate like this is a time 
when members can express themselves quite broadly and eloquently 
and can be more thoughtful than is often the case in the 
hurly-burly of normal debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say 
and what her colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle had to say.  It 
seems to me we live in a confederation.  The strength of a 
confederation is that we have jurisdictions where all sorts of 
things can be tried.  If they are no good, others can learn and 
do not need to repeat the experiment.  If they are good they can 
be applied by the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle gave the rightly famous 
example of Saskatchewan developing a health care system which 
proved to be good for the whole country.  Similarly the federal 
government, in addition to taking ideas from the jurisdictions, 
can have ideas of its own and hopefully persuade the provinces to 
go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the thing works well when it is clearly federal 
jurisdiction and the federal government has the wherewithal and 
the jurisdiction to do something.  For example, it was this 
government that put every school, every kindergarten, on the 
Internet through the SchoolNet program.  The provinces 
essentially were not involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Saskatchewan and health care, the province 
developed something and the Liberal government of the day saw it 
was possible.  The other provinces realized it was possible and 
that they could implement it.

<A HREF="#LINKT138"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some other examples.  I think the member would agree 
that the child tax benefit is a remarkable program of the 
government and yet it has been clawed back, for example in my own 
province of Ontario, from the poorest children and families.  The 
federal government appears able to do nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 research chairs is an extraordinary program.  No 
jurisdiction has a fraction of the number of research chairs we 
have.  We discovered that universities sometimes cannot afford 
the research chairs because they are not getting the funds 
through the CHST or from the provinces to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada student loan program has been greatly improved. The 
millennium scholarship program is 95% income related and deals 
directly with student loans, yet most provinces with the 
exception of two are raising tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague comment on that?  Where jurisdiction is 
clearly provincial or federal, things are very simple.  In the 
most common cases jurisdiction is less simple.  What are her 
thoughts with respect to that and health care which is the main 
topic of her remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I would like to 
indicate that I was not trying to steer the debate in any 
direction.  Members are free to express themselves freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know that.  I 
know that you know I was talking about estimates and the budget 
and the fact that the government should have considered 
allocating a portion of the $15 billion surplus to health care to 
meet some of the critical issues I outlined in my remarks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the very important question from the Liberal member 
across the away about innovations by the federal government that 
should be supported.  I want him to know that the Liberal 
government has come forward with good ideas in a number of 
instances.  I have indicated tonight that we do not quarrel with 
the idea of performance reports or a citizens' council dealing 
with quality health care.  These are important ideas that should 
be advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am concerned about where the government stops in terms 
of concrete action to deal with serious problems.  I am concerned 
about its failure to keep promises pertaining to such basic 
issues as access to reasonably priced drugs, a universally 
accessible home care program and major reforms to primary health 
care.  These are all issues the government said it would be 
innovative on but has failed to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised the important issue of split jurisdiction and 
the problem of trying to advance these issues in the context of 
different agendas at the federal-provincial level.  I recognize 
that point.  However in terms of health care we are dealing with 
a willingness on the part of many provincial governments to make 
progress in the areas of pharmacare and home care.  That is the 
case with my home province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a tremendous resistance or lack of courage by the 
federal government to take up and advance these issues in 
collaboration with provinces that are willing to co-operate.  The 
example of innovation is relevant to the debate because Manitoba 
offers, and the Minister of Health knows this, model programs in 
the areas of pharmacare and home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba pioneered those ideas many years ago and they ought to 
be replicated across Canada.  However that would take federal 
leadership and it would take money.  Yes, it would take some of 
the budgetary surplus available to us today.  It would also take 
a minister who is prepared to do battle if necessary with less 
than co-operative provinces.  There is an interest that the 
present Minister of Health could tap into.  He could move 
expeditiously on some of the key issues pertaining to the reform 
and renewal of medicare.

the member for Mississauga South.  I am happy to contribute to 
the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked for over 25 years as a surgeon in a rural 
community in New Brunswick, having worked in a hospital setting 
and with community health services for all those years, having 
had the privilege of sitting on the Standing Committee on Health 
with government and opposition colleagues, whom I got to know and 
appreciate, I must say I have the health of all Canadians at 
heart.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am opposed to Motion No. 1, which questions Health 
Canada's Vote 5 on the department's subsidies and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this opposition to the motion a way of saying that the 
approach to achieving the government's objective regarding health 
is not laudable? Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members in this House like to claim that the Government of 
Canada is out of touch with the public that it serves. They like 
to suggest that the government is disconnected from the real 
needs of Canadians. This is far from the reality, and in more 
ways than one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most appropriate ways to demonstrate that we care 
about the health of Canadians is to look at the subsidies and 
contributions that Health Canada gives to community organizations 
and to its partners, the provincial and territorial governments. 
These funds meet real needs in the health sector and they allow 
us to explore new avenues to strengthen our health system. 
Currently, subsidies and contributions are given to partners that 
do productive work in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic principle is that our government is taking measures 
regarding a large number of priorities in health, priorities that 
Canadians feel are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking measures to provide to first nations 
and Inuit communities sustainable programs and health services 
that take into account the disparities and the threat of disease, 
so they can enjoy a level of health that is comparable to 
that of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking measures to improve prenatal health and 
ensure that young children have the best possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking measures to help older children and 
teenagers who are pressured by their peers to smoke or to use 
drugs or alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking measures regarding a number of 
priorities in community health that impact on people of all ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is working to meet the needs of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our government knows that all these concerns need not 
be tackled strictly within government.  The fact is that there 
are many groups already working in these areas.  There are ways 
that we can work with the provincial and territorial governments. 
There are many organizations which are very familiar with their 
communities and which have the necessary expertise to deliver 
effective programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grants and contributions are investments in partnerships and 
success.  I will, if I may, give a few examples of what I am 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the alcohol and drug treatment and 
rehabilitation program, or ADTR. This is a longstanding program 
designed to reduce the harm caused, as we all know, by alcohol 
and other drug abuse to individuals, to families and to 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this program, Health Canada provides funding to the 
provinces and territories in order to help them improve 
accessibility to effective alcohol and drug treatment and rehab 
programs. These governments use these funds to support direct 
treatment and rehab programs for persons with substance abuse 
problems, and to provide training to health professionals, as 
well as services in schools, rapid screening, and counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, if we accept this opposition to the motion, the 
provinces and territories will no longer receive support for 
ADTR.  The funding will no longer be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the programs in support of science, which is 
essential to an understanding of health risks.  It is crucial to 
policy choices that will enhance Canadians' health.  All of these 
are supported by research funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for instance, research into atmospheric pollution 
in our cities.  All of us realize that poor quality air is bad 
for people, but we need to know which components in air pollution 
are the most harmful. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT141"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT141"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2145

<A HREF="#LINKT140"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know whether this situation presents more risks for 
certain members of society such as children or seniors.  With 
that information, governments, communities and businesses can 
make informed choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada funds research activities at the University of 
Ottawa in these fields.  This budget category is what funds that 
research.  These are areas of research which ought to make it 
possible to improve the rules and policies that impact on 
atmospheric pollution and to provide healthier air to the 
population of our cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many other cases, we are pursuing broad initiatives in which 
our subsidies and contributions are combined to fulfil major 
commitments made to Canadians. Allow me to give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week, the government announced new support for eight 
health initiatives in rural British Columbia. This was a global 
announcement on subsidies and contributions. For example, some 
local and regional projects will benefit from funds provided 
through the HIV/AIDS strategy to target problems such as the care 
and treatment for people infected with the HIV/AIDS virus, or to 
prevent the spreading of the HIV/AIDS virus in these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some projects will benefit from the support provided under the 
community action program for children. We co-manage this program 
with the provincial and territorial governments. This is another 
example of federal-provincial co-operation through subsidies and 
contributions. And this co-operation will provide support for 
community programs and services that help children up to six 
years of age get a good start in life, be ready for school and 
improve their chances of having a healthy adult life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already close to 450 projects across Canada under the 
community action program for children. Together, these projects 
are valued at more than $50 million. If the House accepts the 
motion, this will all come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by pointing out that a large number of subsidies 
and contributions help shape Canada's future health system. The 
funding provided under that vote will be used for a number of 
telehealth initiatives across Canada, including in Quebec, 
Ontario, Atlantic Canada, western Canada and the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These projects serve as testing grounds for ideas on such 
matters as how health care organizations can exchange records on 
patients securely and effectively and on how to give people in 
remote regions access to the expertise available in the health 
care centres of our major cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are even trying ways to link people receiving home care with 
organizations providing community services to enable them to use 
these technologies at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to give an example of the outreach project in 
Ontario.  This project, which is being run in London, involves 
exploring a way to meet the need for psychiatric services in 
poorly served regions in southwest and northern Ontario. It will 
be achieved by linking four psychiatric centres to as many as 100 
locations in the cities and communities of the first nations, by 
way of a video conferencing system.  Examples of this sort are 
popping up all over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that subsidies and contributions are an essential 
part of the government's strategy to improve the health of 
Canadians.  They enable us to support local organizations that 
share our commitment to a healthy childhood.  They enable us to 
support major research efforts.  They enable us to keep up with 
the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding deserves the support of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with some interest to the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche speak on the merits of the government and 
what it has done as a health care provider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he is a member of the government I certainly understand 
that he would want to sing the merits of the government, but I 
just do not understand how he is able to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I do not expect that the health care provided in his 
riding is much better than the health care provided in my riding 
of South Shore.  In the village of New Ross where I live, we are 
40 or so kilometres from the nearest doctor.  People who cut 
themselves or get their hand caught in a piece of equipment have 
to hold it together as best they can until they can get to a 
doctor.  There is certainly none in the community.  There was 
when I grew up there.  There was always a doctor there, but there 
are no doctors in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should not stand there and sing the praises of the 
government and what it has done to help rural Canadians and 
provide health care because it is just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a question that I actually do want to raise now that 
members have finished singing the praises of the government.  Now 
that they have finished, they can answer a question on a specific 
item.  The item is one that was brought up earlier.  It is a 
serious potential health hazard and I would go so far as to say 
that it is a serious health hazard now.  It is bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy or BSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the hidden health care risk that Canadians face and that 
the government in particular does not want to recognize.  It does 
not want to recognize the big issues and the real problems that 
it could face.  This is the hidden health care risk.  It is out 
there behind the scenes and we do not know just how quickly it is 
going to rear its ugly head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have chronic wasting disease in deer and elk.  We have BSE 
potentially being spread from blood product, from beef and sheep 
and animal products that have not been prepared properly.  We 
expect that it will be just as big an issue in Canada as it was 
in Britain unless the government is willing to be proactive and 
do something about it in a very proactive way, take a risk, spend 
some money, find out what the problem is and do something about 
it to protect our health care and protect our agriculture 
industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do about it?  The government has done 
nothing so far. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jeannot Castonguay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
sharing his concerns.  They are concerns I have as well, even if 
I sit on the government side.  Furthermore, this is one of the 
reasons I ran for office. I will answer the second part of the 
question and come back to the first part later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to BSE, the human form of which is known as 
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, this is a disease which has been known 
about for quite some time already. The problem right now is 
knowing whether so-called mad cow disease is the same as 
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.  How is this disease transmitted?  The 
answer is still not known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy when I see our government investing substantial 
amounts in research and development to work on this very sort of 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for doctors in the regions, it is true that there is a 
problem.  Sometimes, I have a lot of trouble understanding, when 
I see that federal transfer payments to my province are not put 
immediately into health care.  We do not know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the earlier speakers who said that the provinces 
must be truly responsible.  The provinces must have the strength 
of their convictions and tell us what they are doing with the 
money that the federal government is transferring to them.  If 
they cannot do that, we should look after the health 
care system for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two points I want to talk about.  He talks about 
helping with grants and contributions to deal with substance 
abuse.  Let me tell the hon. member about substance abuse.  Last 
week we dealt with the public accounts.  A lady by the name of 
Lorraine Stonechild was at the public accounts committee telling 
us how her brother died of a drug overdose because he was given 
300 prescriptions in one year, all paid for by Health Canada. 
Each and every one was paid for by Health Canada.  It killed him 
because there is no control on Health Canada in how they 
distribute drugs, and substance abuse is rampant in the first 
nations because of it.

quality such as the Sydney tar ponds in Nova Scotia?  The people 
are demanding that the government move them out of there because 
the place is making them sick, and Health Canada is doing next to 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government look after the first nations of the 
country?  When will the government look after the people of 
Sydney, Nova Scotia?  They deserve an answer to what the 
government and Health Canada are doing because they are killing 
them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jeannot Castonguay:</B> Madam Speaker, with regard to the issue of 
drug overdose, I agree that there are problems. We often point a 
finger at the problem, but there are also many positive things 
about the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important reason to invest in telecommunication 
technology to allow the various stakeholders in health to share 
information is precisely to try to prevent such unfortunate 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of ambient air, we should invest in 
this area. I would be dishonest if I commented on the issue of 
tar ponds, because I do not have any expertise in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that a lot of pressure is being exerted within our 
government to find solutions to this problem. We will continue to 
work to that end. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK327"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I believe that report of the Department of Health on plans and 
priorities clearly demonstrates that Health Canada is focusing 
its efforts and its resources on the health priorities that make 
sense for the people of Canada.  However, to understand these 
estimates, we must first understand the role the Government of 
Canada plays in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the delivery of health care services is almost 
completely under the jurisdiction of the provinces.  They decide 
how services are to be organized.  They negotiate with physicians 
and nurses and they set overall provincial funding levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health of Canadians involves far more than just the delivery 
of health care services.  The Government of Canada has a set of 
distinct roles that reflect its wide perspective.  The funding 
provided in these estimates support the achievement of those 
roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the basic operations of Health Canada is our 
health care policy.  This involves many elements of co-operation 
with the provinces, the territories and the new territories in 
order to ensure that all Canadians have a health care system that 
works for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of that collaboration will be aided by the implementation 
of the first ministers agreement on health which was signed by 
the first ministers last September.  By putting $18.9 billion 
more into funding over the next five years, we will go a long way 
toward revitalizing our health care system for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada did far more than just agree to 
increase health and social transfers.  It set up three targeted 
funds: $1 billion for medical equipment, $800 million for 
innovation and reform, and $500 million to strengthen information 
technologies so that we can move ahead in areas such as 
tele-health programs that will allow people in remote areas to 
contact medical experts in large cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One priority that will be particularly interesting for 
Canadians, and these estimates will help support it, is the work 
that will take place with the provinces, territories and outside 
experts to define common indicators.  It will mean that Canadians 
will be able to look to a consistent set of indicators that cover 
health status, health outcomes, and the quality of service across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to note the funding for the new tobacco control 
strategy of $480 million over five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the investment in improving the health of 
our first nations and Inuit.  This is a basic constitutional 
responsibility of the Government of Canada and it involves many 
elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many other points to make, but let me conclude. Canadians 
expect the Government of Canada to take a lead role on health 
issues and to take those responsibilities very seriously. That is 
precisely what the Government of Canada does.
