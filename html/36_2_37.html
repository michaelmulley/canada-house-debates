</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to 
this supply motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a few comments about the work of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and what we are doing in so many 
different ways to assist farmers, as well as our work with the total 
agri-food industry in Canada.  As I have reminded the House 
before, this is very important subject and Canadians know clearly 
the importance of the agriculture and agri-food industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all starts on the farm, that very tough part of the food 
production cycle in Canada and in the world, where those people, 
those families and those communities deal not only with the 
vagaries of the world market, but also with the vagaries of the 
weather and many other things which, no matter how good their 
management or the technology they have, are out of their control. 
It is a tough, unpredictable business which can tear out anyone's 
heart.  However, 75% of the jobs in the agri-food industry are 
beyond the farm gate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When most people think of the agricultural industry, they think 
of the farmers, and well they should because they are the 
important key people who start the whole food production cycle. 
However, when the product leaves the farm gate, it enters into 
what I refer to as the agri-food portion, that is, the further 
processing, the retailing, the marketing, et cetera, which 
presents to Canadians, to the customers of Canadian agriculture 
and agri-food products around the world, without question, some 
of the highest quality food products in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have some of the highest safety standards in the world. 
Consumers around the world are concerned about food safety.  We 
have a positive and effective regulatory system in this country. 
That has been clearly demonstrated.  The best test of any system 
is the results, and the results are that this is the safest food 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mistaking the importance of the programs and 
services that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is involved in, 
only a small minority of which are mentioned in the motion that 
we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind my colleagues and the people of Canada that the 
agri-food industry is one of the largest employers in the 
country.  One in seven working Canadians works in the industry. 
Over 13% of Canadian jobs are in the agriculture and agri-food 
industry.  I think we would all be surprised to learn that over 
half of all young Canadians entering the workforce for the first 
time get jobs in the agri-food industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a highly innovative industry, one that depends on 
scientific progress, which is why we spend a good chunk of our 
money investing in research each and every year.  It is an 
industry in which we can take a great deal of pride, one I 
believe must and will survive and thrive, not just for the good 
of farmers, but for the good of the country as a whole, whether 
it be in job creation or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, I spent a good portion of my life in the 
industry.  I know firsthand the ups and downs of the industry, 
but I also know firsthand the satisfaction that comes with the 
success of meeting the challenges which come every day.  There 
are risks and there are things which happen that can make a 
person's heart pound or the hair on the back of their neck rise 
because, just when that person figures out the way things should 
go, that is when the chain flies off, or whatever terminology we 
want to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to continue to work together and keep holding 
everything together so that more can happen.  In the partnership 
we have with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and with everybody 
in the industry, I am convinced that we will find an effective 
way to deal as much as possible with those risks that have become 
not only my preoccupation over the last many months, but the 
continuing preoccupation of everyone involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues know, earlier this week I returned from very 
important meetings for the agriculture and agri-food sector.  The 
meetings were held in Seattle, where the WTO talks were expected 
to be launched.  We know the results.  Unfortunately they did not 
get off to the start we had hoped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also met this week with my provincial counterparts to work 
toward a long term safety net.  It is not the only challenge we 
have before us at the present time, but I would say, without 
question, it is the most important challenge.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the world trade talks could not be launched as 
planned is obviously a disappointment.  However, for those people 
who try to paint this as the end for agriculture, I want to tell 
them that they are a long way from reality.  That is just not the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 135 countries represented at Seattle could not agree on how 
to proceed on a variety of issues, but the talks will begin. 
Agriculture and services were mandated in the Uruguay round to 
begin in the year 2000 and will begin at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that we were able to maintain the 
agricultural working group and the text was frozen.  When the 
talks begin again we will begin negotiations from that point.  We 
were clearly in a position that our negotiators could go forward 
from that text as it was frozen and negotiate toward the mandate 
that we announced as an industry after a long period of 
consultation back in August as the goals and the objectives for 
the Canadian industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did make progress in Seattle, despite what some reports might 
have suggested and that is the important thing.  It will be a 
setback, unfortunately, but only a temporary setback.  That was a 
very important meeting to work toward trade reforms and we will 
continue to press on for and with our industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, on behalf of myself, the government and the trade 
minister who was there, we were very pleased with the support, 
co-operation and attendance of a large number of non-governmental 
organizations, as well as provincial members of parliament, 
federal MPs and senators who were there as team Canada at the WTO 
talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the biggest trading countries in the world, Canada 
does have a strong interest in those talks and we are absolutely 
committed to staying in the game until the very end.  The 
commitment is not just at the federal level either.  One of the 
really positive things about the talks and this whole process of 
getting ready for them has been the partnership, the working 
together and how everybody in the industry has stuck together 
throughout all that.  That kind of co-operation will stand us in 
good stead in the long negotiations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers need a level playing field.  I will continue to work 
to build support with our trading partners around the world so 
that we can get an agreement that allows our Canadian farmers to 
compete fairly in markets all over the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said, the WTO talks even if they had started last week are 
not going to be a quick fix, but they are a necessity and an 
important part of all that we have to do in order to continue to 
level that playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we brought forward as a government the aid 
program, AIDA, a year ago.  We look back to where we were about a 
year ago this week when we announced as a federal government that 
we would be putting forward $900 million.  Since then we have 
added another $170 million so it is close to $1.1 billion.  With 
the provincial contribution to that, there is over $1.75 billion 
available over 1998 and 1999 to assist producers in this 
stressful time they are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware of the criticism that the program has received. 
I think the House is aware that I am not as happy with the 
program as we would all liked to have been.  The goals of the 
program were to target the resources that were available as much 
as possible to those who needed support.  In targeting, it takes 
some paperwork.  The easiest and quickest way to disburse money 
at any time is just to send everybody a cheque, but when one does 
that those who do not need the support as much as the others get 
support and, for those who need it, there is less to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fixed some of the problems with the program.  We will 
continue to work at it, but I remind everybody that it was a 
program to deal with the precipitous drop in incomes in 1998 and 
1999 relative to the period of time before that.  That was the 
request.  We remember the very spirited and thoughtful debates we 
were having in this place and other places a year ago. 
Everyone was saying that because the bottom had dropped out of 
grain and hog prices that we needed to do something to address 
it.  We did that.  There are those who unfortunately it did not 
reach and we are looking at that.  That is why we are looking at 
a long term program.  I had a good discussion with ministers 
earlier this week.  We will continue that discussion through our 
officials and through further meetings in as early as January.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we need to put a long term program in place.  We have a 
short term problem and we have a long term reality to face.  We 
have to work the two of them together.  I am confident that we 
can.  I am confident that we will be able to find a lot of 
resources to do that.  I am a realist and I know there are not 
enough resources to satisfy everybody to the extent that every 
individual would like, but we will do the best job we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally feel strongly that we need to work together.  We 
are working together to be more flexible with a system that 
responds to the whole range of needs that exist in a very diverse 
agricultural industry.  When we think of the size of this 
country, of how diverse it is even within one province and how 
diverse the agriculture and agri-food industry is from coast to 
coast to coast, it is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an easy task but nobody said it would be easy.  If it 
were easy, we probably would have been there a long time ago. 
Every time we do these kinds of things in the best interest of 
and in fairness to everybody who has been involved in the past, 
present and future, we think we have got it.  Then we find out 
that because this industry is so flexible, so rolling and moving 
so fast that we have a hard job keeping up.  Because there are so 
many things that affect what goes on out there, things change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about change for a minute.  It not only applies to 
the agri-food industry but also to our lives in general.  The 
assistant deputy minister of research in my department told a 
group of us not too long ago that 90% of the scientists who ever 
lived are alive today.  There are some pluses and minuses or pros 
and cons to that.  It is not just agriculture and agri-food 
scientists but all kinds of scientists who make up this 90%.  It 
is just amazing what these people will produce in terms of new 
technologies, new research, et cetera, and that is fantastic.  We 
can see that every day in our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also means that because so much is being produced and so many 
of those results are coming about, the shelf life, to use a 
layman's term, is so much shorter because something comes on to 
follow what was there before.  This is happening in every sector 
of our society.  Things change and the only constant is that 
there are changes taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the discussions will be frank and fruitful and we will 
continue with those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are counting on us.  They can know that we are spending 
an inordinate amount of time and that we have their best 
interests in mind.  All ministers I met with this week know it is 
our obligation to show leadership and to work together to come up 
with a package of risk management tools that the government could 
be involved in to encourage producers to get involved in what I 
refer to as commercial risk management.  There are other ways to 
manage the risk out there as well that will help us build an 
adaptable, productive and competitive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us as individuals, all of us as ministers and all of us 
as MPs and provincial members of legislatures want the best for 
farmers.  I want the best for Canadian farmers.  We cannot afford 
to divide ourselves if we are going to deliver to our producers. 
As I said, I will be meeting with my provincial counterparts to 
continue on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moneys in this motion today are to go toward a number of 
those things, programs such as the Canadian adaptation and rural 
development fund, to make sure our industry is compliant.  We 
have contingency planning for the Y2K event that will be 
happening not too many days ahead of us.  There is money for the 
Canadian biotechnology strategy and money for genomics based on 
research and development.  There is the implementation of a 
component of the youth employment strategy and those types of 
things.  They are very important things that we need to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to do whatever it takes with my colleagues here 
in the House and with my fellow agriculture ministers across the 
country, with industry itself and with our trading partners 
around the world, to build an agriculture and agri-food industry 
that is strong, stable and productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a busy year again for all of us.  It has not been 
an easy year for industry.   I am sure building on the 
experiences and determination that we have, we will all continue 
to do whatever it takes; my colleagues here in the House, the 
ministers, the industry and our trading partners.  I look forward 
to continuing to meet and beat the challenges that we have before 
us and to find opportunities, to make opportunities and take 
advantage of those opportunities for everyone in the important 
agriculture and agri-food industry in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for recognizing the official opposition's 
responsibility in the House to ask the first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of agriculture in Canada is written one page at a 
time.  The agriculture minister has been writing his pages 
certainly since the start of his appointment to the ministry in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the agriculture minister deals with his 
administration of the agriculture department.  He briefly 
mentioned that he had responded to the drastic drop in income. In 
the good administration of a minister's department, particularly 
agriculture, why is the minister simply responding to requests as 
opposed to administering the department and foreseeing that ad 
hoc payments have not worked out over the past 100 years?  Why 
has he not been able to put in place long term programs over the 
past two terms of this Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question relates to the $1.4 billion budget that he has to 
work with and why an additional $63,196,279 has to be 
appropriated in extra payments from taxpayers at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
obviously does not understand how the system works.  Before we 
can get permission from Treasury Board to actually get the money, 
we have to demonstrate what it will be used for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of a year when the budgeting is done, plans are 
there and the money is there.  However, before we can actually 
draw it from the Treasury Board we have to go back with the 
specific things that we will be using it for.  We tell Treasury 
Board what we expect to need, what our plans are and what our 
budgets will be for the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as simple as the Treasury Board just writing a 
minister or a department a cheque and saying “Here is the $1.X 
billion.  Go away and do it”.  There is a system of checks and 
balances there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I recall, members of the official opposition have said a 
number of times that they want to see that type of system.  That 
type of system is there.  The reason we are here today and why we 
are having these votes is to move those moneys from point A to 
point B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the government reacting to things 
rather than being as proactive as he would like it to be. If we 
go back to the previous election, the definition of proactivity 
of members of the official opposition was to remove hundreds of 
millions of dollars from the agriculture and agri-food budget in 
Canada. 
Thank goodness they did not get elected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were proactive when nobody saw the expected downturn in the 
industry coming to the extent that it did.  As a government we 
found the money, an extra $1.1 billion.  It is quite a 
difference, if we compare it to the opposition wanting to remove 
over $600 million.  The farmers of Canada are fortunate that it 
is a Liberal government and not a Reform government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the minister.  The Reform Party wanted to 
cut back even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is one that farmers are asking me on an almost daily 
basis, and I ask it very sincerely.  Why is there no more 
assistance coming from the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that the joint position in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan is supported by all three provincial political 
parties: the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, which is 
the Saskatchewan party, and the Conservative Party.  It is 
supported by all farm organizations, chambers of commerce and 
federations of labour.  There is sort of a position of solidarity 
in both provinces that they need an extra $1.3 billion for people 
to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go over the arguments this morning.  We all 
know the argument that the trade war is driving down the price of 
grain and people are at the point of suffering.  I am sure the 
minister is aware of that.  In light of all the protests, in 
light of all the representations, in light of the solidarity 
among members of his own party, and in light of all the media 
coverage, people are asking me why there has not been any action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party ran an extremely high profile popular 
candidate in the byelection in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Henry 
Dayday who was mayor of the city of Saskatoon for 11 years and a 
very good person.  He obtained 15% of the votes, basically 
because the issue became the farm crisis and the economic harm 
that would result if there were no additional aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are asking why the message did not get through.  We know 
there is a surplus of approximately $10 billion coming next year, 
or almost $100 billion over five years.  People are aware of 
that.  Historically the minister is very conservative in his 
estimates.  It may even be more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this money were to come, farmers also know that a lot of it 
would go back to the federal government because of the extra 
stimulus in the economy and taxes.  They are asking why this 
message did not get through in terms of getting the extra $1.3 
billion.  I hope the minister understands what I am asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand what the 
hon. member is asking, but I also understand that in the last few 
years the province from which he comes has drastically cut back 
its support to the agricultural industry.  The federal government 
did so too because of fiscal realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of what we did we are now able to put $1.1 billion back 
in.  We are now able to talk about a long term program based on 
the experiences of that program, the needs, the realities of 
today, and the everyday changing and rolling, if I could use that 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member of the incredible difficulty we had as 
a government to get the Government of Saskatchewan in particular 
to come forward.  We had to beg.  We had to push.  We had to 
pull. I could use words stronger than those in order to get it to 
to support that major industry in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is a shared jurisdiction between the federal 
government and provincial governments.  Shared usually means 
50:50.  In the safety net program over the last number of years 
the federal government has paid 60%.  I had to do a lot of 
levering to get the hon. member's provincial government to come 
forward with its 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came forward with another change to the program to cover 
negative margins, the province did not want to do it.  It wants 
to take some money and mail a cheque out to every farmer in 
Saskatchewan.  I understand there are farmers that the IDEA 
program did not reach.  We are trying to fix that in the future, 
but in order to get money to farmers that need money that 
provincial government wants to give money to those that do not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 12 months the federal government has put in $1.1 
billion.  When we combine that with what we have finally 
convinced the province of Saskatchewan to put in, it means that 
$575 million more than what there was a year ago are going into 
the hands of farmers of the province of Saskatchewan who are 
hurting.  Only the New Democratic Party would say that $575 
million were insignificant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate.  I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to agriculture we are very pleased that it was the 
Conservative Party that brought about this debate.  Obviously the 
minister has been forthright in his remarks today, but it is 
increasingly clear every day that the federal government has not 
clearly recognized the importance of agriculture in Canada.  Due 
to the urging of members of this party and others a standing 
committee is currently travelling in an attempt to deal with this 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A crisis is the proper word.  The government manages by crisis. 
It waits until the wheels come off and then it reacts.  It is not 
like there has been any planning.  The minister talked about long 
term planning.  It will be a long time and a cold day in this 
place before we see long term planning coming from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to that topic we now know that legislation is 
coming that is meant to provoke the province of Quebec.  Yes, the 
little cat from Shawinigan is out of the bag.  We now know that 
the government plans to bring in legislation in very short order. 
There will be a press conference later today in which the Prime 
Minister will outline his attempt to poke Quebec in the eye once 
again and try to get the country embroiled in a debate over 
national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We question the timing, the procedure, and the process that has 
been followed.  It has been demonstrated again.  We just finished 
a 40-plus hour debate over a similar issue, an issue that is 
divisive, an issue where the government has failed to consult, 
and an issue where the government deliberately ran roughshod and 
used a process to beat the opposition and rest of the country 
over the head to impose its will.  We are about to embark on that 
same process again.  Later today in a press conference the Prime 
Minister will outline his way to impose things upon the province 
of Quebec in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to question that.  As members of the House we are 
representatives of the people of Canada.  It is our 
responsibility to question the Prime Minister as to why he is 
doing it and why he is continuing to demonstrate such a 
provocative, aggressive approach toward one province of the 
country.  We have seen it. It is always Quebec that the 
government and the Prime Minister single out in an attempt to 
impose their will.  We do not see leadership demonstrated in the 
government.  We see dictatorship.  We do not see democracy.  We 
see autocracy.  That is what the government stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been very little insight from the Prime Minister. Time 
and time again he has demonstrated that he does not understand 
his home province.  Again the process is being abused and used by 
the government to impose its will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we dealing with the issue of agriculture today?  A 
supply day is traditionally and has always been a day on which 
the opposition was allowed to choose its priorities.  It is clear 
that the opposition understands the priorities of the country a 
lot better than the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the mind that the Prime Minister gets up every morning 
with no plan.  It is whatever pops into his head that day.  He 
got up one day and decided to pick a fight with the premier of 
Quebec and with the province of Quebec.  Why?  Maybe in the back 
of his mind he thinks that this is a way to somehow rewrite 
history, to correct the wrongs or correct the way he somehow 
dropped the ball in the pass.  He is trying to make Canadians 
forget that he completely mismanaged this issue during 1995.  He 
has completely misunderstood Quebec from the very day he entered 
public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is very little faith not only in the province of Quebec 
but in every province.  I suspect the premiers will be extremely 
upset when they come to understand what the Prime Minister is 
doing.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers have not been consulted.  The provinces have not 
been consulted.  God knows the opposition has not been consulted 
at all on this issue.  Why now?  Why at this time when we have 
seen in the province of Quebec the most sustained period of 
stability that has existed for some time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Perhaps it is that it is Christmas. 
Perhaps it is because the Prime Minister is very good at 
manipulating the rules.  It is very clear to him that we will be 
out of here some time in the next week.  Of course that is at his 
urging; he is the person who will control the agenda.  Then 
Quebeckers and the rest of the country will be left to stew in 
their own juices over the holidays, to sit and wonder and wait to 
see what the Prime Minister will do next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This supply day is focused on agriculture.  There will be 
significant debate on the issue.  My colleague for West Nova will 
speak further on the Conservative position.  Sadly the member for 
Brandon—Souris cannot be in the House.  He is travelling with 
the agriculture committee and doing his good work on behalf of 
his party, of Canadians, and of his home province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with a very crucial issue in and of itself, the 
issue of what the Prime Minister is up to.  We read about it 
through a leak.  The government policy is to leak things through 
the press rather than have any meaningful debate or interaction 
with members of the opposition.  We see this time and time again, 
not only from the Prime Minister but from all ministers across 
the way.  They would rather leak something to the press gallery 
than come in here to make a ministerial announcement, talk with 
members of the opposition or go to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are members of the opposition even in the House if they 
cannot expect some kind of meaningful dialogue, some indication 
that government members are listening?  Members of the House have 
been elected to put forward their beliefs on behalf of their 
constituents.  Yet the government completely forgets that and 
abrogates its responsibility when it comes to having any kind of 
dialogue with members of the House.  We see it in committees when 
ministers are simply too busy to appear before members of the 
committees to speak about the government plan, and we are left 
wondering what the point is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Quebec we know that the plan is to be 
provocative and reckless.  The government will impose what it 
thinks it should do as opposed to sitting down with Quebec and 
discussing what should happen.  Does it try to include the 
commentary and thoughtful insights of the province of Quebec? No, 
that is not the way the government approaches the situation. It 
has not been and it probably never will be under this Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has very skewed priorities.  It knows 
that its one driving or motivating force for being in government 
is to remain in government.  That is what the government is 
about. It is not about identifying issues that are important to 
Canadians.  It is about how it stays in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members are like survivors of the <I>Titanic</I> 
clinging to a lifeboat.  That is the way they approach this 
matter.  They will do whatever they have to do to stay in power. 
They are clinging to power by dividing the country.  They have 
taken a provocative approach that will pit members of one 
province against those of other provinces.  That is an easy thing 
to do. It is always easy to find issues that divide the country. 
The Prime Minister has demonstrated that time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to keep the passions of people outside Quebec 
enraged against those who live in Quebec.  It is very easy to 
leave Quebeckers with the impression that the rest of Canada does 
not care about them, and that is not true.  That is not the case. 
There are people right across the country, francophones both 
inside and outside Quebec, who want to make the country work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remind Quebeckers and Canadians of that time and time 
again.  Unity is something that can and will work in the country, 
but the Prime Minister does not understand that.  He would rather 
pick a fight, get down on a very base level and try to impose his 
will, his vision if he even has one, of how Quebec should exist 
within the country.  It is a sad day in the House when that 
happens.  It is a sad day every day that the government takes a 
provocative and mean-spirited approach toward one province and 
one people in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the position of the Conservative Party of Canada. 
It never has been and never will be.  We have a long and proud 
record of what we have tried to do to keep the country together, 
not in an appeasing way or in a way that is meant to give away 
rights but in a way that is meant to respect, understand and at 
least make meaningful and truthful gestures when it comes to 
keeping the country united and people of the country working 
toward a common goal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize my time is short and that we are somewhat off topic in 
talking about agriculture, but it is too important an issue to 
let it go by at this time.  We have not seen the type of 
leadership that one would expect from the Prime Minister who is 
from Quebec.  He has abrogated his own responsibility and 
understanding toward his own home province in the move he has 
made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that members of the government are surprised and taken 
aback at the approach their leader, the Prime Minister, has 
taken.  There is very little unity in the government as opposed 
to the unity in the country at this time, yet the Prime Minister, 
I suggest, is prepared to stumble recklessly into this issue for 
his own political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the press conference occurs today, Canadians should beware 
and be ready for what the Prime Minister will say.  It is not 
going to be all wine and roses.  That will be the approach he 
takes.  It will be an attempt to baffle Canadians with his 
insights into Quebec.  They should look a little deeper as to 
what is behind this provocative move by the Prime Minister.  It 
is not an approach to heal; it is an approach that will harm the 
unity of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague who has just spoken has condemned 
the parliamentary scandal we are facing.  It shows that we have 
reached a total breakdown of  the Canadian federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him. 
Do the negative effects of this alarming power grab the Prime 
Minister will be carrying out with the complicity of the Liberal 
Party of Canada not indicate a disdain for democracy, a disdain 
for parliament, a disdain for all the people of Quebec and of 
Canada, for which he will pay the price politically?  Will he 
not go down in history as the Prime Minister of Canada who was 
responsible for this failure of democracy? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question and a very apt description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Prime Minister has always been prepared to 
manipulate the process, to use a provocative, powerful approach 
when he has a majority government to beat other provinces over 
the head.  We know that other governments have been less likely 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the farmers?  Why did they not make today an 
agriculture day instead of sitting over there on their butts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec is very concerned about why this is 
happening now.  Why is the Prime Minister creating an issue at 
this time when there are other important issues brewing like 
agriculture, the crisis in the fishery on the east coast and 
problems right across the country?  He is just creating an issue. 
There is no reason whatsoever to be in this debate right now. 
There is no reason.  It is only because the Prime Minister once 
again wants to create a problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member from Pictou—Antigonish has brought up the 
fact that agriculture has a lot of problems today and something 
has to be done.  That is what we are here to debate. He also 
brought up alienation, east versus west, Quebec versus the west, 
all the different parts of the country fighting against each 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question for the member.  Back in the 1980s, Mr. 
Brian Mulroney was the prime minister. Fifty percent of the 
alienation in western Canada today is directly related to that 
prime minister.  Not only did he take the CF-18 contract away 
from western Canada, from my own city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, but 
he turned off the farmers.  Where was the long term disaster 
assistance program for farmers?  Why was it not created during 
the Mulroney years, the Progressive Conservative years, when they 
had the biggest majority ever as the governing party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again we see an 
attitude from the Reform Party that is very much in line with the 
current government.  It singles out one region of the country and 
pits it against another region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the emperor's new clothes in the form of Mr. 
Manning and Mr. Chrétien when it comes to this type of thing. 
They want to take the divisive approach.  They want to take the 
approach that is very provocative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
realize that you were engaged in a conversation, but you missed 
something.  The hon. member from the PC Party is blatantly 
breaking House rules in debate by using members' names.  I think 
you should correct him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair accepts 
the point made by the hon. member for Elk Island.  I am sure that 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in no way would 
want willingly to break the traditions and the customs of the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
on a very timely and well delivered speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many Canadians prepare to celebrate the holiday season, 
many others are worried that any kind of celebration will be 
short lived if they do not see any kind of financial assistance 
soon from the federal government. I am referring to Canadian 
farmers who in some instances have been suffering through the 
most serious farm crisis since the Great Depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad fact is that the Liberal government fails to recognize 
the severity of the situation throughout Canada's farming 
communities. Since being elected in 1993 the Liberal government 
has consistently ignored the plight of our farmers.  From what 
our farmers can see from the government's estimates, this neglect 
is bound to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm support since 1993 has been reduced by approximately $3 
billion.  We are talking about federal-provincial contributions 
that once exceeded $7 billion which have been reduced to under $4 
billion.  This is a very significant decrease at a time when our 
Canadian farmers are facing increased subsidized competition, 
rising input costs and natural and economic disasters. Now our 
federal government wants to add Canada's inadequate national 
safety net program to their misery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continuously preaches about the importance of our 
agricultural industry, yet its inaction in a time of crisis 
suggests a clear lack of commitment toward our Canadian farmers. 
In response to the crisis in the agricultural industry the 
government has introduced a farm aid package that has been 
thoroughly criticized for being inadequate.  Even members from 
the minister's own governing party are lamenting about the 
inadequacy of the government's AIDA program. This is the program 
that was going to provide farmers with $1.1 billion in aid but 
has thus far only delivered $300 million in much needed 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has promised that all the money will be in the 
hands of our farmers by Christmas.  I would like to tell the 
minister that Christmas is fast approaching, as is bankruptcy for 
many farmers unless money arrives soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has designed a program that is a regulatory 
nightmare.  Many Canadian farmers who need the help the most are 
falling through the cracks.  The AIDA program was ill designed 
and totally underfunded.  Even provinces such as Ontario and 
Saskatchewan are threatening to pull out of the federal safety

truly committed to helping our Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 22 I read a very disturbing article in one of Nova 
Scotia's daily newspapers, the Halifax <I>Herald</I>. The article 
was entitled “Quebec farm suicides lead country”.  Any suicide 
is tragic but to have specific numbers for our farming community 
simply magnifies the crisis situation our Canadian farmers are 
facing each day due to mounting debt. I recognize that this 
Queen's University data is somewhat dated, however it does 
magnify the tragedy our farmers are facing due to the extreme 
financial pressure often associated with the agricultural 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is one of Canada's top five industries.  However by 
the actions of the federal government we would think that this 
important industry is of very little benefit to Canada's overall 
economy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In 1998 
alone, our agriculture and agri-food industries contributed over 
$90 billion to our overall economy. 
That is equivalent to 8.6% of Canada's gross domestic product. 
Our overall agri-food exports exceed $22 billion and are 
responsible for 30% of Canada's total trade surplus.  These are 
impressive figures, however behind these impressive figures lies 
much anxiety and heartache.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps blinded by some of these impressive numbers, our federal 
government appears incognizant of the growing threat to our 
agricultural industry.  Each and every day Canada is facing the 
loss of another farmer.  We are losing these farmers because the 
government has failed to come up with any long term solution to 
the problems facing this vital industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia alone, well over 1,000 farms have disappeared 
since 1981.  That is an average of 69 unreplaced farm closures 
across the province every year.  Nova Scotia's youth increasingly 
choose other careers rather than farming because they sense that 
there is no future for them in this industry.  They recognize 
that their federal government will not be there to help them in a 
time of crisis such as we are witnessing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia's farming industry is increasingly in danger of 
eventually becoming irrelevant.  This would be a tremendous blow 
to an area that has prided itself on its agricultural prowess 
since as far back as the beginning of the 17th century when the 
first European settlers arrived in the Annapolis Valley.  What is 
particularly frightening in Nova Scotia is the fact that 42% of 
our farm operators in 1996 were over the age of 55.  The average 
age of farmers in Nova Scotia is 52.2 years.  Our farmers are 
slowly getting older and there is no indication that our youth 
will be willing to carry the torch in any significant manner come 
the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be encouraging our youth to embark on a 
career in agriculture.  Yet by the proposed estimates the 
government has introduced concerning agriculture, any future 
young farmers and I see that the government has very little 
interest in encouraging our farming tradition that spans back 
centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already we see a considerable number of our farmers being forced 
to rely on outside employment to subsidize their farming income. 
Because they are forced to pursue other employment opportunities 
to survive, many of them fail to qualify for government tax 
incentives that would offer them some relief on an already 
enormous debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Progressive Conservative Party recognize that we 
can ill afford to lose any more of our farmers.  With less than 
7% of our land being currently used for agriculture, Canadians 
are becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign imports.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
Monday I had the opportunity to meet with a group of farmers in 
the lovely town of Melita, Manitoba.  This town, in the southwest 
corner of the province of Manitoba, is located in the centre of 
the area that bore the brunt of last year's high water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers I met with were representative of the area's best. 
Smart and industrious, these farmers are successful in a very 
difficult industry.  The product of their labour contributes 
strongly to Canada's exports and is the foundation upon which a 
number of other industries run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year they have suffered two blows.  The flooding of 
international markets with low priced goods has reduced their 
returns from their labour.  The flooding of their land has made 
it impossible to plant much of the available acreage.  They made 
the point to me that farming is a very difficult business subject 
to the vagaries of weather, disease, insects, drought one year, 
flood the next.  These are the norms of the industry and they 
accept that.  They know that there will be good years and bad 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, however, a new blight has emerged, one which they cannot 
fight alone and one which will overwhelm them if we do not offer 
some support.  The blight is the subsidies that are given to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister now tell the House how his proposed

<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have debated 
that for a long time.  There is a judgment of the supreme court.

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will win any future referendum if Quebecers are presented 
with clear choices:  the choice between an isolated Quebec state 
or a strong vibrant province within a renewed federation; the 
choice between building a strong future together on the basis of

differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the government has a responsibility to ensure that the 
choices are clear and that the consequences are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister, how does this proposed legislation 
clarify these choices and those consequences? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have said publicly many times that the question has to 
be clear and the result has to be clear.  The question has to be 
on the idea that Quebec will not be a province of Canada.  We 
want to clarify that so that people know exactly what they 
are doing and what they will achieve when they vote.  We want the 
people to know exactly what is the plan of the provincial 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, defining the rules of any future Quebec referendum in 
clear, indisputable terms is only half the battle.  It is 
crucial, but it is only half the battle.  Equally important is 
how the government proposes to modernize the federation to offer 
Quebecers and other Canadians an alternative to either status quo 
federalism or separation.  They need a third way.  For the 
Canadian federation to thrive in the 21st century, federalism 
itself needs to be modernized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister include with his referendum legislation 
a list of the positive reforms that he proposes to modernize the

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have a policy on modernization that is one step at a 
time.  That is why we voted in the House of Commons in December 
1995 to recognize Quebec as a distinct society.  That is why we 
have given a veto on constitutional amendments to the provinces 
of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.  That is why the federal 
government gave manpower training to the provincial governments 
some time ago. 
That is why we are no longer in tourism and forestry, as we were 
before.  We are modernizing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
clarifying the September 17 ruling in the Marshall case, the 
supreme court said that the native fishing rights were limited to 
the area traditionally used by the local community. That being 
the case, why did the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans give LFA 
33 lobster licences to fishers from Indian Brook? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the issue of licences for lobster fishermen in the 
area in question is a tricky one.  These licences are worth a 
great deal of income and money.  We are attempting to work out a 
system whereby fairness prevails. Inevitably in such a system we 
want to have a full discussion with the lobster fishermen 
themselves.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I believe 
that this process is working effectively. However, we have to 
accept that in a situation such as this, we cannot satisfy every 
player. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the supreme 
court ruling clearly restricts the mobility of natives from 
moving from one fishing area to the other. I ask again, why did

lobster licence in LFA 33? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member clearly is unaware that with the 
surprising decision of the Marshall case where there is indeed a 
need to accommodate a large number of people who previously were 
not taking part in the lobster fishery, adjustments will have to 
be made along the line.  We cannot simply say that we can change 
that and leave everything else the same. Clearly under those 
circumstances there would not be enough of the resource for the 
fishermen involved. Alternatively, we would simply run the 
resource into extinction which would be the worst possible thing 
we could do.

Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official 
languages, the first report of the Standing Committee on Finance, 
entitled “Budget 2000 New Era—New Plan”.  It is the result of 
continuing conversations with thousands of Canadians, a national 
dialogue that has helped us understand our fellow citizens' 
values and priorities and how the federal budge should reflect 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want an agenda that will see them enjoy more 
opportunity, a higher standard of living and an even better 
quality life in the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve all this, we need a clear vision for the 
future.  “Budget 2000 New Era—New Plan” provides the road map 
to achieve that vision.  The plan fosters sound financial 
management, promotes economic growth and a better quality of life 
by reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank all the members of the committee and 
member of staff for their excellent work.

<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying prior to question period, members of the Conservative 
Party recognize that we can ill afford to lose any more of our 
farmers.  With less than 7% of our land presently being used for 
agriculture in this country, Canadians are becoming increasingly 
dependent upon foreign imports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government may accuse me of exaggerating the 
severity of the situation; however, I do not think I am 
exaggerating Nova Scotia's increasing dependence upon imported 
agricultural goods.  Whether these goods are imported from the 
U.S. or from another Canadian province, the fact still remains 
that it is importing large amounts of agricultural products, and 
this trend will continue so long as our youth stay away from 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned many times in the House, our farmers in Nova 
Scotia have had to endure three successive years of drought 
conditions.  These hard weather conditions have significantly 
reduced yield, resulting in a tremendous increase in feed costs. 
A number of farmers have been forced to prematurely rid 
themselves of cattle, at a substantial loss.  With the price of 
beef being so low, a farmer in Yarmouth told me that some beef 
producers have incurred such tremendous losses they will most 
likely be forced to exit the beef industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer these farmers and many others like them 
throughout the country some ray of hope, but I find little in the 
government's estimates to do that.  Even the Prime Minister's 
throne speech failed to address any of the major issues facing 
our farmers.  In fact, farming barely received mention in the 
throne speech, which simply confirms what all Canadians know, 
that this government is not committed to helping Canadian 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our western neighbours are struggling tremendously, yet the 
federal government is not there to help.  Unfortunately, our 
western friends are coming to grips with what Nova Scotian 
farmers have known for years, that this government simply is not 
committed to maintaining or enhancing our agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, we have had three successive years of drought 
conditions, yet the federal government has seen fit to introduce 
an aid package that is very difficult for our farmers to access. 
We had farmers experiencing hardship during the ice storm, yet 
the government did not see fit to provide them with any 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotian farmers are not immune to hard times, yet they tend 
to be overlooked by the government.  I am telling the government 
that it can no longer ignore our Nova Scotian farmers.  Farming 
is an important industry within Nova Scotia, as it is throughout 
the rest of the country, and I will continue to demand that our 
farmers be treated fairly by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous Progressive Conservative government recognized the 
importance of agriculture to our Canadian economy. 
That is why in 1991 the government introduced the gross revenue 
insurance program, GRIP, and the net income stabilization 
account, NISA.  These programs were designed to complement each 
other.  Unfortunately, the Liberal government abolished GRIP and 
has failed miserably in replacing it with an effective, 
nationally responsive program.

listened with interest to the hon. member's remarks.  Although 
there was a lot of doom and gloom in his remarks, that really 
does not surprise me.  We recognize and the minister has said 
that there is indeed a farm crisis in western Canada that we are 
trying to deal with.  However, there are some positives in 
agriculture.  I would like to know where the hon. member and his 
party stand in terms of where those positives are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard mixed remarks from his colleague, the member for 
Brandon—Souris, on the supply management industry.  He goes on 
and on attacking the Canadian Wheat Board, which is an agency 
that maximizes returns to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that in his province there is a big 
supply management industry in terms of dairy and poultry, which 
are models of development for rural Canada.  Where does he stand 
on those industries?  Is he supportive of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Malpeque for his very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is that there are problems throughout the system. 
We recognize that certain sectors are doing well, but the 
problems still exist.  We have serious problems that the 
government is not addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier in my comments, 42% of our farm operators 
are over the age of 55.  The average age of farmers in Nova 
Scotia is 52.2 years.  There are no young people entering the 
industry.  There is a reason.  It is because of the policies of 
the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to applaud the member for West Nova for his 
intervention on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, we have been working together on this side 
of the House to get those people who live in urban areas involved 
in the issue of agriculture and agri-food.  The reality is that 
80% of the population in the country live in urban areas and 
those consumers have very little knowledge of the difficulties, 
the challenges and the complexities that surround matters of 
agriculture, the family farm and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that it would be a useful exercise to 
engage the people of urban Canada in a very thoughtful, 
constructive way, so that ultimately they could participate fully 
in these agricultural issues, the family farm problem, and 
especially young people moving away from the farm?  Does the 
member think that would be a good exercise?  If we did something 
like that, would he and his party get behind the exercise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Broadview—Greenwood for a very thoughtful question, one 
which deserves a serious answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of Canada is that, yes, 80% of the people live in 
urban centres, which is a large part of our population.  Some of 
the decisions coming from the government are based on votes and 
do not reflect the realities that exist. 
If that is the case, that is why the government is not taking 
hold of the problems that exist, dealing with the farm crisis, 
the east coast fisheries crisis and other issues.  Those are some 
of the things that should be looked at.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating the business of supply.  In the 
Supplementary Estimates (A) the President of the Treasury Board 
has indicated that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada requires an 
additional $63,196,279 to continue its programs which began in 
this fiscal year.  The Reform Party and our chief critic, the 
member for St. Albert, are opposed to this money being added to 
the spending of the agriculture department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions that always go unanswered are:  Why did the 
department not foresee what was happening?  Why did it not plan 
better?  Where has the money gone that it originally had?  Was it 
simply wasted or was it shifted to some other area, resulting in 
additional funds being required? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debating this appropriation of money we have to look at the 
overall operation of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The 
department's operations are of course directed by the minister in 
charge.  The agriculture minister sets the tone, examines what is 
happening and determines how the money will be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The performance of the Liberal government and the agriculture 
minister is on trial.  When someone takes over a major department 
like agriculture and agri-food, that person has to demonstrate by 
action, not words or spin doctoring, that a good job is being 
done.  When we see what is happening in regard to western 
Canadian agriculture in particular, we have to question very 
seriously the performance of this minister and, indirectly, the 
government itself, because the problems that are evident in the 
west are not being addressed and have not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years we have had successive governments which 
have failed to put in place a program of long duration to address 
the problems which we know come up continuously.  The Progressive 
Conservatives certainly had opportunities through the eighties, 
with massive majorities, to put long term programs in place.  Ad 
hoc programs have been shown time after time to be insufficient 
in taking care of the problems which farmers encounter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems which agriculture is encountering are not of its 
own making.  The agriculture sectors that are in trouble are the 
ones which are dependent on export markets.  These farmers 
contribute gigantic sums, in the tens of billions of dollars, to 
the Canadian economy.  As a result, when they are harmed by the 
actions of our competitors, namely, gigantic subsidization for 
cereal grains and oil seeds, our farmers are not on a level 
playing field.  They cannot compete against these massive 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nothing new.  This has been going on for some time. 
Successive governments have failed to put in place programs that 
will enable Canada to have a viable agriculture sector.  This is 
a bit astounding.  Maybe over the years governments have become 
complacent because there is always food at the grocery store. 
Anyone can go to the store to pick up food relatively cheaply. 
This complacency has done nothing for the agriculture sector in 
having a long term program to guarantee that the sector will 
remain viable.

whether or not the farmers are getting value for that, whether 
they have any say about those user fees and whether the 
sub-departments that are charging those fees are accountable for 
how they use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fuel taxes are a good example. The federal excise tax is four 
cents per litre and that is applied directly to the farmer.  That 
is one case where we could quite easily lower his costs.  The 
farmer's problem, as I mentioned, is that input costs have gone 
up drastically and net returns have gone down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned previously and in my question today in question 
period, when a natural disaster strikes western Canada as in the 
case of the flooded areas in southwest Manitoba and southeast 
Saskatchewan, there is no declaration of a natural disaster.  We 
heard the defence minister tell us today that unless the premier 
of Manitoba and the premier Saskatchewan initiate a call for a 
natural disaster area, he will not do anything.  The premiers and 
the defence minister had better get together and make that 
declaration for farmers. The chairman of the agriculture 
committee of this House is telling farmers that there is still a 
chance that a natural disaster area could be declared to get the 
help they need to recover from that disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are places besides the department itself where we could 
get the money.  The government has to look carefully at how it is 
using the money it gets.  It must bear in mind that agriculture, 
our food supply and the basic necessity of life which is food, 
should be the country's primary importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has subsidized our magazine industry to the tune 
of $150 million. Here again it is farmers versus magazine moguls, 
which is what I would call them. They are limited in number and 
have massive influence with the government. They are getting $150 
million.  It is a case of their merely not wanting to meet the 
competition from other magazine producers. In the case of the 
farmer, he is not getting the subsidy and he is up against 
competitors who are subsidized.  In the case of the magazine 
industry, competitors in other countries are not getting 
subsidized so it is not the same issue. It is mispriorization in 
government spending in regard to agriculture and other sectors of 
the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw an interesting little example in the National Gallery of 
Canada the other day, the famous “Voice of Fire”.  That 
beautiful art piece was purchased for about $1.2 million and the 
gallery staff told me it is now worth $7.5 million.  When hearing 
that, the question farmers ask is if it has gone up that much in 
value, why not sell it and use the money for some good priorities 
such as keeping a viable agriculture sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the infamous Winnipeg situation of $15,000 in St. 
Norbert for a display of dead rabbits hanging in the trees. That 
was funded by the government. 
The government is being asked for money for agriculture. Lots of 
money is being wasted and foolishly spent and it lets the 
agriculture sector sink.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not go on too much about the extra money. Other 
examples such as the movie <I>Bubbles Galore</I> have come up. 
The coast guard and Corrections Canada spent $6,000 on a party on 
the east coast. The ships with the helicopters on them probably 
cost about $30,000 an hour to run. It was probably $200,000 or 
$300,000 no doubt for that little trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $130 billion budget for the federal government's operations 
is a pretty big figure.  With that amount the government knew it 
was getting and would be able to spend, it should have simply 
planned for that spending and used it properly. It should not be 
coming back to the taxpayer time after time to get more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will mention regarding wasted money is the 
figure of around $200 million on the famous former Bill C-68 on 
gun control, the Firearms Act.  What a tremendous waste of money. 
It is evident to virtually every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at what the agriculture minister and chairman of 
the agriculture committee are saying and doing in regard to the 
agriculture crisis that is happening in western Canada.  We know 
what they are saying to the people of southwest Manitoba and 
southeast Saskatchewan in the flood area. Let us look at what 
else they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister was talking about farmers who are in 
trouble and possibly going bankrupt.  One of the most famous 
statements he made rates right up there along with Mr. Trudeau's 
“Why should I sell your wheat?” The minister said, “I have 
been there, I have done it and it is now time for tough love”. 
He continued, “We are sorry but that bottom 30% of farmers who 
cannot make it will just have to go and do something else and we 
will continue on with the remaining 60%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be the vision of the government regarding 
agriculture.  Some of the policies the government brings out 
encourage that kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best examples is the Canadian Wheat Board.  A lot of 
people believe that the Canadian Wheat Board will keep the small 
farmers around.  In the timeframe that the Canadian Wheat Board 
has been going, since the 1940s, we have lost tens of thousands 
of farmers, and the small farmers are disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that the wheat board does not have the ability to 
provide independent marketing for the individual farmers who 
could by looking at their own marketing maximize their prices. 
The wheat board wants to tell everybody it will do all the 
marketing and get a price which will be shared among every other 
farmer.  That has not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that the Canadian Wheat Board assets be sold off. They 
should be sold off to a consortium named the Saskatchewan Wheat 
Pool and the Agricore.  That would become their marketing arm, 
two organizations that are set up to pool the returns for all 
farmers and would voluntarily go in with them.  The farmers who 
did not want to be part of that organization would end up 
marketing on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the solution for marketing grain on the prairies.  This 
would actually add income for a lot of farmers.  Those who would 
be hurt by not having pooling and not having somebody to do their 
marketing for them, would have farmer owned co-operatives, namely 
Agricore and the marketing ability of the wheat board to do that. 
It is pretty clear there are things which could be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a minute about a couple of farmers who 
are telling the government what is necessary.  One of them 
mentions the Canadian Wheat Board and marketing freedom, but they 
also get into other areas such as transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One farmer said “I have been a producer representative on the 
old senior grain transportation committee that existed”. He went 
on to say that what it really comes down to with the current 
regime is that it is based on a command structure. We could say 
that about the wheat board as well, because the wheat board is 
set up by the House as a command structure where one has the sole 
right to sell wheat and barley for export.  However, if one wants 
to try and do it by oneself, the wheat board says “Sell it to us 
and we will add some costs and return what is left over”. The 
command structure there again is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmer went on to say that the transportation system runs on 
layers of regulations and formulas.  He said that the irony is 
that over the years it was the farmers who asked for that.  We 
see now that in fact a command structure does not work.  It does 
not work in agriculture and it does not work in the case of 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of supply management in Manitoba where I come 
from.  We are glad to have it.  That is different from the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  The Canadian Wheat Board is not supply 
management.  There has been a lot of deception by the government 
over the years that the Canadian Wheat Board is supply 
management.  That is absolutely not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply managed sector operates under legislation and the 
cost of production is included in a formula on which it prices 
its product.  That is a good thing.  I support that supply 
management is a good sector for agriculture. Supply management 
does not seem to be applicable to the whole agriculture sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hog producers have said that they do not want to go back to 
supply management because they are export dependent.  As long as 
we force agriculture just to be in the domestic market, we can 
say that if we do not want to export, let us have supply 
management in the whole agriculture sector and we will pay those 
farmers who are able to be in that enough to keep going. But what 
we see is that the country makes tens of billions of dollars in 
the non-supply managed sector.  That is new money coming in from 
outside the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the government can stand here and not support western 
Canada's farmers and also those in Ontario who export grains and 
earn the country tens of billions of dollars is beyond me.  In 
the planning of the government and the agriculture minister, one 
would think the importance of these export sectors and what they 
contribute to the country would be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other farmer saw fit to talk to us about farming on the 
question of whether or not this government could afford to help 
agriculture and maintain a viable sector.  He commented that 
“The finance minister is projecting a $90 billion surplus in 
five years.  I may say this government can find money for support 
for those who are under siege”.  He used the example of East 
Timor.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is time to recognize the farm industry at home here is 
under siege as well.  Because farming is a renewable resource 
every year employing people directly and indirectly by the 
thousands, the government must come to recognize that those 
dependent on the farming industry are under siege as well.  What 
is being offered so far to combat the record foreign subsidies 
through AIDA is at best insignificant.  The farmers and the 
business people both directly and indirectly have demonstrated, 
sent petitions, made trips to Ottawa, staged rallies and have 
given presentations by the dozens in the months that followed 
seeding and the harvest in 1999, all in an attempt to get Ottawa 
to recognize the farm crisis in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point in the government going around talking and 
asking everyone what should be done.  The facts are on the line. 
The government has been told what is going on. Number one, the 
low net margin in the west for the export crops and in Ontario 
have to be addressed.  The net margin has to be brought up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of a long term program necessitates a massive infusion 
of cash into Manitoba and Saskatchewan in particular.  That 
infusion has been identified by the premiers of both those 
provinces to the federal government as being in the neighbourhood 
of $1.3 billion.  It is time the government rolled up its sleeves 
and gave us the viable agriculture sector that is so important to 
our national interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the remarks of the member from 
the newly named riding of Hilstrom—Interlake.  I am a member 
from downtown Toronto and not a rural member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not fully aware of the complexities surrounding the issue 
of agriculture and agri-food, but earlier this week I had the 
privilege of speaking at the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
summit.  One fact that came out at that summit was the need to 
debate mobilization and getting more focused on the problems and 
challenges surrounding rural issues.  We must start with a new 
beginning and engage a larger number of consumers and city 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the member for Selkirk—Interlake is very sensitive 
about government resources, I would like to ask him if he would 
support the notion of the Government of Canada and Agriculture 
Canada investing some dollars in mobilizing city residents to 
become more engaged and more involved in rural agricultural 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to be very concerned about taxpayer money being spent 
on arts, culture, et cetera.  I personally believe that a lot of 
money should be spent on mobilizing city representatives because 
we represent 80% of the votes in the House.  Perhaps the member 
could speak on behalf of his party and indicate whether they 
would support such a campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I support a 
campaign along those lines but we would have to look at the 
details.  The Leader of the Opposition and I met with the 
ex-premier of Manitoba this summer, along with the Rural Disaster 
Coalition people.  We in fact called for the very same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consumers of Toronto are very important to agriculture in 
not only the west but all areas of agriculture because they 
consume and pay for food.  They also vote to put MPs into the 
House to represent them.  The interest of consumers is served by 
keeping a viable agriculture sector and reasonably priced food. 
As a result I support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last comment I would make gets back to the performance of 
the agriculture minister.  The government and the agriculture 
department have to be very careful about putting out press 
releases with regard to what is happening by way of support.  He 
mentioned again today that farmers received $1.1 billion.  He did 
not say this today but he has said that provincial governments 
put in their part, bringing the figure up to $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers in Toronto think that farmers have obtained $2 
billion.  They have not.  They have a portion of it but they are 
still to get it all.  We are in agreement that consumers are 
important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
listened intently to the member for Selkirk—Interlake.  I think 
he wasted some of his energy at the beginning.  Typical of 
partisan politics, he decided to take a shot at the Tories so I 
will take a little one at the Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canada was very well represented under the Tories. 
Agriculture was at the top of the agenda, not at the bottom of 
it. We had people like Don Mazankowski,  Harvie Andre, Joe Clark 
and a number of others who were cabinet ministers, prime 
ministers and deputy prime ministers sitting at the table.  They 
understood and represented the issue of agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke about wheat and grain. Certainly they are 
issues but there is a greater one which I would like the member 
to comment on, and that is the desperate failure of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grain farmers are supported by something like 65 cents to 75 
cents per bushel of wheat.  The United States supports its grain 
farmers by approximately $1.60 to $1.80.  The numbers change 
constantly.  The European Union supports its farmers by $2.30 to 
$2.40 per bushel of wheat.  This is one of the major underlying 
problems facing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's question 
raises the point that a united alternative would certainly help 
us put forward the position that he purports to be putting 
forward right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member termed my remarks as slamming the PCs.  That was not 
my point at all.  The history of agriculture policy and programs 
over the past 20 years the PCs and the Liberals have been in 
power has not resulted in the long term program which everybody 
is identifying needs to be in place.  They are talking about it 
again today.  If this is not done in another five or ten years, 
the MPs who follow us to this place will be talking about the 
same thing.  This is my criticism of past governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of subsidy in Canada for farmers, not all farmers but 
just those who are being hurt by trade distorting subsidies of 
other countries through no fault of their own, is the issue that 
has to be addressed today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
love to get into an extended debate with the member on the 
Canadian Wheat Board but we really do not have the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one on the government side is saying that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is supply management.  We are saying that the Canadian 
Wheat Board is orderly marketing, maximizing the returns that are 
in that market.  Instead of confusing the facts the member should 
have clearly said that the government has put in place an elected 
board of directors so that the farmers on the board could be 
masters of their own destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised and disappointed at the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake.  He used the tactics of divisiveness in his 
remarks by talking about some of the grants to culture and so on 
as if they were not needed as well.  They are needed in that 
area.  I have seen this type of tactic being used previously by a 
former Reform Party member, the present Saskatchewan party 
leader.  He used the argument of east versus west as to what one 
was getting and the other was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a problem.  The minister has very clearly said that 
there is a farm crisis.  We have outlined the problem with 
subsidies in the European Economic Community and in the United 
States.  We tabled a position at the WTO for those countries to 
bring down the subsidies.  Yes, we have to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said additional funds were needed for the farm 
sector. I agree that additional funds are needed.  Could he tell 
us how much in additional funding is needed from his perspective? 
How should it be paid out so that it gets to the farm community 
quickly and helps the family farm?  Let us put the facts on the 
table.  What are you really saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind all hon. 
members to address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the facts are on the 
table.  The premiers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have asked for 
an immediate $1.3 billion.  They have asked for a natural 
disaster declaration for the flooded regions of the provinces of 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  That money should go out to the 
provinces right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to east versus west, that is not true.  I put 
forward a motion in the standing committee on agriculture asking 
for a tour of Ontario so we could talk directly with the farmers 
there.  It was cancelled by Liberal members of the committee; we 
will not be going to Ontario.  My colleagues in the Reform Party 
and I will be required to do it by ourselves and report back to 
parliament on what farmers in Ontario are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last comment is with regard to maximizing returns of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
We have no idea whether or not it maximizes returns.  That simply 
comes from the Kraft report.  The wheat board gave him some 
statistics and he said that it looked like it was doing a great 
job.

choice of the farmer is the important issue.

rise in the debate on supply, because we should in this 
period be looking at the government's approach to management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be talking about agriculture today. We want to talk 
about it, but the government is turning its attention elsewhere, 
as is its habit, instead of dealing with the real problems 
confronting it daily.  Since 1993, the government has done 
everything except look after the problems put to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government is disturbing this allotted day on 
agriculture with the introduction, as a total surprise and in a 
sneaky and unusual way, of a bill that has nothing at all to do 
with economic difficulties, nothing to do with the way this 
country is being governed, but that instead pits the House of 
Commons of Canada against the National Assembly of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will understand that I, like my Conservative 
colleague who made the motion, cannot help but address that 
issue in the context of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, the way the House of Commons operates is that the 
House leaders of all parties reach agreement in a civilized and 
correct manner, respectful of the rights of each, of the 
standing orders, of tradition, habits and parliamentary good 
faith.  It is our habit here to reach agreement and to ensure 
that the business is properly organized. 
We have some idea of what is coming and the government has some 
idea of the kind of fight, the kind of opposition it will 
get from us on each bill.  There is nothing really secret in 
all of this, with the exception of a few surprises like the one 
we had this week about the vote, but nothing more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are clear and the business of the House is based on 
mutual respect, confidence, honesty and clarity.  That is how 
things are generally done in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few days, however, based on certain things leaked to 
the press, we were expecting the government to introduce a bill 
that, more than ever before, places the House of Commons and the 
members of this House in the position of having to make 
decisions that will restrict the powers of Quebec's national 
assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this government not content with ignoring the 
constitutional responsibilities of each level of government but 
now, when it comes to something that has never been challenged 
by anyone, that the history books accept as a given—Quebec's 
right to decide its own future—the government has decided to get 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, the entire process has been changed for the 
introduction of this bill.  Gone were any notice, clarity, trust 
or honesty.  The whole thing was done during the night.  The 
night was what it was, and I challenge the members opposite to 
say otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday evening, after the dinner hour, I myself checked with 
the government and the House whether it was indeed true that a 
fast one would not again be pulled on Quebec, whether a bill 
that might limit the rights of the national assembly would not 
be introduced. 
The answer yesterday evening at 7 p.m. was “Never, there is no 
question of it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a certain night in November of 1981, a plot was hatched 
behind Quebec's back, in the kitchens of the Chateau Laurier 
here in Ottawa, to patriate the constitution.  That was what 
happened.  It has been described as the “night of the long 
knives”.  On many occasions, the present Prime Minister has 
claimed never to have had anything to do with the “night of the 
long knives” and with what the history books will call the 
“night of the long knives” with respect to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., there was a “night of the 
long knives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> This is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Everything changed. That was the end of 
parliamentary trust, the end of respect among individuals, the 
end of respect for the word given. The case of Quebec was 
settled the way things usually are, here in Ottawa. The deed was 
done during the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand such an inappropriate—to use a 
parliamentary expression—process, let me quote an editorial 
published on Wednesday, November 22, 1972, in the daily <I>Montréal 
Matin</I>. The journalist was referring to the current Prime 
Minister, who was then the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interview was given to CTV, on November 19, 1972. A copy of 
the transcript was available. The journalist, Clément Brown, 
quoted the Prime Minister talking about the parc de la Mauricie. 
I would appreciate it if members opposite would listen. 
I would like all Quebecers to hear it, because it will be a sad 
reminder of who we are talking here. The editorial quoted the 
current Prime Minister as saying “I used that park to break the 
back of the Quebec government and, believe me, I am proud of 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of the then Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, now the Prime Minister and member for 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What a sinister individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> The difference between today and 1982, when 
this same Prime Minister was the enforcer of the previous 
Liberal government to unilaterally patriate the constitution, is 
that, at the time, Quebec was represented by 74 members of the 
Liberal Party of Canada in this House. Indeed, Quebec was

patriation of the Cthey are going

representatives of Quebec agreed with him.  He could therefore 
proceed.  And we were to think that Quebec had been well treated 
and well served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has judged the Prime Minister of the time and the 
current Prime Minister.  Since 1982 in Quebec, no premier— 
federalist or sovereignist—has dared put his signature to the 
constitution, which no one in Quebec accepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have news for the current Prime Minister and the government in 
place: there will never be another 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never again will the majority of the members representing 
Quebecers in this House support what this government is up to. 
Never again will the members representing the majority of the 
ridings in Quebec, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, people who 
have something in their heart, 
allow the government to try to take away from the national 
assembly even a single ounce of responsibility, a single ounce 
of power to determine the future of the people of Quebec.

the Conservative Party members from Quebec, who have some 
respect for the right of the people of Quebec to decide their 
future—for instance, the member for Chicoutimi, in the 
sovereignist region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean—will vote on this 
bill.  I can hardly wait to see how the Conservatives will vote. 
I believe they will not stoop to the same level as the

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today is that the chickens are coming home to 
roost.  In 1982—and hon. members would be wise to listen, for it 
may improve their knowledge of the reality of Quebec—this Prime 
Minister committed an extremely serious error in political 
strategy.  All of his government knows this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1982, the federal government has been dragging along, like 
a ball and chain, a constitution that has never been accepted by 
one whole founding people, by one whole province, one of the 
most important provinces, one that was there from the beginnings 
of Canada, that was the place where European life in North 
America began.  That province is part of the constitution of 
Canada solely by obligation; we never signed it.  This error 
committed by the Prime Minister is what we want to correct 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, there was 40% support for Quebec sovereignty. Then came 
the patriation of the constitution, the fruit of the labours of 
this wonderful Liberal government. 
In 1995, support went up to 49.6%. I remember having discussed 
this with eminent colleagues just before the 1995 referendum. 
Do you know what they told us?  “The polls are giving you 35%; 
and so that is that, sovereignists, that is the last we will 
hear of you”.  If my memory serves me, we got 49.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> 49.4% 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Sorry, 49.4%.  The result of the

more and more Quebecers have understood that their future lies 
in sovereignty and not in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the pretext of clarity, the great minister of constitutional 
affairs, the great implementer of the Prime Minister's

pretexts, they are setting up barriers likely to make it 
impossible, to all intents and purposes, by setting all sorts of 
undefined considerations.  They are hanging swords of Damocles 
over the head of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feeling is that the federal government wants to make sure 
Quebec cannot democratically overcome all these obstacles.  This 
is where we are at.  Because 1982 was a mistake, because 1982 
was an injustice, because Quebecers want to run their own 
country, those on the other side want to stop them.  We will not 
let that happen.  We give them notice of that.

would like to put a question to the hon. member in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three parts of his proposal are as follows. The first part 
was that it was up to the Quebec national assembly to define the 
question and the conditions of the referendum. The second was 
that the leader of the opposition gave his support to the 
principle of 50% plus one. The third was that the whole 
matter should be in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme 
Court of Canada. Does the hon. member agree with this proposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the contents of the bill we 
are debating were so clear, so good and so beneficial for 
Quebec, why did they do this during the night?  Why, until now, 
has it been withheld from all the newspapers, MPs and Quebec? 
Why, if it is so clear and so good? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the government.  It has a habit of flaunting its bills 
everywhere and telling people how wonderfully it is looking 
after Canada.  Members opposite are not shy.  But now we have 
this bill which nobody knew anything about. Without any advance 
warning, it was sprung on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that this bill poses an indescribable 
threat to Quebec. 
The government will have to submit the referendum question to 
all of Canada's provinces and territories.  Only after all these 
opinions are in will the federal government decide whether or 
not the question is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no mistake, responsibility for the clarity of the

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-235, an act to amend the Divorce Act (marriage counselling 
required before divorce granted) be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-235 is a bill concerning the 
Divorce Act.  However, it is not about parents, it is about 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 22, 1967, Pierre Elliott Trudeau declared that the 
state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.  At the time, 
the number of divorces in Canada was 10,000 per year.  In 1987 
divorces peaked at 90,000, one in every two marriages.  Today 
there are about 80,000 divorces per year or an effective rate of 
over 40%.  However, there are also about one million common law 
couples and their breakdown rate is 50% higher than for married 
couples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common law relationships represent less than 20% of all couples 
but account for over 60% of all cases of domestic violence; 20% 
of parents break up before their children reach the age of five; 
25% of children enter adult life with some sort of significant 
mental, social or behavioural problems; and 50% of all children 
will experience divorce or family breakdown before they reach 
their 18th birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lone parent families represent about 16% of all families in 
Canada but they account for 52% of all children living in 
poverty.  One out of four children do not live at home with their 
biological parents and 70% of young offenders come from broken 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other impacts related to family breakdown.  Domestic 
violence for instance is another important issue.  Seventeen per 
cent of homicide victims in Canada are divorced or separated, and 
although as a group they only represent 6% of the population, 12% 
of those committing homicides were also separated or divorced, 
and 23% of women killed in registered marriages were separated at 
the time of the incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research evidence is clear.  It shows that children who 
witness abuse between their parents are affected as much as if 
they were abused themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the recent statistics about children from 
fatherless homes in the United States:  63% of youth suicides, 
85% of children with behavioural disorders, 75% of high school 
dropouts, 85% of youth sitting in jails, 80% of rapists. 
They are five times more likely to be poor and more likely to be 
abusers of drugs and alcohol.  Forty-one per cent of youth 
showing anxiety, depression and physical aggression come from 
fatherless homes and are twice as likely to get involved in 
crime.  They are also 11 times more likely to have violent 
misbehaviours and more likely to have problems achieving intimate 
lasting relationships themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear from those examples alone that divorce is child 
abuse, and that is why as responsible legislators we cannot remain 
silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Pierre Trudeau say today?  I have no doubt that he 
would not change his basic premise that the state has no place in 
the bedrooms of the nation, but I would like to think that today 
he would add the qualifier “unless it affects the business of 
the nation, including the well-being of our children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 basically calls for court ordered mandatory 
counselling prior to the granting of a divorce.  The requirement 
does not apply where the grounds are physical or mental cruelty, 
where the court agrees that counselling is inappropriate or when 
one party cannot be brought to counselling.  It is therefore 
estimated that only 10% to 20% of divorces would be affected by 
such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the legislation is not primarily to seek 
reconciliation of marriages but rather two points.  One is to 
ensure there is a viable parenting plan in place which is child 
centred and in the best interest of the children.  Second, it is 
to address the tragic prevalence of post-break up acrimony which 
is far more likely to occur after separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce has been described by many as being like a runaway 
train.  Parents are often ignorant of the facts and do not 
understand the wide ranging consequences or ramifications, 
particularly on their children.  The related issues are much more 
complex and touch virtually every aspect of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would suggest, however, that parenting education after 
divorce is quite frankly too late.  However, when we consider that 
75% of divorced persons remarry within five years and we 
understand that children are the real victims of divorce, it is 
never too late to mitigate the devastating impacts of divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent book written by Dr. David Royko called <I>Voices 
of Children of Divorce</I>, he expressed his experiences with 
children who had undergone mandatory programs as a result of 
divorce.  I will relay to the House some of the comments and 
quotations from the children interviewed by Dr. Royko.  Some said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me bad dreams.  It hurts a lot.  I cry a lot.  If I have 
to go back and live with mom, I'll run away or kill myself. 
I'm totally caught in the middle.  I felt sick a lot, like I 
might throw up.  I was scared.  I thought that no matter what 
happened someone was going to hate me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can go nuts after awhile.  I feel pushed around by everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had three wishes, the first one would be to be thin because 
my parents fought about how much I eat.  I heard my dad yelling 
at my mom that if she had got custody, I'd turn out to be a fat 
pig just like her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents' fight for custody was the scariest thing in the 
world and it made me realize that marriage is stupid and having 
kids is something I'll never ever do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had three wishes, I'd like to be a cop, I'd like to have a 
machine gun and I'd like to have a nuclear bomb.  It all makes me 
so mad, like I want to kill everyone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to listen to the voices of our children.  Children are 
the real victims of divorce and the impacts on those children as 
a result of divorce are too serious to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the special joint committee of the Commons and 
Senate on custody and access, entitled “For the Sake of the 
Children”, also recommended mandatory parenting education for 
parents seeking custody orders of children.  This is a major 
change in the philosophy of parliamentarians, the legislators of 
the Commons and the Senate, with regard to the Divorce Act which 
for far too long has been parent centred and has not taken the 
best interests of children to heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are existing programs in place.  In Alberta, for instance, 
there is a program called Parenting After Separation which 
began as a pilot project in Edmonton in February 1996.  It is a 
six hour, court mandated, education program for divorcing parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who would suggest that counselling cannot work, let us 
look at what some of the participants had to say about their 
participation in the Parenting After Separation mandatory 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first participant said “The class helped me determine that 
I would do everything to work things out ourselves for our 
daughter's benefit rather than go to the court and be 
adversarial”.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some said “Thank you very much.  You have boosted my confidence 
level in realizing that divorce doesn't have to mean war”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another said “This course is great.  It should be mandatory for 
all those who are separating to teach both parents about their 
responsibilities toward their children.  It helped me to get to 
the real important issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another said “It makes me feel that I should not fight because 
it hurts my child.  This course helped me realize that things can 
be worked out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, one participant said “I was really ticked off that my 
lawyer told me I had to take this course so I came with somewhat 
of an attitude.  Am I ever glad now that I came.  I did not 
realize how much I was hurting my children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parenting education programs are not new but classes tailored to 
the specific needs of divorcing families are a relevant recent 
phenomenon in Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen years in the U.S. there was one program.  Five years ago 
there were dozens.  Now there are hundreds.  Mandatory 
counselling is now required in 18 U.S. states and in Florida even 
children of divorce are required to attend a program to help them 
cope with the impacts of their parents divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parenting education programs are now available in every province 
of Canada although they are mandatory only in Alberta and on a 
pilot basis in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective June 1, 1998, the attorney general of B.C. introduced 
mandatory parenting courses in Burnaby and New Westminster.  It 
is a three hour course and the parents take the course 
separately.  It teaches dispute resolution as well as the impact 
of family breakdown on children.  In his announcement, the 
attorney general stated “This is not for parents.  It's for 
children.  We want to reverse the adverse impact of the divorce 
process on children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there broad reluctance for any intervention, but 95% 
of couples ordered by the courts to take counselling do so with 
great reluctance.  Interestingly enough, 90% of those who go 
through the program are grateful that there was a program.  The 
Alberta experience is that in 5% of cases the parents discover 
that divorce is not going to solve their problem and reconcile 
their problems and are dealing with them in a constructive 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the custody and access joint Commons-Senate committee did 
its one year study, consulting right across Canada, it found 
three positive results from the U.S. programs. First, parents 
participating in the programs were more likely to communicate 
positively with their children about the other parent and 
non-residential parents had greater access to their children; 
second, parents demonstrated improved communication skills; and 
third, programs lowered the exposure of children to parental 
conflict and increased each parent's tolerance for the parenting 
role of the other parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that constructive intervention at a time of high 
emotion after parents have separated is very effective based on 
actual programs running.  It is not a wish, it is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children do have rights.  They have the right to the continuing 
care and guidance of their parents and the right to a continuing 
relationship with their parents.  They have the right to know and 
appreciate what is good in each parent without one parent 
degrading the other.  They have the right to express love, 
affection and respect for each parent without having to stifle 
that love because of fear of disapproval of the other parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have the right to know that the parents decision to divorce 
was not their responsibility.  They have the right to not be a 
source of argument between the parents.  They have a right to 
honest answers to questions about changing family relationships. 
They have a right to experience regular, consistent contact with 
both parents and to know the reason for cancellation of time or 
change of plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a right to a relaxed, secure relationship with both 
parents without being placed in a position where one parent is 
pitted against another.  They also have the right to be treated 
as important human beings with unique feelings, ideas and 
desires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are the real victims of divorce and mandatory 
counselling will provide reasonable guidance to ensure that there 
is a viable parenting plan in place and that post-break up 
acrimony will be mitigated as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the bill is not about parents.  It is about 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Healthy outcomes of children mean stronger families and 
ultimately a stronger country.  For that reason, a constructive 
intervention for divorcing parents not only makes sense for the 
parents but for society as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-235, and act to amend the Divorce Act, 
requiring marriage counselling before a divorce is granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Mississauga South for this initiative 
and for his ongoing commitment and concern for family issues.  He 
has acquitted himself admirably in pursuit of issues to 
strengthen the family and his contribution to issues 
surrounding the welfare of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family is the foundation of this nation.  A strong family 
makes a strong community.  A strong community makes a strong 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is hardly one that should cause objection. 
It is a straightforward and direct attempt to achieve 
reconciliation in cases of potential marriage breakdown and 
subsequent divorce. On this side of the House we would have 
preferred to see a caveat in the bill that covered the aspect of 
children and the requirement for counselling.  Perhaps the member 
for Mississauga South will have some afterthoughts that he will 
want to add to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce wreaks havoc on the spouses concerned and has been 
likened to the death of a mini civilization.  The repercussions 
are devastating, particularly, as I said previously, when 
children are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premarriage counselling is mandatory in some faiths, such as the 
Mormon faith.  In certain faiths couples will not be joined in 
matrimony until they have completed a marriage preparation 
course.  I believe that is true in certain U.S. states.  As I 
understand it, the success rate of marriages where couples have 
participated in the course is very good.  In today's world, with 
all of its stresses, diversions and temptations, why not equip 
those thinking of marriage with all the possible tools to handle 
the difficulties and stresses that marriage brings.  Similarly, 
why not attempt to salvage a marriage that is on shaky ground by 
way of counselling before a final decree is registered granting 
divorce.  This seems to me to be the least that society should do 
to prevent another divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December a joint Senate and House of Commons committee 
tabled a report on child custody and access entitled “For the 
Sake of the Children”.  The report was greeted in most circles 
as a compelling and cognitive effort to come to grips with the 
realities of what divorce means, in particular what it means to 
children and other family members left in the wake of marriage 
breakdown.  As I said before, divorce has been characterized as 
the death of a mini civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint report contained some 48 logical and progressive 
recommendations and received all party support, with some 
refinements and additions by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the joint committee, the hon. member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, the hon. member for 
Cariboo—Chilcotin and the hon. member for Calgary Centre, who is 
the Reform Party's critic for family affairs, did a marvellous 
job in putting facts together for the sake of children, families 
and this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members of the Reform Party took the time and effort 
to work on the special joint committee. 
We on this side of the House care a great deal about families and 
children because, as I said earlier, the institution of the 
family is the foundation of this great country.  A strong family 
makes a strong nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister will again study this issue.  She is slow 
in bringing the provinces along in order to reach a consensus on 
what we can do for families, and children in particular.  We can 
strengthen our families, but the Liberal justice minister's idea 
of doing things in a timely fashion is to drag her feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched her do this with the youth criminal justice 
system.  We saw the government drag its feet.  In fact it tried 
to dig in its heels, while the opposition humiliated it into 
compensating the victims of government controlled tainted blood. 
I hope that the justice minister will listen to a member of her 
own party on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall this report was endorsed and applauded as a realistic 
approach to deal with marriage breakdown when children are 
involved.  Recommendation 29 of the report called upon the 
federal government to extend financial support to programs run by 
community groups for couples wanting to avoid separation and 
divorce or seeking to strengthen their marital relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that this recommendation stemmed from the 
fact that the committee wanted to support troubled couples, 
particularly couples who had children and wanted to avoid 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative before us today is a further refinement and a 
more direct attempt to salvage a marriage.  It puts emphasis on 
the lawyers and the courts to ensure that a marriage counsellor 
is involved in the process before any decree of divorce is 
granted. It calls for more than the perfunctory questions which 
divorce lawyers are responsible to ask before they proceed with 
divorce papers.  This is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the bill recognizes the lack of benefit and 
perhaps harm that can be caused if the parties to a potential 
divorce are in a situation involving physical or mental cruelty. 
I agree that there would be no benefit in putting those parties 
in any further situations where further harm to either party may 
ensue.  There is obviously a point of no return, as sad as that 
may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again commend the member for his sense of realism and 
compassion in this regard.  This approach and attempt to provide 
spouses contemplating divorce with some form of reconciliation is 
sensible, but there is little use in forcing a situation.  Again, 
I wonder if there is some way of augmenting this marriage 
counselling undertaking to give it more impact and force when 
children are involved.  Perhaps there is not a way to achieve 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the comprehensive work undertaken and delivered 
by the joint committee in the report I spoke of earlier, 
regrettably we will see no further movement on the issue of 
divorce law changes for perhaps three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has responded to 16 of the 
recommendations in the report and has stated that she will now 
undertake further study and consultation on the issue, as she 
usually does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is again regrettable that she cannot accept that the issues 
of divorce and child custody have received comprehensive study 
and cogent recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is pleased to see a member of the 
government, an hon. member of the House who contributed to the 
work and deliberations of the joint committee, step forward with 
this bill today to begin the process of divorce law changes in 
Canada.  It is a start and it will be a fundamental part of any 
21st century approach to a tragic and growing situation in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces should be involved. 
I understand that the province of Alberta has produced a video 
for couples.  Similar things should be done by other provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are debating Bill C-235. For the benefit of those who may have 
tuned in to CPAC, I will take the time to read the very short 
summary of that bill. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment amends the <I>Divorce Act</I> to require spouses to 
attend marriage counselling before a divorce is granted. This 
requirement does not apply where the grounds are physical or 
mental cruelty— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucky for us. My colleague from Mississauga South was elected to 
the House in 1993. In fact, I have known him since that date. 
Someone looking at the bill would be very surprised to learn 
that the sponsor belongs to the government majority because his 
approach to the harsh reality of divorce is more conservative 
than liberal in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not a votable item, but if it were, we could not 
vote for it. Let me outline some of the reasons why we would 
oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would oppose it because we believe that, when a couple is 
seriously contemplating divorce, it is useless to force them to 
see a marriage counsellor in the hope to make them change their 
minds. It is very rare that a couple decides to divorce on 
impulse. 
That decision usually arises out of a long series of events. To 
“require” individuals to do something totally disregards the 
freedom of those concerned, their right to see things their own 
way. Note that this is not the first time we see something not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the government came up with a draft bill designed, 
for all intents and purposes, to force Quebec to remain part of 
Canada. This no longer makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce is a federal jurisdiction. When the Special Joint 
Committee on Child Custody and Access tabled its report in 1998, 
the Bloc Quebecois presented a dissenting opinion to recognize 
and stress that the responsibility for family, education and 
social services comes under the provinces, and that it is an 
anachronism to have the Divorce Act still under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote what Senator Beaudoin, an eminent constitutional 
expert recognized as such by just about everyone, wrote in 1990 
about the Divorce Act, and what he said is interesting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder why the constituent of 1867 granted to parliament 
exclusive jurisdiction over marriage and divorce. It seems that 
it was for religious reasons. Under section 185 of Lower 
Canada's civil code, marriage could only be dissolved by the 
natural death of one of the spouses. That principle was accepted 
by the overwhelming majority of Catholic Quebecers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add “practising” Catholic Quebecers. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Protestants wanted the opposite, namely to allow the Canadian 
parliament to legislate divorce. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at the time, there was a clear difference between Quebec 
and the rest of Canada. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence section 91.26 of the Constitution Act of 1867, which gives 
exclusive jurisdiction to the Parliament of Canada over marriage 
and divorce. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What may have been appropriate back in 1867 no longer is. 
Religion does not have as much importance as it used to, and our 
legislation should reflect this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote again Senator Beaudoin's remarks: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question begs to be asked: Should the jurisdiction over 
marriage and divorce be given to the provinces, so that Quebec 
could have more control over its family law, an important part 
of its private law which is different from that of other 
provinces? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another difference that should be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some experts see advantages in leaving this jurisdiction under 
section 91. Decentralization here would be a paradox, in their 
view, while our neighbours to the south appear to be moving 
toward centralization. Americans are not alone. Our friends in 
the west would also like to centralize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning centralization and standardization of divorce laws, 
they may be forgetting—and the prime minister should also be 
reminded of this—that we have to different legal systems in 
Canada, and the arguments supporting their position may be a 
little less convincing in Canada. That is what Senator Beaudoin 
was saying back in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois did participate in this joint committee, 
because the problem of children in family with relational 
difficulties is indeed a serious issue. 
But our opinion is that the whole jurisdiction over divorce 
should be given back to the provinces. Quebec's family law 
reflects its own circumstances and meets the needs of its 
citizens. Counselling has been available to couples for a long 
time. Spouses freely choose to use these services. In this area 
just like in so many others, things can change only if people 
really want them to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to inform the House that Bill C-235 will not be 
supported by my colleagues or by the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to take 
part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South raises an issue which deserves 
our consideration. Bill C-235 proposes to amend the Divorce Act 
to provide counselling to spouses before a divorce is granted. 
The marriage counsellor would act as a mediator between the 
spouses. Fortunately, a few exceptions worth mentioning were 
included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Counselling would not be provided in cases where the grounds for 
divorce are physical or mental cruelty, in cases where the court 
is satisfied that counselling would be inappropriate or serve no 
purpose and in cases where one party refuses to take part in 
such counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary of Bill C-235 says that this amendment would require 
spouses to attend marriage counselling before a divorce is 
granted. However, this requirement is not stated in the bill 
itself. I hope the sponsor of the bill will be able to clarify 
this point in his reply at the end of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce is a real problem in Canada and the main victims are not 
the adults, but the children. I sat on the Special Joint 
Committee on Child Custody and Access, which did a comprehensive 
study of the issue of divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in December 1997, this committee, made up of 
parliamentarians from both Houses, set out to meet a formidable 
challenge, namely to consider issues relating to child custody 
and access arrangements after a separation or divorce, focusing 
mainly on the needs and the best interests of the children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235, however, proposes that action be taken before a 
divorce is granted. The members of the special joint committee 
hoped that their report's recommendations would promote the 
emergence of a sensitive culture in order to avoid conflicts 
instead of worsening them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague from Mississauga South also wants to avoid this 
kind of conflict. He wants a mediation system to be put in place 
before a divorce is granted, and not after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the intent of the member for Mississauga South is 
very praiseworthy. If we can reduce the number of family 
breakdowns in Canada, we will have accomplished much good, 
particularly for the vulnerable ones, our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of children, the Special Joint Committee on Child 
Care discovered that, according Statistics Canada, because of a 
high divorce rate, more than 47,000 children were covered by 
custody orders pursuant to the Divorce Act, in 1994 and 1995. 
Consequently, many children saw their home life changed. When 
parents get remarried or find new partners after a divorce, 
things get even more complicated for children. Close to 75% of 
divorced men and women get remarried, and the children from 
their first marriage have to develop new relations with their 
stepparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another statistic worth mentioning: 13% of divorces in 
1992 marked the failure of a second marriage. Incredibly, some 
people think that such instability will not affect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mental health literature, and testimony by young people 
especially, convinced the joint committee that divorce has a 
deep, and at times disastrous, impact on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that most members in this House are aware of the 
harmful effects of separation and divorce on the younger members 
of our society. Although the solution does not entirely rest 
with governments, they can make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, since September 1, 1997, we have had an act similar 
to Bill C-235. It makes it compulsory for divorcing couples who 
have children to attend at least one information session on the 
benefits of mediation. It should be noted that this is an 
information session, not a mediation session. 
If the parents agree to mediation, the Quebec government pays 
for up to six sessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain cases, for example when there is a history or a risk 
of family violence, the Quebec act allows the parties to forgo 
both the information sessions on mediation and the mediation 
itself. The individual who declines to attend such sessions only 
has to sign a consent form that will be forwarded to the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Quebec act is specifically geared to future 
divorcees, it shows how useful mediation can be as a dispute 
resolution mechanism for couples. In Quebec, the results of 
mediation are impressive. Between September 1, 1997, when the 
act came into force, and September 30, 1999, close to 20,000 
couples with children took part in mediation sessions. 
According to the available data, in at least 73 % of the cases, 
mediation was successful in resolving disputes between divorcing 
or separating spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are of course dealing here with spouses who cannot agree on 
the terms of the separation or the divorce agreements and on the 
future of their children. However, the mediation process could 
without any doubt help the spouses who are involved in the 
disputes to stay together for the benefit of all the family 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major advantages of the mediation system is that it 
helps both parties to avoid the more adversarial court 
proceedings where both parents, accompanied by their lawyers, 
are more likely to start making accusations. Accordingly, 
chances of reconciliation are much lower there than with a 
mediator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 proposes a mechanism to help families to stay united. 
As long as the legislation does not force a man and a woman to 
undergo mediation against their will, the Progressive 
Conservative Party would be in favour of Bill C-235. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An in-depth study will have to be made on that subject some day. 
It would be interesting to hear what the experts in the field of 
mediation and even professional mediators have to say on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec experience in this field is worth looking at. Some 
people also believe that divorce legislation should come under 
provincial jurisdiction. Unfortunately, we will not be able to 
look into that for now, because the bill proposed by the member 
for Mississauga South will not be considered by a parliamentary 
committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member for Mississauga South and add a 
little praise for some of the work he has done in the House, 
particularly on Bill C-235.  Sometimes we know the parliamentary 
secretary is anxious to jump up to get rid of a bill and tell us 
why we cannot vote for it.  This is actually a non-votable item 
so it does not really matter what the parliamentary secretary 
says or what anyone says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important in life for people to obtain counselling for 
divorce, family or any other matter.  They need the ability, not 
necessarily in legislation, to sit down with someone who is clear 
thinking and talk about their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed that the statements today of a couple of 
people who did not do any counselling bordered on no one being 
welcome in Quebec unless he or she speaks pure French, even 
though 42% of Quebeckers have Irish backgrounds much like myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in my early years as a member of the parole board I do not 
believe I counselled anyone over there so I do not have to worry 
about them.  At that time I looked at the problems of 
incarcerated people, people who had been sent to jail.  Before 
sitting down I would read the case files and note that they came 
from broken homes, that they were abused as children, that they 
dropped out of school at very early ages, and that they were 
suffering some type of substance abuse whether drugs or alcohol. 
That provided me with a catchment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very early on in my career here I was asked to speak at a 
breakfast meeting in Ottawa.  I was not sure I was capable of 
speaking at it because it was the Parkdale Baptist Church.  It 
sent around a topic that I was to speak on:  the cost of being a 
Christian member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at it and thought as a Christian and family oriented 
person that perhaps I could speak to it, and so I did.  I did 
some research which showed that at one point in time previous to 
1993 the divorce rate among members of parliament elected for a 
second term was at about 75%.  I thought that was pretty high 
compared to the rest of the country.  The last time I checked it 
was still hovering around 72% to 75% as a result of a couple of 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a rule members of parliament are elected at a later stage in 
their lives.  They are moved away from the family unit and 
operate in a vacuum in this building and in the area that 
surrounds it.  Their lives become run by the whip's offices, by 
the various bills that are presented, and by the pressures of the 
media surrounding them.  Probably members of parliament, more 
than most people, need counselling and help in coping with 
everyday life.  Certainly when they are away from home five days 
a week it plays havoc on the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic premise of what the member for Mississauga South has 
brought forth both in the book he has written and in the bills he 
put before the House is that counselling is very important to the 
life cycle, that counselling is probably at the heart of talking 
out one's problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has come forward with a bill that encourages people 
to have counselling before they get divorced. 
In fact, before they get married there should be counselling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Marilyn and I took part in the premarriage encounter 
course in my hometown of Lindsay. We were worried the first 
weekend that we spent at the church with a group of young people 
all full of vim and vigour ready to get married. We were shocked 
when we found that three couples broke up that weekend.  The 
ministerial association was delighted and said, “What we have 
done and what this course has done and what this counselling has 
done is it has prevented divorces.  It has prevented broken 
homes.  It has prevented people from starting a family before 
they realize they are not compatible, that they have nothing in 
common, they have nothing that they can actually associate 
with”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In life, as we know, as soon as people start going together 
society starts to pull the couple apart.  Whether it is boy 
scouts, girl guides, the women's leagues, baseball or sports, the 
forces that people have to deal with start to pull couples apart. 
They have to look at how they are going to handle that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Couples that are getting married in the church are now told that 
they have to attend a premarriage encounter course.  That course 
involves human sexuality, the legal aspects and spiritual aspects 
of marriage and all kinds of things that are important to what my 
friend from Mississauga South is trying to get at.  When a family 
is established and is functioning as a unit, there are 
differences.  Every family, whether it is brothers and sisters, 
husbands and wives, grandparents or in-laws, has differences. 
Most of the minor things can be talked out before they become 
major things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's bill would cause the government to look at what it 
is in law that should be standard to allow families to stay 
together.  Whether it is a certain type of tax deduction which 
allows more counselling in marriage or which allows persons to 
spend more time at home, all of those things have to do with 
mental health as married couples or as common law couples. Fewer 
people are getting married and more people are living common law 
but they suffer the same problems. Counselling also has 
advantages in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South has brought forward something 
that causes us as parliamentarians to take a look and say, yes, 
counselling is important, marriage is important, common law 
relationships are important.  People can deal with each other in 
situations as a family and go to counselling and talk out their 
differences. Bill C-235 is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, that is either a Roman ordering five beers or you 
are telling me my time is up.  I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
for indicating that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should keep in mind that 75% of all marriages 
among people elected for a second term end up in divorce or split 
homes, split marriages.  Members should call home if they have 
not lately.  They should make sure that they spend some time with 
their family so that they do not need the type of legislation the 
member is bringing forward and they do not need the type of 
counselling that is going to come out of a marriage split-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree in some ways that divorce may be the end of a long 
process.  If people talk at the very start, that process ends up 
being a very short process but also a very sweet and loving one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Mississauga South for bringing forward 
Bill C-235.  I know the member for Scarborough Southwest has 
something to say on it, so I will end my speech now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to the consideration of Bill 
C-235 today.  I take perhaps a different and more personal 
perspective on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should begin my remarks by saying that prior to becoming a 
member of parliament I was a lawyer.  The bulk of my practice was 
civil litigation.  A portion of that civil litigation practice 
pertained to matrimonial law.  Within that matrimonial law 
sphere, I did my share of divorces. It was early in my practice 
and early in the experience of the Divorce Act newly passed. 
There were certain obligations placed on lawyers at that time and 
they are still in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members opposite characterized the duties of the 
lawyer as perfunctory.  When I was practising law, I considered 
those duties to be anything but perfunctory.  I thought they were 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my obligation as an officer of the court to bring to the 
attention of my client, who was either responding to a 
matrimonial situation or initiating it, that reconciliation 
counselling was available.  I had to ask if the client had 
considered reconciliation counselling and more to the point, to 
provide the names of reconciliation counsellors, the names of 
arbitrators and that sort of thing in order to keep the peace 
within the breaking up family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I did— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am 
sorry to interrupt the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest but 
I had forgotten that this bill is non-votable.  Therefore the 
mover will get the last five minutes. If the hon. member for 
Scarborough Southwest would give the parliamentary secretary two 
minutes to get his oar in the water, we could do that as well. 
That would give the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest another 
three minutes, but it is up to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will do as you suggest, of 
course.  Just give me that ordering five beers signal, as my 
friend said earlier, and then a countdown on one so I know where 
I am going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I am one of the statistics that my hon. colleague 
has talked about.  I am separated from my wife and have been for 
over two years.  There are no divorce proceedings instituted 
between us, so this bill would not help us in any way because 
this bill pertains to the Divorce Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the points I want to make.  While lauding my 
friend from Mississauga South and all the efforts he has made 
with respect to the issues he is talking about, one of the 
problems with jurisdiction and the fact that the federal 
government has jurisdiction over divorce but not over family law 
per se is that by the time people come to use the Divorce Act, in 
many circumstances sadly it is already too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member exempts, for example, mental and physical 
cruelty from his bill.  If there are grounds, for example, of 
adultery or some other matrimonial offence, people are so angry 
at that point they are not thinking about reconciliation.  A one 
year separation is now grounds for divorce but when I was 
practising it was three years.  By then in many instances it is 
too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to mention very briefly about the 
reconciliation issue is that when the hon. member for Mississauga 
South was speaking, he was talking about this being for the 
benefit of children.  It is absolutely critical that that 
principle be recognized, that it is for the benefit of the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his bill the member talks about the marriage counsellor 
visits “with a view to assisting them to achieve a 
reconciliation”.  I want to draw to the attention of the hon. 
member that there is in fact no mention of children in his bill. 
Perhaps it should read “assisting them to achieve a 
reconciliation and/or to facilitate the lives of the children 
with respect to the unfortunate break up of the marriage”.  I 
draw that to the hon. member's attention because I know that is 
his primary concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have heard today from many parliamentarians on the merits of 
counselling, and the government takes no issue with that.  The 
issue is mandatory counselling.  In order to consider the merits 
of Bill C-235, we have to compare the current Divorce Act to see 
what it would add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently several sections in the Divorce Act that 
already refer to reconciliation.  For example, section 10 
requires the court to assess the possibility of a reconciliation 
of the spouses that come before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to subsection 10(1), the court must satisfy itself that 
there is no possibility of reconciliation of the spouses before 
the court can even consider the evidence on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 10(2) provides that if it appears at any stage of the 
court proceedings that there is a possibility of the spouses 
reconciling, the court must adjourn the proceedings and nominate 
a marriage counsellor to assist the spouses to achieve this 
reconciliation if it is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 does not refer to section 10 but rather proposes to 
replace section 9(1) of the Divorce Act.  As I have already 
noted, section 9(1) currently creates a duty for all legal 
advisors to inform spouses of the available marital counselling 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, section 9(1) requires every barrister, solicitor, 
lawyer or advocate who undertakes to act on behalf of the spouses 
in a divorce proceeding to do two things: first, to draw the 
attention of the spouse to the provisions of the Divorce Act that 
have as their object the reconciliation of the spouses; and 
second, to discuss with the spouse the possibility of 
reconciliation and to inform the spouse of the marriage 
counselling or guidance facilities known to him or her that might 
be able to assist the spouses to achieve reconciliation.  This 
duty is imposed unless the circumstances of the case are such 
that it would clearly not be appropriate to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may also be constitutional and cost implications 
associated with requiring mandatory marriage counselling for all 
divorcing couples.  Counselling can be expensive and would impose 
an additional cost on parents.  Provinces and territories could 
also be reluctant to co-operate if they viewed this legal 
requirement as a federal intrusion into matters of provincial 
jurisdiction.  There would be a strong expectation that the 
federal government would provide the financial funding for those 
counselling services since this legal requirement would be 
imposed on them by the federal government and it could be very 
costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Mississauga South on his initiative and 
his continuing crusade to support family and children.  He is to 
be commended for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would like to 
thank hon. members for being so considerate of each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last five minutes of the debate will go to the mover of the 
motion, the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank all hon. colleagues who participated in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important issue to keep bringing before the House. This 
is the third time I have had this bill before the House.  I want 
to address some of the comments made by hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for Surrey Central for his kind 
remarks and support for the intent of the bill.  I stress intent 
of the bill because certainly as a private member's item it is 
quite difficult for an individual bill to be as comprehensive as 
say, for instance, the special joint Commons-Senate committee on 
custody and access.  This is certainly only one part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Bloc member for Laval Centre for her participation. 
We worked very well together in a number of areas.  She made 
reference to the freedom of individuals.  This is one of the 
reasons why the Divorce Act has to be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently, the Divorce Act is structured for individuals, 
individual rights for the parents.  What it does not do and what 
the Commons-Senate committee said it should do, is shift the 
paradigm and start being child centred and in the best interests 
of the children.  That is where we disagree on the thrust of 
divorce law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that I had Quebec particularly in mind on this 
because the divorce rate in Quebec is around 70%, whereas it is 
less than 50% in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the member for Shefford for her comments.  I know 
how hard she has worked on the special joint committee. She 
raised with me the issue of whether it was mandatory or 
obligatoire.  In the report of the custody and access committee, 
recommendation No. 10 recommends that all parents seeking 
parenting orders be required to participate in an education 
program obligatoire; custody and access report. 
So the member should be clear, this is mandatory counselling. It 
is already in the existing law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is outstanding with the breadth of knowledge and 
experience that we have in this place that members such as the 
hon. member for Haliburton—Victoria—Brock can rise and share 
the experience he has obtained from his work before he came to 
the House.  I really appreciate his words of encouragement and 
his support for some sort of constructive intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Scarborough Southwest is one of the most 
knowledgeable people regarding legislative crafting. I take his 
comments constructively. I hope the issue will continue to be 
alive.  When I bring this issue back to the House, I will be sure 
to consult with the member to ensure that children will be 
foremost in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the points the parliamentary secretary has raised. 
I understand that the government has already indicated that it is 
supportive of educational programs for children.  I find that 
very encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this bill is not votable. The important thing is 
that the bill raises the importance of children and the impact of 
divorce and family breakdown on them.  I think it is always a 
good time to bring this issue before Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude my comments simply by quoting from a review 
of the book <I>The Divorce Culture</I> by a woman who is quite 
experienced in this.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You think your kids will bounce back from divorce?  Guess again. 
Divorce is less like a cold for children than a serious chronic 
disease. You think you will eventually repartner and create a new 
family unit and kids will live happily ever after?  Forget 
it....Not all children of divorce are doomed but in just about 
every way we have to measure such things, divorce has hurt 
children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I thank all hon. members.  I look forward to bringing 
this bill back before the House and the Canadian people in the 
best interests of our children.
