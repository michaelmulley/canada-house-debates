RESPONSIBILITIES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-388, an act to establish a Canadian charter 
of duties and responsibilities.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, one of the main problems I have 
identified in my research is that there are legal documents which 
describe the rights of Canadian citizens in great detail, but no legal 
document which describes their responsibilities. Consequently, 
Canadians are becoming more and more preoccupied with their 
rights, which is creating an unhealthy entitlement mentality in our 
society.
<P>
	Today I am introducing a private member's bill entitled the 
Canadian charter of duties and responsibilities. My long term goal 
is to improve the balance between self-interest and public interest 
and to encourage a sense of trust, responsibility and generosity of 
spirit among all Canadians.
<P>
	The specific purpose of my bill is to remind Canadians, every 
time they apply for a federal program, of this simple reality: we 
cannot continue to enjoy our rights until and unless we continue to 
fulfil our responsibilities.
<P>
	My bill describes in very general terms 16 fundamental duties of 
citizenship and every time a citizen or permanent resident of 
Canada seeks any financial assistance from the federal government 
they will be required to sign a statement of duties and 
responsibilities. This routine process will serve as a regular 
reminder that the benefits of being Canadian also mean meeting 
one's obligation to our country, our communities and our families.
<P>
	My bill will also ensure that all federal legislation is consistent 
with the principle that rights and freedoms must be balanced with 
duties and responsibilities.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIVORCEACT">DIVORCE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-389, an act to amend the Divorce Act (marriage 
counselling required before divorce granted).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this month the Vanier Institute on the 
Family reported that one out of every two marriages in Canada 
ends up in divorce and that 50 per cent of children will experience 
family breakdown before their 18th birthday. It also reported that 
23 per cent of families in Canada are lone parent families and 
account for some 46 per cent of all children living in poverty.
<P>
	This private member's bill seeks to amend the Divorce Act to 
require that spouses attend marriage counselling before a divorce is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9134"> 9134 </A></B>
<P>
granted, unless grounds of mental or physical cruelty are present or 
the court is satisfied that it is impossible or inappropriate for them 
both to take  counselling. The issue here is not the divorced couple 
but the children.
<P>
	Children of divorced parents are two to three times more likely 
to experience poverty and insecurity. They experience negative 
impact on their capacity to love. They are less likely to go to 
college or university. I could go on.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying that the children are the real victims 
of divorce, that mandatory counselling will provide reasonable 
guidance to ensure that a viable parenting plan is in place and that 
the acrimony in divorce is mitigated as much as possible.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have two petitions to table this 
morning.
<P>
	The first one deals with the national highway system, 38 per cent 
of which is substandard. The petitioners point out that the national 
highway policy study identified job creation, economic 
development, saving lives, preventing injury and, more 
importantly, improving Canada's competitiveness on international 
markets as benefits of the proposed national highway program.
<P>
	Therefore, constituents in my riding are calling on the federal 
government to join with the provincial governments in upgrading 
the national highway system.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
second petition points out that the availability of sources of 
affordable fuel is a natural advantage to Canadians in reducing the 
high cost of shipping over long distances between source and 
market.
<P>
	In addition, Canadians are paying approximately 52 per cent of 
the cost of a litre of gasoline in the form of taxes and the excise tax 
went up by 1.5 cent a litre in the last budget of 1996.
<P>
	Constituents in my riding therefore request that Parliament not 
increase the federal excise tax on gasoline in the coming year.

The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that our police 
officers and firefighters  place their lives at risk on a daily basis as 
they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians.
<P>
	They also state that in many cases the families of officers killed 
in the line of duty are often left without sufficient financial means 
to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and

the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our

	The House resumed from February 20 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of 
the government; and on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury.
<P>
	We all know that budgets are delivered to the House of 
Commons and the nation as a whole, but budgets are lived every 
day 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9135"> 9135 </A></B>
<P>
within communities throughout our country. This budget, in my 
opinion, has encountered a very positive response in the homes and 
workplaces of  many families of my constituency, in fact, in 
hundreds of thousands of families across the nation.
<P>
	This time the government did not speak to the corporate 
boardrooms of the nation nor did it speak to the international 
money making organizations, important as they may be. It spoke 
instead to the homes and families which are the real strength in the 
country. When we speak of families, every parent across the 
country will tell us that their greatest concern is the well-being and 
future of their children. The budget addresses the future of 
Canada's children.
<P>
	In the budget, the Liberal government proposes a two-step 
enrichment of the current child tax benefit. What an historic 
undertaking, two levels of government committing to a new cross 
Canada child benefit system.
<P>
	By investing in our children, we reflect Canadian values and 
priorities and make our investment in a stronger society. I am very 
proud that the budget allocates $230 million over the next three 
years to assist the disabled. Canadians with disabilities face real 
barriers. However, they do not seek any special treatment. They 
seek equal citizenship and need our support to secure it. For this 
important reason, the medical expense tax credit has been 
broadened.
<P>
	In the budget, the finance minister addresses important family 
issues with his championing of medicare and his aid to the most in 
need among us.
<P>
	My riding of Niagara Falls was lucky enough to be represented 
in the House by another champion of medicare. I am referring to 
the Hon. Judy LaMarsh, who was responsible for some of the most 
innovative legislation within the Pearson government. It was under 
her guidance, as minister of national health and welfare in 1963-65 
that the Canada pension plan was implemented and Canada's 
medicare system was designed.
<P>
	Recently, and always under a Liberal government, we have 
learned from the National Forum on Health that the money spent on 
health in Canada is more than sufficient. There is, however, a lot of 
evidence that the money is not being spent as effectively and 
efficiently as it could be. The budget has listened to this and is 
providing funds that will help to pave the way for more effective 
and efficient health care system which will bring Canada into the 
21st century.
<P>
	Despite the over 700,000 new jobs created since 1993, we 
strongly believe that the unemployment rate remains too high. 
What parent, as head of a family, is not concerned with how they 
make their daily bread? The budget addresses job creation, jobs 
which support the dignity of individuals as no one enjoys being 
unemployed, jobs which allow the breadwinners to give their 
families a decent standard of living, and jobs that will allow family 
members to contribute to the new revitalized Canada pension plan 
for which, Mr. Prime  Minister, we all thank you today. The tourism 
sector is a very important component for the creation of jobs in the 
Niagara region. The industry is expected to grow by 125,000 new 
jobs in the coming years and the budget allocates $95 million for 
this very purpose.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	My constituency of Niagara Falls borders the U.S. and it has 
some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. I must admit 
that the budget's support and encouragement of tourism is good 
news for my constituency and for all the Niagara peninsula. The 
help provided in the budget to the tourism industry will be great for 
all of Canada. Is it not true that almost every constituency in 
Canada is a tourist destination?
<P>
	Tourism is more that just the scenery. By working in conjunction 
with the aid provided to tourism by the Liberal government we will 
succeed in making our cities, towns and villages equal to our 
scenery as places for tourists to see and enjoy.
<P>
	We are building our tourism industry not only for visitors from 
abroad but for Canadians who will then be able to meet and 
discover one another and explore each other's culture. I firmly 
believe that inter-Canadian tourism can do much more to knit the 
country together than all the politicians and constitutional lawyers 
will ever be able to do.
<P>
	As our cities, towns and village grow older and our population 
stabilizes we have to renew and rebuild much of our infrastructure 
system and the budget has recognized this. Even the most right 
wing of private enterprise supporters would have to agree that if 
there is a place for government spending it has to be on 
infrastructure. It must be the streets, roads, bridges and schools. As 
we all know, those are not in the areas where enterprises excel.
<P>
	Our families need good infrastructure for improved health care, 
education and safety. Businesses need good infrastructure to 
become more competitive and to create the profits which in turn 
will supply the economy with jobs and revenue. My appreciation, 
and I am sure the appreciation of millions of Canadians, goes out to 
the Liberal government for recognizing the need of this basic 
stepping stone for reaching the 21st century.
<P>
	Lower interest rates are expected to generate between 300,000 
and 350,000 new jobs this year. They have translated into real 
savings and real benefits to individuals and business alike. 
Furthermore, the measures announced in our fourth budget cannot 
but facilitate greatly the task of small business in creating jobs.
<P>
	Speaking of small business, I would like to address the farming 
community and its constituents who in most cases are small or 
medium sized business owners. I am sure they will appreciate the 
budget measures geared to the Farm Credit Corporation, which will 
enhance  economic growth in rural Canada by providing 
specialized and personalized services to farming operations. 
Family farms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9136"> 9136 </A></B>
<P>
and small and medium sized businesses that are related to farming 
will then be able to benefit from it. Increases in the Farm Credit 
Corporation's lending activities will help to enhance the economic 
development of rural Canada, particularly the agri-food sector.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, when we took office Canadians knew that tough 
decisions and fundamental changes were required. Canadians did 
not want any tinkering. They asked for lasting solutions. They 
wanted us to develop a plan and stick to it. With our fourth budget 
we have done just that and we are continuing to do so because we 
know we are on the right track.
<P>
	One of our greatest prime ministers, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, said that 
the the 20th century belonged to Canada, and it surely has. 
However, our work is not complete. Our record is not perfect, but it 
shows that the Liberal government has taken its commitments very 
seriously. Our current Prime Minister and Minister of Finance have 
with this budget staked out our claim which will successfully lead 
Canada and all Canadians into the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a comment and a question or two to ask of the member for Niagara 
Falls.
<P>
	I know he is a businessman. I would like to make this analogy. 
He praises this budget. He says that it is a good budget and that he 
is proud of it. When the government first came into power its 
members talked about how they would reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP. Somehow we thought the deficit was $38 billion but 
that was inflated to $42 billion.
<P>
	According to the budget the deficit for the current year now 
stands at $19 billion. Would he agree with me that a deficit in a 
business can be stated as a loss? When the government took power 
the previous government had run up a loss of $42 billion. The 
Liberal government has now reduced that loss on an annual basis 
down to $19 billion.
<P>
	The member is saying that he is proud of a budget, that he is 
proud of a business, that he is proud of a finance minister who 
brags about breaking the back of the deficit or that he is proud of a 
finance minister who loses on behalf of Canadians, who spends 
more money than he brings in by $19 billion.
<P>
	How can the member say that he is proud of a budget that loses 
this kind of money when the whole criteria of a budget should be to 
get to a balanced budget, and the sooner the better. I know the 
member is a businessman. I know the member understands that he 
could not run at a loss for 30 straight years and keep adding to his 
debt unless he had unlimited natural resources in Niagara  Falls. 
Maybe he does. I know Canada is rich as well. I do not understand 
how Liberal members can brag about a budget that brings in a loss 
of $19 billion.
<P>
	The member talked about the serious commitment of the 
government. We found out yesterday that to reduce the deficit the 
government has cut transfers to provinces by $7.5 billion. That 
represented about 23 per cent of its overall deficit cutting regime. 
Then the government representatives said: ``Yes, we know it's 
tough to swallow. You provinces will have to handle it. You guys 
will have to work it out at lower levels yourselves and locally. But 
we're going to bite the bullet as well. We are going to reduce 
program spending and departmental spending by 18 per cent or so, 
by $9 billion''.
<P>
	The government was supposed to cut regional development by 
50 per cent but it is still the same. It is still half a billion dollars 
away on transport even though it has done a good job in that area. If 
the government is serious about its commitment, then why have the 
cuts to departmental spending, the government's spending within 
its own jurisdiction, not been made to their full extent? The cuts are 
only half of what they should be according to the member who said 
that the commitment was strong.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pillitteri:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
excellent question.
<P>
	When we went to an election in 1993 there was a $42 billion 
deficit. We stated at the time that we would bring our deficit down 
to 3 per cent of GDP, and we have done that. We are very proud of 
that. Not only have we done it, but we have excelled on it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> By tax increases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pillitteri:</B> It was not by tax increases. We have done this by 
lowering spending on behalf of the government. We lowered our 
spending by a ratio of seven to one that we transferred to the 
provinces. The provinces were warned two years ahead that their 
transfers were going to be cut.
<P>
	In comparison we cut our own spending by seven to one. We 
have not done this on the backs of Canadians, as the hon. member 
across the way and his party wanted to do it. We wanted to do it 
fairly. We wanted to do it slowly so that in actuality people would 
reflect and understand what we were doing. We did not want to 
burn and slash as the hon. member across the way wanted to do. We 
wanted to do it in a way that was fair to Canadians, and we have 
done so.
<P>
	Our job is not finished yet. We want to continue and certainly we 
will continue because we are on the right track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is my first occasion to congratulate you on presenting 
yourself in that part of my  constituency that has been transferred. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9137"> 9137 </A></B>
<P>
know you will represent those constituents in the future as ably as 
you have the people of Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	In considering the budget we have to go back to 1995. I am sure 
that happens from time to time in circles on both sides of the 
ideological lines in terms of what the 1995 budget meant to 
Canada, what we have been able to accomplish, and what we have 
been unable to accomplish. I cannot disconnect the 1995 budget 
from our former colleague from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. This is 
also the first opportunity I have had to pay tribute on the public 
record to someone who served this place with honour and integrity 
far in excess of the average.
<P>
	The 1995 budget represented a challenge for many of us in the 
context that we had to do some very tough things. We had to 
exercise vigorous restraint on what we would like to consider 
Liberal programs. It did not come easily to us.
<P>
	Because we did it we have found ourselves in a position where if 
the current deficit is not finished with the job must continue. We 
have to be vigilant to make sure that we retain our economic and 
fiscal sovereignty. Generally speaking it is considered to be 
manageable. All indications from outside observers would suggest 
that. That allows us to do some of the things the budget has done.
<P>
	Specifically I refer to jobs. I will simply go through the list of 
things contained in the budget respecting jobs. There will be $95 
million for tourism over three years; an extension for another year 
of the infrastructure program that was extremely helpful in terms of 
jobs and infrastructure development in 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury; a year of premium relief under the 
new hires program; a 10-cent premium reduction on EI premiums; 
$50 million for private sector infrastructure through the Business 
Development Bank; and $2 billion additional capital for the Small 
Businesses Loans Act. We often speak of the Canadian Foundation 
for Innovation and its impact on universities. It is a job generator in 
terms of the R and D opportunities in placing Canada in a position 
to compete at that level internationally.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The opportunities fund which has been discussed with regard to 
disability is a program designed to allow Canadians with 
disabilities access to employment. The youth package was 
announced prior to the budget. The interest rate is low. All these 
things lend themselves to job creation in an environment that will 
see more jobs.
<P>
	The second or third consecutive budget has attempted in a 
modest way, admittedly, to deal with the real problem of child 
poverty. In a relatively affluent society we have this anomaly. I do 
not mean to understate it. It is a terrible tragedy, but the real 
tragedy is that it could happen in a country as wealthy as this one. 
In the third  successive way we have tried to deal with this problem 
in a modest way. It was recognized in the budget speech that we are 
just beginning and that it should be acknowledged.
<P>
	In terms of universities and students I mentioned the innovation 
fund. We have done a number of things to make universities more 
accessible to deal with the problem of rising debt loads. We need to 
make sure that no one who is academically qualified to enter any 
post-secondary education institution is denied that access because 
of an inability to pay for that opportunity. We have had a very 
generous university program and that is one of the reasons Canada 
has been so successful.
<P>
	It is important to recognize that there comes a point when the 
student loan program is not the answer. At some point a huge debt 
with high unemployment is an obstacle to a post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	We mentioned the various responses that the budget contained 
with regard to the National Health Forum. These are opportunities 
to implement new programs or to enhance existing programs 
because we have made progress. The mission is not accomplished, 
but we have made progress in terms of dealing with the deficit.
<P>
	I cannot let the opportunity pass by without speaking specifically 
of the 30 per cent increase in the money available for literacy. It is 
not something that has received a great deal of attention, but it is 
something very dear to my heart. Certainly the government has 
made literacy one of its major preoccupations and I welcome that.
<P>
	In terms of the various things contained in the budget I bring 
attention to the announcements that related to Canadians with 
disabilities. As the chair of the government task force on 
disabilities I was very encouraged by the response of the 
government to our task force. I thank the four ministers who 
sponsored us and the many Canadians who appeared. Upward of 
2,000 people from cities across Canada appeared before the task 
force to speak of what they believed the priorities of Canadians 
with disabilities should be.
<P>
	Although it is a modest beginning, and I do not want to diminish 
in any way the extent to which the battle must continue, in reality 
the government did not break faith with all those people. It did not 
break faith with our task force that went in good faith across the 
country seeking advice. I am very happy the government has seen 
fit to recognize the work, to recognize the need and to respond with 
$230 million over three years in the budget. Approximately$100 million will be in the first year.
<P>
	The budget exercise represents only a beginning. We found 
ourselves having to do things as a government that were borne of 
necessity. These were not ideological decisions. We had a deficit. I 
have always believed that the former government deflated the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9138"> 9138 </A></B>
<P>
deficit to $38 billion  in the last campaign. When we got here we 
found that it was actually $42 billion.
<P>
	My colleague across the way sees it a different way, that it was a 
$38 billion deficit that we inflated to $42 billion. It is remarkable 
how one can look at the same numbers from different sides.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	It is also remarkable that we have been given credit. Members 
across the way during the course of the debate have acknowledged 
that some effort has been undertaken and some progress has been 
made. However the progress is not an end in itself. It allows us to 
get our house in order so that we can do what government is 
supposed to do: to address inequity and to recognize that not 
everybody in Canada starts from the same place. The reality is that 
people differ whether it is by virtue of their capacity, where they 
happen to live or what family they were born into. Not everybody 
has the same chance.
<P>
	In our province we believe deeply in the concept of equal 
opportunity. The job of government is to ensure that everyone has 
an opportunity to start at the same starting line. That is where 
government has to be. However, if government does not have the 
fiscal capacity to do that because too much of what it spends 
services the debt it cannot do it.
<P>
	We have dealt with the very onerous fiscal problem we inherited 
from the former government. We have done it in a way that has 
attracted international attention, although it has not satisfied my 
friends across the way. That should not surprise anyone.
<P>
	I have debated with colleagues across the way from time to time 
in committee and in other places. I remember, going back to 1995, 
talking about the nature of some of the reductions the government 
undertook to deal with the deficit. We have had that discussion. We 
have heard a lot about it lately as members have come forward with 
proposals with regard to social spending.
<P>
	When given the opportunity to comment on the 1995 budget, 
members across the way and the Progressive Conservatives did not 
say that we cut too much. They did not say that it was wrong to cut 
transfers to the provinces. What they said was that we did not cut 
enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the member opposite from Fredericton and I have served 
on committees together. Particularly we served on the committee 
for human rights and persons with disabilities. That committee 
worked in a non-partisan way on many worthwhile subjects, one of 
which addressed the very real concerns of persons with disabilities.
<P>
	Persons with disabilities could be put into two separate groups. 
Although some persons with disabilities do not want to be put into 
two distinct groups, the fact remains  that there are two groups. 
There are those Canadians who through accident, through birth or 
through other circumstances find themselves in absolute need of 
society's help on a daily basis to have, as the member opposite 
mentioned, the potential of equality of opportunity. There are those 
who have become disabled over the course of their lives and whose 
disabilities are very real but have come about as the result of aging 
or living. That is the distinction between the two disabilities.
<P>
	When the Canada health and social transfer was first instituted 
persons with disabilities fell through the cracks. Most people 
acknowledge that happened.
<P>
	Has the government considered a specific program whereby 
persons disabled for life will be held harmless from the cost of their 
disability both through proactive financial support and through the 
removal of the catch 22 where disabled people, who make the extra 
valiant effort to be gainfully employed, find that they lose the very 
benefits allowed them to get employment in the first place? Has 
that been and will that be addressed?
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the member from Edmonton for his question. He is well 
informed in this debate.
<P>
	The task force concluded two specific recommendations. The 
first is that the role of the federal government should be to mitigate 
the cost of disability.
<P>
	If we cannot make a disability go away, surely as an enlightened 
society one of our objectives would be that they do not have, in 
addition to the real obstacle that is presented by a disability, the 
other costs that go with that disability, such as the cost of the 
wheelchair, the cost of adapted transportation and so on.
<P>
	Specifically, the medical services expense credit has been 
expanded to accommodate that. There is a list of items. There is the 
cost of an air conditioner if the person has conditions that require 
them to have air conditioning. It was dealt with.
<P>
	The second thing has to do with the catch-22 that the member 
referred to. Many Canadians with disabilities want to go to work 
but cannot because they recognize that the moment they go to work 
they lose access to a variety of programs, usually provincial, that 
they need by virtue of that disability.
<P>
	I refer to the changes in the limitations on the medical service 
and the disability tax credits that allow an increase in what might 
be covered under those credits.
<P>
	That in itself will go a long way not only in terms of allowing 
people who are currently unemployed to go to work but also to take 
away the need for many people who are working to stop working so 
that they can access these programs.
<P>
	It is a very real question put. It is a good question. The reality is 
that the budget spoke to it.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the fourth budget tabled in this House by the 
finance minister, on February 18.
<P>
	It is an election-minded budget because most of the cuts had 
already been announced in the three previous budgets. Once again, 
the main victims of that budget are the provinces, the middle class, 
the unemployed and the poor. The greatest tragedy, the biggest 
scandal in Canada, the major failure of this government is the 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	However, this budget does nothing in the area of job creation. 
The Liberals rely solely on market forces and on the private sector 
for job creation. Up until now, that strategy has been a total failure. 
Yet, during the 1993 election campaign, the Liberals did promise 
they would create jobs, jobs, jobs, as their famous slogan said.
<P>
	They did not meet that commitment, which was a determining 
factor in their victory. The Liberals have consistently reduced the 
access to and duration of UI benefits. Let me remind you that, when 
the Liberals came into office in 1993, only 33 per cent or a third of 
the unemployed did not receive benefits. Today, the figure is 55 per 
cent. It is appalling.
<P>
	To these restrictions, we must add the carelessness of the 
government and its failure to act when faced with multiple business 
shutdowns. On that point, I would like to draw your attention to one 
human tragedy that occurred in Montréal-Nord, in my riding of 
Bourassa; at the end of February, the Zellers distribution centre 
announced that it would close on July 1. Because of that closure, 
379 men and women will lose their jobs in my riding, which is 
already hard hit by unemployment and poverty.
<P>
	I have asked the federal ministers of industry and labour and the 
President of the Treasury Board, who is responsible for Quebec, to 
take the necessary measures to prevent that distribution centre from 
closing so that these workers may keep their jobs and their dignity.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	I hope that the federal government will act in good faith and 
co-operate on this issue. I hope also that the results of its action will 
demonstrate that it is truly trying to create jobs. Up to now, I have 
not had any response from the government on this.
<P>
	Since 1993, I have been the official opposition critic for 
Citizenship and Immigration. Therefore, I would like to make a 
few comments on that department. The budgetary needs for 
1997-98 have been set at $575 million, that is to say $40 million 
less than the previous year. The budget was reduced 6.5 per cent 
over last year, and the staff 20 per cent.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came back to power, the government has 
imposed unprecedented cuts on the  department. Several centres in 
Quebec and elsewhere were closed, and thousands of employees 
were let go, at a time where extra efforts are needed to integrate 
newcomers.
<P>
	Yet, with the creation of an immigration tax of $975 per person, 
and a $500 fee per application, plus the steep increase in other user 
fees, revenues have increased tremendously. They will reach$363 million for the current year and cover 63 per cent of 
expenditures. Previously the revenues amounted only to 54 per cent 
of expenditures.
<P>
	Despite budget cuts, the government will spend $3.4 million on 
the promotion of Canadian citizenship. This money will be used for 
advertising and propaganda campaigns to promote Canadian unity. 
If we add the tens of millions of dollars allocated to this same 
objective by the heritage department, it is clear that the government 
is making cuts in areas in which it should be investing, while 
wasting public funds on unnecessary things.
<P>
	Last November, I went to Taiwan as part as a parliamentary 
delegation. In Taipei, I met with the diplomats and immigration 
officers of the Canadian mission. I learned that, just from granting 
visitor's visas and charging fees to the Taiwanese who come to live 
in Canada, the government had collected more than $9 million in 
the last year. It must be pointed out that more than 100,000 
Taiwanese tourists came here in 1996. Yet, the mission only costs a 
third of that amount. At that rate, the citizenship and immigration 
department will be making profits in a few years, which is neither 
the role nor the objective of the government with regard to 
immigration.
<P>
	I would also like to deal with the issue of child poverty. One 
child out of five lives in poverty in Canada. Among industrialized 
nations, this country ranks second after the United States for child 
poverty. The Liberal government forgets that children are the 
future of the country. The budget does nothing to create jobs and 
unemployment means poverty. There are 1.5 million poor children 
in Canada. That is appalling.
<P>
	In the face of this disastrous situation, the government is only 
committed to injecting $600 million, which is clearly not enough. 
According to the Caledon Institute, there should be at least$2 billion more each year to really deal with poverty.
<P>
	As in the previous years, this budget has been praised by big 
business and the financial sector. However, it has been denounced 
and condemned by the labour movement and anti-poverty 
organizations.
<P>
	Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, has 
this to say: ``This budget is a cynical and political attempt by the 
federal Liberals to manipulate public opinion before the next 
election''. He adds: ``We were told that, if we reduced the deficit 
and focused on business, everything would fall into place. 
However, the  private sector itself has shown that it is unable to 
generate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9140"> 9140 </A></B>
<P>
the jobs that Canadians need, and the finance minister's cuts have 
only made the situation worse''.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	As for Bob White, the president of the CLC, he condemned the 
fact that the Liberals have cut $14 billion in social programs since 
1994. He said this: ``The only plan this government had with regard 
to job creation is to put blind and almost reverend trust in the 
markets to do the job''.
<P>
	In Quebec, similar criticisms were voiced by FTQ, CSN and 
CEQ leaders. FTQ president Clément Godbout deplored the lack of 
job creation initiatives, particularly ones encouraging the reduction 
of work time and the restructuring of work. He also condemned the 
cuts made in transfer payments, which hit Quebec real hard.
<P>
	I condemn this fourth budget of the Liberals because it does not 
give any hope to the 1.5 million Canadians and Quebecers who are 
jobless or to the 1.5 million who are employable but have given up 
looking for a job. It is a scandal to have 10 per cent unemployment 
in Canada, and more than 20 per cent in my riding of Bourassa. 
Even Chile, a developing country, has managed to bring 
unemployment down to 5 per cent, as in the U.S.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that 17 per cent of our young people do not 
have jobs, that the wages of millions of workers have been either 
frozen or cut back, that 5 million Canadians and Quebecers-a 
500,000 increase since the Liberals took office-live under the 
poverty line, that some businesses and some rich people do not pay 
taxes, that the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing. 
That is an immoral and outrageous situation the federal 
government should deal with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
this third day of debate on the budget, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues and to speak as the member for Trois-Rivières and critic 
for regional development.
<P>
	This government and its Minister of Finance in particular are 
constantly boasting about their good performance, but, on our side, 
we never stopped shedding a different light on the facts to remind 
the public that their fight against the deficit is not really aimed at 
putting our fiscal house in order, but is done on the backs of the 
unemployed, the most disadvantaged.
<P>
	We all know that, thanks to UI contributions paid by employees 
and employers, the unemployment fund has a huge surplus of some 
$5 billion that the Minister of Finance is using to reduce the deficit 
rather than speed up economic development. We this surplus, he 
could lower UI contributions for employers, and above all for 
workers, leaving more money in their pockets and thus increasing 
consumer spending.
<P>
	No, this would be too wonderful, too generous. The Minister of 
Finance prefers using other people's money  to improve his image 
just before the election, although this is not in the best interests of 
the public. He also did it at the expense of the provinces, as 
everyone knows, by recently cutting $4.5 billion in transfers to the 
provinces, not to mention, again, the $5 billion taken from the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	So, the government is boasting about an amount of $10 billion 
when, in fact, it got that money at the expense of others. This is 
absolutely shameful, and we will make it our duty to inform the 
public accordingly, including Quebecers, in the months to come.
<P>
	There was also no tax reform, even though the official 
opposition, through its members on the finance committee, 
provided a great deal of advice to the government in recent months. 
I am referring here to the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the hon. member for La Prairie, and the 
hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies who, with the help 
of advisers, did a job that was even noticed by the Minister of 
Finance, but ignored.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The government turned a deaf ear, even though these were very 
reasonable, not ``revolutionary'' proposals, including a suggestion 
to make sure the tax deferred by corporations is better managed. 
The business sector is well aware that some companies are making 
excessive use of that tax provision. Why not crack down harder on 
these companies, given what is being asked of the poor?
<P>
	No effort is being made either to ensure that the distribution of 
wealth is done more properly, and that those who are financially 
well-off make a greater contribution. And I do not mean the middle 
class, because it is all too easy to crack down on wage earners. I 
mean those who wield some financial clout. I mean those who can 
take advantage of tax havens, who can use several of them at the 
same time. These are the people we should be going after.
<P>
	Of course, I also want to mention those who have family trusts of 
a very high value. I am not talking about a family trust of $50,000 
or $100,000, but about the family trusts the auditor general 
mentioned last year: $1 billion in each one, and morevoer they 
were transferred to the United States.
<P>
	When are these issues ever raised, nowadays? When will the 
government make the rich pay, the really rich people, not the 
middle class, which is being strangled and which increasingly is 
working for nothing, a situation which has a destabilizing effect on 
the social fabric? We are more and more critical of each other, 
while forgetting in the process that the money is there somewhere. 
As far as I know, there is no warehouse facility in Canada, in 
Quebec or in the world, where money is being burned. Money is 
not being burned. If wealth is not being shared, then it is being 
concentrated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9141"> 9141 </A></B>
<P>
	In Quebec, in Canada, in the western world, we are witnessing 
an increasing and abusive concentration of wealth. If this trend 
is not corrected, we have every reason for being concerned about 
the future.
<P>
	There is a passage in the speech from the throne that particularly 
caught my attention; it is the second paragraph on page 12, and it is 
of special concern to the residents of the municipalities in my 
riding and of many communities, especially in Quebec. Some of 
my colleagues will no doubt feel concerned.
<P>
	The paragraph reads as follows: ``Therefore, we are announcing 
today that $10 million of funding in each of the next three years 
will be devoted to significantly increase the number of 
communities across Canada that have the electronic infrastructure 
required to access the communications technologies of the future. 
As a result of this program, virtually every community in Canada 
between 400 and 50,000 in population will be connected over the 
next four years-5,000 communities in all.''
<P>
	That is all very nice, but you have to know how much this is out 
of touch with reality as far as daily communications by telephone 
are concerned. You have to know that in my riding, in the new part 
of my riding adjacent to Louiseville, Saint-Léon-le-Grand and 
Maskinongé, as in many other small communities of Quebec-I 
got to understand that these last weeks-we have telephone service 
that cannot be called anything but rotten.
<P>
	We are still living in the stone age as far as communications are 
concerned. In the Saint-Léon-le-Grand area and in some 
communities in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister's 
riding, four subscribers still share a single line. Four people on the 
same line, and we keep talking about the electronic infrastructure 
across Canada. We have satellites and we still cannot even have fax 
machines at home. This is a far cry from the optic fibre era. We 
have four people on the same line. Some businesses are also on a 
party line of four. They cannot get personal calls because there is 
no confidentiality whatsoever.
<P>
	Apparently, there are senior citizens homes with 10, 20, or 30 
people using a single party line shared by four customers. There is 
no confidentiality, and it is impossible to make emergency phone 
calls. These people need to be able to call the police or the 
ambulance. This is not in the far north, but in an area between 
Montreal and Quebec City, right in the middle of the province.
<P>
	I hear more and more that even in the Montreal area, this kind of 
problem occurs, just like in smaller towns. It is about time the 
government called the CRTC to order, and that the CRTC called to 
order big companies like Bell Canada, to make sure the public in 
Canada and Quebec gets some respect, to make sure taxpayers and 
subscribers get the kind of respect they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	There is something weird here. We keep talking about the optic 
fibre networks, of globalization of markets, free trade and high 
technology-and technology kills jobs-and we cannot even make 
a simple phone call in decent conditions. This is unacceptable. We 
at least need the means to spread the bad news. In an area between 
Montreal and Quebec City, we still have party lines of four. It 
makes no sense whatsoever. These people sometimes need to call 
the ambulance. I would like to pay tribute here to the head of the 
Maskinongé RCM, Jocelyne Elliott Leblanc, the mayor of 
Louiseville, who has done a remarkable job.
<P>
	The issue has been brought to the attention of the Office of the 
Prime Minister, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice. He better deal 
with the problems faced by the residents of these new 
municipalities still living in the Stone Age, because his 
government sanctions the CRTC, which establishes standards fit 
for large corporations, including Bell Canada, and where 
navel-gazing is a favourite pastime, except for those who do not 
have access to adequate phone services.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has better take care of this. The ball is in his 
court and we will be waiting for him just around the corner in a few 
weeks or a few months because, if he is unable to deal with such 
issues-he was unable to settle other similar issues, as we 
know-the people of Saint-Paulin and others in that region who are 
faced with such enormous problems will let him know.
<P>
	In some cases, Bell Canada's solution was to suggest that people 
buy cellular phones. There are no phone services in that area, and I 
am not talking about the far north, as I said, but about a region 
located between Montreal and Quebec City, one hour from 
Montreal and one hour and a quarter or one hour and a half from 
Quebec City.
<P>
	It does not make sense; it is unacceptable. The government is 
bragging, something the Minister of Finance is quite good at. They 
are bragging about the information highway. But we will talk about 
that again during the election campaign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a question for my 
colleague who has just delivered a very passionate speech. At the 
end of his speech he talked about communications. Certainly 
nothing is more important than communications. He talked about 
communications between Montreal and Quebec. He talked about 
telephone lines. In my riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington, which encircles Kingston, we had those challenges. 
We have locations where telephones are barely available.
<P>
	Would my colleague not consider that if his provincial 
government and his party, which I understand still has  the status of 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9142"> 9142 </A></B>
<P>
opposition, the loyal, royal blue roots opposition here today, were 
to work together with us, we could make greater progress?
<P>
	I have many friends and colleagues in Quebec. They want the 
same thing for their families that people want in my riding. They 
want to ensure the future, the health and the concern for jobs. It is 
time we speak for what we believe in and that we work together. 
This is reflected in value of real estate today. It is shameful what 
has happened in Quebec City to the very fine wonderful people 
there, what has happened to the value of real estate since the first 
day of 1997.
<P>
	It is time to start to concentrate on working together instead of 
putting up this smokescreen to appease a few people who have a lot 
of money. I ask the member to represent all of his constituents.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
for his question. I think that the main characteristic of the official 
opposition since we were elected to the House in 1993, the first 
session starting in 1994, is indeed a spirit of co-operation, which 
was reflected in documents published during the October 1995 
referendum, in which we spoke of partnership.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	What we sovereignists ask for is mutual respect. This is 
something we as the official opposition can achieve here.
<P>
	I spoke earlier of the work done by my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who is our finance critic. It must be a rare 
occurrence in Canadian history when the opposition proposes very 
articulate and well-documented suggestions on corporate and 
personal income tax. We suggested ways for the government to 
improve the tax system. This is a good example of partnership and 
respect.
<P>
	We are not here to destroy any country but to build one: Quebec. 
It is our country, our homeland, and we want to work in a respectful 
partnership, on an equal footing with our closest neighbour, with 
whom we have an indisputable historic relationship.
<P>
	We are a people, just as Canadians are a people. So why not work 
together in an honourable and civilized way? Both our societies are 
civilized. So why are there such antagonistic feelings, especially in 
the Canadian press? Why not recognize that Quebec is profoundly 
distinct? Why not be pleased that this people will soon become 
sovereign? We would work together, not one against the other. 
Quebec's current economic problems should not be a cause for 
celebration.
<P>
	Montreal is going through a very difficult period. Let us hope 
that this is not the result of a concerted effort. Let us hope that this 
will not lead some people to pat themselves on the back. The worse 
the situation is in Quebec, the more people will be scared and thus 
tempted  to vote no; let us hope this is not a strategy. Let us hope 
that this is only a coincidence and that the Canadian government 
will put Quebec's money back into Quebec's economy, especially 
for R and D and the purchase of goods and services. We know that 
Quebec has historically been treated like an underdog by the 
Canadian government. Let us hope that the situation will get back 
to normal as soon as possible and that we will be able to work 
closely together as two peoples and two civilized nations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the 
hon. distinguished member for Burin-St. George's.
<P>
	It is a distinct pleasure for me to participate in this debate with 
regard to this budget. I would like to congratulate the government, 
the Minister of Finance and of course the whole Liberal caucus. I 
want to single out the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, the hon. member for St. Paul's, who is my seatmate. He 
has done a tremendous amount of work in the preparation of this 
budget and of course lining up the debate which is going on the 
House right now. I congratulate him. I am sorry that he has decided 
not to run in the next election and I wish him well as he goes down 
the road and continues his work as a great Canadian.
<P>
	Our teamwork has resulted in a budget that will benefit not only 
the people of my riding of Hillsborough but all Canadians. Since 
the minister made his speech we have heard a lot of commentary. 
Some special interest groups say it is not enough, other groups say 
that it is too much but, more important, we have heard from a few 
Canadians who, I believe, represent most of the people who say it is 
just right.
<P>
	I am one of those people. I am one of the many in this House and 
I am one of the millions of Canadians across the country who agree 
that the government as a whole has done the right thing. I agree 
with the budget approach, the extent of the measures and I agree 
with the timing of these measures. I would like to elaborate by 
explaining why my opinions are so positive toward this budget.
<P>
	When we entered office in the fall of 1993 the federal 
government was deep in debt and it was falling ever deeper very 
rapidly. After just four budgets we can now see the light at the end 
of the tunnel. The deficit has been reduced by over half, a reduction 
of $23 billion, and if we look at the cumulative effect of those cuts 
we have lowered the net debt by $89 billion from what it otherwise 
would have been. For this we and all Canadians have been 
rewarded by the financial markets with lower interest rates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9143"> 9143 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard many calls for cuts to payroll taxes, income 
taxes, sales taxes and every other tax that has been the flavour 
of the day. I would like to provide my hon. colleagues in the House 
examples of what our actions have meant to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	First, let us assume that you, Madam Speaker, have a $100,000 
mortgage which is to be amortized over 25 years. If we compare 
the rates that were available in January 1995 and the rates available 
right now, by refinancing you could save roughly $230 a month on 
a five-year mortgage. Instead, if you took a one-year mortgage you 
could save over $300 a month. That is a lot of money.
<P>
	But there is more. Let us assume that a small business person 
started a business and took out a $1 million loan amortized over 10 
years. If we compare the interest rates that were available in April 
1995 with the interests rates that are available now, by refinancing 
that loan, that person could save $33,000 annually.
<P>
	If I went out tomorrow to buy a car and I borrowed $15,000 and 
amortized it over four years I would save $480 a year because of 
the lower interest rates.
<P>
	These examples are not fiction. These are examples in the real 
lives of real Canadians. I have people in my riding, as I am sure in 
other ridings as well, who will save thousands of dollars because of 
our actions which have resulted in these lower interest rates.
<P>
	To make my point even clearer, perhaps we should compare a cut 
in payroll deductions with one of the examples I have just given. 
What would happen if a payroll deduction was cut 25 cents per 
$100 in earnings? We have heard calls for this in the House and 
across the country. The Canadian who makes $39,000 a year would 
save, now hold on to your hats, a whopping $97.50 per year, not per 
month but per year. What is more, this meagre cut would cost the 
government $1.8 billion. Lower interest rates save money, not cost 
the government money.
<P>
	Given the choice of a payroll deduction cut of $100 a year or 
interest savings of $480 on a consumer loan or $2,000 to $3,000 on 
a mortgage, what would members choose? I know what I would 
choose and let me tell the House it would be worth more than $100.
<P>
	I would like to put the budget into perspective. The deficit is still 
falling. We are doing well on that front, so well in fact that the 
government was able to invest in health care as recommended by 
the National Forum on Health. It was able to invest in education by 
assisting students and their parents. It was able to relieve some of 
the burden on low income Canadians, and it was able to provide 
assistance to Canadians with disabilities as suggested by the 
federal task force on disability issues.
<P>
	All this goes hand in hand with recent announcements and other 
budget items such as the funding for the extension to the 
community action plan for children and the Canadian prenatal 
nutrition plan. I applaud these extensions. I and my constituents are 
happy to see these important programs being maintained.
<P>
	The government chose the right path. It chose a balanced 
approach by staying the course while providing some relief to 
Canadians. It has been a hard fight for everybody, but we must 
continue to reduce the deficit if we are ever going to be able to 
achieve our goals.
<P>
	One of our primary goals is job creation. A lot of attention has 
been given to small business. Yet again, there are initiatives in the 
budget that benefit small business.
<P>
	The Canadian Tourism Commission is a partnership of both the 
private and public sectors which designs and implements effective 
marketing strategies and programs to increase tourism revenues in 
Canada. The commission also provides services to the tourism 
industry to help it remain internationally competitive.
<P>
	Tourism is a large part of the local economy in my riding, indeed 
in my province. The increase in funding to the CTC will boost the 
promotion abroad of Canada and thus boost our tourist industry on 
Prince Edward Island. This is particularly important to us now that 
the Confederation Bridge is opening in just a couple of months. 
Islanders are expecting a million tourists this year. This is a jump 
of some 200,000 tourists over last year, the largest factor for the 
increase of course is the bridge. This is twofold.
<P>
	First the bridge will alleviate many of the travel problems 
associated with the ferry service. Second, the bridge is more than 
just mode of transportation. The bridge itself will be a tourist 
attraction because Confederation Bridge is the largest of its kind. 
When it was built a special crane had to be brought in, a 9,000 ton 
crane, to install the 8,200 ton girders. In fact, tours were given 
throughout construction just to see this operation.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Another boost to the tourism industry is the additional funding to 
the Business Development Bank of Canada. The $50 million will 
translate into $250 million in loans to small business and tourism. 
This means more opportunities for Islanders and for all Canadians. 
This increase in tourism will not only enhance the peak summer 
season in Prince Edward Island and Atlantic Canada, but it will 
also strengthen the shoulder season periods of spring and fall.
<P>
	This will mean jobs. More help will be needed during the peak 
season and the shoulder seasons and that will mean more hours. In 
short, more people will stay on the job longer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9144"> 9144 </A></B>
<P>
	Boosting the tourism industry is good but what Islanders also 
need are full time, year round jobs. To assist in that area, the 
government is investing upfront $800 million in the new Canada 
Foundation for Innovation. This foundation will help strengthen 
the research and development infrastructure at universities, 
colleges, research hospitals and not for profit research institutions 
and organizations in the area of health, environment, science and 
engineering.
<P>
	I have both a university and a college in my riding. These two 
institutions are eligible for financial support from the foundation to 
modernize their research infrastructure. The foundation will be an 
arm's length organization. It will seek partnerships to support these 
investments. Together with their partners, it will be able to fund up 
to $2 billion in infrastructure improvements.
<P>
	I am sure that all hon. members are interested to hear what the 
president of the University of Prince Edward Island had to say 
about the foundation. Dr. Elizabeth Epperly said: ``It sounds 
wonderful and you can be certain that we will take advantage of 
it''. Those are words of encouragement from a key player in the 
field.
<P>
	In fact, innovation is becoming increasingly important for 
international competitiveness and that is even more important in an 
open country like Canada. In light of this, the government 
continues to make every effort to improve competitiveness.
<P>
	I am pleased with the budget. I know Canadians are pleased with 
it. It shows that the hard work that we have done over the last three 
years is paying off. I encourage all people in this House to support 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with quite a lot of interest to the member's speech. At the 
very end of his speech he said that Canadians support the budget.
<P>
	I would just like to ask him a question based on a letter that I 
have received from one of my constituents dated February 11 with 
respect to the budget. My constituent says: ``Last October I was 
lucky enough to receive a $300 per month raise in pay. My wife and 
I consider ourselves fortunate and looked forward to being able to 
remodel our kitchen in the new year. When my end of January pay 
arrived, there did not seem to be any extra money available. Closer 
examination reveals that from my original $300 raise, $162.60 
went to increased income tax and $129.96 went to increased CPP 
and UI deductions which left $7.44 on my cheque''. When that was 
combined with some additional increases in natural gas and so on, 
he calculates that he is actually $14.56 worse off in January 1997 
than he was in January 1996.
<P>
	At the end of the letter he says: ``I do hope that you have enjoyed 
using the extra $1,951.20 of income tax that my raise produced in 
your budget this year''.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member whether he thinks it is productive 
that the tax creep that has been encouraged  by the government's 
actions has actually created a situation where people are worse off a 
year later than they were in 1996. Why is he so proud of his budget 
when all it has produced is more hardship for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
North Vancouver for his question.
<P>
	Obviously the individual he is talking about is in a very high tax 
bracket. As I said throughout my speech, as a result of this budget 
people are better off today than they were four years ago. I say that 
without any fear of contradiction. We have lowered the payments 
to unemployment insurance. We have done all these things. We 
have lowered interest rates. People have more money after they pay 
on their mortgages and their loans. Things are much better.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The government could give an across the board tax cut, but this 
is not the time to do it. The government does not think it is the time 
to do it. However, eventually the time will come. If we give an 
across the board tax decrease right now, then the deficit would go 
up. We cannot afford to do that. We have to get our financial House 
in order. When that day comes we will certainly have even a better 
budget than we have today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague is pleased with the budget and the success in the battle 
against the deficit. However, he does not say a word about child 
poverty, a serious issue in Canada and Quebec nowadays.
<P>
	There are 1.5 million children who live in poverty in this 
country, and the government has no real intention of solving this 
problem. The government has set targets in its battle against the 
deficit and it has met them, but it has not set any objectives in 
dealing with the very serious problem of child poverty.
<P>
	I would like the member to explain to us why the government is 
investing only $600 million in the fight against child poverty, while 
various anti-poverty organizations tell us that it must immediately 
invest at least $2 billion in concrete measures in order to address 
this problem.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Bourassa for his question. No doubt it could be said that nothing is 
ever enough.
<P>
	We put $600 million in the budget to fight child poverty. 
Probably it is not enough but it is all we could do this time. A lot of 
poor children belong to families where there are single parents. 
This is a terrible tragedy of our society. We have to make things 
better for these people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9145"> 9145 </A></B>
<P>
	If the hon. member goes through the budget and sees the 
programs in it, the money that has been put in there, probably it 
is not enough. However, it is a lot better than it was last year.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I too want to rise and voice my support for the measures in 
the budget brought down just over a month ago. The would-be 
minister from Calgary Centre draws attention to his presence here.
<P>
	I say to my good friend from Calgary Centre, I have a lot of 
choice on this one. It is my choice to support this budget. If he will 
give me a chance, being the gentle man that he is, I will tell the 
House in the few minutes I have some reasons why I support the 
budget.
<P>
	The first was alluded to by my good friend from Bourassa just a 
moment ago, the issue of child poverty. As my friend from 
Hillsborough said, not enough is being done. However, we are 
making some progress. Some money has been put into this 
important initiative. I happen to believe, as a Canadian and as a 
Newfoundlander, that it is an absolute disgrace that so many people 
are living in poverty in this, the best country in the world.
<P>
	Obviously, we have done some things very wrong over the past 
few years so that we should have that situation still applying. We 
have to address that one. It has to be a priority for Canadians of all 
political stripes because poverty, which you rather take for granted 
in third world countries, is right under our noses. People have to 
ask why we cannot do more to alleviate that situation, to get rid of 
it sooner rather than later.
<P>
	I salute the Minister of Finance because he has made some 
progress in this area through the child tax credit. It is a step in the 
right direction in addressing the problem of child poverty.
<P>
	The budget this year, which proposes to increase spending on 
children, will increase from $5.1 billion to $6 billion by July 1998. 
That is some progress but dollars do not say it all. The reward will 
be in the benefit that these dollars achieve over time. Also in the 
budget there is new emphasis on young people not only in terms of 
increased funding for summer jobs but in terms of addressing some 
of the problems they face with funding for university. We have an 
improved system of student loans and education credits to ensure 
fuller access to a good education by all young Canadians from 
coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	I like the emphasis in the budget on the assistance for disabled 
people, including broadened tax relief for medical expenses. It is 
something that I have been fighting for for a long time, I and many 
others in this House, and I am glad to see that the government is 
moving in that direction.
<P>
	I was also pleased with the emphasis on health care in this 
budget and the new initiatives that the government proposes to 
take, in particular in the area of nutrition for example.
<P>
	If we reflect on the time we have been here since November 
1993, three and a half years, things in financial terms, in fiscal 
terms were quite different and a lot bleaker at that time than they 
are right now. This government, through the leadership of the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, has restored some 
sanity to the public finance system. We all know the statistics on 
how we have brought down the deficit by so much over such a short 
period of time. I will not bore members with those stats again.
<P>
	Let us always keep in mind that government finally is not about 
managing money, as important as that is. That is the means to the 
end. If we do not manage our money right, we cannot do these 
things in terms of social programs and job creation that we are 
dedicated and committed to doing. We have to keep our eye on the 
ball. While managing money is an important step it is not the end in 
itself. It is just the means to the end. The end itself has to be, must 
be at all times, people. We have to see that people are better served.
<P>
	People who are unemployed are not very well served. It is 
difficult to appreciate the importance of deficit reduction or many 
other things that are touted in this budget if one does not have a job. 
In my own riding, in my own province the unemployment rates is 
still unacceptably high. I salute the job creation initiatives in this 
budget. I believe we are generally going about it in the right way 
because I am a free enterpriser. I believe that government does not 
create jobs. It is the private enterprise sector that creates the jobs 
and small business that creates jobs. There are measures in this 
budget including lowering employment insurance premiums which 
make it more attractive for small business to create jobs.
<P>
	We have had to be patient. It is hard to be patient if one does not 
have a pay cheque to put the groceries on the table. I believe that 
the effect of the kind of budgetary measures that we have had over 
the last three or four years, together with the one right now before 
us, the cumulative effect of that will be to increase more jobs out 
there.
<P>
	Already the record of this government is that it has increased 
700,000 jobs. The projection is that we will see another 300,000 or 
so in this year.
<P>
	We are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have 
great concerns for those people who do not have jobs. We have to 
see that more is done by government in terms of leadership, in 
terms of the incentives we provide to bring down the unemploy-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9146"> 9146 </A></B>
<P>
ment rate. In my own situation in Burin-St. Georges and in 
Newfoundland generally, we have over the past three or  four years 
been devastated by a terrible downturn in the fishery.
<P>
	There too we are beginning to see a bit of light at the end of the 
tunnel. I do not want to anticipate my friend, the minister of 
fisheries, but I am hoping that he will accept the recommendations 
of his advisory council and reopen the fishery at least in a limited 
way on the south coast, 3PS, 3PN, 4S and so on, that area that 
recommendations apply to. I hope we will see a reopened fishery.
<P>
	Those people who are on TAGS, those people who are on 
government assistance, are not there because they want to be there. 
They would rather be working. Speaking of those people, we are 
still leading the charge on the issue of labour force attachment.
<P>
	These people through no fault of their own were prevented from 
working by a government initiated endeavour. They were barred 
from working. The government mandated that shutdown. Through 
no fault of their own they now find themselves being treated as new 
entrants. That is unconscionable. It has to change. These people 
were not told upfront that might happen to them. Indeed it was not 
going to happen to them. If we had been able to stick with the 
original objectives in that program, where all would be trained, that 
would not have happened. That circumstance of no labour force 
attachment would not have applied. It applies today because in 
midstream, because of increased numbers coming into the 
program, the government had to change the rules and deprive 
people who would normally have had some training opportunities 
because of a limited budget.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	For those reasons, that they did not know upfront and that the 
rules were changed in the middle of the game, these people, in all 
conscience, have to be given labour force attachment.
<P>
	I have addressed that issue on every forum I have been able to. I 
have talked to the Prime Minister and the minister. I have raised it 
in caucus and I have raised it on the floor of the House on several 
occasions. We have to continue to punch away at it until we beat 
some sense into the heads of the people who matter on that issue. It 
is an important issue. It affects about 15,000 people in Atlantic 
Canada and Quebec, the five eastern most provinces. We have to do 
the fair thing when it comes to that issue.
<P>
	Government is also about fairness. People out there have 
difficulty identifying with the positive things that may be in a 
budget or in a government initiative if they see something like the 
TAGS issue which has become a symbol of basic unfairness.
<P>
	There is no good reason for it, certainly not a monetary reason. 
What we are talking about would cost $30 million to $60 million 
over time. That is not a lot of  money in the greater government 
context. It is money which would be well spent.
<P>
	Let me recap my remarks, as my time has expired. I support with 
a heart and a half this budget. I invite my friend from Calgary 
Centre to do likewise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the speech by the member across the way, and I would 
like to ask him two questions.
<P>
	Does the member agree that the finance minister is giving 
himself room to manoeuvre by hiding up his sleeve, according to 
Bloc Quebecois estimates, $8 billion this year and $14 billion next 
year?
<P>
	Would the member agree that these sums of $8 billion and $14 
billion should be used to restore the levels of transfer payments to 
the provinces? And this is particularly important since the member 
comes from a maritime province which greatly needs its transfer 
payments, which were cut by the finance minister. Moreover, 
instead of keeping these large amounts as a reserve, the minister 
could reinject them into the economy in order to help 
unemployment insurance claimants recover their former benefits.
<P>
	Is the member ready to support the Bloc Quebecois in its efforts 
to have the reserves hidden by the minister used to restore transfer 
payments that have been cut from the provinces, and the money 
taken from the unemployed, since it is their money after all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from La 
Prairie for his question. However, I must have missed the preamble 
to his question because I did not fully understand what the 
conspiracy was. He said that the Minister of Finance is hiding some 
$8 billion. Could he be a little more specific. I will attempt a 
response.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Madam Speaker, I will rephrase my question. 
According to the calculations made by the Bloc Quebecois, the 
minister could have lowered the deficit a lot more this year. It is 
said to be around $17 billion, but according to the latest trends, the 
real figure, which will be known in the next few weeks, could very 
well be around $10 or $12 billion. In the next few years, probably 
by 1999 or by 2000 at the latest, the Canadian deficit will have been 
eliminated.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois calculated that, by announcing a $17 billion 
deficit for this year, the Minister of Finance has kept $8 billion up 
his sleeve for this year and probably $14 billion for next year.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Could all the billions the minister is keeping in his pocket be 
given back to the unemployed who have been robbed by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9147"> 9147 </A></B>
<P>
government's employment insurance  scheme? Instead of hiding all 
those billions to bring the deficit down to zero as fast as possible, 
would it not be better for the government to give back the$4.5 billion cut in transfer payments to the provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, one of the things we whisper on 
our side is that the Minister of Finance is really a closet 
conservative. Certainly on fiscal matters it is well known that he is 
a conservative. If we look at his record of budget making over the 
last three or four years, we will notice that on the matter of 
projections about employment levels, deficit levels and so on, he 
has always been a bit cautious.
<P>
	What my friend from La Prairie characterizes as hiding I would 
put in another context altogether. I would submit that the Minister 
of Finance is being true to form here in that while he has projected 
a deficit of $17 billion, I am sure, as the member suggests, that the 
Minister of Finance is hopeful it will come in below $17 billion. I 
would not subscribe to the suggestion that somehow he has been 
duplicitous and is somehow hiding a lot of money. He is just being 
himself and is being a bit conservative.
<P>
	Let us hope the member for La Prairie is right that the deficit is 
even lower than the $17 billion projected so conservatively by my 
friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	It is with some disappointment that I get up today to speak on 
this fourth Liberal budget. It is a good time to reflect on the fact 
that it is the fourth budget. In my view it is the second really do 
nothing budget of the four. I say that because the first budget 
introduced by the finance minister was a stand pat, do nothing 
budget. It was not until his second budget that the government 
acknowledged the seriousness of this country's deficit and debt. He 
did start to make some moves to deal with that serious problem. 
But in the second and third budgets he did too little. It was too 
little, too late. Of course, this fourth budget is an election budget. It 
is stand pat, status quo which has serious consequences on the 
country as a whole.
<P>
	This fourth budget gives absolutely no hope to those who are 
unemployed. Despite the election promise of jobs, jobs, jobs, the 
same number of Canadians are now looking for work as when the 
government was elected. There are about 1.4 million Canadians 
who are still looking for jobs. There are about two million to three 
million underemployed Canadians. About one in four Canadians is 
employed but is worried about their ability to hold on to their job. 
There is tragedy among our young people with a youth 
unemployment rate of 16 per cent. This is an extremely serious 
issue which the government has failed to address in its budget. We 
have  had 76 months of straight unemployment in excess of 9 per 
cent. That is the worst record since the depression.
<P>
	There was no hope in this budget for the crushing tax burden that 
is faced by all Canadians, be they consumers or part of the business 
community. It is unbelievable that after four budgets we still have 
no commitment to a balanced budget. The finance minister says 
that we are heading in that direction but there is no firm 
commitment, no timeframe, no date set to indicate when we will 
have the books in balance.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The budget says to a lot of Canadians that they are reluctant to 
slay the monster they created. They want to keep that avenue open. 
There are those in government who are saying the era of cuts is 
over and they can now start spending again when we are 
approaching $620 billion of debt.
<P>
	In the budget tax revenues will be up $4 billion. They will be $24 
billion higher than when the government took office in 1993. When 
the finance minister talks about his war on the deficit and we take a 
look at how he has achieved the reductions in the deficit, 71 per 
cent of those reductions have been accomplished through increased 
revenues and only 29 per cent have been achieved by expenditure 
reductions. There is much more that could be done and much more 
that should be done.
<P>
	Those expenditure reductions have been mainly reductions to the 
provinces in transfer payments. There has been $7 billion in cuts to 
health care and education in our social programs by a government 
that gets up day after day and talks about being the defenders of 
health care.
<P>
	Since the government was elected in 1993 it has introduced 35 
tax increases. Just before the budget was presented the 36th 
increase was introduced. It is indeed a killer. It is a $10 billion tax 
grab under the increases in the CPP.
<P>
	The finance minister argues that it is not payroll tax, that it is an 
investment. However when it is compulsory out of payroll, from 
the taxpayers' pockets to the government's pocket, that is a tax. 
When the government sets the rate that is a tax. I would like to see 
anyone in government defend what the finance minister is saying to 
young Canadians, that this is an investment. Young Canadians are 
struggling to make ends meet. They are not looking for an 
investment. They are looking for some tax relief so they can keep 
their heads above the water and pay the debts that are mounting.
<P>
	Earlier finance minister acknowledged that payroll taxes were a 
cancer on job creation. Apparently he has changed his mind on that, 
but members on this side have not changed their minds. Payroll 
taxes are a cancer on job creation. As a matter of fact the finance 
department issued a report recently on the number of jobs that were 
lost on the modest increases in CPP between 1986 and  1993. About 
half of what is being proposed this time cost Canadians 26,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9148"> 9148 </A></B>
<P>
jobs. This will create a loss of jobs but the government has yet to 
acknowledge how many.
<P>
	The debt will be about $620 billion by the end of 1997-98. That 
is our collective shame and our challenge. The government says we 
are acknowledged as the number one country by the United 
Nations. We are the number one country in the world. I will not 
dispute that but I will take exception to the fact that we have more 
mortgaged our children's future to achieve that number one status. 
We have not paid our way. That should be our shame.
<P>
	Since the government was elected it added $111 billion to the 
debt. The finance minister has gone on about reducing the deficit 
from 5 per cent to 4 per cent and 3 per cent of GDP. He has not 
mentioned the fact that we have seen the debt go from $500 billion 
to over $600 billion. The additional $111 billion the Liberals have 
added represents about $8 billion in additional interest servicing 
costs, approaching a total federal interest bill of $49 billion or35 per cent of revenue. That is more than the government is 
spending on pensions, employment insurance, health education and 
social programs.
<P>
	When dealing with those kinds of numbers a 1 per cent increase 
in interest rates could add potentially $4 billion to our debt 
servicing costs. Yet I hear the government cheer the fact that the 
finance minister is talking about only overspending by no greater 
than $19 billion. I find that no cause for cheering. We are still 
living beyond our means. Our debt to GDP ratio is the second 
highest in the G-7.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	European countries that want to join in the common currency 
must be below the 60 per cent target of debt to GDP. Ours is 
currently much higher than that at about 74 per cent.
<P>
	What is lacking in the budget and in government's thinking is 
vision. There is no plan. I read in the paper the Prime Minister has 
now realized how important vision is. It is encouraging that he is to 
start getting a vision for the country. There has to be a better way 
than 76 months of straight unemployment over 9 per cent.
<P>
	All we have heard from the government-and we heard it today 
and we will continue to hear it-is that its only jobs strategy is 
lower interest rates. This will create employment. Lower interest 
rates are something the government does not have full control over. 
They are very volatile.
<P>
	The government encourages borrowing when it should be doing 
just the opposite. It should be encouraging Canadians to save and to 
pay their way.
<P>
	Let us look at the climate for lower interest rates in Canada 
today. On Saturday the <I>Globe and Mail</I> published an article about 
record consumer bankruptcies.
<P>
	I wanted to get into the better way, the Reform way, but I see my 
time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
his statement the member challenged anybody to convince him 
otherwise that the CPP increases were not a tax or that Canada 
pension plan premiums were not a tax.
<P>
	Let me put on the table a couple of facts on the record for the 
member. He will know that today's pensioners, those people 
collecting CPP today who have contributed the maximum 
throughout their careers, are receiving $8 for every $1 for they 
contributed. That amount tends to indicate that it is not a 
sustainable situation. When there are five working Canadians for 
every one retiree it is sustainable, but when the ratio decreases to 
three to one something has to be done. That is why the changes 
were made.
<P>
	As an aside, the member will know that the increases proposed 
by the government are 9.9 per cent whereas his party is 
recommending something like 13.5 per cent. If it is a tax in the 
member's view, why is it that the collection of Canada pension plan 
premiums does not go into government revenue and therefore 
reduce the deficit?
<P>
	When employers pay a little more CPP they have a higher 
deduction, lower income and thus pay lower corporate tax. The 
corporations have to pay the additional amount. All other things 
remaining equal their corporate taxes are going down. In fact the 
deficit will increase further.
<P>
	When individuals have to pay additional CPP premiums from 
their paycheques it reduces the amount of income tax they pay and 
government revenue goes down further. No matter how we look at 
it government revenue is going down and the deficit is increasing 
as a result of the increase in the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Does the member not agree that the increase in Canada pension 
plan premiums increases the deficit of the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
member for his question. I do not know from where he got the 
statement that revenues were going down. When I looked the 
budget over that escaped me completely. Government revenues 
have gone up. It is right there and it is indisputable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> CPP does not increase revenues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> I know that. It is outside the 
budget but it is a payroll tax. The member said that it was not a tax. 
When the government takes out of employees' pockets and it is 
compulsory, I challenge any member to debate with working 
Canadians that it is an investment and not a tax. They are not 
looking for an  investment. They are looking for a tax reduction. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9149"> 9149 </A></B>
<P>
is a payroll tax. The finance department has said it is a payroll tax. 
The member's play on words will not fool Canadians. Regardless 
of how it tries to fudge the issue it is a reduction in the take home 
pay of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The corporations are telling the government to reduce payroll 
taxes to help them create jobs. The government is talking to the 
corporations but is not listening to them. They are asking the 
government to do exactly opposite to what it is doing if it is serious 
about creating jobs in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks of the member for 
Simcoe Centre. The notion of comprehensive tax reform is an area 
on which the House should be engaged in full debate in a very 
active way.
<P>
	I am totally opposed to the member's obsession with deficit and 
debt. We took a position in the House of Commons four years ago 
that we would get the fiscal framework of the country in order and 
that if we did so private sector industry would pick up the slack. We 
would create an environment so that all these people could 
somehow create jobs. The fact of the matter is that industry has not 
done that. It has not come to the party.
<P>
	What does the member believe we have to do in the House to get 
industry active in the game of job creation?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will allow 
about 30 seconds for the hon. member to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, 30 seconds. It 
will be a short response from a short member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> I am the short member in this 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Industry is not reacting because 
industry is looking for the government to get its fiscal house in 
order. Industry is looking for the government to make a 
commitment to a balanced budget and the government has not done 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak on the budget somewhat after the fact. The 
budget has kind of come and gone like the proverbial wind in a 
barnyard, but it is still with us today in debate. It will be with us in 
the upcoming election whether it is this spring or next fall.
<P>
	It is good to talk about budgetary items since budgetary items 
will affect every department and all Canadians because they are 
footing the bill for the budgetary priorities of the government.
<P>
	In the wake of the budget many people are asking why they do 
not feel so good if this is a feel good budget. Where are the 
benefits? What will the government do to address that we now have 
over 9 per cent unemployment for 77 consecutive months? The 1.5 
million unemployed  that shocked the Liberals when they were in 
opposition is the same 1.5 million unemployed of today. Many 
people do not see the benefits.
<P>
	People are also saying they are not sure the government's 
priorities on spending are where they should be. When I talk to 
people they say the government's priorities should be a good health 
care system and a pension system that is supportable and gives the 
benefits needed. They see the federal government has cut health 
care and education funding to the provinces by 39 per cent since it 
came into power. They see hospitals closing. They do not see a lot 
of benefit for them.
<P>
	They also see the government raising CPP premiums by 73 per 
cent. Private contractors will pay $3,270 per year in CPP 
contributions if they are their own boss. They must pay their entire 
working lives almost $3,300 per year all for less than a $9,000 per 
year pension. This is quite a contrast to the MP pension plan that 
the government has schemed to maintain. It will pay the equivalent 
of millions of dollars to some members of Parliament for a 
relatively few years of work.
<P>
	There is no plan for tax relief in the budget. That is a shame for 
individuals who have seen their net income drop by some $3,000 a 
year since the government took office.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	It is also a shame because private industry does not see why or 
how it is going to be able to afford to hire more people. Payroll 
taxes continue to go up. The general taxation level is staying too 
high and the federal government does not seem to be listening to 
businesses.
<P>
	Provincial governments, for example the Alberta government, 
have asked the federal government to have a look to see what lower 
tax rates and the lowest tax rates in the country mean the most job 
creation. It is a direct correlation. Why does the federal 
government not see that?
<P>
	All this comes in the context of the Liberals now doing their 
spinning as much as possible to try to create the impression that the 
Prime Minister is a man with vision, that he can see into the future, 
that he is able to see what we need and where we are going.
<P>
	I do not know whether Canadians believe that. Certainly none of 
what the federal government has done to date budget-wise was 
visionary, especially its own red book promises. It is now rather 
waffling in the area of, do I borrow more money, or do I spend a 
little more on some programming, should I reduce the deficit, is tax 
relief a good idea or not?
<P>
	A little while ago the Prime Minister said that tax relief was 
un-Canadian. Now we hear the finance minister saying that tax 
relief would be good some time, he just does not know when.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9150"> 9150 </A></B>
<P>
	The national debt will exceed $600 million next year, some$111 billion more than when the Liberals took office. Deficit 
reduction is due mainly to higher revenue and not to reduced 
spending. The deficit remains some $19 billion, which proves that 
the country does not have a revenue problem. Revenues are up. 
We seem to have a spending problem but the government will not 
address that.
<P>
	Since the Liberals took office, tax revenues have increased$30.4 billion. The Liberal vision seems to be that it is okay that the 
average taxpayer sends some $10,200 to the federal government 
each and every year, $3,400 a year to service the debt alone.
<P>
	If that is the vision, then it is no wonder that so many Canadians 
are working two jobs, that they are moonlighting, that many of 
them are working on the underground economy and that people are 
saying they have to do what it takes because if they play by the 
rules this government is setting, they cannot even feed their 
families. That is where lack of vision from the Liberals is hurting 
the average Canadian family.
<P>
	There are 7.3 million Canadians earning less than $30,000 a 
year. The Liberal vision seems to be that that is somehow okay. In 
other words, the chronic problem of the working poor is somehow 
okay.
<P>
	Again I mention that by 1998 the Liberals will have cut health 
and education payments to the provinces by $7.5 billion while 
cutting its own spending only that much as well. In other words, a 
lot of the deficit reduction which it has been able to achieve is on 
the backs of the provinces with the reduced health and education 
transfers.
<P>
	I would like to talk specifically about a budgetary item in my 
own constituency. The Liberals in the last budget, not this one, 
closed CFB Chilliwack. Now that we have the access to 
information documents before us, some of the retiring generals and 
so on have said that this move was a poor move at the time, that it 
was not a budgetary move but a political move.
<P>
	In addition, it has been done without consultation with the local 
communities. That is in contrast to what it said in its February 
budget when it stated: ``where warranted, the federal government is 
prepared to work with community leaders and other levels of 
government to assist in the development and implementation of 
community adjustment plans''.
<P>
	We have tried to do that. We met with Treasury Board in Ottawa 
on April 17, 1996. We were told that there was no money, no 
compensation, no second thought and that it was just there to 
determine the process by which the lands could be disposed of. The 
lands now, according to the Minister of Transport, may sit idle for 
as long as seven years, stuck in aboriginal land claims which are 
benefiting neither the aboriginal people nor the community at 
large.
<P>
	There has to be something, I would argue, given the words of the 
federal government both in opposition and since its members have 
been in government, to mitigate this problem in our community. A 
$105 million impact on our community cannot be just shrugged off 
without consultation and without a plan B, a plan that will help the 
community to make that adjustment.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I have asked in the past and I am asking again today for the 
federal government to consider transferring E division 
headquarters of the RCMP to Chilliwack, to the lands at that site. It 
would be a good use of that land. I have written a letter again to the 
minister today asking him to do that. It would inject spending into 
the local economy.
<P>
	It would be good for the RCMP. They could come into a federal 
facility where they would have new buildings. It is a lower cost for 
the RCMP to be in Chilliwack as opposed to where they are located 
now. It makes sense economically. It makes sense to the members 
of the RCMP who could enjoy a lower cost of living in Chilliwack. 
It would be fair because it allows the federal government to do 
something, as it promised, to make the adjustment from shutting 
down CFB Chilliwack lands to another use of those lands. It would 
also let the process begin about the uncertainty of what is going to 
happen to our lands.
<P>
	Since the government has pushed ahead with this, the land at 
CFB Chilliwack has to be divvied up quickly in a way that will 
allow both the aboriginal people and the community at large to 
benefit. If E division headquarters were to come to Chilliwack we 
could make some use of some of the newer buildings and some of 
the new facilities.
<P>
	We could then start the process of rezoning that land where 
applicable. The aboriginal people could get part of it, the 
community at large could have access to it, developers and home 
builders and so on could have access to that land. It would be a 
good budgetary procedure as well if the government could only do 
that.
<P>
	I do not have time to get into all the Reform proposals, things 
like increasing personal deductions, some of our tax proposals and 
so on, but I am interested in doing that in questions and answers if 
anyone would be keen to get into that subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to speak specifically to that portion of the 
member's speech which deals with base Chilliwack.
<P>
	It is an interesting example. We have been listening to Reform 
members all morning and they keep saying that the government has 
not cut enough, that the Minister of Finance has not cut enough, 
and that we must continue to keep focusing on a balanced budget. 
Yet here we have a concrete example in the member's riding, where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9151"> 9151 </A></B>
<P>
his  community has been a victim of this ideological campaign to 
eliminate the deficit almost overnight.
<P>
	I am sympathetic to the closing of that base. There are several 
other examples across the country where this obsession with the 
deficit has shut down key government instruments, the government 
presence that has helped build the country.
<P>
	I listened to the member say that he went to Treasury Board, the 
very group that did the cutting. He went back after the cutting was 
done and said: ``Can you help us get this thing going again?'' He 
feels that he has been a victim of this deficit thing that is evolving 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I say to the member respectfully and sincerely, does he not think 
that this campaign to balance the books virtually overnight should 
now be halted a bit and we should get back into the business of 
putting a bit more government intervention into the economy so 
that we can get our constituents back to work. What would the 
member say to that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> I thank the hon. member for his question. I know he 
has expressed to me both personally and in the House his concern 
about CFB Chilliwack. I appreciate that. He has been one of the 
few members who has actually publicly worried about what has 
happened to British Columbia's last land forces base. I thank him 
for those words.
<P>
	I have two or three comments that are appropriate here. One is 
that I had said to the minister if he could show me how he can 
complete the mandate of the Canadian armed forces, how he is 
going to save money and if he could lay it out for me, I would be 
hard pressed to say that it is a lousy idea.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	What we have been able to find so far from access to information 
requests, from comments by Colonel Daigle of the western forces 
command, whose budget briefing documents say there is no money 
to be saved by this closure, from General Addy who said that this is 
a military risk and a poor military decision, from the cost overruns 
in the transfer of base personnel to CFB Edmonton, now some $200 
million over budget, is that there is no money to be saved. If there 
was money to be saved and we could do the job, we would look at 
it. However, there is no money to be saved and we cannot do the 
job. It was a poor decision all around.
<P>
	If money could be saved and the job could still be done, we 
would have to take a serious look at it. However, that is not the 
case. That is why I believe this decision has been politically 
motivated, which makes it a doubly heinous decision. Money has 
not been saved and the military now says it cannot fulfil its 
obligations in British Columbia because it does not have a land 
forces presence.
<P>
	On the issue of whether the government should slow down its 
deficit cutting, I would like to say two or three things. Government 
still has priorities. The budgetary plan of the Reform Party is to 
spend $94 billion on federal government programming. That does 
not include servicing the debt. That is still a substantial chunk of 
change which we think Canadians want and deserve.
<P>
	Further discussion, I believe, will not be so much on whether the 
budget should be balanced. Everyone says that the budget should 
be balanced, whether it be done in two, three or four years. The 
question then becomes: at what level of taxation should the budget 
be balanced?
<P>
	It could be balanced at $94 billion, which is our proposal. It 
could be balanced at $109 billion, which is the government's 
proposal. It could go to $120 billion-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in 
this House to discuss the budget that was tabled by the finance 
minister a month ago today, on February 18.
<P>
	I will begin my remarks by extending my warmest 
congratulations to my colleague, the Minister of Finance, for the 
excellent budget he tabled in the House. Of course, this budget, his 
fourth, builds on the measures announced in the three previous 
budgets and on the extraordinary work done by this government 
over the last few years. The work we have done is so exceptional 
indeed that, when we came to power in 1993, few Canadians 
expected us to do so well in managing our country's public 
finances.
<P>
	This government has put Canada's public finances on such a 
sound footing that we can now see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
For years and years, Canadians had been criticized by foreign 
markets throughout the world for having lost control over their 
public finances. We have now regained that control thanks to this 
finance minister and to the government which has contributed to 
these efforts.
<P>
	Now that we have put our public finances on such a sound 
footing that foreign markets and Canadian economists have 
regained confidence in us, that interest rates are at their lowest 
level in thirty years and that inflation is finally under control, what 
kind of society do we want to build, now that our finances on a 
sounder footing than any time in the past thirty years?
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	What the Minister of Finance showed us in his budget was a 
government whose primary focus is giving hope back to 
Canadians, because the budget, in a fundamental way, puts people 
first. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9152"> 9152 </A></B>
<P>
Now that we can finally see the  light at the end of the tunnel, we 
are turning our attention to people.
<P>
	This is a government that wants to build a stronger society, a 
society that gives everyone a chance to make a contribution, a 
society that gives even those who are sometimes the least fortunate 
a chance to hope again.
<P>
	I often kid my colleague, the Minister of Finance, telling him 
that he has been just as wrong in his forecasts over the years as all 
his predecessors. Obviously, I kid him because, if he has perhaps 
erred, it has been in the sense that the deficits have been lower than 
he had announced, whereas previous governments have, for years 
now, always announced lower deficits than they actually produced.
<P>
	I, of course, prefer the Minister of Finance's rigorous 
management and tendency to underestimate our deficits rather than 
constantly overestimate them. I think this was by far the best way 
of operating.
<P>
	Naturally, we are concerned about the continuing high 
unemployment. We are obviously aware that our increasingly 
healthy economy has created more jobs in Canada since 1993 than 
the economies of most industrialized countries, that our 
performance has far surpassed the average of G-7 countries. In this 
we must take pride.
<P>
	It is still not enough. We must do more, and I, for my part, am 
confident that we are going to achieve much better results with the 
continuing high performance of our economy. It is important that 
the growth of the Canadian economy, which rests on a solid 
foundation thanks to this government, can now lead increasingly to 
job creation everywhere.
<P>
	I would now like to draw your attention to the kind of society we 
are going to build on the solid foundation and the achievements of 
recent years. We on this side of the House have compassion for the 
least fortunate members of our society and we must stand united, as 
a society, and invest in each other's future.
<P>
	The priority we have set, a priority I would consider national 
because the Government of Canada arrived at it in discussion with 
the provincial governments, is the situation of children in low 
income families. The child tax benefit is one of the first 
investments we can make. Now that we have some leeway, the 
Minister of Finance has shown that this government continues to be 
concerned about the least fortunate members of our society, those 
who are most vulnerable.
<P>
	What we have also demonstrated as well is that, by focusing on 
the children of low income families, we are investing in the future, 
since everyone is aware that poverty consistently leads to situations 
that are harmful to society. Poverty is unacceptable in itself, for the 
people experiencing it, but it is an extremely heavy burden for 
society as well.
<P>
	Thus, when we invest in the children of poor families, we are 
strengthening the social fabric of our society, and therefore are 
making what might be called an investment in the future, rather 
than a social expenditure, for poverty can kill every spark of 
promise there is in an individual. I believe that everyone can see 
that poor children start off with a strike against them. They have 
more school problems, and more need of the health care system. 
Knowing that the poor are always more liable to end up 
unemployed and dependent on social programs, we must therefore 
make sure that fewer children start off life on the wrong foot.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	A child who starts off on the wrong foot has a hard time 
changing gears and overcoming obstacles later. These children 
need to be nourished; the same goes for their spirits, their hearts, 
their souls and their potential. This we have done, in a way that 
strikes me as eminently responsible.
<P>
	We wanted to break down what we call the welfare wall. The 
child tax credit established by this government in conjunction with 
the provinces across Canada is intended to break down that wall. 
This is an extensive, nation-wide effort, in which the provinces and 
the Government of Canada are working together in an area of 
concern to them both.
<P>
	What do I mean by the welfare wall? The social assistance trap 
which holds too many children prisoner. Very often, parents faced 
with the decision of whether or not to return to work opt for staying 
on welfare so that their children will continue to benefit from the 
programs-such as dental care and coverage for certain 
prescriptions-they are entitled to as welfare recipients.
<P>
	As a government, we have determined that we must help 
families get off welfare if they have the chance, without penalizing 
their children. This is what we are doing by putting $850 million in 
new funding into the child benefit. This will come into effect on 
January 1, 1998, perhaps earlier if the program we want to create 
with the provinces can be ready sooner.
<P>
	The idea is to reduce the social welfare trap that penalizes 
parents, or at least their children, if they agree to go back to work. 
The purpose of the child tax benefit is to provide equal 
opportunities for children in low income families with one parent 
working, by allowing provincial governments to use the money 
freed by the increased federal tax benefit to ensure that these 
children have access to better, more equitable services. This is the 
goal of our policy.
<P>
	From an economic point of view, this policy is fundamentally 
sound and, from a social point of view, it is an investment in our 
future. We all know that a child who has a bad start in life will 
ultimately cost much more to society. This policy seems extremely 
interesting to me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9153"> 9153 </A></B>
<P>
	The $850 million that will be allocated as of January 1, 1998 
will be added to the $5.1 billion the government is already paying 
for the child tax benefit. As of January 1, 1998, $6 billion will 
be paid out to families with children. We see this benefit as a down 
payment the government hopes to increase in the future as soon 
as our financial picture improves. The money to help low income 
families will rise from $3 billion to close to $3.9 billion, an 
increase of around 30 per cent.
<P>
	Thus, 1.4 million families, or more than 2.5 million children in 
Canada, will see an increase in the benefits they receive from the 
Canadian government. The results are remarkable, because at the 
same time we have managed to update Canadian federalism by 
proving that we can work in harmony with the provinces in this 
country.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of seeing two levels of government 
quibbling over jurisdictions. They want us to work together. We 
must clarify our roles to avoid this constant stepping beyond the 
limits of our responsibilities and to avoid creating conflict 
situations. We must clarify our roles, and that is what we have done 
with the national child benefit.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will provide income support for 
families, while the provinces have agreed to redirect money from 
welfare to programs and services for children living in low income 
families. It is this kind of partnership that shows how flexible 
Canadian federalism can be, how Canadian federalism can be a real 
boon to the priorities we want to establish, including for our 
children.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is time that we realize that federalism is not some game, either 
the government in Ottawa wins and the provinces lose or the other 
way around, when the provinces win it is Ottawa that loses.
<P>
	Federalism is a win-win situation when the two levels of 
government determine that our federation can be more harmonious 
and less conflicting. This is the great work we are doing at the 
ministerial council on the social union. Progress has been 
absolutely remarkable in the last few months.
<P>
	I would like to thank my provincial colleagues very much for 
their extraordinary work and contributions they have made to the 
national child benefit for which all Canadians are already so 
grateful and pleased because they can see the better society it is 
going to build.
<P>
	The second priority of our discussions at the ministerial council 
on the social union is the issue of Canadians living with 
disabilities. We have also taken important steps in the budget to 
help many of the 4 million Canadians, about 15 per cent of citizens 
in the country, who live with disabilities. It is absolutely  important 
that in this society that we build on the solid foundation we have 
built over the last few years, after four budgets from the Minister of 
Finance, which have established the foundation. It is important that 
the society we build on that foundation will allow every citizen to 
participate more fully in life in Canadian society.
<P>
	We know that the 4 million who live with some disability have 
more obstacles to overcome to participate in society. This is why in 
our budget we really wanted to respond to several 
recommendations of the task force headed by my colleague, the 
member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury. The Scott task force has 
done wonderful work to really bring our attention and focus on the 
priorities of Canadians living with disabilities who must be helped 
by the government to participate more fully in life. This is the kind 
of society we believe in. It is important that it be reflected in 
society.
<P>
	We have therefore renewed the VRDP. The budget has actually 
set aside $168 million to extend the vocational rehabilitation of 
disabled persons program for another year. It is a very good 
program which is helping Canadians with disabilities to get back to 
work and to contribute and earn a living with dignity, which every 
human being in the country is entitled to.
<P>
	In addition to the VRDP this budget provides $70 million in tax 
assistance to Canadians who are facing significant medical costs. I 
think it is a very important element which will help them as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The budget also provides for investing $30 million in a new 
opportunities fund which assists the economic integration of 
persons with disabilities in their community. We will operate in 
partnership with non-governmental organizations, NGOs.
<P>
	In fact I welcome the outstanding job done by members of these 
NGOs who are working together with organizations for Canadians 
who live with such disabilities. Without these NGOs, they would 
not have the same quality of life. That is why we are working very 
closely with these NGOs to help them financially and in the work 
they do to help persons with disabilities in Canada to enter the 
labour market satisfactorily, something they want very much.
<P>
	This budget has also shown how concerned we are about our 
youth. On February 12, few days before the budget was tabled, I 
had the honour to announce, on behalf of the Government of 
Canada, the youth employment strategy.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The youth employment strategy is not just a strategy for youth, 
but a strategy designed by young people for young people. We 
consulted them. What did they ask us?  They said: ``Sir, could you 
please help us get better access to the information we need to get a 
job? Could you tell us about training programs and careers that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9154"> 9154 </A></B>
<P>
available to us?'' As you know, there are many in my own 
department, Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	So we put in a 1-800 line which is perfectly democratic. It gives 
everyone access to programs and services, even people living in 
rural areas, because we did not forget the outlying regions in this 
strategy. With our 1-800 line, democracy has reached those regions 
as well, through access to programs and services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Rural youth are extremely important for us. This is why we were 
so pleased to be able to connect them through a web site available 
all over the country with a 1-800 line that everyone can have access 
to in a very democratic way wherever one lives in the rural regions 
of this country.
<P>
	We have been asked by people to get them out of the vicious 
cycle of no job, no experience, no experience, no job. We have 
created 110,000 work experiences in order to allow young people 
to get work experience. It has been clearly demonstrated that 
people who have such work experience through an internship 
somewhere get a job within a few months after that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why, once this work experience has been acquired, a 
young person tends to find a job more easily, I mean a steady job, 
after his training.
<P>
	Since the Chair would like me to conclude, I want to say that the 
work we did in the social union council is particularly useful and 
constructive, now that our public finances are in good shape, in fact 
better that they have ever been in Canada for decades. We can now 
look to the future with far more hope and enthusiasm. We now 
know that the social safety net we have in Canada will be 
strengthened in the years to come. There is light at the end of the 
tunnel. We again have something to look forward to. And we are 
very pleased to share this prospect with the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the minister on his speech. It was very 
enthusiastic. It is obvious that he believes everything is rosy and 
great and that the items in this budget and all his plans and best 
wishes are going to create all the wonderful jobs by the expenditure 
of these moneys that he has outlined so carefully.
<P>
	However, I would like to remind him that the light he talks about 
at the end of the tunnel is not a great vision for Canada. The light at 
the end of the tunnel is the single biggest problem that this 
government has failed to address, the debt. That debt is going to be 
over $600  billion. There is no plan by the finance minister or this 
minister to address how they are going to amortize or mortgage that 
$600 billion in some reasonable economic way, like a 35 year 
period, to pay it down.
<P>
	He brags about the great finance minister who has addressed the 
deficit. The government is still spending, according to the latest 
numbers, $19 billion more than it is bringing in. There are some 
members opposite who would like to start spending more. They 
think that because the government is ahead of its deficit targets is 
new found money, a surplus. That is not a surplus.
<P>
	What I would like to point out is that this minister is 
complimenting the finance minister and himself for a job half 
done. I know he will say that nobody is always ever happy and that 
they want to always get further and better. However, on this job 
issue, I am getting sick and tired of listening to government try to 
take credit for creating jobs, to say that their job is to create jobs. 
Then other members get up, and actually this is a more intelligent 
response, but it is not the government that creates jobs. It creates 
the environment and the right conditions and the private sector 
creates the jobs. But the government has not done its job yet. It has 
only done half a job. It is still running a deficit.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	On the jobs that the government says it has created, I heard this 
all last week in question period 770,000 new jobs. Then the finance 
minister claimed that was a net number.
<P>
	This is the question I would like to ask the minister directly. He 
should know this because he is in charge of job creation as well. 
When the Liberals got elected jobs, jobs, jobs was the platform and 
1.5 million Canadians were out of work. Their job strategy was 
infrastructure, a number of these other items that are in the budget 
and this was going to reduce the unemployment rolls.
<P>
	Unemployed according to statistics is 1.4 million. If we are 
talking net numbers it would seem to me, if I do the arithmetic, this 
government, if it wants to take credit for creating the jobs, created 
100,000 new net jobs, not 770,000 new net jobs. Otherwise the 
unemployment would have been 2.2 million, not 1.5 million.
<P>
	Somewhere in there the arithmetic is not right. Somewhere in 
there somebody is spinning a myth that Canadians are getting a bit 
confused by. I as a member of Parliament do not have this straight. 
I do not understand how this government can stand up and say it 
created 770,000 new jobs and it is the private sector that creates the 
jobs, which is a contradiction right there, and then have an 
unemployment rate that is only 100,000 lower than what it was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have been saying for a 
long time is that the responsibility of the government is to create a 
climate, the right conditions. What I have said is that it has not 
materialized  completely yet and the economic growth has not yet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9155"> 9155 </A></B>
<P>
translated into all the jobs we hope will be created in the next few 
months and years.
<P>
	The interest rates are much lower than they have been. They 
were two points higher than the interest rates in the United States 
when we took office in 1993. They are now more than two points 
lower than in the United States after four Liberal budgets. What can 
I tell you, this is certainly contributing to the right climate.
<P>
	Inflation is now at less than 2 per cent. Really for the first time in 
decades we have full control of public finances. This is 
extraordinary. I do not say that the job is finished. Governing is an 
ongoing process. I hope we will be continuing to govern for a 
while.
<P>
	What I am saying is that what we have achieved has been 
without putting at risk the social fabric of society. The social fabric 
of society has been saved and protected and ensured into the future.
<P>
	This is why I say there is light at the end of the tunnel. We still 
have important moves to make in the direction we are giving right 
now to Canadians but there is hope. Let us stop saying all the time 
that there is no hope. What the young want is for us to let them 
know that there is hope and that we are going in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the minister on his remarks. 
The initiative of the national child tax benefit is a great initiative. 
As Liberals we should be proud that we are once again speaking for 
those in our community who are most disadvantaged.
<P>
	We always talk numbers around here in such large, grandiose 
ways, about the deficit and the debt. We talk in numbers that 
sometimes the average person on the street does not quite 
understand. The reality is that we still have a large number of 
Canadians who are out of work. They are not looking for a debate 
in the House on whether the deficit is $19 billion or $17 billion. 
They are looking for some hope and energy so that we can get 
people going again.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I would like to propose an idea to the minister responsible for 
putting Canadians back to work. Would the minister consider 
seeking an all-party consensus that we have an emergency debate 
so that every single member of Parliament could stand up and in a 
constructive way put forward thoughts and ideas on how we could 
get the whole momentum of hope for getting people back to work 
going again?
<P>
	It should not be the normal hours. It should be, in the true sense 
of the word, an emergency debate, perhaps from 10 a.m. until9 p.m., 6 or 7 days a week. We would go until we sort of sensitized 
the whole country that we are totally obsessed with the idea of 
getting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	I watched the minister on television last night when he 
announced a very specific project in a region of Montreal where he 
was getting Canadians back to work. The problem is that one 
announcement like that is not enough to get the whole energy 
system of the country going.
<P>
	Would the minister take the initiative, appeal to the Prime 
Minister that we create a national, bipartisan debate in the House of 
Commons so that we could come up in a constructive way on how 
all members of Parliament can put their ideas on the table on how 
they can get their own communities going?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly welcome the member's 
suggestion for raising the profile of the situation of unemployment 
in Canada. It is something that should be above party politics, 
particularly at this time.
<P>
	We need all the creative work that can be done. I am sure that 
opposition members would be able to contribute as well. This is 
something that does concern every one of us. In most of our 
ridings, we have too high an unemployment level.
<P>
	We need all the creativity that we are able to produce in the 
House and elsewhere. It is the one priority that we should be having 
right now, job creation in Canada. It is something that we will 
continue.
<P>
	Certainly I as minister am very open to any constructive 
suggestion from my colleagues in our caucus or from opposition 
members. We are trying very hard these days.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to rise today as part of the debate on the 
budget speech. However, I am less than delighted with the budget.
<P>
	In fact, I have a short anecdote for you. One or two days after it 
was tabled, an accountant was to come to the chamber of 
commerce in my riding to make a presentation on the budget. In his 
introduction, he said: ``When I learned I would be doing this 
presentation, I was quite anxious thinking there would be a lot of 
elements that would be difficult to integrate. My problem this 
morning is that there is nothing new in the government's budget, so 
there are few elements. It is a budget on automatic pilot''.
<P>
	The problem is that we do not need budgets on automatic pilot in 
Canada and Quebec at the moment, we need budgets that address 
the main problem: jobs. In past years, a lot of work was done on the 
issue of the deficit with some results, although much was done on 
the backs of the provinces through cuts to transfer payments and on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9156"> 9156 </A></B>
<P>
the backs of the unemployed through the unemployment insurance 
reform.
<P>
	As far as jobs are concerned, this time, the issue on the table, the 
main concern of the people in my region, in Quebec and in Canada 
is, how are we going to use the human potential available? And 
how is it that the unemployment rates are acceptable?
<P>
	The government is arguing that it can do no more. It is setting up 
attractive conditions, and it is up to the private sector to create jobs. 
The private sector has a responsibility in job creation, but the 
government also has the responsibility of tackling this problem.
<P>
	The first step would be for the Prime Minister to say: ``We will 
indeed make it a priority, we will set up objectives to ensure we put 
the same energy in job creation as we may have put into deficit 
reduction in the past''. The tools are there. We can suggest some to 
him. On the weekend, at the Bloc Quebecois convention, there was 
no shortage of solutions proposed at the workshop on employment.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We are not saying that it is an easy matter, but there are things 
that the government could do, but chooses not to simply because it 
lacks the political will to do so. For example, it could very 
substantially reduce unemployment insurance premiums, which 
would result in the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. It could 
create an employment RRSP, as suggested by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the Bloc Quebecois' finance critic. We 
made this proposal to the minister. What did he do with it? He 
forgot about it. They decided it would be business as usual. They 
stuck to the traditional course, and did not bother with that.
<P>
	Jobs have been created in the past and are still being created, but 
a whole class of people, all the unskilled workers who have been 
affected by technological change, are being ignored, much as if 
they were so much cast-off furniture. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	Society must be able to react more rapidly if we are to have an 
agreement on manpower. A system which takes as long to react as 
the Canadian one does is unprecedented. For the past five years 
everybody in Quebec has been saying that common sense requires 
Quebec to be responsible for manpower, but the federal side is still 
hemming and hawing, trying to ensure that it will have some 
control over it, while it really falls under the jurisdiction of 
Quebec.
<P>
	This is another tool which has to be handed over to ensure a 
better match between workers' training and available jobs. The 
employment insurance fund surplus must be used to this end. It 
must be used not only in the financial statements, to reduce the 
deficit, but above all to launch dynamic manpower training 
initiatives, to allow workers to get a training and keep their jobs. 
We must be proactive and take action before problems appear.
<P>
	There is nothing of that kind in the budget and I think the federal 
government should do its homework to ensure that interesting 
solutions are found.
<P>
	Other means were suggested in a workshop on employment 
during the Bloc Quebecois convention, this past weekend. For 
example, we could do something to reduce drastically the red tape 
for small and medium business. I challenge the members to go 
through all the administrative steps that must be taken when a 
business is established. The number of governmental organizations 
to communicate with and the number of forms to fill up are enough 
to discourage any entrepreneur from creating jobs.
<P>
	A progressive retirement plan proposal was also put forward. 
Why not allow people who are at the end of their careers to 
gradually reduce their job schedule to four, three or two days for 
the last five years and to use their RRSPs to make up for the 
difference without having a tax penalty. That would be an incentive 
for them and an opportunity for young people. Again, this is an 
interesting solution.
<P>
	Mutual fund or investment fund management is another issue 
that must be looked into, even though it is more complex. Many 
funds invest on the American market and other markets around the 
world. As the government here in Canada, we have a duty to 
provide interesting conditions to make sure these funds invest in 
Quebec and Canada so that our savings support our own 
development and not the development of others.
<P>
	There is another avenue to explore. Look at what is happening 
today: while jobs are being created for individuals with 
postsecondary education, the situation remains dismal for those 
without high school education. Literacy needs to be improved. 
Does this budget contain any major initiative providing for the 
federal government to withdraw from this area, give the budgets 
back to the provinces and let them take over? No, not a word.
<P>
	They are leaving it up to market forces without making any 
attempt at enabling those who have been a little left out because of 
their lack of education to train, get back in the race on the labour 
market and finally get work. There is nothing to that effect in this 
budget.
<P>
	There is another instance where, in my opinion, the Minister of 
Finance lacked compassion. For nearly a year now, questions have 
been asked and letters written to the minister about American 
pensions. While the minister acknowledged there were iniquities in 
the new tax treaty between Canada and the U.S., nothing has been 
done. This matter should have been addressed in the February 
budget.
<P>
	The tax treaty between Canada and the U.S does have to be 
amended, reopened if possible, or reviewed from an administrative 
point of view. While we are still waiting for a final decision on this, 
there are people who have been living on $6,000 a year for the past 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9157"> 9157 </A></B>
<P>
two years. They  used to receive $8,000, a small pension if you 
consider that some of them do not yet qualify for old age security. 
Members should try working out a household budget of $6,000 a 
year, just to see.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Before, people did not have to pay taxes upon receiving their 
cheque from the American government. They would receive the 
whole amount and declare half of it the following year, in their tax 
return. This taxation method allowed low income people to be a 
little better off, thanks to their tax refund. This is no longer the 
case. Now, 25 per cent of the amount of the cheque issued by the 
American government goes directly to the U.S. treasury, and 
Canadians have no way of getting that money back.
<P>
	What is rather unfair is that people who worked and earned a 
good salary for a long time, and who are now getting a big pension, 
are in a better financial position than they were in the past. 
However, low income people, that is those who receive $8,000, 
$12,000 or $15,000 per year, or a support income of $3,000 or 
$4,000, are now being deprived of an essential part of that income.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance should have spent as much time looking 
at this issue as he gave some people to take advantage of tax 
loopholes. A change must be made as soon as possible. I am asking 
the minister to get the unanimous consent of the House to correct 
this situation, through the budget or through a short term measure, 
at least on a temporary basis.
<P>
	We made suggestions, including a proposal whereby the income 
supplement would be calculated on the net amount received by the 
individual, thus allowing senior citizens to get their supplement 
more easily. Such a solution would not solve the problem, but at 
least it would make it easier to give back money to those who need 
it on a daily basis. We are not talking about family trusts, we are 
not talking about billions of dollars: we are talking about people 
who need that money to buy milk, to buy butter and to pay their 
rent. The federal government is showing an unacceptable lack of 
compassion toward these people.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I feel the government did not do its 
homework with this budget. It merely lets the train follow the 
tracks without changing the speed. We have a new problem called 
non-employment. This shortage of jobs, hundreds of thousands of 
them, keeps us from putting to work citizens who are ready and 
willing to serve their community.
<P>
	We must create opportunities, we must create a dynamic. The 
government must really make this a priority and follow up on the 
slogans used during the election campaign. Imagine the impact, on 
the credibility of parliamentarians, of the slogan ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' 
used by the Liberals in the 1993 election campaign now  that, four 
years later, there are as many people out of work as there were back 
then.
<P>
	During the next election campaign, the Conservatives will use 
the speeches made by the Liberals in 1993 to talk about change, 
while the Liberals will use the Conservative rhetoric. This is a 
tradition among old line parties. However, it does not solve the 
problem.
<P>
	What is required in this budget are clear and specific decisions 
and commitments on the part of the government to make 
employment a priority. For these reasons, we will support the 
amendment tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues and I are pleased to take part in the debate on the budget 
and on the Bloc Quebecois' amendment.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, and ever since, we have heard 
so much about the red book that at some point we decided to read it 
for ourselves. There are some passages that, after three and a half, 
almost four, years leave us wondering whether the people who 
wrote it have lost their memories, are suffering from Alzheimer's, 
or at the very least should be ashamed to see what this book has 
produced after three and a half years.
<P>
	I will quote you a short passage from page 13 of our Liberal 
friends' red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today, after nine years of Conservative government, Canadians are facing 
hardship: 1.6 million unemployed, millions more on welfare, a million children 
living below the poverty line, record numbers of bankruptcies and plant closings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Like I said, that was from page 13 of the Liberal Party's red book.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	What compassion. What fine words. I do not know whom they 
hired to write such wonderful prose, but they should have hired 
somebody else to carry it off.
<P>
	It has been three years now, and I would remind members that 
there are not 1.6 million unemployed, but 1.5 million Canadians 
still without jobs; there are 3 million Canadians on welfare. Instead 
of one million children living below the poverty line, there are now 
1.5 million in this situation. The number of bankruptcies has 
reached a record level in 1996, and these are not Bloc Quebecois 
figures, these are not figures provided by nasty separatists, but 
figures from Statistics Canada, Industry Canada and Human 
Resources Development Canada. These figures are very interesting 
when starting off a speech in reply to the budget speech.
<P>
	What have the Liberals who were so appalled by the situation in 
1993 done after three and a half years in government? They have 
made things worse than in 1993 and today they are telling us how 
wonderful they are.
<P>
	I wonder whether, in the next campaign, the Liberals will dig out 
their red book and parade it around, saying:  ``Look, we have kept 
80 per cent of our promises''. I wonder if they will use the Statistics 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9158"> 9158 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, Industry Canada and Human Resources Development 
Canada statistics to show that we are not the ones contradicting 
them, but that it is their own organizations instead which are 
saying: ``The government has not met its objectives, has not kept 
its promises''. Not just little promises, but the major promises of 
the election campaign: jobs, children, and bankruptcies. In other 
words, things that affect the pocketbooks of the men and women of 
Quebec and of Canada.
<P>
	If I were a Liberal MP, I would make sure no red book came 
anywhere near me, and I would make the rounds of the bookstores 
and the MPs' offices to make sure there were none to be found, for 
I would be embarrassed to be seen with one in my possession.
<P>
	As critic for international trade, however, I will make reference 
to the Minister of Finance's budget speech, four key points in 
particular. First of all, back to the red book, which contained 
promises on respecting democracy and human rights throughout 
the world, international trade versus human rights, respect for 
democracy and the Liberal Party vision of foreign affairs.
<P>
	What has this government done in the past three years about 
international trade and foreign affairs? As you will see, on this first 
point, I will be able to demonstrate to you that they have not done 
much. On the contrary, they have backtracked. Not just inertia, but 
backtracking with respect to their promises, their positions as set 
out in the red book.
<P>
	How has the Liberal Party backtracked on aid for international 
development? How has the government backtracked on the 
question of encouraging democratic rule in the various parts of the 
world? Here is one simple example.
<P>
	First of all, CIDA is responsible for administering some 80 per 
cent of the Canadian Official Development Assistance program, or 
ODA. This supports sustainable development in the developing 
countries, in order to reduce poverty and contribute to the creation 
of a safer, more equitable and more prosperous world.
<P>
	In 1997-98, spending by CIDA will total $1.6 billion or $160 
million less than had been estimated in 1996-97, to keep a promise 
the government had made to help countries that wanted a greater 
measure of democracy to prosper and provide for sustainable 
human development. What is the Canadian government doing? 
What is the Liberal Party doing? In its budget, it cut Canada's 
official development assistance by 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The International Development Research Centre examines the 
problems of developing regions throughout the world and tries to 
find ways to use and adapt scientific knowledge to improve the 
economic and social well-being of these regions. The government 
subsidy for  the International Development Research Centre for 
1997-98 will, according to the budget of the Minister of Finance, 
total $88 million, $8 million less than in 1996-97, which means 
another 10 per cent cut.
<P>
	I repeat, the Liberal government said it wanted to defend and 
promote democracy and human rights throughout the world. 
However, we see a 10 per cent cut in official development 
assistance and a 10 per cent cut in funding for the International 
Development Research Centre.
<P>
	I hope they are not going to brag about how they kept those 
promises during the next campaign. In any case, I hope they will be 
embarrassed if they ever do, because they know they will be 
stretching the truth, to avoid using another term that would be 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	Because of the cuts initiated by the Liberal government, official 
development assistance has been reduced to less than 0.7 per cent 
of GDP. The United Nations, the OECD and its development 
assistance committee had suggested 1 per cent of GDP. The 
Canadian government had also promised to maintain a significant 
level of international aid, and among the G-7 and the OECD 
countries, the objective was to give 1 per cent of GDP to 
development assistance. During the three years it has been in 
power, the Canadian government has reduced development 
assistance from its already inadequate level of 0.7 per cent to less 
than 0.7 per cent.
<P>
	Is development assistance important? Should charity not begin 
at home? Let me tell you that in Canada, one job out of four 
depends on foreign consumers; one job out of four in Canada 
depends on our exports. Is it important to ensure that our customers 
are in good shape socially, economically and politically? It is 
essential.
<P>
	The Canadian government has no choice but to defend, promote 
and encourage political, economic and social stability in those 
countries. Eighty per cent of the world's population will soon need 
greater stability to be able to buy and acquire our products. If only 
from the strictly fiscal and economic point of view, we must ensure 
that these countries enjoy a certain level of growth and stability.
<P>
	We should also promote research and development here in 
Canada. This will only take a few seconds. In a document by the 
OECD on employment, we read: ``The main cause of rising 
unemployment and the increased number of low paying jobs is the 
growing gap between the need for OECD member economies to 
adjust and innovate and their ability and political will to achieve 
this''. Does the Canadian government have the political will? No. 
The Canadian government has put nothing in its budget, the 
Minister of Finance put nothing in his budget to help businesses 
and international development.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate. The 1997 budget 
represents the fulfilment of the red book commitment on the 
economy. Almost 3.5 years ago the Liberal Party made a series of 
commitments to Canadians on the economy.
<P>
	One of the most challenging and badly needed of the 
commitments was to reduce the federal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP 
by the end of our third year in office. We have not only fulfilled this 
commitment. We have exceeded it.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The deficit for 1996-97 will be no higher than $19 billion, 
substantially better than our commitment to reduce the deficit to3 per cent of GDP this year. It is more than $5 billion lower than 
target and $9.6 billion below the 1995-96 deficit.
<P>
	I remind the House that this is the largest year over year decline 
ever. Because of the efforts of the government to clean up the 
nation's finances led by the Prime Minister and Minister of 
Finance, Canadians see light at the end of the tunnel.
<P>
	The 1997 budget is more than just the achievement of these 
impressive numbers. It represents the fulfilment by government of 
major election commitments, the significance of which should not 
be underestimated.
<P>
	When we took office Canadians were fed up with government. 
Canadians had just undergone almost 10 years of a government that 
kept on promising to get Canada's fiscal house in order and 
consistently failed. We cannot undue mistrust fostered by previous 
governments overnight, but we have taken a major step by keeping 
our commitment on reducing Canada's deficit.
<P>
	The 1997 budget demonstrates that the government did not cut 
just for the sake of cutting. Rather the budget is a springboard to the 
21st century, preparing Canada for the next millennium.
<P>
	Perhaps what is most important is not what the budget does for 
Canadians today but what it will do for the country tomorrow. 
More than any other budget, the budget is a rallying cry to all 
Canadians to prepare for the next millennium. We are well on track 
to eliminate all borrowing requirements from international markets 
by 1998-99. This means that we will have the lowest deficit among 
the G-7 countries.
<P>
	The budget contains a number of very focused investments in 
Canadians. Certainly one of the most needed of them is the Canada 
child tax benefit. This investment which totals $6 billion will begin 
to help families escape the welfare trap. The federal government 
will assist low income families with this tax benefit,  removing the 
disincentive to find work. This will have the added benefit of 
allowing provincial governments to take some of the money they 
are currently spending on welfare and redirect it to services and 
programs for the working poor.
<P>
	We have also taken action to strengthen health care. The recent 
report of the National Forum on Health stated that the transition to 
a better system in the future requires some targeted investments 
today. This our fourth budget provides $300 million over the next 
three years to implement key recommendations of the National 
Forum on Health.
<P>
	We have provided $150 million over the next three years for a 
health transition fund to held provinces launch pilot projects to 
investigate new and better approaches to health care.
<P>
	The budget also introduced Canada information services and 
increased funding for the community action program for children 
and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. These measures 
demonstrate our commitment to the Canada Health Act and to 
Canadians who want a strong health care system.
<P>
	If Canada is to excel in the next century we must have a modern, 
innovative economy. The economy of the next millennium will be 
knowledge based economy and research intensive. The government 
recognizes that if Canada is to be a leader in research and 
development we must have a strong research infrastructure. The 
1997 budget creates the Canada foundation for innovation for 
modernization of research infrastructure at universities, colleges, 
research hospitals and associated organizations in the areas of 
health, environment, science and engineering.
<P>
	The foundation will be run by those who conduct the research 
and by those who need to know what needs to be done. In other 
words we are not adding another layer of bureaucracy. We are 
reaching out to those involved in industry and we are working in a 
co-operative manner.
<P>
	The foundation will be funded by an upfront investment of $800 
million, which will allow the foundation to provide around $180 
million annually over five years. This is an investment in the 
economy today which will result in an innovative and modern 
economy tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The Canada foundation for innovation represents a major 
investment in Canada's research and development sector. This is a 
sector with the brightest minds in the world. Sadly it is a sector that 
has been ignored by previous governments. The government values 
the research and development sector. We have sent that message 
loud and clear through this major investment on behalf of all 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9160"> 9160 </A></B>
<P>
	A great deal has been made about the numbers in the budget. 
Indeed they are impressive. However the budget is not about 
numbers. It is about the people of Canada. We have taken the first 
steps in laying the foundation for Canadians to seize the next 
century. In a relatively short span of time we have put an end to 
Canada's crippling deficit cycle. We have gone from having one 
of the worst deficit levels in the G-7 to one of the best in a very 
short span of time. As a result of this action Canadians are 
enjoying the lowest interest rate levels in decades.
<P>
	The opposition has claimed that interest rates are low throughout 
the world and that our Minister of Finance cannot take credit for 
the low interest rates. The fact that ours are lower now than those of 
the United States means that our minister can certainly take the 
credit for it. It has been a long time since our interest rates have 
been lower than those south of the border.
<P>
	Our economy is poised to enjoy tremendous growth. Our 
ambitions go far beyond just these economic goals. That is why we 
have taken measures to fight child poverty and to strengthen 
Canada's health care system. These are elements of our society that 
Canadians cherish. We took the approach to deficit cutting that we 
did because we wanted to preserve and strengthen these elements 
of society. The budget is a very strong first step in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talked about how opposition members have-and I know I 
have been one of them-criticized the finance minister for creating 
the myth that he has broken the back of a deficit that still stands 
today at $19 billion.
<P>
	I attacked the government for trying to take credit for the jobs it 
claims to have created when the net number is only 100,000, from 
1.5 million to 1.4 million. Yet it claims to have created a net 
700,000 jobs.
<P>
	I criticized the finance minister for taking credit for having low 
interest rates. What advantage are interest rates to people who 
cannot borrow money? It does not matter what the rates are. What 
advantage are the interest rates when credit cards are not affected 
by their lowering? Interest rates set in Canada, as they are in the 
United States, are usually set and tied to inflation.
<P>
	The member will recall a gentleman by the name of John Crow 
who used to worry about inflation. We had high inflation and he set 
interest rates high to curb it. It took lot of years of struggling.
<P>
	I remember the Liberals on this side of the House, when they 
were in opposition, being against the high interest rate policy of 
John Crow and criticizing him. He is the individual who deserves 
credit for the low interest rates in Canada today. Inflation has been 
killed and brought to its knees. Then interest rates came down. That 
is who should get credit for the low interest rates, not the 
government or its budgetary policies. In spite of the  budgetary 
policies of this government interest rates came down.
<P>
	I heard many members of the House take credit for the low 
interest rate, jobs and breaking the back of the deficit. It is all a 
myth. They are spinning a myth. The reality faces them in black 
and white. Yet they brag and congratulate a finance minister who 
has failed to address the real problem of the debt and the high 
interest costs to service it. We will all pay for that in the long run. 
No one is addressing that except the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to hear the 
hon. member say that we have not dealt with the deficit. When we 
were at the polls three and a half years ago, Canadians did not want 
the Reform approach of chop, chop, chop. Canadians accepted the 
fact that 3 per cent of GDP was what the social fabric of the 
economy could accept.
<P>
	You gave it your best shot three and a half years ago. Canadians 
rejected your approach. We have lived up to our commitment to 
Canadians.
<P>
	If the economy was not doing so well, you can be sure that the 
finance minister would take the blame. I believe he also deserves 
the credit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member during her speech said how proud she was of the 
government for what it has done for the health care system.
<P>
	I would like to ask her a couple of questions related to that topic. 
I wonder how proud she is of her Minister of Industry who gave an 
entrepreneurial award to a Winnipeg company which specializes in 
selling health insurance to Canadians to go to the United States if 
they have to stay on a waiting list too long.
<P>
	Is she also proud of her government that has a Canada Health Act 
that means in Vancouver there are waiting lists for an MRI? People 
are not allowed to pay for one but dogs and cats can be scanned on 
the MRI for veterinary surgeons, because there is not enough 
money in the system. Is she proud of her government for that?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> We all recognize that there are serious problems 
with the health care system and in the response of the government 
it is trying to address these issues.
<P>
	The information in the report that has just come out by the 
Canada health forum indicates that we are prepared to take action 
to correct these situations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a privilege for 
me to rise today to participate in the budget debate. I am proud to 
support the 1997 budget. In particular I endorse very heartily the 
agenda for jobs and growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9161"> 9161 </A></B>
<P>
	The government's plan for jobs and growth is to stay the course 
on restructuring the country's fiscal health, to invest for immediate 
jobs and for immediate growth, but also to invest for long term 
job creation and growth and to invest in a stronger society.
<P>
	Building on the efforts and successes, our fourth budget brings 
the hopes and dreams of Canadians closer to fruition. For the 
record, we are solidly positioned to eliminate financial 
requirements. The deficit has fallen from $43 billion to $19 billion. 
In 1998-99 the government will no longer need to borrow money 
on financial markets to pay for programs and debt charges. This is a 
remarkable achievement, giving Canada the best record of any of 
the G-7 countries.
<P>
	Since the 1993 election, 715,000 jobs have been created, 80 per 
cent of which are full time jobs. That is another remarkable 
achievement. Although unemployment has dropped from 11.4 per 
cent to 9.7, it is much too high. However, the foundation for growth 
and job creation has been laid. Interest rates, as we have all 
acknowledged, are at a 35 year low. Confidence in Canada's 
economy and governance has been established. The government is 
identifying opportunities and developing strategies that will work.
<P>
	Our goals have been achieved in a managed and responsible way. 
I commend the Minister of Finance for having elected to provide 
selective tax cuts of almost $2 billion over the next three years: for 
low income families, charities, the disabled, students and for 
parents saving for their children's future education. That will 
benefit us.
<P>
	More than 1.4 million low income Canadian families with 2.5 
million children will see an increase in federal child benefit 
payments by July 1998. We have accomplished these targeted tax 
cuts while we have created no new taxes.
<P>
	My riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington is 
rural, and small business makes major contributions to our local 
economy and to job creation. This budget rewards small business. 
Payroll records can now be filed quarterly, a major saving in time 
and paperwork.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	There are no further cuts to government programs. In fact, as a 
result of the 1997 budget, investments are being made in tourism, 
rural development and small business, all areas with a significant 
potential for job creation.
<P>
	The government is investing in post-secondary education and 
innovation, including increases to the education credit, an 
extension of the tuition tax credit, flexible student loan repayment 
options and help for parents saving for their children's education. It 
is planning for the future by renewing research infrastructure at 
Canadian post-secondary institutions and research hospitals 
through the Canadian Foundation for Innovation which will secure 
our future.
<P>
	The government is investing in health care, particularly by 
strengthening community based programming and programming 
directly related to the health of children.
<P>
	I was particularly pleased to hear of the rural development 
opportunities that were included in the budget. The riding which I 
represent is a rural riding. Many of the initiatives in the budget will 
benefit the constituents of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington. For example, tourism will reap the benefits of another 
$50 million which has been invested into the BDC. That will lever 
up to $250 million more in new loans for tourist operators, 
especially those outside the major urban areas. An additional $45 
million over three years have been designated for the Canadian 
Tourism Commission.
<P>
	These initiatives are very important to my riding, which borders 
Lake Ontario and Algonquin Park. We have always had a very 
challenging time in accessing capital and international markets.
<P>
	Certainly rural constituents will benefit from the technology 
programs. The community access program is being expanded in 
order to connect more than 5,000 small communities with 
populations between 400 and 50,000 people. We already have 
Bancroft and Northbrook-Cloyne participating in the program. 
Other communities will benefit from it.
<P>
	We have addressed child poverty. My riding, like too many 
others, has experienced too much poverty which has had a negative 
impact on the lives of the children today and will have a negative 
impact on their future. To quote the Minister of Finance in his 
budget speech: ``Too many Canadian children are not getting the 
start they need to become healthy, happy, educated and productive 
adults. This is not only a personal tragedy, but also a loss for the 
nation as a whole. And so there is a growing consensus among 
Canadians that our first priority when it comes to any fiscal 
dividend is to invest in the well-being of our children, the future of 
our country''.
<P>
	The first step will occur in July 1997. The working income 
supplement will be enriched by $195 million. Benefits will be 
provided for each child instead of per family. Step two will take 
place in July 1998. The supplement will be combined with an 
enriched child benefit to form the Canada child tax benefit.
<P>
	The government has made a very sincere promise. It will 
continue to work with the provinces to design complementary 
changes that will help to reduce child poverty and barriers to work.
<P>
	Building on the efforts to improve the conditions under which 
children are growing up, we are creating opportunities for youth so 
they may make the transition from school to work when that time 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9162"> 9162 </A></B>
<P>
arrives in their lives.  The youth employment strategy is an 
important step toward restoring hope for young Canadians.
<P>
	Recently in my part of the country Industry Canada had an 
information fair. More than 20 government departments staffed 
booths, answered questions and provided material. People are 
writing into my office and phoning us asking for more of this 
information. I am glad to see the government focusing on small 
business and the opportunities we have for export development and 
trade.
<P>
	Last spring I worked with a coalition of community groups to 
mount an area business show ``Connections `96''. I am happy to 
report that the show is being repeated on April 19 of this year. 
``Connections `97'' will showcase business and community groups. 
There will be displays of products and services, panels, discussions 
and guest appearances of accomplished people from a variety of 
interests.
<P>
	This is what good government can produce: government and the 
private sector complementing each other's efforts to produce jobs 
and growth.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The budget recognizes the fact that no single initiative will 
address the challenges we face. However, the threads, woven 
together, do promise a beautiful tapestry in which the government 
works with the private sector so that the needs of the vulnerable in 
society, the poor, the children and the aged are met.
<P>
	This budget is about getting our fiscal house in order and about 
investing in the future. I thank the minister for an excellent budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to compliment the member on his speech. He worked very 
hard and diligently at it. He stayed up late at night to write every 
single word of it and I know he believes everything that is on that 
piece of paper.
<P>
	Does he believe in the contradiction he is perpetrating on the 
Canadian public? He says that the government has created 
700,000-plus new jobs. The finance minister and the Prime 
Minister have said that that is a net number.
<P>
	Then, in his speech, he indicates that the unemployment rate has 
gone from 11.4 per cent down to 9.7 per cent. If you take the drop 
and the number of unemployed when this government came into 
power, which was at 1.5 million, it rather rounds out to close to 1.4 
that still exists, which allows for some variance in there and some 
cushion.
<P>
	How is it that this member can defend the cabinet ministers' 
claim that they have created 770,000 net new jobs, yet in his speech 
say that the unemployment rate has only dropped from 11.4 to9.7 per cent? Maybe the member could address that discrepancy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
address that question for my hon. colleague from the fine province 
of Alberta.
<P>
	Seven hundred thousand new jobs have been established. These 
are not my figures. They are from Statistics Canada. That is over 41 
months. In the 41 months prior to the election, there was a loss of 
100,000 jobs. There was no gain by your friends and by your 
colleagues during that government.
<P>
	Canadians are re-entering the work force daily in our ridings. 
Housing starts are on the rise. This is winter. Basements are being 
dug in the small community of Bath, Ontario, a loyalist community 
on the banks of Lake Ontario. People are moving in weekly from 
Toronto and Montreal. Young couples are coming to our area. One 
billion dollars has been invested in our community in the last year. 
It is investment from around the world. People feel good.
<P>
	When this happens, many people re-enter the workforce. I am 
glad to see this confidence. Yes, the challenges are there. Is this 
glass of water half empty or half full? It is half full. I am glad that it 
is there so that I can drink from it. We can benefit from the 
workforce. I am proud to be a member of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
constantly hear the members of the government talking about child 
poverty and how they are going to get rid of it.
<P>
	I would really like to hear a definition of poverty from one of the 
government members. When I have asked in my riding for the 
definition of poverty, people always come back to me with, the 
children would have no shoes, no television, no refrigerator. There 
would have difficulty affording food and people would be living in 
very difficult conditions.
<P>
	Would the member, please, give me a definition of poverty and 
tell me what percentage of his riding is living that way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington, my riding, has the unfortunate title of having the 
second highest unemployment rate in eastern Ontario and the 
second lowest income. Many of our people have comfortable lives. 
I grew up in that area. I realize in your area of Vancouver-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to please address 
his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I can actually say 
how many children are barefoot. However, our investment and our 
concern about child poverty is more than just clothes, it is more 
than just the food on their plates, it is their stake in our future.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting and sad that in a nation as great as ours with its 
tremendous potential in terms of resources and human capital we 
have managed to squander it for so much and for long. This year's 
budget was another opportunity to make our nation great, to put our 
economic house in order and to strengthen the social fabric which 
ensures most Canadians can live comfortably and are protected 
from some of the more egregious circumstances that occur south of 
the border. It is unfortunate that once again we have seen 
opportunity lost.
<P>
	If the government had taken our solutions of three years ago, 
today we would have a balanced budget. We would be bringing 
down the real ogre which compromises our social programs and 
our employment situation, decreasing the debt. The government 
chose to ignore the factual practical solutions we gave it two and 
half years ago. Now the government is spending more money than 
it takes in and it compromises the very people it professes to help, 
the poor and those in the lowest socio-economic groups. The 
government compromises the very programs it claims to uphold, 
health care, welfare, old age security, guaranteed income 
supplement.
<P>
	The government fails to recognize as it fails to tell the public that 
if you do not live within your means, if you are not fiscally 
responsible, you are socially irresponsible. In a nutshell, Reform's 
platform can be best summed up as fiscal responsibility with a 
social conscience, as fiscal responsibility with social 
responsibility.
<P>
	We have been accused of trying to cut. Yes we have but we have 
tried to determine where moneys can be spent to preserve those 
programs most needed by Canadians and to eliminate those 
programs that are not. This is not because we wish to cut programs 
but because we wish to ensure that the social and economic fabric 
of Canada will be intact. Canadians will have an opportunity in the 
future to live long, prosperous and healthy lives. Unfortunately 
what is happening out there, away from this bubble of Parliament 
Hill, is very different from what the government would lead 
Canadians to believe.
<P>
	In my other profession as a physician I see there is a great 
destruction taking place within the health care system. Canadians 
are not getting their essential health care services when needed. 
Instead, they are getting these services when governments say they 
can. The government like to trumpet out that it is the great staunch 
defender of the Canada Health Act. You can defend a piece of paper 
but it does not do a whole lot of good for somebody trying to get 
into an intensive care unit bed when they are having a heart attack 
if the  money is not there. But that is what is happening throughout 
the country.
<P>
	The government has to wake up. It is doing a huge disservice to 
Canadians by spinning them a series of gross misinformations 
about our health care system, our social programs and the 
economic situation in the country. Government members like to 
stand up and say they are balancing the budget and winning on the 
deficit. Winning for whom?
<P>
	The government is trying to balance the budget on the backs of 
the only people who pay the money to run this place and every 
single program in this country, the hardworking, much 
beleaguered, overtaxed Canadian taxpayer. That is what is 
happening. The government has instituted 35 tax increases for 
Canadians. It is living off the avails of programs from before to 
keep the interest rates low. Actual cost cutting has been very small. 
It is disingenuous to say to the public that the government has not 
increased taxes when the reality is very far from that.
<P>
	The government has also compromised some other very 
important programs. It has yanked out $7 billion from health care, 
welfare and education. This is at a time when education is going to 
be the underpinning of our social fabric.
<P>
	Reform has put forth effective, concrete solutions. I will discuss 
a few of them. If the government were to institute just a fraction of 
them, we would begin to greatly improve the welfare of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	First, get the deficit down to zero but for heaven's sake bring 
forth a surplus budget so we can bring down the debt. Second, stop 
increasing taxes. Canadians cannot stand any more tax increases.
<P>
	Third, simplify the tax system. It is unfathomable that we have a 
tax system that is so complicated that many Canadians simply 
cannot do their own tax returns.
<P>
	In private companies, the true creators of jobs, small and 
medium size businesses, their ability to increase employment, 
invest in their companies and in the economic strength of the 
company is compromised by the egregious taxation system. It acts 
as a strangle hold on companies to compete. Companies have 
problems competing within the country but, worse, they have 
problems competing with companies in other parts of the world 
because our tax system prevents them from being competitive.
<P>
	We also have a whole array of restrictive, stultifying rules and 
regulations which crush the living daylights out of companies and 
their ability to be aggressive, mobile and nimble in creating jobs 
and survive.
<P>
	The government must work with its provincial counterparts to 
develop ways to streamline the systems, the rules and regulations 
that are completely necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9164"> 9164 </A></B>
<P>
	Everyone in the House knows that we are one of the most, if 
not the most, overgoverned democracies in the world. We do not 
need that. It is the taxpayer who is paying for it. In essence the 
tax system, overspending and the debt are a noose around the 
private sector and every Canadian, and around our social 
programs. We have to remove it from around the necks of 
Canadians and put forth good, strong economic policies that will 
get people back to work and strengthen the social fabric.
<P>
	The government likes to trumpet employment statistics. The fact 
is that we have been suffering from the worst and longest 
unemployment record since the depression. This Liberal 
government and the preceding Conservative government are 
directly responsible.
<P>
	If the Canadian people would like to see a change they should 
vote for the Reform Party in the next election. However, before 
they do they should look at our policies and compare them to those 
of the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP. Compare policy to 
policy and idea to idea. Canadians must get involved.
<P>
	It is also essential to remove other barriers to trade. The 
government had an opportunity to decrease the interprovincial 
trade barriers. Did it do it? No. It touched and nibbled around the 
edge. There are more barriers to trade between my province of 
British Columbia and Ontario than there are between any province 
in Canada and the United States. Does this make sense? It is 
absolutely absurd.
<P>
	The government also has to decrease taxation levels. The GST 
should be scrapped as soon as possible. There is a model we can 
look to. In 1992 the Conservative government decreased taxes 
temporarily. What happened to government revenues? They went 
up. What did the government then do? It started to tax wildly and 
government revenues went down. Think and listen. There are 
examples which we can draw from.
<P>
	In conclusion, if we are to get substantial changes and if we are 
to achieve our potential, then the place to change first is Parliament 
because it is not a democracy; it operates more a medieval fiefdom 
and gives democracy a very bad name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take a few moments to respond to the hon. member's 
comments.
<P>
	I will go down the list, but first let me state that I do agree with 
him that our tax system needs to be looked at and simplified for 
each and every Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure the member did not become a medical practitioner by 
being stupid. The member said that if this government had listened 
to the Reform plan two and a half years ago we would have been 
better off. I would like to remind the member that not only did we 
listen to the people of Canada but even his own members listened 
to  us and applauded us. It was after our previous budget when their 
own finance critic was the first one to stand up and lead the 
applause after the budget was presented.
<P>
	It is so ironic because on two occasions the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands stood up and said that this government had 
gone too far and had cut too much. On the very same day I recall 
being in the House when the member for Lethbridge stood up and 
said that we did not go far enough.
<P>
	I do not know what the Reform Party actually wants this 
government to do. We know what we want to do and that is a 
balanced approach.
<P>
	I want to take this a step further because he touched on the health 
care system. I want to use the example of Ontario which most 
recently has put close to $400 million back into the health system 
and is saying that the $500 million cut slotted for 1998 most likely 
will not take place.
<P>
	The national forum on health not too long ago announced that 
the problem with the health system is not that we do not have 
enough money in it but that we have to simply spend the money 
wiser. Having that feedback, we as a government took it a step 
further and talked about putting $50 million back into the program 
for the next three years. We also talked about introducing the 
pharmacare program. That is why we are going to insist on 
protecting the program.
<P>
	When he talks about social conscience, let us recall that in their 
presentation just a year and a half ago, their approach to taking care 
of our seniors and the needy was to turn them over to the 
communities, the social services, the relatives and the charitable 
organizations.
<P>
	They say they want to get rid of the GST, scrap the GST, as the 
member stated a minute ago. In their own platform they state they 
will hold on to the GST until they balance the budget and then they 
will address it.
<P>
	If they were elected would they scrap the GST immediately or 
not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are a lot of questions that the hon. member asked me and I would 
like to go through a few of them because I do not have enough time 
to go through all of them.
<P>
	The first thing I would like to say concerns the government's 
claiming it is the great defender of health care by putting a few 
hundred million dollars in. That may be well and true, but if you 
put a few hundred million dollars in after you have removed $7 
billion in transfer payments, what kind of arithmetic is that? Take 
away this much and give this much. I am sure the provinces will be 
absolutely ecstatic to hear that.
<P>
	Looking at any place in the country will show the devastation in 
our health care system, lengthening waiting lists and people 
suffering. However, I will not get into the specifics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9165"> 9165 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the health care forum, those people were 
selected by the government to get the result that the government 
wanted. When the asked members on the health care forum 
whether surgical waiting lists were becoming longer and longer, 
the response by some of the members was that is because doctors 
do not want to work. That is what the members of the health care 
forum said. They said that doctors do not want to work and that 
is why we have increasing waiting lists.
<P>
	The Minister of Health likes to say, as my hon. friend mentioned, 
that the answer is not more money but better management. That is 
like saying we are in favour of sustainable development. It is 
another motherhood statement. We need specific solutions as to 
how we are to provide Canadians with health care when they need 
it. Not once in the three years that I have been here have I ever 
heard one constructive solution as to how we are to make sure that 
Canadians will get their health care when they medically need it. 
All we hear is better management.
<P>
	I have asked the Minister of Health time and time again what is 
meant by better management. Not once have I ever received one 
single iota of an example or a constructive solution to resolve or 
explain that statement.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We have put forward constructive solutions. They may not be 
what the government wants but they are what the Canadian people 
want.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in rising to speak on the 1997 budget I want to look at 
some of the facts.
<P>
	The Liberals announced a deficit target of $19 billion. However 
hitting the deficit reduction target still leaves us $17 billion to$19 billion short of what we are spending this year. It is not really a 
success story.
<P>
	The national debt will reach over $600 billion this year, an 
increase of $111 billion since the Liberals took office. By April it is 
expected to hit the $600 billion mark but there is no plan to reduce 
it.
<P>
	Since the Liberals took office tax revenues have increased by 
$30.4 billion or $2,250 per taxpayer. Yet we hear constantly that 
there are no tax increases. Surely the Liberal government's most 
outrageous statement regarding our nation's finances must be that 
the government has not raised taxes during its mandate.
<P>
	As we saw in this year's budget speech the Minister of Finance 
went a step further and made the claim that in last year's budget 
and in this year's budget they had not raised taxes at all. Regardless 
of whichever way we look at it, taxes have risen in each and every 
year of Liberal rule. In fact there has not been a single year when 
the overall tax burden was reduced.
<P>
	What about personal income taxes, the most odious of all taxes? 
They are on their way to reaching record highs when measured in 
dollar terms, relative terms or  comparative terms. An example of 
such tax hikes is the 1.5-cent increase in excise tax on gasoline 
which is worth about $500 million a year. The elimination of the 
$100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption is worth about$340 million a year. The clawback of age credit on seniors is worth 
about $300 million per year. Reducing RRSP limits and 
overcontribution allowances is worth about $125 million a year. 
Forcing part time workers to pay employment insurance premiums 
is worth as much as $1 billion per year. The tax on employer paid 
insurance premiums is worth about $210 million a year. Increasing 
the air transportation tax is worth about $40 million per year. 
Increasing the corporate surtax is worth $120 million a year.
<P>
	Since the deficit will have fallen by $33 billion, a full 92 per cent 
of that reduction in the deficit is due to higher revenues, not 
reduced spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Tax increases.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> ``Tax increases'' as my colleague says. In other 
words the deficit is the symptom of a spending problem, not a 
revenue problem.
<P>
	What about protecting health care? By the time the Liberals 
leave office they will have slashed health and education spending 
by $75 billion or 39 per cent. Is this protecting health care? The 
government has cut $7 billion in health transfers to the provinces 
and then let the provinces take the fall for the reduced services. 
This is not protected health care. We are facing a government 
which is lacking in accountability, integrity and responsibility.
<P>
	The Liberal vision is a country where the average taxpayer pays 
$10,200 to the federal government each and every year, and $3,400 
a year is to service the debt alone. As well the Liberal vision is a 
country where 7.3 million Canadians earning less than $30,000 pay 
27 per cent of their incomes to the federal government.
<P>
	With regard to creating jobs, doubling the CPP premiums does 
not bode well for the 1.1 million unemployed Canadians who will 
now become more expensive to hire. Payroll taxes are job killers. 
On top of all this the Liberals have done nothing to address the 
waste and inefficiencies in government.
<P>
	This year we can again expect unemployment and not tax relief, 
bankruptcy, personal insecurity, more contract work, layoffs, 
shrinking income, increasing taxes and another year of record high 
tax burdens.
<P>
	Spending borrowed money is living on borrowed time. We have 
mortgaged the futures of our children and grandchildren and it 
must stop. Today I have some of my grandchildren sitting in the 
gallery. It is their futures I am concerned with as well as those of 
others.
<P>
	Let us take a look at that part of the fresh start plan to make 
government smaller and more effective. I am sure the members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9166"> 9166 </A></B>
<P>
opposite would agree with that. It would  provide tax relief to 
stimulate job creation, end overspending and attack debt. I am sure 
all of us in the House would like to see that happen.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	A balanced budget is a means to an end with the end being a 
smaller, leaner and more focused federal government. A balanced 
budget is not an end in itself. Attempting to balance the budget by 
waiting for tax revenues to catch up to spending simply ignores the 
fact that the current size of the federal government is 
unsustainable.
<P>
	Let us look at our unemployment figures. In 1993 the 
government was elected on the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. Three 
years later Canada still suffered from a jobless rate of 10 per cent. 
Since the Prime Minister took office the seasonally adjusted 
unemployment rate has averaged 9.96 per cent. High taxes go along 
with high unemployment.
<P>
	I would like to use a chart to emphasize some of these items. 
Some points have been made on it. There are a few facts regarding 
the government's failure on jobs. Since January 1995, some 25 
months ago, only 153,000 full time jobs have been created or about 
6,000 jobs per month. There were far less than the 312,000 new 
entrants the labour force needed. In the same period 121,000 part 
time jobs have been created or about 4,800 a month. Also over the 
25 months since January 1995 the economy has added only 
274,000 jobs or 10,960 per month. At the same time the labour 
force has grown by about 12,500 per month.
<P>
	We are getting the picture here. The need is not being supplied. 
The result has been a 37,200-person increase in unemployment 
since January 1995. Since taking office the Liberals have presided 
over a level of unemployment that has averaged 1,490,000.
<P>
	We must stress that unemployment now is not a global problem. 
The Prime Minister likes to say his record is the best in the G-7 
group. but I would like to clarify this. The Prime Minister likes to 
compare our job creation performance with that of European 
countries. I draw to the attention of the House that the comparison 
is irrelevant since the economies are so different.
<P>
	Better comparisons might be found with the United States, with 
Australia and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom where 
performance has been much better than in Canada. In Canada it is 
9.7 per cent on this chart whereas in the United States it is 5.3 per 
cent. In the United Kingdom it is 6.7 per cent. In Australia it is8.6 per cent. In Japan it is 3.3 per cent. In Austria it is 7 per cent. In 
Sweden it is 8.7 per cent. In Switzerland it is 5.3 per cent. Those are 
all lower than Canada's unemployment rate. We have to take a look 
at that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Spinning a myth.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> ``Spinning a myth'' as my colleague says. 
Absolutely.
<P>
	On failing to hold the line on taxes, I should point that the 
Liberals have hiked taxes 35 times since taking office. Some 
examples include forcing employees to pay tax on employer 
provided life insurance benefits and eliminating the capital gains 
exemption that benefited hundreds of thousands of middle class 
taxpayers. It is awful. Who gets hurt again? It is always the middle 
class.
<P>
	Tax revenues will be $24.5 billion higher in 1997-98 than they 
were in 1993-94, an average of $6 billion a year. Of this$24.5 billion about 30 per cent is due to the combined effects of 
Liberal tax hikes and Liberal inflation tax.
<P>
	Canadians paid an average of 23.3 per cent of their personal 
income in direct taxes and other payments to governments in the 
1990-96 period, up from 20 per cent in the 1980s and up from12.3 per cent in the 1960s. Americans by comparison paid 17.5 per 
cent.
<P>
	A full 7.3 million Canadians earning less than $30,000 owed 
$10.7 billion in federal tax in the 1994 taxation year. It makes no 
sense for the Liberals to talk about child poverty-we keep hearing 
that word-when they are forcing low income parents to pay taxes.
<P>
	The Liberals have been milking the employment insurance 
system to meet their deficit reduction goals. The real disposable 
income of the average family of four has fallen by $3,000 since 
1993.
<P>
	I see my time is almost up. The budget does not bode well for the 
future. The Prime Minister has already stated that he will increase 
spending if the Liberals manage to balance the budget. He claims 
that across the board tax cuts are not the right thing to do in a 
society like Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	If Canadians trust the Liberals again it will not be long before 
another deficit crisis rears its ugly head. This is a slippery slope, I 
hope Canadians will say they will not put up with it any longer at 
the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two short questions for the hon. member.
<P>
	First, the hon. member said that the government took office in 
1993 with a $42 billion deficit which it has brought down to$17 billion. She said that was not an achievement. Compared to 
what?
<P>
	If we consider the record of the previous government, which was 
in power for nine years, I am sure the majority of Canadians would 
agree with me that this was a fantastic achievement. It may not be 
enough but it was a fantastic achievement to bring the deficit down 
by about 50 per cent. I ask her to comment on that.
<P>
	Second, she did not mention that an average Canadian who has a 
$100,000 mortgage or a bank loan is saving about $6,000 net net on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9167"> 9167 </A></B>
<P>
yearly payments. If we multiply  that by a five-year term mortgage 
it will mean a net net saving of $30,000.
<P>
	I ask the member to show me a government in the world that 
provides that kind of opportunity to taxpayers within a 3.5-year 
period. That point should also be made.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member replies to those two points.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions.
<P>
	There is a lot of deceit-and I hate to use that word-in the way 
the government has manipulated its figures. It is true that it has cut 
the deficit in half, but that has been done through increased taxes. 
As I pointed out in my speech, we have had 35 to 36 tax increases. 
Those increases cannot be denied.
<P>
	What are the results of those tax increases? We have an 
unhealthy economy in the marketplace. We have fewer jobs and we 
have higher unemployment. We cannot get away from those facts.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is almost two o'clock. We will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
invitation of the Comité de solidarité tiers-monde de 
Trois-Rivières, some 9,000 people made clear to the Prime 
Minister of Canada their desire to have the federal government cut 
its military spending and use the money to keep social programs 
and fight poverty.
<P>
	The campaign was supported by many well known individuals 
from the Mauricie, including the bishop of Trois-Rivières, Mgr. 
Martin Veillette, and by some 30 boards of directors of popular

<P>
	So, while Quebec and Canada have been hit broadside by 
increased poverty and the number of people who have been left out

<P>
	I put forward the motion to bring accountability to the House for 
Private Members' Business which is referred to standing

<P>

<P>
	The need for this legislation became obvious to me from my

<P>
	Although unanimously passed by the House at second reading, 
the grandparents bill was buried in committee, like many others 
sent to committee by the House, with no apparent reasons given.
<P>
	It is this lack of accountability to the House, the arrogance of 
simply dropping an issue raised by the House that Motion No. 267 
seeks to rectify by simply requiring committees to report their 
conclusions to the House.

	In Yukon the youth empowerment and success drop-in centre 
will lose its core funding as a result of this decision by the Liberal 
government. Youth workers in Carmacks, Yukon and other 
locations from coast to coast are threatened with losing their jobs. 
The young people who benefit from these programs will have 
nowhere to turn.
<P>
	Ending successful programs for young people is yet one more 
example of this Liberal government's deficit cutting with no 
vision.
<P>
	Successful programs which help Canadians be more

co-operative housing empowers Canadians to build active,

its very integral function in Canadian society.
<P>
	The recent decision by the Ontario government to off-load 
responsibilities over co-op housing to municipalities further 
threatens its viability. I commend the minister responsible for 
CMHC for looking into the implications of this move by the Harris

transfer of federal responsibilities over co-op housing to provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada has put forth a 
proposal to create a non-profit entity which would assume the 
administration of the federally funded co-op housing portfolio.

Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois severely criticizes the federal 
government for its inconsistent decisions and its mistakes, as 
former minister André Ouellet called them, in the matter of the 
Montreal airports.
<P>
	As Senator Pietro Rizzuto himself admitted Saturday, for two 
years now, the federal government has failed to assume its 
responsibilities in looking for a viable solution to ensure the future 
of air transport in Quebec, hence the current confusion and the 
mess we are in.

again, to take the people of the Lower Laurentians hostage on this 
issue by making all sorts of promises on the eve of an election for 
purely partisan purposes.

	The Bloc Quebecois therefore demands that the Standing 
Committee on Transport hold the public consultations promised on 
this issue as soon as possible.
<P>
	In addition, we demand that the committee quickly make 
recommendations to the Minister of Transport after reviewing the

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister ruled out the Bloc's 
suggestion that an emergency debate be held on the war between 
the groups of biker gangs. He washed his hands of it saying that the 
federal government had nothing to do with this question.
<P>
	That is not, however, the opinion of those involved primarily. 
The Government of Quebec and all the municipalities in the 
Quebec City area trying to deal with these biker gangs are 
requesting exceptional measures from the federal government for 
an exceptional situation to help them in their efforts to rid 
themselves of this scourge.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or the Minister of Justice. 
Given the unanimous desire for action on the part of the 
Government of Quebec and municipal authorities, including the 
mayors of Quebec City and of Saint-Nicolas, will the Prime 
Minister or the Minister of Justice admit finally that the federal 
government must also act urgently in this matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I share the concern expressed by 
the hon. member. The most important thing is to protect families 
and communities in Quebec and throughout Canada.
<P>
	I spoke today with Robert Perreault, minister responsible for 
public safety in Quebec. We agreed it would be preferable to meet 
as soon as possible to look at all the possibilities and at all 
available, valid and constitutional approaches. I plan to meet Mr. 
Perreault and the mayors of the Quebec City area municipalities on 
Thursday morning to discuss the situation.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, I am open to looking at all available 
strategies, all valid and constitutional measures to improve the 
Criminal Code and criminal law so as to help the police in their 
fight against organized crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is good news, finally. The Minister of Justice has 
decided to take on the issue.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice if he would agree-we could do it 
unanimously in this House-before meeting minister Perreault and 
the mayors of the Quebec City area, to hold an emergency debate 
here in the House and to table the dozen measures he announced 
yesterday so this House might debate them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, before we have a debate in the 
House, I think we have first to identify the specific measures we 
can take to strengthen the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We must look at the situation, meet those who are involved in 
Quebec and then, if possible and desirable, introduce a bill for 
debate here in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the minister undertake, following this meeting, in 
fact, to take positive steps, either through the introduction of a bill, 
before the elections are held, or through the holding of an 
emergency debate, again before the elections, so that we may deal 
with this urgent matter here?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member and I 
share the same goal, that is, to improve the law and the Criminal 
Code, to help the police. If it is possible, after our meeting 
Thursday morning in Quebec City, to identify specific, valid, and 
constitutional measures, we will adopt them, we will propose them 
here, in the House, for debate.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member or his colleagues have some ideas, I am open 
to them. As I said today to Mr. Perreault, the most important thing 
is to equip the police, validly and constitutionally, with the tools 
they need to fight organized crime and to protect Canadians 
throughout the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we saw this morning, mayors from the Quebec City 
area and the Quebec Minister of Public Security sent a letter to the 
federal Minister of Justice reminding him that, under Bill C-17, for 
which he is taking credit, he has additional powers, but that this is 
still not enough. The minister must go further to stamp out 
organized crime.
<P>
	Given the reply he just provided to the Leader of the Opposition, 
I am asking the minister whether, when he refers to valid and 
constitutional clauses to stamp out organized crime and biker 
gangs, he is alluding to the ``notwithstanding'' clause in the 
Constitution, and whether he is prepared to go so far as to use that 
clause in the fight against biker gangs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is premature to consider such an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9172"> 9172 </A></B>
<P>
option. The important thing right now  is to meet with those 
involved and, as I said, to look at all the options with an open mind.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to Bill C-17, in which we proposed 
several changes to the Criminal Code, so as to strengthen the 
legislation. I hope that with these measures, and perhaps other ones 
which I will discuss on Thursday morning with my Quebec 
counterpart, Mr. Perreault, we will be able to improve the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in their letter to the minister, the mayors and the Quebec 
Minister of Public Security talk about an exceptional situation. 
Exceptional measures are therefore required. I asked the minister a 
very clear question, but he did not answer it.
<P>
	I want to know, if the Quebec government and the vast majority 
of mayors from the Quebec City area who are stuck with this huge 
problem ask him to go so far as to use the ``notwithstanding'' 
clause, whether the minister is prepared to go that route to follow 
up on the request made by these municipalities and those who are 
stuck with that problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to face such 
challenges calmly and to look at every option and every possible 
approach. As I said, it is academic and premature to discuss section 
33, the ``notwithstanding'' clause.
<P>
	I would rather first consult with Mr. Perreault and officials from 
the municipalities of the Quebec City area, to see if it is possible to 
act without resorting to section 33. Again, it would be premature to 
provide a reply to the questions put by the hon. member.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister likes to say that the federal government led by 
example when it came to reducing the deficit but the problem is 
that is just not true.
<P>
	Departmental spending is $8 billion higher than the finance 
minister promised it would be.
<P>
	The Liberals promised with their program review that they 
would reduce departmental spending by 19 per cent, but so far, as 
the minister knows, it has only gone down 9 per cent. This probably 
qualifies in his department as an ``oops''. That is a huge difference.
<P>
	My question is this. Why does the government find it so difficult 
to tighten its own belt by $8 billion when it did not bother it a bit to 
slash health care and education by $7 billion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> That was a real big whopper, that one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> He's in trouble again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Put a cork in it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have implemented program review according to plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Getting people on these whoppers is just not 
acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Today I checked the percentage of expenditure 
decrease department by department. We indicated that we would 
decrease expenditures from $120 billion in 1994-95 to $106 billion 
in 1997-98. The result this year is $105.8 billion. The figures are 
almost exactly at the right point for all the departments. There is 
nothing more to say. We have met our target.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
easy for the minister to make things look good when the 
government continues to bring in billions of dollars more of 
revenue every year. Taxes go up all the time but it just does not 
solve the problem. The budget estimates simply do not lie.
<P>
	The Liberals had a choice and they chose to cut health care and 
education by $7 billion. Regional development spending should 
have been $567 million but instead it has ballooned to over$1.2 billion. That is a difference of $.5 billion. How many hospital 
beds would that $.5 million have allowed to remain open instead of 
the kind of nonsense we see happening here all the time? These 
people chose handouts over health care.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why does the 
government care so much more about regional development than 
health care and education where it has made huge cuts of$7 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again it is necessary to check the real figures. The reason there 
is a difference in the figures for regional development agencies is 
because they administer the infrastructure program and that cost 
has been added to their budgets. This is why their budgets are not 
comparable. Reconciling these figures has to be done by people 
who know the estimates well and know how they are done.
<P>
	We indicated we were going to reduce actual spending by the 
government from $120 billion to $103 billion in 1998-1999. We are 
exactly on track. This is where we will be. The spending of 
departments is going to be reduced by $9 billion which is what we 
said we would do three years ago and we have accomplished it.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not sure there is anyone in the country who would buy that kind of 
mathematics except the people who are sitting on his own benches.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9173"> 9173 </A></B>
<P>
	He talks about reconciling figures. The Canadian public are 
trying to reconcile the facts and the facts are these: Regional 
development is over budget. Canadian heritage is over budget and 
that is no surprise. Industry is over budget. Natural resources is 
over budget. Foreign affairs is over budget. The beat goes on. The 
only thing that the Liberals have managed to cut is funding to 
health care and education. Over and over again we see it.
<P>
	Let me try one more time. How can the Prime Minister and the 
government justify slashing health and education by $7 billion 
when his government departments are $8 billion over budget? Plain 
and simple, what is the difference?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
figures have to be used in such a way that you compare apples with 
apples and oranges with oranges. The opposition is using figures 
that do not do this.
<P>
	The truth is the expenditures in the departments have been 
reduced by 14 per cent while transfers to provinces have been 
reduced using not only cash but tax points by 9.9 per cent. We have 
reduced 40 per cent more than we have reduced transfers to the 
provinces. That is what we have done.

always said that our targets were not the most we would do but the 
least we would do''.
<P>
	It looks like the lowest targets are not the law. In fact, the 
government is not even close to coming in on target. It has spent $8

would take the Liberal-Tory coalition to go back to its old pattern.
<P>

reduction targets laid out in the 1995 budget?

<P>

Liberal math.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the essential spending the government 
cannot bear to cut, such as the $8.1 million announced yesterday by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development for a sock factory 
in Montreal. That must be their high tech initiative. Then there is 
$600,000 for a hotel in Shawinigan. How about this? There will be 
$120,000 spent by the Department of Canadian Heritage for golf 
carts in the health minister's riding. All the while the government is 
closing hospitals around the country.
<P>

is the reason the government has overshot its spending reduction 
targets by a whopping $8 billion?

guess we will let the Canadian population  judge whether our

exactly what they were asking for.

is even more shocking for those who are unemployed and unable to

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> What I said was that the figure did not include 
workers who may now, in our system, continue to work up to a 
certain amount and, now that our system is more flexible, there are 
people who may continue to work and receive EI benefits at the 
same time.
<P>
	If these people are included, the figure is approximately 48 per 
cent, a major improvement. But it is obvious that the system must 
be improved and we must ensure that more and more Canadians 
learn to work with it and I am confident that this figure will go up, 
as it has already been doing monthly.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
unbelievable. The minister is telling us that we should include 
those receiving supplements among the unemployed. But, Mr. 
Speaker, there are no more of  them now than there were before, 
and they have never been included.
<P>
	I ask him whether he is aware that, for 1996 alone, there was$3 billion less available to the unemployed in Quebec and in 
Canada to help them through times of difficulty because of the 
Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, to my surprise, the member has 
obviously misunderstood what I said. She was undoubtedly very 
distracted by certain activities in recent weeks and did not have the 
time to really examine the issue. She is now the one who does not 
understand it.
<P>
	What I told you was not those entitled to the income supplement, 
that is completely obvious. What I said, and the member pretends 
not to understand, is that those now entitled to a certain income, 
because you can work up to a certain amount, are now covered in a 
system that is really much more interesting. That is the situation.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently a young immigrant arrived in 
Montreal with her approved Canadian residency papers but was 
refused entry into Canada by the Canadian immigration officer 
because Quebec had not granted her the right to live in Quebec.
<P>
	While the Canada-Quebec accord permits Quebec to select 
economic immigrants to that province, it also acknowledges that 
every person with permanent resident status is granted mobility 
rights, equal protection and equal benefit without discrimination.
<P>
	What right did the minister's department officials have to deny 
entry to an immigrant who arrived in Quebec with documents 
which stated that this individual has been approved for residency in 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that, under the 
1991 Canada-Quebec agreement on immigration, Quebec has 
power over the selection and settlement of immigrants.
<P>
	What does this mean in reality? When a person wants to 
immigrate to our country, and wants to settle in the province of 
Quebec, Quebec's and Canada's offices abroad work together, so 
that the person arrives at our borders with a Quebec selection 
certificate in hand, as well as a permit to settle in Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in the case in question, the person had neglected 
to bring the Quebec selection certificate. So the problem is only a 
technical one. But I can assure the hon. members of this House that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9175"> 9175 </A></B>

the Canada-Quebec  accord is working very well at the present time

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

Ontario because this person was not going to reside in Ontario but 
in Quebec.
<P>
	This is just another example of the government's policy of 
exclusion that treats people differently across the country. This is 
still a united country and it would be nice if the government acted 
as if it were.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to instruct Canadian immigration 
officers that approval for permanent residency in Canada is valid 
from coast to coast to coast?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleague to 
read the Constitution of Canada wherein it is stated very clearly 
that immigration is a shared responsibility between the Canadian 
government and the provinces.
<P>
	When provinces such as Quebec, Manitoba and others want to 
take on the responsibility of immigration we are very pleased. We 
all realize the provinces also have a role to play in integrating 
immigrants into our country.

question is for the minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage

<P>
	For nearly a year now, the minister has been announcing that she 
was on the verge of negotiating with the provinces the transfer of 
all federal social housing programs. When questioned on this by 
the Bloc Quebecois, close to ten months ago now, the minister 
stated that negotiations were progressing well, and implied that an 
agreement was imminent.
<P>
	Now that her government has settled with Saskatchewan, and is 
exhibiting all sorts of good intentions on the eve of an election, will 
the minister act in good faith at the negotiating table, in order to 
finally reach agreements with the other provinces, Quebec among 
them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

said, we have signed an agreement with the province of 
Saskatchewan. We are preparing to sign another, this week 
probably.
<P>
	As for Quebec, we shall continue to work with them. They know 
what we have on the table, and they can look at the agreements we 
have completed as well. We shall continue our efforts in order to 
keep our promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
Quebec has faced a $120 million annual shortfall for more than ten 
years in this area, can the minister promise during the negotiations 
under way that Quebec will receive fair and full financial 
compensation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

poses a threat to the well-being and health of thousands of my

<P>
	Will the minister tell us what he is doing to address the serious

question, not because of the essence of the question but because he 
brings a knowledge and base to the House which remind us of just 
what a shortfall there is. We can talk about quality housing and 
training but we have to walk the talk, which means taking our 
dollars and focusing them on where the need is.
<P>
	I am pleased to report to the member that over the next five years 
we will allocate $140 million in extra money. In 1996-97 there will 
be a package of $352 million. In Manitoba generally there will be 
an additional $28 million.

<P>
	Last month the minister had the honour of having a research 
centre in Israel named after him. I am sure it is only a coincidence 
but only two days before the announcement of the naming of the 
Art Eggleton Centre of Molecular Medicine Research, a 
biotechnology centre, his department announced a grant of $3

<P>

<P>
	Is the minister purchasing personal monuments with Canadian 
taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very honoured by the Technion Institute's 
gesture which I think is a recognition of Canada's involvement in 
helping to support that fine institute.
<P>
	The Canada-Israel Industrial Research Development Foundation 
is a totally separate matter. It is a totally separate fund that was 
established some three to four years ago to help promote a 
matchmaking between Israeli firms and Canadian firms for 
research and development in high technology co-operative areas.
<P>
	That has produced a great deal of jobs in both Israel and Canada. 
It is a very solid and a very good program. It is in no way connected 
to the great honour that the Technion Institute bestowed upon me 
and upon this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
reminds me of the Carly Simon song: ``You're so Vain'' You 
probably think this question is about you, don't you?
<P>
	There is a cyclotron in Chalk River, a world class research 
institution in Canada. The government is to shut it down. It is likely 
to cut it up for scrap. All it needs is $3 million to keep it open.
<P>
	If the people at Chalk River promise to name the cyclotron after 
the minister, will he grant it the money to keep the cyclotron in 
operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

tremendous results in terms of promotion of trade and investment 
opportunities both in Israel and in Canada. It is creating thousands 
of jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	That is the trade and opportunity that have arisen out of the

at the matter.
<P>
	There is a mission of OSCE members right now of which Canada 
is a part to determine what kind of initiative might be helpful to 
bring stability to that area. That is why there have not been any 
specific recommendations. Therefore we as a government do not 
respond until we receive the proposals put forward by the European

Speaker, documents from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada show 
very clearly that the government is using taxpayers' money to fund 
research into increasing the addictive potential of cigarettes. I 
quote: ``They want to improve the level of nicotine and focus on 
higher nicotine content''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. As leader of the 
government how could the Prime Minister possibly justify using 
Canadian taxpayers' money to find ways in which to increase the 
addictive power of cigarettes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the foundation of 
that question is absolutely wrong. I believe the statements being 
used were statements regarding a program we had in P.E.I. that was 
looking at the viability of growing tobacco in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We did research. We looked at all aspects of growing tobacco 
plants in Atlantic Canada. We found through that research the 
nicotine levels of the plant itself were not suitable to meet 
international standards. Therefore we no longer do research in 
Atlantic Canada. As well, no commercial tobacco is being grown in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The direction of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been to 
reduce tobacco research. There has been a tremendous decline by 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in doing research in tobacco 
over the last 10 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is absolutely unbelievable. The nicotine content of 
tobacco has increased 53 per cent in the last two decades. It was 
still taking place at the end of last year.
<P>
	On the one hand we have the Minister of Health holding up a can 
of tobacco and saying it is really bad. On the other hand we have 
the minister of agriculture investing taxpayers' money into 
increasing the addictive potential of cigarettes. What is going on 
here?
<P>
	The government has gutted $4 billion of transfers to health care. 
Yet it finds $2 million every year to research ways to increase 
nicotine levels in tobacco. The member has it all wrong.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister immediately stop using taxpayers' 
money to fund research to increase the addictive potential and 
power of tobacco?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
explain to the hon. member that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
does research with regard to tobacco plants. The nicotine levels in 
tobacco plants are set by industry standards that are very closely 
held.
<P>
	There is no question when we talk about a tobacco plant growing 
in Canada that there has been a definite reduction in the amount of 
nicotine in each tobacco plant. However that is not to say there has 
not been an increase in cigarettes, which is quite a different 
question when it comes to tobacco and the use of tobacco in 
cigarettes.
<P>
	I might point out that Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's 
research has declined some 90 per cent in the last 10 years. That is

Canada is.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; and of 
the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to be given this opportunity to participate in the 
debate on our most recent budget. There are many positive details 
in the budget but will focus on a few issues which are very 
important to me and to the constituents of Scarborough Centre.
<P>
	First I will touch on the measures we have taken with respect to 
supporting small and medium size businesses. I speak from 
experience when I say that I know the importance of a strong 
support network which is indeed instrumental in allowing small 
businesses to grow. Before I entered the political arena I too was a 
small businessman. I believe the growth of small and medium size 
businesses is essential to the creation of jobs for all Canadians.
<P>
	Our government believes that small businesses will remain a key 
source of continued employment growth in the years to come. The 
small business sector now accounts for over half of all private 
sector employment. The impact of this most important initiative is 
the profound way it will continue to be relied on as our growth and 
economic initiatives for today and the future. Because of the 
importance of small business, the government has been working on 
ways to make life easier for the owners.
<P>
	One measure that was announced in this year's budget is the 
quarterly remittance of statements. The joint forum to reduce paper 
burden on small business identified frequency of remittance as a 
major irritant and recommended that quarterly remittances be 
made for small businesses. Monthly remittances impose a great 
burden on small businesses, as they do not normally have the in 
house resources that larger companies have.
<P>
	The budget proposes allowing small businesses with average 
monthly remittances of less than $1,000 complete with a good 
record of compliance for payment of income tax and other payroll 
deductions to be remitted on a quarterly basis as opposed to a 
monthly basis. This will potentially affect approximately 650,000 
businesses, representing 56 per cent of all businesses.
<P>
	Also announced in this year's budget is the raising of the lending 
ceiling for small business loans from $12 billion to $14 billion. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9180"> 9180 </A></B>
<P>
Since the Small Business Loans Act is expected to hit its$12 billion ceiling by July 1997, the government has raised it by$2 billion to ensure that loans can continue to be made in both 1997 
and 1998.
<P>
	For any of the other small business organizations, the loan act is 
something that I believe small business should access and tap into 
with respect to supporting them when it comes to expansion, to 
purchasing equipment or expanding the business, fixed assets et 
cetera. This program has proven to be extremely beneficial to the 
small and medium size businesses right across the country.
<P>
	Our government has also lowered the EI premiums which in turn 
helps employers and employees. In 1993 EI premiums were pegged 
at $3.30 per $100. Today they are at $2.90. This budget has clearly 
stated that the premiums will be going to $2.80 by 1998. When we 
add the entire program that is a combined savings of almost$1.7 billion both for the employers and the employees. I would 
tend to look at that as a tax deduction as opposed to a tax increase. 
Although I use the word tax, I have always termed this type of 
deduction as a premium rather than as taxing.
<P>
	The new hires program which was introduced in the 1997 budget 
will also allow up to 900,000 eligible employers to pay virtually no 
premiums for new jobs created this year. As I mentioned earlier, 
together these measures will combine to almost $1.8 billion in 
payroll deductions for both employers and employees.
<P>
	These measures coupled with the low interest rates, the lowest in 
almost 35 to 40 years, have generated an environment of 
confidence and strong growth within the small business sector.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	As the statisticians and the economists are stating, this trend 
most likely will translate into about 300,000 to 350,000 new jobs in 
1997. I cannot express how important this sector is not only to my 
riding of Scarborough Centre but to all communities across 
Canada.
<P>
	Large firms have been downsizing consistently, 
entrepreneurship has become the in thing of today and this is why I 
speak, as a former entrepreneur and a small business owner, on how 
important interest rates are. When we look at today's primate rate 
at 4.75 per cent, an individual whose running and operating line is 
at an average of $150,000 may be saving 2 per cent or 3 per cent, 
constituting a considerable amount of money at the end of the day. 
When we look at their loan payments certainly the less they pay in 
loan payments, the more they can put back into upgrading their 
company or hiring new staff.
<P>
	When we look at mortgage payments and the rates of today 
which hover around 6.5 per cent for a five year mortgage, maybe 
6.75 per cent, for the average individual renewing their mortgage 
today there is a considerable savings of anywhere from $3,000 to 
$4,000 on an average $100,000 mortgage. I would like to 
emphasize this because this is disposable income that these 
families  or small business people never had three or four years 
ago. This is after tax dollars.
<P>
	Our small business community has become more sophisticated 
and globally competitive, particularly in a technology based 
economy. It is vital we understand that as we move from a resource 
based economy to an information based economy it is important 
not only to support these organizations to expand and invest in 
research and development but that we train our workforce to have 
the tools and the skill sets needed to compete in today's economy.
<P>
	Our government has also shown a willingness to support and 
foster the entrepreneurship spirit that drives the small business 
community. That is why another measure in our budget is to 
increase the funds for Canadian tourism. Funding for the CTC will 
increase $15 million per year over the next three years. Much of 
this funding will go toward increasing Canada's visibility in 
foreign markets. The Prime Minister's trade visits across various 
countries have brought in close to $22 billion in contracts. There 
are companies in my riding of Scarborough Centre that have 
benefited directly as a result of those trade missions. We see our 
trade surpluses today at numbers that we never imagined they 
would be and with the stability of the dollar this certainly enhances 
our economic position both locally and abroad.
<P>
	I want to return to the tourism industry. This industry has huge 
potential for employment creation and by infusing money within 
that industry with more funds we can encourage and continue 
interest in that area. The other dimension in supporting the tourism 
industry is that it gives us an opportunity as a nation to showcase 
our country from sea to sea.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to encourage Canadians to 
visit other parts of this country. Maybe we could entice Canadians 
to travel within our country by some form of tax breaks and rebates 
at the same time.
<P>
	I congratulate the Minister of Finance on his continued balanced 
approach to fiscal responsibility. After being elected three and a 
half years ago our government pledged to get our financial house in 
order. We have set firm two year rolling targets and this will be the 
third year in a row we have met and bettered our deficit targets. Our 
1996-97 results will be more than $9.5 billion below our deficit a 
year ago. That is the largest year to year decline. We are clearly on 
track to meeting our deficit targets for the next two years;$17 billion for 1997-98 and $9 billion for 1998-99. This means 
Canada will enter the new millennium in a position to eliminate 
financial borrowing needs. Once again we will be in control of our 
own country. We will have reduced the deficit to zero and we will 
be able to say that we are number one in the G-7 countries.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9181"> 9181 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Often the opposition refers to EI and Canada pension plan 
contributions as payroll taxes. I would like to take this opportunity 
as a former business owner to say that when I hired an individual, 
UI deductions or Canada pension contributions were not a deterrent 
in hiring new employees. I looked at it as part of the benefit 
package that the company had to offer.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to make it clear when 
talking about Canada pension contributions that opposition 
members have often used the figure of a 73 per cent increase. It is 
totally unfair when they say it is a tax. Let it be stated very clearly 
that Canada pension plan contributions are simply contributions. It 
is saving today for benefits in the future.
<P>
	Probably each member in the House drives a car. Every year he 
or she pays insurance premiums, expecting nothing back. I hope 
that none of us ever has a car accident because only then would we 
access the program. Similarly, we pay unemployment insurance 
hoping that we never lose our jobs, but on the chance we might be 
laid off or are out of employment we can access that program.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on earlier debates in the House 
with respect to the health programs and the slashing that has 
supposedly gone on. Earlier in the debate-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Forgive me for interrupting you but I need a 
clarification. The information that I have is that you are going to be 
splitting your time. Is this not the case?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention at 
the beginning that I would be sharing my time with the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is my problem. Technically you still have 
nine and a half minutes of a 20-minute speech. If you would like to 
continue you may have that time because you will not be splitting it 
as far as I can see. Is my interpretation correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will continue my presentation. I 
want to touch on transfer payments and the cuts that have often 
been mentioned during this debate. Earlier on there were comments 
about a $7 billion cut in health care. We are being intellectually 
dishonest when we stand up in this honourable House and make 
those kinds of statements.
<P>
	We know very well that it was not $7 billion to health cuts alone. 
This was $7 billion spread throughout the country. I would like to 
use Ontario as an example because that is where my riding is 
situated. Ontario's hit was $1.2 billion. In the election of 1995 
before the current government took over in Ontario, the former 
government headed by Bob Rae just before the election gave out 
almost $1.6 billion in handouts. I can break  down exactly where 
these handouts were but the question many people had was where 
the money came from.
<P>
	I would like to repeat that Ontario's reduction was $1.2 billion. 
Most recently the Conservative government in Ontario stated that it 
was going to put back into the health program almost $400 million. 
It also indicated that the additional $500 million that was slotted to 
be taken out of the program in 1998 most likely will not be taken 
out. Therefore, when we take those two figures of close to$900 million that in essence almost adds up to the type of shortfall 
that Ontario will be receiving.
<P>
	Let us be very clear about it. The closure, reduction or fine 
tuning of certain hospitals is not as a direct result of the less money 
going to specific provinces. That is a political decision of the 
respective governments, in this case the governments of Ontario 
and Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I would like to touch on tax relief. Earlier today we heard the 
leader of the Conservative Party indicate that he is going to reduce 
taxes immediately. Where is the money going to come from to try 
to balance the budget and give a tax break at the same time? The 
people of Canada know, because economists have spoken about it 
often enough, that we are on track. The underlying message is that 
we are headed for a balanced budget and we are very proud to say 
so.
<P>
	Once the budget is balanced, what will we do with the surplus 
that we will hopefully have? The debate then will be, do we start 
eating away at the debt or do we rebuild some programs?
<P>
	One big point we have debated over the last while has been the 
Canada pension plan. In the 1950s and the 1960s it was our 
responsibility to bring forward these programs. The challenge 
before us today is to make sure these programs are secure, not just 
for us and our children, but for generations to come. I believe the 
approach being used to secure the future of the pension program is 
the only way to go.
<P>
	If we look at the alternatives that the Reform Party has put 
forward, using the example of Chile, today almost 40 per cent of 
the population of Chile have no benefits, no programs or pensions 
whatsoever. We can talk about super RRSPs or private pension 
programs. Most recently we read about the Route Canada program 
which after so many years is now starting to clear the company 
pension program.
<P>
	In response to a question, the Minister of Finance indicated the 
difference in the Canada pension plan. There is one word I would 
like to stress and that is secure. Confederation Life unfortunately 
went into bankruptcy. What happened to the pensions and the 
savings?
<P>
	There was an article in the paper not too long ago about the 
difficulties the retail store Eaton's is going  through. It says here: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9182"> 9182 </A></B>
<P>
``Eaton's eyeing pension surpluses''. If I had a private pension plan 
that I had no control over and a large organization is controlling 
that pension program and something unexpected happens, where is 
the protection? There may be some protection.
<P>
	It has been claimed that the Canada pension plan has been 
exploited in a very extreme way. I would like the opportunity to put 
my constituents at ease by saying that the Canada pension program 
is one that now has been put on a solid footing. The money will be 
invested and reinvested. An independent group will be looking 
after it and, for example, investing much as teacher's pension funds 
or the firemen's fund are invested.
<P>
	I am comfortable responding to questions from my constituents 
when I tell them they have no worries. The Canada pension plan is 
there today and will be here tomorrow.
<P>
	Another important issue which I believe will be before us during 
the next election is the question of health. The National Forum on 
Health stated that the problems with the program are not monetary. 
There is enough money in the programs. What did we do as a 
Liberal government? We said we would like to go a step further and 
add an additional $50 million over the next three years.
<P>
	I recall some comments I heard from my constituents in 
Scarborough Centre when speaking of the provincial government. I 
was hearing comments such as: ``Why do we have just over10 million living in Ontario and 11 million health cards?'' That 
does not make sense. What we have to do with our health system is 
spend our money wisely. We do not need four managers for ten 
staff, for example. That is the restructuring that is going on within 
the hospital environment.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	It has been noted in the past that Reform Party members would 
like to see us take a much more aggressive approach to reducing the 
deficit. We know their statistics. We know their numbers. What 
good will it do to slash and burn from day one only to come back to 
re-energize? Who will we bring back to life? The dead patient? It is 
too little, too late.
<P>
	We have taken a balanced approach, a humanitarian approach to 
cutting. As a government we have also taken our hits. They have 
been clearly noted. We are looking at supporting the health 
program in the best way we know how. I want to tell that to my 
constituents in Scarborough Centre and to anybody else who is 
listening.
<P>
	I also hate it when they talk about the 73 per cent increase. Why 
do we not take the Canada pension plan and go through it step by 
step. Today we are paying almost 6 per cent. Next year it will be6 point something. What is odd here is how Reformers combine the 
employer's share and the employee's share. We know there are also 
private pension programs within company pension programs. That 
is not a tax. I do not understand  how they term Canada pension 
contributions as being a tax.
<P>
	I am not concerned with what the finance department says. I 
know what I said when I was an employer and hired people. When I 
hired people, the deciding factor was not how much I paid in UI 
contributions or Canada pension plan contributions. That was part 
of the employment package. The bottom line was productivity.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to put out a challenge to the private 
sector. We responded to their concerns and put our financial house 
in order. I put the challenge out to the private sector: We have done 
our share. It is high time they do their share and recommence 
hiring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest and incredulity to the hon. member 
who just finished speaking, particularly when he was defending the 
Canada pension plan in the context of his own experience as an 
employer. I found it passing strange that anyone who has ever 
signed a pay cheque would not consider payroll deductions as 
being a tax.
<P>
	As everyone knows, employers do not have an option on payroll 
deductions such as employment insurance or the Canada pension 
plan. They are mandatory deductions which by law must be paid to 
the government.
<P>
	Government documents, including the human resources 
employment insurance recently issued, refer to payroll deductions 
as taxes. The finance minister has referred to payroll taxes as a 
cancer on job creation.
<P>
	What is the number one problem in our country? Job creation. 
Who are the most affected in our country as far as finding jobs is 
concerned? Young males. Who is the most hurt by this? Young 
males. Who are the last hired and first fired? Young males entering 
the workforce.
<P>
	The tragedy of the Canada pension plan is that the government 
was the opportunity to fix it, not tinker with it, It has been 
described accurately as a giant Ponzi plan.
<P>
	I ask the member opposite to pay close attention. Government 
documents indicate that persons who retired in 1976 contributed to 
the Canada pension plan $2,521. Their benefits would have been 
$29,000. They would have had a return 11 times the size of their 
contribution. Someone retiring in the year 2030, who will be our 
children, and in the year 2031, will contribute $472,000 to get back 
$266,000 for a return on their investment of just about half.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member opposite would justify that not to his 
contemporaries but to his children and his grandchildren who are 
paying the freight for the retirement plan for seniors and for the 
debt we leave them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. I thank 
the hon. member for his comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9183"> 9183 </A></B>
<P>
	The question does not respond to the figures he gave between 
the year 1976 and the year 2030. However it is very important 
for the people to know that the Canada pension program is not 
strictly a program of the federal government. We did not simply 
decide that we would do this. The program is administered in 
co-operation between the provinces and the federal government. 
We did not arbitrarily say one day what we were going to do. We 
all know about the negotiations that went on.
<P>
	We agreed to a 10 per cent increase. The fact remains that the 
Reform Party wanted to increase it by 14.2 per cent. If he is 
concerned about the numbers he has given me, in essence he is 
saying these are the numbers we will have with a 10 per cent 
increase over the next six years. He is not saying how wide the gap 
will be with their proposed 14.2 per cent.
<P>
	Their programs do not provide for any disability phase of the 
Canada pension plan. As an employer I looked at it as part of the 
benefit package when it came to hiring staff. It was part of my 
obligation. When we moved over from health premiums and the 
employer had to assume that responsibility I was very happy to 
take it on. I made sure the health program had an infusion of 
money. It was my responsibility as an employer to make sure that 
based on the payroll deductions I had to contribute to the health 
system. That was one way of securing the health system would be 
there.
<P>
	In essence the gap would be wider if we had gone with the 
Reform Party proposal.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Now for a really astute question from the hon. 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure I can live up to this advanced billing, but I 
would make a remark about payroll taxes.
<P>
	Economists look at payroll taxes in the following way. Workers 
are hired at a wage rate of $10. That is what a small businessman 
can afford to pay. The technology chosen, whether to use 
computers and what kind of computers to use, are predicated on the 
fact that the wage cost is $10. A bargain is struck and everybody is 
happy.
<P>
	Then the government decides that as of tomorrow the hourly cost 
of the worker will not be $10 but will be $11. Under those 
circumstances a multitude of companies and employers in Canada 
that could afford to hire someone at $10 can no longer afford to hire 
them at $11.
<P>
	A large number of companies will say that at $10 it is not worth 
introducing an automated machine to take the place of the workers, 
but at $11 some will automate more. The workers will lose their 
jobs or will not be hired if the company expands. That is what is 
taught in Economics 101 in university as being the effect of 
government legislated increases in payroll taxes.
<P>
	I do not care whether the increase from $10 to $11 in the cost of 
hiring a worker goes to the worker's pension or not. It does not. It is 
interesting what happens in the long run. Studies have shown that 
increases from $10 to $11 mean that those who remain hired will 
not get any more pay increases. In the long run it is the worker who 
is paying for the government legislated increase.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell me where he got the information that 
for 10 million people in Ontario there are 11 million care cards 
outstanding? Could he quickly summarize for me how this came 
about? It is an unbelievable statistic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, he would have to ask the provincial 
people. That is where it was from. I want to respond very quickly 
because I know my time is up.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The member for Capilano-Howe Sound is absolutely correct 
and I agree with him. Maybe, because I agree with him, that is why 
he was the first member who applauded our previous budget. As we 
reduce payroll contributions we could entice employers to hire. 
That is clearly stated in the budget.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my presentation in 1993, EI deductions were 
$3.30 per $100. They are down to $2.90. They are going down to 
$2.80. As our economy grows our intentions are to reduce those 
premiums. Hopefully that will motivate employers to hire. He is 
absolutely correct in saying that. Then hopefully we can take part 
of those contributions and increase the savings with respect to the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Gaspé. Will you be sharing 
your time with anyone?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that I was not thrilled with the 
finance minister's February budget. Why? Because the budget 
tabled by the Liberal government is what I would call a lazy 
budget. Let me explain. It is clear from the figures that the Minister 
of Finance has much more breathing room than he lets on in his 
budget.
<P>
	No one can argue with wanting to balance the budget. I believe, 
however, that there is a way to go about it and, when targets are met 
ahead of schedule, one would expect that those who helped create 
this breathing room for the Minister of Finance would recover part 
of the costs, get back some of the money they have given the 
minister. The finance minister should have returned the favour.
<P>
	The theme of this year's budget was: while balancing the books, 
we will combat child poverty. This was the theme. But how does 
this translate into reality? There are  a few subsidies, measures that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9184"> 9184 </A></B>
<P>
are supposed to eliminate child poverty. But what does this mean in 
reality?
<P>
	Practical measures for implementation this year-because 
children are hungry this year, right now-amount to approximately 
$70 million. But-and the Minister of Finance did not talk about it 
this year-he took close to $4.5 billion from the social transfer 
payments to the provinces. What is the impact of that? It means 
that the provinces are also forced to make cuts.
<P>
	The provinces are forced to cut in the health sector, because there 
is a shortfall of $4.5 billion. They also have to cut social assistance. 
All these measures adversely impact on daily necessities, on 
post-secondary education. It comes as no surprise that things are 
not going well in the provinces, that provincial governments are 
forced to cut their payrolls, and that they have to consider 
increasing tuition fees in the universities-even though they 
managed to avoid having to do it this year. The fact is that when the 
federal government makes cuts, someone, somewhere, is adversely 
affected.
<P>
	Again, the recurring theme, which may well be an election 
theme for the Liberals, is that something must be done about child 
poverty. The Liberal government is trying to show that it is 
reducing its deficit but, as I said, barely $70 million will be 
allocated this year, compared to the $4.5 billion cuts to transfers to 
the provinces. I want to say something about the largest cut ever 
made. What makes things even worse, and the Liberals should be 
ashamed of themselves, is that they target the poor in our society, 
namely the victims of this lack of jobs and those who rely on 
employment insurance benefits.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Everyone on the Hill and in this House knows that before 1993, 
the cumulative deficit in the unemployment insurance fund was as 
high as $5 or $6 billion. I realize something had to be done.
<P>
	However, today, and the President of the Treasury Board has 
made no secret of it, in fact he even bragged that there was a 
surplus, today in 1997-this is March 1997-there is a surplus of 
$12.3 billion in the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance says proudly that he balanced his 
budget, he got the money somewhere. He took it out of the pockets 
of the provinces and of those who were hit by the lack of jobs.
<P>
	What could he have done? I will try to give government 
members, the Liberals opposite, a few clues. They will not be able 
to say I do nothing but criticize. Today, I would like to do some 
constructive criticism. There are people on the Liberal benches 
who come from rural areas, who at one time were farmers and 
whose parents were farmers.
<P>
	Here are some rules every good farmer knows: If you have a 
good harvest, you put 50 per cent of the year's  profits in the bank,
<P>
and you reinvest the remaining 50 per cent in the land that helped 
you make those profits. You seed for the next harvest, to make sure 
the next harvest will be just as good.
<P>
	Now the government has just taken $12.3 billion out of the 
unemployment insurance fund, I would have expected the 
government to introduce job creation measures for the people who 
need them. Of course two weeks ago, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development hastily tried to deal with one of the 
sticking points of the employment insurance reform by allowing 
hours to be accumulated for the purpose of calculating benefits.
<P>
	This measure will cost scarcely $245 million and will expire in 
the fall of 1998, after the election. Then we will have to start all 
over again. This is just peanuts, these handouts for people who 
have been hit by employment insurance.
<P>
	What does the budget contain regarding job creation? I would 
remind the House that the Liberals opposite were not elected to cut 
unemployment insurance. They did not have a slogan saying: If 
you elect us, we will cut unemployment insurance. They did not. 
Was they did say was this: ``We are going to create jobs, jobs, 
jobs''. That was the slogan they shouted as they waved the red 
book.
<P>
	What is the government's record on job creation? The only real 
jobs that were created under this government were short term jobs, 
as part of the infrastructure program. There was some highway 
construction and other construction, but the jobs created were only 
temporary jobs in 1994. We are in 1997 now. The effects of this job 
creation program are long gone.
<P>
	So where are the job creation projects and the famous jobs, jobs, 
jobs? If only the government would act as a catalyst for job 
creation. How? I will give them a few more leads.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, we, in Quebec, were asking 
for decentralization. We wanted to see powers transferred back to 
us. The Prime Minister took us at our word and said: ``We are going 
to decentralize powers, in the area of manpower training in 
particular, and transfer these powers back to the provinces''. The 
referendum was held in the fall of 1995. We are now in the spring 
of 1997, on the eve of another election campaign, and nothing has 
been done.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They will make one more promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Transferring powers back to the 
provinces, at least those who have asked for it, would be a good 
way to create employment. The funny thing about it is that 
agreements were signed, but not with the provinces had made a 
request.
<P>
	If agreements were signed regarding manpower training, I would 
expect the applicable budgets to be  transferred back at the same 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9185"> 9185 </A></B>
<P>
time. This way, government would really be brought closer to the 
people, with the provincial government being in charge instead of 
the federal government. Synergy could be gained from these 
budgets.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I would like to see these budgets used to bring people together. 
Projects, not 10 or 20 week projects, would be designed to address 
a common problem specific to a group of people living in a certain 
area. With the available budgets, and the help of the private sector 
maybe, social infrastructure programs could be developed. The 
participants would be working together for at least three years to 
give them time to achieve something.
<P>
	As I said, this is a lazy budget. I wish I had more time to share 
more constructive ideas. In the election campaign, the Liberals will 
boast about successfully bringing the deficit down, but they will be 
very careful not to mention whom they have to thank for that. 
There are the provinces, whose postsecondary education and social 
assistance budgets were cut back, and the unemployed, at the 
expense of whom the President of the Treasury Board and the 
Minister of Finance were able to build up a reserve fund of $12.3 
billion.
<P>
	There is still time, on the eve of the election, for the Liberals to 
give themselves a chance of winning a few seats in Quebec. Put 
something on the table, resolve the manpower training issue and 
give us the necessary budgets for job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member for Gaspé and took note of the fact that 
he described the 1997 federal budget as a lazy man's budget. I am 
not exactly sure how he arrived at that description. Perhaps it is 
because our finance minister makes the job look easy, at least easy 
compared to the performance that we saw for so many years under 
the former Conservative government.
<P>
	He also noted in his speech that the finance minister is ahead of 
the budget projections he laid down when the government assumed 
office in the fall of 1993. It is true that the finance minister is ahead 
of projections and he should be congratulated for that.
<P>
	The hon. member pointed out that since the finance minister is 
ahead of his projections he should be giving something back to the 
Canadian people. I certainly agree with that and that is exactly what 
the finance minister did in the 1997 budget.
<P>
	I remind the member for Gaspé, the House and all Canadian 
people that in the budget there was a $600 million child tax benefit, 
something that had not been  there before. There was a reduction in 
the EI premiums. In addition small and medium size businesses in 
some cases will be able to forgo having to pay EI premiums at all if 
they hire additional employees.
<P>
	There was $300 million for developing and researching new 
ways of delivering health care, something that the Canada Forum 
on Health proposed and recommended in its report. There was $800 
million for the Canada foundation for innovation for universities 
and colleges. Those institutions have congratulated the government 
for that far sighted initiative.
<P>
	There were $50 million for social housing initiatives in the 
budget. There was double the funding for youth employment 
initiatives. There were millions of more dollars for tourism. When 
we put it altogether we have lower interest rates.
<P>
	I noted just today that the Boeing company which has a 
manufacturing plant in my riding announced an expansion of 400 
jobs. Those kinds of things happen as a result of good fiscal 
management.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the 
question put by the hon. member. What I said was that I felt, upon 
reading the budget speech, that once the budget would be balanced, 
the finance minister's objective would be to redistribute wealth and 
to fight child poverty.
<P>
	The hon. member pointed out that the minister announced in his 
budget that $600 million would be allocated to that goal. Again, I 
tell the hon. member that, this year, there is barely $60 million 
earmarked for that initiative. And children are hungry now.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned that children's parents were made poorer, to 
the tune of $17 billion. The provinces were deprived of $4.5 billion 
through cuts to social transfers, while $12.3 billion was taken from 
the unemployment insurance fund, after paying off the first 
accumulated deficit of $6 billion. So, 12.3 plus 6 equals 18; and 18 
plus 4 equals 22 or 23 billion dollars. The government is offering 
$600 million, which is already not much. However, this offer 
includes an amount of only $60 million for this year. This is where 
the problem is; this is what is upsetting. It is an insult to the 
intelligence of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member also pointed out that there is another $800 
million for the health sector, through the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation. Where did the Liberals get that money? They just cut 
$4.5 billion in transfers to the provinces for the health sector. Now, 
we are told that the government will allocate $800 million to 
research. Again, this is an insult to the intelligence of people. And 
this amount of $800 million will not all be paid this year. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9186"> 9186 </A></B>
<P>
government is distributing election  goodies, but does not want us 
to unwrap the candy before the election.
<P>
	I wonder about all this. Will Canadians and Quebecers be fooled 
by such a budget? Imagine how things will be when the Liberals are 
re-elected. They will not hesitate and there will be no candy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
on my colleague, the member for Gaspé, who described the budget 
brought down by the finance minister on February 18 as lazy, I am 
in complete agreement with this expression and I would add that, in 
addition to being a lazy budget, it is an election-minded one.
<P>
	I am going to limit my remarks to employment. To begin with, it 
is a topic I am very concerned about. Last month, the human 
resources development office in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region moved to Jonquière in the neighbouring riding of 
Chicoutimi. According to this office, there was an unemployment 
rate of 17.2 per cent in this region. By simply moving offices from 
one location to another, do they hope to create jobs? This is 
unacceptable. Furthermore, the only reaction I have heard in my 
riding is that an unemployment rate of 17.2 per cent in a region like 
ours is unacceptable, particularly when we know this government 
was elected in 1993 on its famous promise to create jobs. Every 
statistic shows they have not delivered the goods.
<P>
	As for their slogan ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', the people in my riding 
have changed it to ``We are as poor as Job, Job, Job'', meaning the 
one in the bible. But let us take a closer look at what the Liberals 
are telling us about employment. First of all, there is the 
infrastructure program, with $425 million in new money. The 
question arises: ``Did this program create jobs?'' The Auditor 
General of Canada himself said it did not. Of course, when there is 
construction, there is a bit of activity everywhere. But afterwards, 
when everything is over, what remains? Do any full time jobs 
remain? None do.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	And here is something worse still, a comment by an alderman in 
Chicoutimi on the infrastructure program: ``This program only puts 
the cities further in debt''. So much for this program, and for job 
creation.
<P>
	Now, moving on to what this government could have done for 
job creation. It is no secret. The unemployment insurance fund has 
a surplus of approximately $5 billion. This government lowered 
contributions by 10 cents. Does the Minister of Finance think that 
10 cents is enough to encourage employers to create jobs? I think 
not. I am not convinced that this can reduce unemployment.
<P>
	As for the unemployed themselves, this budget has just taken 
away their last hope of getting back into the work force. In my 
riding, what they are now being offered are precarious jobs of 
limited duration. Yet people do want  to work. Last month Alcan 
opened up 50 jobs in Arvida. Do you know how many people sent 
in a c.v. to the various employment centres in the region? More 
than 30,000. This shows that people want to work. The unemployed 
are not lazy. They want to work.
<P>
	It would be hard for me not to have something to say as well 
about the unemployed paying off the government's deficit. The 
Minister of Finance could have convinced his colleague to make 
the UI rules more flexible. Why? Because the accumulated surplus 
could have given our unemployed a little longer to find work. But 
he did not. The Minister of Finance has made welfare the only 
prospect for the unemployed.
<P>
	Even worse, this government is helping to increase 
unemployment: 14 jobs were lost in Chicoutimi because the 
Department of Human Resources Development decided to move 
the response service for the unemployed to Shawinigan, in the 
Prime Minister's riding. That is how they create jobs.
<P>
	We are faced with a government that has given up trying to 
create jobs. It seems to me that instead of taking the money of 
needy Canadians to reduce this deficit, it could have created steady 
jobs for people. Steady jobs mean people who pay taxes. It also 
means people who buy consumer goods. This is what makes the 
economic wheel go round. Of course the Minister of Finance is 
above that sort of thing.
<P>
	If people had jobs it would be a good way for the Minister of 
Finance to bring his deficit down. That is what responsible 
government means.
<P>
	Yesterday, we all saw the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announce a major subsidy for a sock manufacturer. 
Congratulations, but this comes just before an election campaign. 
One wonders whether it takes an election campaign to have this 
government do something about job creation. Considering its 
record during the past three years, I think the answer is yes.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I therefore urge the federal Liberal ministers to come to my 
riding and announce investments. Come and announce new 
businesses, come and tell our unemployed workers that you support 
them, that you are working for them.
<P>
	In concluding I would add the following. The federal 
government should mind its own business. Once again, the Liberals 
are encroaching on areas under provincial jurisdiction. In the health 
sector alone, new funding approved by the federal government 
constitutes additional interference. I wonder why this government 
insists on minding other people's business, replacing and 
duplicating provincial programs by introducing its own maple leaf 
programs.
<P>
	Finally, this budget is just an extension of the flags program of 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. This  government is interested 
in its visibility. That is why they do television broadcasts and send 
flags. I agree that finding a job for an unemployed worker is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9187"> 9187 </A></B>
<P>
spectacular, unless we oblige the unemployed to walk around with 
a placard that says ``Canada'' with the maple leaf on top. Maybe 
that is what our unemployed workers need for the government to 
take notice of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my colleague, whom I would like to 
congratulate. With the unemployment rate in Canada at over 10 per 
cent, in the United States at 5.5 per cent, and in Quebec at 12 per 
cent, I wonder about this inequity.
<P>
	How is it that, for the past 20 years, the unemployment rate in 
Quebec has almost always been 2 per cent higher than in the rest of 
Canada? Sovereignty is certainly not a factor, since it was the same 
when Mr. Lesage and Mr. Trudeau were in power. Does it mean that 
things are poorly distributed in Canada, that research and 
development are channelled more into Ontario and that we are 
being given crumbs, which I would today call misery insurance?
<P>
	I would like to know whether my colleague shares these ideas 
and how is it that the government talks about being prepared to help 
the weakest regions, from sea to sea, when in my riding of 
Matapédia-Matane, no matter what we do, no matter what is 
undertaken, no matter how many Operations Dignity are launched, 
no matter how many public rallies are held, nothing is happening. 
But all we want to do is work where we live.
<P>
	We are not asking for gifts, we just want what we are entitled to. 
I have a very positive example: investing in forestry is a plus. It 
pays the government well in terms of taxes. Instead of being given 
job security benefits, income security benefits or employment 
insurance benefits, people have a job.
<P>
	However, we see that the federal government, which had a plan I 
considered acceptable, profitable for it, made cuts. There is an easy 
answer to this one, that forestry is a provincial matter-that is true 
in part-except that forestry workers pay their income taxes to 
Ottawa, and when they put gasoline in their chain saws, they pay a 
tax to the federal government.
<P>
	I would simply ask my colleague from Chicoutimi whether he 
shares these ideas and what he might propose to have it change?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has just pointed out that, 
in a number of areas, Quebec is not receiving its fair share of 
federal government spending. The result is a shortfall of hundreds 
and hundreds of millions of dollars that businesses could use to 
create jobs.
<P>
	We have only to think of the field of research and development 
where, relative to its population, Quebec is  seriously underfunded. 
There is also the area of military activity: Quebec receives less than 
18 per cent relative to its population.
<P>
	This afternoon, in asking a question to which, as usual, I did not 
receive an answer, I pointed out to the minister responsible for 
social housing that Quebec had come up $120 million short every 
year for the last ten years. That is over $1 billion in ten years.
<P>
	We could have revitalized construction with this money. As they 
say, when the construction sector goes well, so does the economy. 
Factories would have developed materials, produced services, our 
engineers and architects could have put down plans on paper. It 
would have meant work for people.
<P>
	In areas with a real impact on the economy, Quebec is receiving 
very little relative to what it pays. Of course, if you are talking 
about UI, we receive quite a bit. In my riding, the unemployment 
rate is 19 per cent, but this is not the kind of money we want. We 
want money that will allow us to create stable and well paid jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will note at the 
outset that I am sharing time with my colleague, the learned hon. 
member for Kitchener.
<P>
	This latest federal budget confirms that we are well ahead of 
schedule in achieving the Prime Minister's goal of a balanced 
non-deficit budget before the year 2000. In 1993 we inherited a 
record $42 billion plus deficit budget from the Mulroney 
government. Since then we have been reducing the enormous 
deficit on a step by step basis with each of our annual budgets. This 
year the deficit will be down to $19 billion which is $5 billion 
ahead of our own favourable projections.
<P>
	We have decided to stay the course in our goal of a balanced 
non-deficit budget, possibly attainable by 1999 now, and not to 
succumb to the pressures to undertake lavish federal spending 
programs.
<P>
	What we have done, however, is invest in those key areas of vital 
concern to our economic future and our general well-being by 
maintaining our social contract with Canadians and our famed 
social security network which earlier generations of Canadians 
paid for with far higher taxes than their counterparts in the U.S. 
This means a stable national pension scheme with no reductions in 
benefits for those now in retirement. It also means upholding the 
integrity of medicare and, beyond that, also making significant new 
additions to take care of the disabled persons and to maintain and 
extend medical clinics and laboratories.
<P>
	It also means new investment in advanced education and 
scientific research in medicine and engineering as the key boost to 
creating leading edge industries capable of competing successfully 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9188"> 9188 </A></B>
<P>
in world markets and also to providing the long term, highly skilled 
professional jobs that go with that.
<P>
	President Clinton in his second inaugural address on January 20 
spoke about becoming an education president for the 21st century. 
The Prime Minister, in asserting a necessary federal government 
role of leadership in establishing national education and scientific 
standards on a competitive level with other post-industrial states, 
has moved to fill the gap in constitutional power created by uneven 
performance at the provincial level and different, sometimes 
mutually competing, provincial policies and programs.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	The investment in pure research as the basis for long range, 
leading edge technological advances was the key to the German 
and Japanese economic recovery miracles post-war. We are making 
that same investment in advanced education and science now. As a 
result, we have in this new budget a very much strengthened and 
extended federal government program of support and financial aid 
for students and their families designed to provide a flow of high 
calibre professional and scientific graduates into new industries.
<P>
	Taken as a whole, the budget demonstrates our commitment to 
fiscal integrity and to freeing Canadians from the burden of huge 
annual interest payments to foreign creditors. In this way we will 
be able to devote even more of our resources to much needed social 
and educational programs and to move at the same time, when the 
budget is balanced, to reducing taxation.
<P>
	The new budget also has its direct implications for governmental 
structures and processes that go to the roots of federalism. The 
constraints on governmental spending in a period of fiscal integrity 
directed toward the goal of a balanced non-deficit federal budget 
mean that community decision making on major community 
projects that transcend any one level of government, federal or 
provincial, have to be made on a basis of co-operation and of 
common joint problem solving through mutuality and reciprocity 
of interests of the different governments.
<P>
	The federal government and Quebec have for a number of years 
shared decision making over immigration with effective 
co-ordination of federal and provincial lawmaking.
<P>
	Recent inspired initiatives by the Prime Minister and by the 
premier of British Columbia have been directed to human 
resources and to immigration. We have resolved, thereby, some 
longstanding intergovernmental differences.
<P>
	Further agreements could follow in other areas like fisheries, for 
which the basis of co-operation has already been laid in several 
joint federal-provincial commissions for inquiry and study of long 
range goals. This highly pragmatic, empirical, problem oriented 
approach,  proceeding on a step by step basis is the new 
co-operative federalism. It seems to be yielding concrete results in 
easing intergovernmental tensions and ending long festering 
differences. It is, in any case, a refreshing change from that old 
fashioned, essentially abstract, a priori approach to federalism that 
insisted on isolating problem solving into separate water tight 
compartments of lawmaking power, federal and provincial, with an 
absolute ban on the different levels of governments ever working 
together toward a common result.
<P>
	In another, in its own way, unusual parallel development, the 
federal government has opened up the diplomatic processes of 
negotiations over Canadian complaints of non-compliance by the 
United States with the provisions of the Canada-U.S. Pacific 
salmon treaty of 1985, with its important conservation imperatives. 
It has opened it up to input from the main private stakeholders 
involved, the actual fisher people. The Canadian fisher people are 
having a series of meetings with their U.S. counterparts and 
feeding back their consensus and conclusions to the diplomatic 
negotiators on both sides.
<P>
	This is the new pluralism which balances the new co-operative 
federalism. It is an application of a broadly inclusive participatory 
democracy which should see more informed and rational federal 
government expression of Canadian community interests in the 
fulfilment of our international law based treaty rights and duties.
<P>
	The federal system, as we know it, thus continues to evolve, 
undergoing change through developing custom and convention as 
glosses on the Constitution as originally written. This is being 
achieved in concrete, substantial ways, in spite of the seeming 
failure of those rather abstract exercises in the dry light of reason, 
represented by the Meech Lake and Charlottetown projects of 
yesterday.
<P>
	The latest federal budget, by establishing the fiscal parameters 
and necessary financial limits to federal government decision 
making, enjoins a new form of pragmatic, problem oriented 
federalism based on intergovernmental co-operation and shared 
decision making, federal, provincial and municipal; the new 
co-operative federalism.
<P>
	Thus the debate in the House over the present budget makes its 
own very distinctive contribution to the new constitutional law in 
the making.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The budget with its ambitious, imaginative and innovative 
approach opens the way to new ideas in federalism and in the 
structures and processes of government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have in front of me a document issued by the 
Employment Insurance of Canada that has been financed by the 
budget. It has in it a program called the self-employment assistance 
program. Under that program people will be subsidized who have 
current
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9189"> 9189 </A></B>
<P>
claims on EI or who have had their claims exhausted in the last 
three to five years. They will get up to 45 weeks of support, 90 
hours of formal business training, development of a business plan, 
adviser consultations and other goodies.
<P>
	Would the member support a budget that does the following? 
Candidates must belong to one of the five federally designated 
equity groups: women, men 45 years and older, visible minorities, 
aboriginals and people with disabilities.
<P>
	Is a budget which allows an employment insurance program to 
be available to everyone except men under 45 who are not visible 
minorities, aboriginals or disabled good for Canada? Should we 
support a budget that allows this kind of discrimination in the free 
country of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound for his very interesting question.
<P>
	He will be aware from my own discussion in the last few minutes 
that the budget does not operate in isolation, in its own watertight 
compartment. It operates within the general parameters of the 
Constitution and the principle of equality before the law, which it 
therein enshrined contains the very explicit affirmative action 
provision. I imagine the areas he is referring to reflect that.
<P>
	Also a main thrust of the budget is creating jobs, creating 
meaningful education and meaningful training in advanced 
technology for young people. This is the whole thrust of the 
extraordinarily augmented provisions for aiding students and their 
supporting families.
<P>
	I and other members fought very hard for having the federal 
government accept its role of leadership in education. We were 
oriented to the young. The groups he speaks of, under 45-year-olds 
whether white or any other colour, are very definitely the 
beneficiaries of the budget.
<P>
	What we have done by creative extension of federal power to fill 
a gap in decision making we hope to extend for the future. It is a 
very necessary part of the new society as we enter the new century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall try to be 
brief, since I know my colleague for Matapédia-Matane would 
also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans a question.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary spoke of fisheries and of the impact 
of the budget. I would like to draw his attention to the following: it 
is the victims of lack of work, the unemployed, who have made it 
possible for the government to have a lower deficit. My proof: the  
President of Treasury Board has proudly announced that the 
unemployment insurance fund now has a surplus of $12.3 billion.
<P>
	I see nothing in the budget about returning a portion of the 
profits to the victims of lack of work. And because he is the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, I 
wish to ask him a question.
<P>
	With the modifications made to employment insurance, virtually 
all fish plant workers will find themselves without an 
unemployment insurance cheque for three months, during the 
winter. There is still be time for the Liberals across the way to 
amend the budget, to make an addition to it so as to ensure that fish 
plant workers do not end up going three months without an 
unemployment insurance cheque. Does he realize how hard it is to 
fish the Gulf of St. Lawrence when it is iced over?
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member speaks well, I 
feel, of the agreement between the Prime Minister of Canada and 
the Premier of B.C. on maintaining and organizing the fisheries. 
All provinces are free to reach similar agreements. As for 
unemployed fishers, surely the two governments can unite to face 
this common problem. I hope the Government of Quebec will have 
the intelligence and the open-mindedness to follow up and reach its 
own agreement with the federal government.
<P>
	As for the question of unemployment per se, our government has 
created 750,000 new jobs in the past twelve months.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak on the 1997 budget so appropriately entitled 
``Building the Future for Canadians''.
<P>
	Canadians elected a Liberal government in 1993. Our 
government inherited a massive deficit that to most Canadians 
seemed out of control and would likely leave Canada and its 
citizens with limited prospects for personal much less national 
improvement.
<P>
	Instead of sitting back and opting for short term policies that 
lacked vision, the government took the initiative and put in place a 
policy of deficit reduction that has become a model for the 
developed world. Alone among the G-7 nations we will have a 
budgetary surplus before the year 2000. Others are now talking 
about the Canadian miracle.
<P>
	Having exceeded its deficit targets in previous budgets the 
government has once again come in well ahead of its 1997 target, 
placing the deficit at $19 billion and substantially bettering its 
commitment to reduce it to $24 billion or 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9190"> 9190 </A></B>
<P>
	What has this meant for Canadians? This dramatic change over 
the last three years has reduced the cost of borrowing money for 
all Canadians. There is less competition for money. The 
confidence of international markets have driven Canadian short 
term interest rates to their lowest level in 35 years. This dramatic 
turnaround in our fiscal situation will contribute to the creation 
of jobs by making it less expensive for businesses to operate and 
by increasing consumer demand for purchases like houses and 
cars. It means, for example, that someone borrowing to buy a 
$15,000 car will make approximately $500 less a year in car 
payments.
<P>
	Our success in bringing the deficit under control is beyond 
question. Within two years the government will be able to finance 
its operations and service its debts internally without borrowing a 
single new dollar. We will be self-reliant in a way that we have not 
been for almost 30 years.
<P>
	However the budget and the government's vision do not stop 
there. For my constituents and for the average Canadian fiscal 
stability is important but there are also tangible and immediate 
results from the budget.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased by the budget's direction and its 
intention of addressing those issues closely linked to the 
constituency level like the new student assistance package, 
strengthening our social assistance programs and supplying jobs 
through the Canada infrastructure works program.
<P>
	With the renewal of the Canada infrastructure works program 
$425 million in new federal money, along with provincial and 
municipal contributions, will support $1.8 billion of infrastructure 
projects in 1997-98 and beyond. Canada infrastructure works has 
helped create over 100,000 short and longer term jobs. In Ontario 
this has meant updating and improving community infrastructures 
through 5,085 projects with an investment of $2.3 billion and 
creating 39,000 jobs.
<P>
	I am very pleased with the infrastructure renewal since it has 
contributed in the past well over $2 million to my riding of 
Kitchener. This has been most welcome news for the area.
<P>
	Something of particular importance and an issue close to my 
heart is the priority given to younger people in the budget. It is we 
all agree unacceptable that the rate of youth unemployment is 
double the national average. It is a waste of talent and enthusiasm. 
It mortgages our future.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	For this reason I am encouraged to see in the budget a new youth 
employment strategy incorporated into program spending which 
will give assistance for well over 140,000 young people each year. 
It will supply experience for them in summer jobs and internships. 
Some $255 million in funding will give way to career summer 
placements and internship programs with private, voluntary and 
government sectors.
<P>
	Last week in my riding of Kitchener I was involved in opening 
the Lutherwood Youth Employment Centre which had received a 
$96,000 federal grant through Youth Services Canada. This 
opening was conducted by unemployed young people who were 
finding positions under the program.
<P>
	I recall very well the comments many of them made to me in 
their very excellent presentations. One said: ``These kinds of 
programs have given me a chance''. Another one said: ``It picked 
me up from the floor''.
<P>
	Another pointed to a youth entrepreneurship program that had 
been funded in our area by the federal government. This program 
has 10 students at any one time for the past couple of years. Sixty 
per cent of the students of this program now operate their own 
businesses. This is a success story for Kitchener, for Canada and 
for small business.
<P>
	We often hear the story from youth: ``We have no experience and 
therefore we cannot find a job''. We will give them that experience 
and I am sure the jobs will come. The budget addresses these 
problems in an imaginative way.
<P>
	Closely linked to this is the issue of education. Clearly students 
are facing increased fiscal pressures associated with 
post-secondary education. They hear talk of globalization and 
global competitiveness. They are frightened about what this might 
mean for their own futures. At the same time they perhaps hesitate 
to pursue higher education because of rising tuition fees.
<P>
	Other costs associated with university are rising as well. As my 
the member for Waterloo knows so well with two notable 
universities in his riding, universities offer so much for a 
community and their students. They enliven the community, bring 
consumer spending to the community and in general contribute so 
much to the development of the region.
<P>
	In talking to many of the students in our area I realize many of 
them are now working in part time jobs that occupy a crucial time 
that they might devote to studying. With additional pressures at 
home and with additional fiscal pressures it is clear that we had to 
help out our student population.
<P>
	Therefore in the budget we invested in the young and in students. 
I note specifically measures such as doubling the post-secondary 
education credit over two years and the opportunity to carry 
forward the unused portions of credits for application against 
future incomes.
<P>
	This results in a combined federal-provincial tax assistance to an 
average student of up to $1,200. This represents an increase of 
approximately 30 per cent. Moreover, there will be assistance to 
students in their effort to repay loans. The deferral period for those 
facing difficulties in paying loans will be extended from 18 to 30 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9191"> 9191 </A></B>
<P>
months. This combined with a grace period of six  months after 
graduation means students will have up to three years with help in 
managing their student loans.
<P>
	Parents saving for their children's education through the 
registered education savings plan will have the annual contribution 
rate doubled to $4,000.
<P>
	More can, more will and more should be done, but it is clear the 
a government is committed to higher education, to youth and to the 
future. On the issue of strengthening our social assistance programs 
the government is proud of the way it has addressed the needs of 
society's most vulnerable, its children. In particular I wish to note 
the national child benefit system.
<P>
	For years Canadians have agonized over the problem of child 
poverty. The government, in partnership with provincial 
governments, is doing something about it. This is a historic 
undertaking with two levels of government committing to a new 
cross Canada child benefit system, with the foundation being the 
Canada child tax benefit announced in the budget. Helping low 
income working families has always been a priority for Liberal 
governments past and present.
<P>
	It is no surprise that the government has succeeded in working 
out a deal with the provinces to bring a new level of financial relief 
to Canada's families. Over 1.4 million families with 2.5 million 
children will see an increase in federal child benefit payments by 
July 1998. This means that families with incomes under $25,921 
will receive higher federal benefits while those with incomes over 
this amount will continue receiving benefits at the current levels. 
The greatest benefit, and rightly so, will go to those with incomes 
under $20,000.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	We want to provide more assistance to low income families with 
children and help those families escape the welfare trap. Currently 
families on social assistance lose money and many valuable 
benefits when the parents find work. This is an intolerable 
situation. The children of families would actually be better off if 
the family stayed on social assistance.
<P>
	The new Canada child tax benefit will go to all eligible families, 
those working and those on welfare. It will also allow provincial 
governments to take some of the money they currently spend on 
welfare and redirect it to services and programs for working poor 
families, such as child care and drug and dental benefits.
<P>
	We have come a long way since 1993. Sacrifices have been made 
at every step. Some decisions, while not universally popular, have 
been made so that the greater benefit of all is preserved for the 
future.
<P>
	As a Liberal and a committed member of the government, I am 
proud of what we have done and the budget is a sign for the future. I 
applaud the Minister of Finance for his determined work and I look 
forward with  confidence as the Prime Minister leads the country 
into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to the hon. member's 
comments. He referred, among other things, to students. He said 
the government would lend students more money, and that they 
would repay their loans three years later. This is not negligible, but 
there is a contradiction here.
<P>
	When students get into debt, it is not so bad, since it allows them 
to pursue their studies. However, what hope is there for a student 
who is in debt and who does not have a job? Sure, one can say: 
``There is money available. You get an education and we will lend 
you money. You will have three years to pay off your debt''. I know 
students who have been out of school for 15 years and who are still 
paying off their debt. If we lend more money to students, they will 
still be repaying their loans at the age of 75. There is a 
contradiction here to say the least.
<P>
	Let me get to the nub of the issue. Everyone agrees that we must 
reduce the deficit. It is obvious. But how should we do it? I put the 
question to the hon. member. This Liberal government has dipped 
into the pockets of the poor. It has also targeted the middle class by 
increasing taxes. Everyone pays.
<P>
	Then there are the taxes on gasoline. The middle class and the 
poor are always the ones who end up paying. Why is the 
government letting family trusts get away? The banks appeared 
before our committee. I asked Royal Bank officials whether their 
bank would go bankrupt if, for a period of five years, the 
government taxed banks more. Of course not.
<P>
	Banks make billions of dollars in profits. If we get $1 billion or 
$1.5 billion in taxes out of them, over five years, they will not go 
bankrupt, believe me. Why not go that route to eliminate the 
deficit? How many rich families do not pay taxes? Why is it that no 
Conservative or Liberal government can see that?
<P>
	Do you know what is happening? It is easy to figure out why 
governments do not go that route. When we asked the House of 
Commons to adopt the same regulations as Quebec did concerning 
political party fundraising, who voted against that proposal?
<P>
	In Quebec, there is an act which provides that the money 
contributed to political parties must come from individuals, not 
companies. Who finances political parties here? Who puts money 
in the Conservative fund? It is the major corporations. How can 
they go against these major corporations?
<P>
	I almost have my answer. Still, I would appreciate it if the hon. 
member could shed some light on this issue.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question has many parts. To deal 
with the first part, in my speech I pointed out that the government's 
actions in regard to students would greatly increase the amount of 
income available to students during the time they are at university 
or in a post-secondary program. Second, I pointed out that under 
the changed RESP program, parents will have a greater opportunity 
to contribute to the education of children and will be encouraged to 
do so. Third, I pointed out that the deferral period will be expanded 
from 18 to 30 months.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that student debt has been rising at 
an alarmingly high rate. However, student debt is undertaken 
largely by students who graduate from university. The hon. 
member talked about the poor. The working poor and the poor who 
do not work are overwhelmingly persons who do not have higher 
education.
<P>
	Statistics, whether in Quebec or in the rest of Canada, point out 
that those with post-secondary education have an advantage. They 
have a much lower rate of unemployment and they are much more 
likely to contribute through loans. In terms of loan repayment it 
seems to be a way in which those who do gain the benefit of higher 
education in some ways pay for their own education.
<P>
	The hon. member beside me told me that it took him 10 years to 
repay his student loan, and today he has a job. This case indicates 
that those with higher education gain benefits within society, so the 
point being made by the hon. member is not well taken.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's 
Crossing-Unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting 
my time with the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	Each time I stand to speak on the budget, I try to judge it from 
the perspective of the last little baby I delivered before I came to 
the House of Commons. Zachary was a cesarean section and he was 
my last enjoyable duty in the hospital. When he was delivered, 
Zachary owed the federal government a debt of $16,400. 
Lightheartedly I tell my patients that when I was taught to deliver 
babies, to make them cry I patted them on the bottom or patted 
them on the feet. I made Zachary cry when I whispered to him that 
he owed the federal government $16,400. The poor little guy 
blubbered for a week.
<P>
	Today Zachary, who is almost four years old, owes the federal 
government just under $22,000, as does every  man, woman and 
child in Canada. I find that unacceptable. I have listened to cheer 
leading on this issue from the other side. I would like them to face 
Zachary. I would like members opposite to sit down with Zachary 
and explain to him that on his behalf they spent his money. They 
did not ask his advice, they did not give him any choice in the 
matter. Every grandma, every grandpa, every parent and every 
child in Canada today should sit down with this cheer leading crew 
across the way. I would like to give them that opportunity. I guess 
they will get the opportunity in the upcoming election and I relish 
that opportunity.
<P>
	What does the budget document say on health care? It follows on 
a promise in the red book that medicare would be protected and a 
National Forum on Health to make sure health care is going in the 
right direction. The national forum presented its conclusions not so 
long ago, and its conclusions were trumpeted far and wide. There is 
enough money in the system. Use the money more efficiently. 
Improving the health of our children is a wise investment. Those 
were the things that were headlined across this land.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	However, a little issue was missed. When they said there was 
enough money they also said there needed to be this cash floor of 
$12.5 billion. The forum presented information which was fairly 
liberal. They never did say that the floor, according to the 
government of the day, was going to be $11.1 billion. There is a 
discrepancy. It is a little discrepancy. It did not get much play in the 
press. I do not know why. I can only guess.
<P>
	In the budget document on sustaining and improving our health 
care, I found a reinvestment in medicare. There is a reinvestment of 
$300 million over the next three years to be used for new 
initiatives. Here is how that $300 million will be spent.
<P>
	Over three years $150 million will be spent for new projects in 
home care and drug coverage. Interestingly enough, the health 
minister seems to glom on to some of these. He wants to direct 
them to his riding.
<P>
	There will be $50 million for a health information system; 
computers to follow and judge whether we are doing the right 
things in health care.
<P>
	There will be $100 million in increased funding for community 
action for children.
<P>
	That is great. That is $300 million over three years. I saw the 
headlines: ``Good news from the protectors of medicare''. I ask a 
simple question. Do they think all Canadians are stupid? Does 
anybody not remember the $3.9 billion in reductions to medicare 
that are coming in the next three years? Only in light of today's 
government could we have a $300 million reinvestment in 
medicare offsetting a $3.9 billion reduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9193"> 9193 </A></B>
<P>
	What are the results of those reductions? We heard them not 
so long ago in Ottawa where there were major hospital closures. 
We heard them as well in Toronto where there were major hospital 
closures. A couple of weeks ago Alberta confirmed that the 
General Hospital would be closed for good. There are hospital 
closures in the maritimes. There are hospital closures in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In Quebec there are hospital 
closures. Il y a la fermeture des hôpitaux là également.
<P>
	Waiting lines are on the rise for urgent, non-elective care. We are 
falling behind in technology. We have 1.1 MRI machines in Canada 
for 100,000 people and in Germany they have 3.4.
<P>
	Here is what Canada's nurses say about the budget as it relates to 
health care. This is not partisan, political stuff, this is from 
Canada's nurses: ``In the 1997 budget the federal government has 
thrown away a valuable opportunity to demonstrate its supposed 
support for Canada's publicly funded health care system. Federal 
cash transfers for health will now decline until the next century, 
despite the fact that the finance minister's target of spending no 
more than 9 per cent of GDP on health has been reached. The 
federal government has stated that it unequivocally supports a 
publicly funded health care system, but is failing to provide the 
funds to genuinely support this system''.
<P>
	Canada's nurses are not politicians. They are the people who 
deliver the services. That is what they think of this budget.
<P>
	It is always easy to criticize. I do not believe in criticizing 
without presenting solutions that are different. What would Reform 
do differently during the same three year period when we are going 
to have $3.9 billion taken away and $300 million given back?
<P>
	Reform would reduce the deficit to zero by changing both the 
size and the function of the federal government. It would reduce 
grants and subsidies to business. It would take selected crown 
corporations off the public purse completely. It would reduce 
international aid while Canada is broke. It would rip up the MP 
pension plan which is grossly unfair. Reform would do all this to 
pump $4 billion per year back into medicare and secondary 
education. It would do that to repair the Liberal damage and the 
damage of those cuts.
<P>
	The results will have Canadian nurses smiling again.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The national forum on health would have its $12.5 billion cash 
floor. Most important, the patients who are today waiting in lines 
with inferior equipment and in pain would be treated sooner. There 
is actually choice on the scene today when it relates to medicare in 
Canada. It is an alternative to the old view of the Tories, the 
Liberals, the NDP, of big government, big programs, big spending 
and big taxes. It is called the fresh start.
<P>
	I will give a couple of examples of wasteful spending specific to 
health care because they lie in the riding of the Minister of Health. 
Here are some examples that Reform would get rid of: $122,654 
for golf carts in the health minister's riding paid for by the 
taxpayers of Canada thanks to you know who; $33,000 to the Cape 
Breton Yacht Club. Yachters need that money according to the 
Minister of Health. What did Nova Scotians ask for instead? They 
asked for the emergency department at the Windsor hospital to be 
left open. They asked that the Wolfville hospital not have to charge 
patients for bandages, syringes and painkillers, which is what is 
happening today.
<P>
	To my colleagues across the way when they cheerlead about this 
budget and the results that they have seen, I ask them to remember 
Zachary, the little boy who has gone from $16,400 indebtedness to 
the federal government to just below $22,000 in the course of this 
Parliament's sitting. They are happy with that performance. I am 
not. I look forward to meeting with them on the platform to 
specifically ask them to look into Zachary's eyes. If I were in their 
place I could not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, there does not appear to be a 
quorum in the House.

<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>

	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I see a quorum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a real pleasure to participate in this extremely 
important debate.
<P>
	Being a budget debate, it gives us the opportunity to have a fairly 
wide ranging discourse about the affairs of the country. It gave me 
an opportunity in preparation for this discourse to consider some of 
the reasons that brought me into politics in the first place.
<P>
	I am sure that my reasons were really not very much different 
than the reasons of my colleagues opposite or those with whom I 
share this side of the floor. Most of us are here because we want to 
make our country and perhaps even in a greater sense the world a 
better place for our children and for our grandchildren.
<P>
	My motives are not necessarily any more pure or pristine than 
the motives of my colleague opposite. It is clear that I would prefer 
that we addressed our problems in a much more forthright manner 
than members opposite.
<P>
	I am reminded of the words of Ayn Rand. These words help me 
very much in my life and I have tried to share them with people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9194"> 9194 </A></B>
<P>
whenever I can: ``You must deal with  problems as they are, not as 
you would wish them to be''.
<P>
	It seems to me that all too often we in politics tend to deal with 
problems not as they are but as we wish them to be or, worse, given 
a particular situation, we will try however we must to justify the 
status quo. If we have made a mistake, rather than fix the mistake 
we will somehow try to make it right without addressing the core 
problems.
<P>
	In politics, the higher a person is on the food chain, the less 
likely it is that any utterings of that person will be seriously 
challenged by anyone in this place.
<P>
	In ``The Rights of Man'' Thomas Paine wrote that each 
generation has the right and the responsibility to govern for its 
times. The greatest insolence and tyranny of all is the presumption 
of ruling from beyond the grave.
<P>
	Particularly to young Canadians who might be watching this 
debate, how does this enter into the budget debate? What do the 
words of Thomas Paine have to do with our budget debate over 100 
years later? Why are his words germane?
<P>
	They are germane today just as they were then for this reason. If 
we in our generation and in the generation that preceded us saddle 
our children and our grandchildren and their children with a debt 
that is not of their making, then we are ruling from beyond the 
grave. When we are no longer of this world, what we have done 
will be paid for by our children and by our grandchildren.
<P>
	I am sure I speak for many parliamentarians here and in 
provincial legislatures across the land. When I wrestle with the 
problems that we have of debt, we must do so bearing in mind that 
we have a sacred obligation to future generations to leave our 
country and our world in better shape than we found it in.
<P>
	That is what brought me into politics and I would expect that is 
what brought a lot of my colleagues into politics. Some of us 
choose to achieve these goals by different avenues. That does not 
make them necessarily right or necessarily wrong. However, it does 
suggest that there are different priorities attached by different 
political parties.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals came into this thinking that if we are able to change 
the name and move things around a little and fudge it we will not 
really have to address the core problems facing our country. The 
core problem facing our country has not been revenue. Being the 
most highly taxed of the G-7 countries, of any industrialized nation 
in the world, revenues are not a problem. As a matter of fact, in the 
government's revenue documents, the budget documents, it clearly 
makes the point that government revenues are going to increase 
from the 1994-95 fiscal year to the 1998-99 fiscal year by $20 
billion.
<P>
	That is virtually the entire growth of the gross domestic product 
of the country. What is happening is that the lifeblood of the 
country is being sucked out of the pockets of individual Canadians. 
We do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem.
<P>
	Over the same period of time again from the government's own 
documents it shows that government spending will decrease $15 
billion but fully $7.5 billion of that government spending decrease 
will be part of the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	So then what are the components of the Canada health and social 
transfer? They are transfers to the provinces with respect to 
payments for health, post-secondary education and welfare. Where 
are the provinces under most stress in their budgets? Health, 
post-secondary education and welfare.
<P>
	The federal government has changed the name of the 
departments, combined them into a global budget and then said it 
will reduce transfers by $7.5 billion. That $7.5 billion represents a 
decrease from $19.3 billion to $11.8 billion.
<P>
	I do not know what the percentage is and I apologize, I should 
have figured it out, but it is pretty dramatic. The provincial 
governments have had to make up and take up the slack.
<P>
	It is a little difficult for the provincial governments to do so 
because in order to be eligible for the transfers from the federal 
government for these programs the provincial governments must 
abide by rules established by the federal government.
<P>
	Here we have the situation where the federal government is 
making the rules but the provincial governments have to pay for it. 
It does not seem right to me. It does not seem right to me not that 
the government does not have the responsibility to get its finances 
in order but how can it in good faith and good conscience slough 
off the responsibilities to other governments and call this doing the 
job?
<P>
	At the same time that the government is reducing transfers to the 
provinces in support of health, education and welfare it has all 
kinds of resources to subsidize business such as Bombardier, such 
as a hotel in the Prime Minister's riding for millions of dollars, to 
business all over the country with the notable exception of the west. 
How can we find money to subsidize business but we cannot find 
money to transfer to the provinces for health, post-secondary 
education and welfare?
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that the government is speaking out of both sides 
of its mouth when it says that its concern is for post-secondary 
education, understanding that the future of young Canadians is 
built on knowledge and at the same time it cuts transfers to 
post-secondary education.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9195"> 9195 </A></B>
<P>
	I invite my colleagues opposite to stand and perhaps we will 
have an opportunity to explore some of these issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to stand and reply to my hon. colleague 
whose remarks were very well taken.
<P>
	However, I would like to react to his observation that because the 
federal government is cutting transfers to the provinces for health 
and education it is irresponsible.
<P>
	He correctly points out that we certainly are trying to stimulate 
business. On the one hand, by stimulating businesses we create 
energy in the economy. Businesses, for profit industries, do make 
money and they are self-controlling to a certain extent in that they 
are accountable to their shareholders. By stimulating small and 
medium size businesses we do much good for the economy.
<P>
	The problem with the health and educational sector is that they 
are industries which are entirely not for profit. The difficulty is that 
at both the provincial and the federal level, and I think my 
colleague will agree, there has been a lack of scrutiny and demand 
for efficiencies that perhaps there should have been, particularly 
through the late 1970s and early 1980s.
<P>
	As I see it, the problem is that when the federal government is 
giving transfers to the organizations which are under provincial 
control, it realizes that there are enormous efficiencies, perhaps 
operating at about one third of their maximum efficiency. What is 
the choice if we are going to bring efficiencies to this sector but to 
cut the transfers from the federal government to the provincial 
governments? How else can we encourage the provincial 
governments which actually control these sectors to demand better 
accountability and better efficiencies?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague opposite makes a 
good point. The problem is that the federal government is the one 
that sets the standards. The federal government is the order of 
government which built the expectations in the population of 
Canada. Provincial governments are responsible for delivering the 
programs for which expectations were determined by the federal 
government. When there is one order of government responsible 
for raising the money and the other order of government 
responsible for delivering the programs, there will automatically be 
situations where people are pointing fingers, one at the other, 
saying it is your responsibility.
<P>
	It seems to me that whoever raises the money and pays the bulk 
of the money should be setting the standards.
<P>
	My colleague opposite also pointed out that businesses create 
wealth. I do not have any problem with that. However, it seems to 
me that it would be far more efficient to provide for entrepreneurs 
to make a profit and retain it and get a capital pool for their 
investment.  When any order of government uses taxpayer money 
to subsidize another business, it is artificially stimulating or 
changing the business environment in a particular area. The reason 
businesses take up government programs is they are there. If one 
business makes use of a government program and another does not, 
then the business that takes the government largess has an 
advantage. It does not create employment, it just creates more and 
more taxation.
<P>
	I raise the example of someone working for $7 or $8 an hour and 
paying taxes to the federal government. That money working its 
way back into the business environment, subsidizing someone else 
to go into competition with the people who paid the money in the 
first place just plain does not make sense.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	If we allowed entrepreneurs to retain a return on the investment 
that would create an entrepreneurial environment so that people 
could make more money from entrepreneurial activity rather than a 
passive return on investment on interest income, we would see a 
whole lot more entrepreneurial activity, a whole lot more job 
creation and it would be extremely cost effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa 
West. I am pleased to have an opportunity to rise on debate today to 
address the budget which the finance minister brought down in the 
House a few short weeks ago.
<P>
	I will examine three perspectives, what this budget does for 
Canadians in general, what this budget does for rural Canada 
specifically, and what this budget does for the residents of my 
riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	This budget shows the good, strong fiscal management of 
Canada. That is what the Minister of Finance has provided for the 
last four years. That is what this government has provided. If we 
look at the comments in the popular press and at some of the public 
surveys regarding the budget, that observation is shared by a great 
deal of Canadians, indeed by the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	What we have seen and what the Minister of Finance was able to 
say in that budget is that Canada will have its lowest deficit in15 years. We have managed as a government to take a deficit of 
about $42 billion which we inherited in 1993 and reduce it to less 
than $19 billion in this fiscal year.
<P>
	More important was the finance minister's comment that within 
another fiscal year or so the federal government will no longer have 
to enter into new borrowings. In essence if we calculated our deficit 
as most other nations do we would say that we were balanced. We 
will no longer have to enter into the markets for new borrowing. 
That will be the first time in almost a generation and a half that it 
has happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9196"> 9196 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada today is enjoying some of the lowest interest rates that 
it has seen in 40 years. That is a benefit and something that flows 
from our strong fiscal management. We are seeing the lowest 
sustained rate of inflation in 30 years. That is protecting the 
purchasing power of Canadians. It is engendering consumer 
confidence. It is important to point out that low inflation protects 
purchasing power for low income Canadians in particular.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance through his budgets has been able to 
create an environment in which job creation has occurred. I do not 
think there is anybody in this House who would not want to see 
more of it occurring, but good progress has been made. There have 
been 700,000 net new jobs created in the last 41 months of this 
Liberal government. That is even more impressive when we 
compare that to the record of the last 41 months of the previous 
Conservative government where some 146,000 net jobs were lost. 
We have gone from losing about 150,000 jobs to gaining about 
700,000 jobs.
<P>
	This budget also saw a targeted tax reduction of about $1.9 
billion. But it was not a tax reduction as we have seen suggested by 
the Reform Party or what we have seen done in Ontario, which was 
across the board which provides very little benefit to the people at 
the low income end while it provides substantial benefits to the 
high income people.
<P>
	This has been a targeted tax cut that has helped specific 
Canadians. It has helped low income Canadians with children. That 
is who the tax cut has been targeted to. It has been targeted to 
individuals seeking post-secondary education. We have had 
targeted tax cuts to help Canadians with disabilities and we have 
had tax cuts to help charitable organizations that are at work in our 
communities trying to help those most in need. That is what this 
budget has done for Canada as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I was particularly pleased to see that the budget also addressed 
the needs of rural Canada and rural Canadians. Indeed, this budget 
began the process of fulfilling the Prime Minister's throne speech 
commitment of last February 1996 when he clearly said that we 
needed to work on the whole issue of rural development.
<P>
	We saw that through a new commitment to tourism, a very 
important industry in rural Canada. We saw the Canadian Tourism 
Commission's budget increase from $50 million to $65 million. 
This was very important for rural Canada.
<P>
	We also saw the Minister of Finance make a commitment of 
some $50 million to the Farm Credit Corporation. These funds are 
going to be used to explore and develop innovative ways to move 
forward the whole issue of economic development in rural Canada.
<P>
	We also saw the minister make a new commitment of $30 
million to the community access program which is absolutely 
essential for rural Canada. We in rural Canada need the on ramp to 
the information highway, so to speak, if we are to be competitive 
and compete in the world market. I was pleased to see that 
commitment to rural Canada. It builds on the natural resource 
committee's report on rural Canada which I had the opportunity to 
chair when we did that report. It dealt with some of the things that 
we needed to do for rural Canada. I applaud the minister for 
beginning the process of working toward the development of our 
economies in rural Canada.
<P>
	I would like to talk for a minute about some of the things that 
this budget is doing specifically for the people of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. For the fourth year in a row the budget does not 
increase personal income tax rates for the people who are living in 
my riding. Indeed, it does not increase it for any Canadian 
anywhere.
<P>
	The second item depends on Mike Harris stopping his political 
games. We have proposed a second phase of the infrastructure 
program. That first phase saw investments in the riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka of some $26 million. We saw $1.7 million on 
tourism infrastructure which is very important. We saw a $1.3 
million investment on increased fire protection for the residents of 
my riding. In a rural area, fire protection is on a volunteer basis and 
this program has provided us with some of the tools that we need to 
increase that protection.
<P>
	We saw over $500,000 invested in our local school boards to 
assist with education in our riding. Once we get this program on 
board in Ontario, I estimate around a $9 million additional 
investment will be occurring. This is very important for the people 
of Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	Again on tourism, there is a specific problem in an area like 
mine where tourism operators are trying to access capital to create 
new private tourism infrastructures, things like resorts, hotels and 
restaurants. It has been a real problem because that capital has not 
been available from our chartered banks.
<P>
	The Business Development Bank of Canada, through a $50 
million investment by the government, is creating a $250 million 
loan pool that will allow the tourism operators in rural areas like 
Parry Sound-Muskoka to develop rural infrastructure or tourism 
infrastructure that will be increasing economic activity and 
increasing jobs in Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	There is also another change in the budget that is very important 
to rural Canadians and the people of Parry Sound-Muskoka and it 
has to do with the education tax credit. This is a credit that allows a 
tax deduction for folks who have to live away from home to go to 
school. In the urban areas there are a number of people who do go 
away, but in rural Canada almost 100 per cent of our young people 
who want to have post-secondary education have to travel to obtain 
it. This tax deduction, which is a  300 per cent increase over the last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9197"> 9197 </A></B>
<P>
two years, is going to make a substantial difference for the people 
of Parry Sound-Muskoka either for those who go to school or for 
their parents who are supporting them when they do it.
<P>
	Another measure in the budget which is going to help people 
specifically in my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka is our new 
hires program. What it means is that the small business men and 
women of my riding who go out and hire somebody new in 1997 
are not going to have to pay any increase in their EI premiums. This 
is a specific measure designed to help stimulate job creation all 
across Canada, particularly in a riding like mine which is so 
dependent on the small business sector. That is an excellent 
program and it will be of significant benefit to an area like Parry 
Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the budget continues to provide strong and 
competent fiscal management for the country. Second, it creates a 
climate in which jobs and economic growth can occur. Third, it 
addresses the needs of rural Canadians with some very specific 
measures which will help the people who live, work and earn their 
living in rural Canada. Finally, the budget and the provisions in it 
will help the people of Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of the government. I am proud to support 
the Minister of Finance who has tabled this budget, his fourth, 
which is bringing wealth, increased economic activity and 
increased prosperity to our country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when my colleague says that the federal government has done a 
great deal for people in rural areas, I wonder if he is serious. With 
respect to agriculture, he earlier mentioned an amount of $50 
million for all of Canada. This is a very small amount for all of 
Canada. Just before that, they had cut transportation for farmers. 
We heard the president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada, Claude 
Rivard, say on the radio that dairy farmers will have to increase the 
price of milk, cheese, yoghurt and so on because of cuts. The$50 million they are now talking about does not even match what 
we were receiving before. It is therefore a cut, not something 
additional.
<P>
	As for forestry, there is nothing. I warn you not to tell me this 
comes under provincial jurisdiction. There is no doubt about that. 
That is what we want, but since forestry workers pay taxes, they are 
entitled to a fair return as well.
<P>
	I could continue for almost all areas of the rural economy. We 
see that, compared to towns and cities, we are the poor relations. 
And, to my way of thinking, the government is not giving people in 
rural areas their fair share.
<P>
	I ask my colleague if he is happy with this budget as it affects 
rural areas.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the question from 
the hon. member who had an opportunity, as part of the natural 
resources committee, to participate in the study on rural 
development.
<P>
	Do I believe that rural Canada has everything it needs or that it 
wants? Of course not. However, progress is being made. Matters 
are far more advanced today than they were when the government 
came to power.
<P>
	A progression has taken place over the last three years. The 
member and I share the fact that we come from rural Canada. The 
needs of rural Canadians really were not on the national agenda 
when we came to this place. Rural Canada was not a topic of 
conversation. This government has put it on the agenda.
<P>
	We saw that clearly last year in the 1996 throne speech when the 
Prime Minister made a commitment to rural Canada. He 
understood that the challenges which are faced by rural Canadians 
are different from those challenges faced by urban Canadians. The 
programming and the delivery of that programming has to be 
designed in a way that takes into account the unique challenges 
which face rural Canadians.
<P>
	That process moved forward and a budget came forward from 
the Minister of Finance in which a number of measures were taken 
to assist rural Canadians. It is the beginning of a process. It is not 
the end. Much more needs to be done. That is why I was pleased as 
the chair of the natural resources committee to have an opportunity, 
with my colleagues from all parties, to have the national resources 
committee study the whole issue of rural development. We 
travelled from coast to coast, out west, in Ontario, in Quebec and in 
the maritimes and listened to Canadians from all of those regions 
tell us about their concerns and their needs. The report was tabled 
in the House last week and it discussed some of those concerns and 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The budget has begun the process to address them. I am 
confident that the government will continue in this mandate and 
when we have a renewed mandate to continue the process of the 
revitalization of rural Canada. This government is committed to 
rural Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to speak today on the budget which represents some very 
fundamental Liberal values and some values that are important to 
all Canadians.
<P>
	While we have been very frugal since the election in 1993, and 
have had a constant eye on reducing the financial obligations of 
Canadians, we have also not taken our eye off those values that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9198"> 9198 </A></B>
<P>
important to Canadians:  compassion, caring for one another and 
building a better future for all of us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government has not had an easy time of it in recent years. 
Some difficult decisions have had to be made. And yet, we have 
considerable achievements to our credit. We have, with this budget, 
taken back our national sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is nothing less than that. We have taken back our national 
economic sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken back the power to decide in Canada, for 
Canadians, and the power to build the future that we want for 
ourselves and for our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	No more do we have to look over our shoulders to Tokyo, Zurich, 
New York, to the international bankers on whom we had become so 
dependent for our bills. By next year for the first time in 28 years 
we will no longer have to borrow new money on the world market. 
This is money that up until now has been borrowed to pay year in 
and year out for medicare, for pensions, for education, for research, 
for culture.
<P>
	I ask people to take themselves back to the situation we faced 
three and a half years ago. Of the money the Canadian government 
had to spend every year, more and more was going to pay the 
interest on the debt and less and less was available for the programs 
that Canadians value, to the point where we were not going to be 
able to afford any of those programs.
<P>
	We have reversed that. We have shrunken the deficit steadily and 
dramatically. By 1999 we will have no deficit.
<P>
	This year's budget showed just how important that achievement 
is. We are able again to invest in our future, modestly, yes, because 
we are not yet out of the woods, but in areas that are crucial.
<P>
	I want to give credit to Canadians from all across the country 
who I believe through our caucus, our Liberal members, very much 
influenced and determined the priorities in the 1997-98 budget.
<P>
	Just one example is the first step in a massive effort against child 
poverty, the most progressive social program that has been 
introduced since medicare. I want to particularly give credit to my 
own riding association in Ottawa West that first developed a child 
poverty resolution to go to the national Liberal convention last year 
and then worked along with the help of the Nepean Women's 
Liberal Association to make sure that at the national convention 
with Liberals from all across the country, children were at the top 
of the government's national agenda.
<P>
	We have held day long forums in Ottawa West on health care, 
social programs and pensions. When the National Forum on Health 
reported last year the values of our community for accessible 
universal portable health care were in its report.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The budget also picks up on those recommendations and begins 
immediately to implement some of the recommendations of the 
National Forum on Health to which my constituents and Canadians 
contributed. It implements $300 million to try some innovative 
new approaches in health care. It deals with such things as a new 
health research fund. It doubles the money for things like the 
prenatal nutrition program and the community action program for 
the health of children.
<P>
	We have money in the budget to recognize the economic equality 
of persons with disabilities. We have tax measures that will help 
compensate for the extra expense of having to cope with 
disabilities such as dependent care. We have a $30 million 
opportunities fund for Canadians with disabilities to improve their 
ability to be full participating citizens of our country.
<P>
	There are measures for short term jobs because we know there 
are still many Canadians uncertain about their future, unable to 
keep a job, able to get only short term low skilled jobs. We are 
extending the infrastructure program which was so successful in 
kickstarting the economy shortly after the last election.
<P>
	Just as important, we are investing long term. The Canada 
innovation fund will strengthen the abilities of universities to 
contribute to research, to the advancement of knowledge and to 
new job opportunities in the future. We are making it easier for 
students to attend university through improved tax treatment of 
their expenses as students from which either they or their parents 
can benefit, and by making it easier for them to repay student loans. 
The government has made it easier for parents to invest in a 
registered education savings plan for their children's education.
<P>
	The economic indicators are all right at this moment. There are 
low interest rates, low inflation, a dramatically improved trade 
situation and a dramatically improved balance of payments. We 
have 700,000 more Canadians working today than were working 
two and a half years ago. That is quite an accomplishment. We 
went into the 1993 election with predictions from the then 
government that unemployment would not go down until well into 
the next century. That was not good enough and that is why we 
invested in both short term jobs and long term economic prospects 
for Canadians.
<P>
	A number of the measures in the budget are also an indication of 
how we have strengthened the Canadian family. In a sense it began 
with the Team Canada missions to stimulate the economy and 
create better opportunities for Canadian firms to sell abroad and to  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9199"> 9199 </A></B>
<P>
create jobs at home. That has led to the provinces working together 
in many other areas.
<P>
	The new child tax benefit would not be possible without the 
co-operation of the provinces. There are a number of measures 
throughout the budget, such as health care initiatives, that rely on 
that co-operation, that of working together as a Canadian family for 
the benefit of all Canadians. By working together we strengthen 
our bonds across this great country and strengthening our ability to 
do even more in the future.
<P>
	I am proud to speak on the budget. It shows some very difficult 
measures have been taken but they have been producing results. 
There are those who would say give people tax cuts. There are 
those who would say cut more and faster. On the other side there 
are those who would say spend more and do not worry about the 
debt and deficit.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	This government will not jeopardize our history of compassion, 
of caring for one another, of investing in the future of all 
Canadians. Nor will we undermine the gains that have been made at 
great sacrifice for many Canadians.
<P>
	This budget represents a record of achievement but it also 
represents a launching pad for the future based on a much more 
solid confidence in our economic situation, based on a sense that 
people have had good government, honest government and that is a 
record I am pleased to stand on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the speech quite carefully and can hear that the member 
is genuinely concerned about child poverty.
<P>
	In all sincerity I would like to ask her if she could please give me 
her definition of poverty. This is something I have been asking 
today of each of the members because I know what my constituents 
define as poverty. I am really very interested when we throw this 
word around to actually have a definition of what that means.
<P>
	The member mentioned that 700,000 jobs were created by this 
government. Not true. The private sector creates jobs for the most 
part and, for some strange reason, there has been no net increase in 
the number of jobs. We are still stuck at the same unemployment 
level. Perhaps the hon. member can explain to me, if the 
government has created jobs, why we still have the same 
unemployment.
<P>
	Since she has expressed an interest in the government helping 
young people get into jobs, can she tell me whether she supports 
the self-employment assistance program carried out by EI, which 
specifically excludes white men under 45 years of age from being 
able to use their EI benefits to start a small business.
<P>
	The program only applies to women, men 45 years and older, 
visible minorities, aboriginals or people with  disabilities. It 
specifically excludes one of the highest unemployment areas in the 
whole country, young white males.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me, since that is funded by 
this budget which she is in support of, whether she supports that 
discrimination.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the member was not 
listening, if he misunderstood, misheard or heard what he wanted 
to hear. I never said that the government created 700,000 new jobs.
<P>
	I said that there are now 700,000 more Canadians working than 
were working in the fall of 1993. I am the last one not to give credit 
to the private sector, particularly to the small businesses that are 
creating jobs and that are getting help from this government in this 
budget to continue creating jobs.
<P>
	May I mention only the new highest program which forgives 
contributions to the employment insurance plan by new businesses, 
small businesses that hire new people in the coming year.
<P>
	The member asked about the definition of poverty. People can to 
to Statistics Canada or to the Canadian Council for Social 
Development and get a definition of poverty that is expressed in 
dollars. Let me talk about what poverty means to children in my 
community, the people I represent.
<P>
	Poverty means not having enough food. Poverty means not 
having proper medical and dental care. Poverty means entering 
school at the age of four or five, already well behind their 
classmates in terms of the experiences they have had and therefore 
their ability to learn and profit from school.
<P>
	Poverty means going to school not as well fed, not as well 
clothes and therefore immediately at a social disadvantage in the 
school environment. Poverty means going to school never having 
seen a computer or having had the opportunity to play with a 
computer as many better off Canadian children have had.
<P>
	Poverty means being behind the eight ball from the time people 
are infants. It means their mother being less well nourished and 
therefore their being born less healthy, with less energy, less able to 
thrive, less able to learn, less able to enjoy life.
<P>
	That is my definition of poverty. I see it in my community every 
day.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I do not know the details of the program the member mentioned. 
I do know that the self-employment program under the EI plan has 
been available generally to people seeking EI. It was over 
subscribed to half way through the two years I have been aware of 
its existence.
<P>
	If we question that in this country women particularly are 
economically disadvantaged and it is the reason for  many children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9200"> 9200 </A></B>
<P>
living in poverty in this country and that we need to do something 
to correct the situation, I do not think we are facing the reality 
about the inequalities that exist in our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say a few words about poverty as well, like my 
colleague.
<P>
	We have the case of the man who has a family, who wants to 
work and has no job. There is the young 24-year old who just got a 
degree, has incredible qualifications, sends his resume everywhere, 
and people do not even bother to answer. I could go on for ages, 
trying to define poverty. Yet, we realize that we are among the 
seven richest countries in the world. However, in this country we 
call Canada, there are still places where poverty really exists. I 
agree with my colleague who gave a very good description of the 
problem.
<P>
	How can we make up for this? Poverty exists, we all agree on 
that. We agree on other points as well, that there is a deficit and we 
have to deal with it, so as not to mortgage the lives of future 
generations. My children's generation, and my children are in their 
twenties, is already in debt. There are other children in my riding 
who are even worse off than my kids.
<P>
	Yesterday, I was talking to a woman of 35 who told me she was 
still paying for her education. That is poverty, too. How can you 
start a family if you are still paying back a student loan after ten 
years? When we know that as far as jobs go, the future is uncertain, 
how can we create hope? If we have no hope in our lives, I think we 
are only half the man or the woman we could be.
<P>
	We agree that poverty exists and that we have a deficit to pay off. 
But it is not up to our children to pay off the deficit, because we 
created that deficit. Starting in 1970, under Minister Lalonde and 
other finance ministers, it was paradise on earth: ``Anything goes, 
borrow now and pay later''. I fail to understand how brilliant men 
and women in this Parliament managed to put us into debt to this 
extent.
<P>
	Well, it is no use crying over spilt milk. We have to find a way 
out. And there are a number of ways, as I see it. Some economists 
also agree. However, and I want to repeat this at every opportunity, 
why can the government not take specific steps to get as much 
money as possible without weakening the neediest among us, 
without creating a psychological threshold which means that in 
some regions, people do not know what to do any more?
<P>
	Ask people who have are unemployed, who have lost their jobs 
and are living on welfare. It is hard on their dignity. It is very hard 
on children too. In my opinion, we have to turn things around and 
go where the money is.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I said it earlier and I say it again, I could say it a hundred times, 
no one is listening, but I could say that I had repeated it: how is it 
that there are rich people that always manage to be on the right side 
of the fence, without paying or hardly paying any income tax, when 
the poor people who have the misfortune to outsmart some of the 
rules of employment insurance, which I call misery insurance, 
automatically get nailed?
<P>
	This year I have run into several cases of people who are honest 
but perhaps naive and who at some point were without work. They 
were employed; legally this was not right. Morally, however, they 
had to feed their family. They were told: ``You are going to do so 
many hours''. The calculations were not done right. One of these 
people owes the unemployment insurance system $40,000, because 
this situation went on for four years. Some agreements were 
reached for him to repay, but he has no work. He is suffering from 
depression.
<P>
	I realize the officials are doing their job. I accept that. What is 
not legal is not legal. But, how is it, when I look on the other side of 
the fence, that I see respect being given to the multinationals 
whatever they do? Nobody bothers them.
<P>
	I repeat: so long as this government and this party do not set 
rules for themselves for the election fund, who will govern? They 
lack the courage to do what René Lévesque did in Quebec, and he 
was quite proud of himself for it. Just before his death, he indicated 
he was proud of Hydro-Québec, yes, but more importantly, of 
having settled the issue of fundraising, for his party and others. You 
may know that, in Quebec, corporations are not allowed to 
contribute millions of dollars to campaign funds. They are not the 
ones making $100,000 contributions to political parties, only 
individuals can do that. As long as they will not have the courage to 
do the same thing, we will keep asking the same questions and 
getting the same answers.
<P>
	I listened to several speakers who are very sensitive to the plight 
of the most disadvantaged and really want to do something about it. 
I sit on a committee on which there is much talk about the rural and 
regional community, and the committee members are quite serious. 
The problem is with the measures being considered. Desperate 
times call for desperate measures. If financial considerations 
cannot be set aside so that the government can have its hands free, 
very free and very clean hands, we will get nowhere. The 
alternative is to go a long way.
<P>
	It may have been unreasonable of him to say so, but we did hear 
the Minister of Finance utter the words, and I quote: ``We can see 
that the worst is behind us, that brighter days lie ahead''. I wish the 
worst were really behind us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9201"> 9201 </A></B>
<P>
	I for one fail to see how the situation has improved, in the 
regions in particular, these past three years. In my region, where 
unemployment is on the rise, jobs are hard to find and the minister 
just steals bread from the mouths of workers, I cannot see how 
one could say that the worst is behind us.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I remind the Minister of Finance that there are 1.5 million people 
looking for work in this country, and 400,000 young people waiting 
to get on the Canadian labour market. In a rich country like Canada, 
why can the right climate not be created, where everyone would 
have a job? While the unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent in the 
United States, it is soaring at 10 per cent here. Something is wrong. 
Something is definitely wrong.
<P>
	This government's real strategy is to starve regions like mine, to 
starve the fishers in the Gaspé, as well as farmers, and to force 
forest workers onto welfare. What is this government doing for 
small business? What is it giving small business, farm producers 
and forest workers? Crumbs. There was the infrastructure program. 
Great. It was a tiny step in the right direction. But only temporary 
jobs were created. What the people of my riding and other ridings 
in Quebec are asking for are good permanent jobs, but the 
government is not listening.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague's remarks with great attention. 
He commented on how this budget takes aim at certain areas of the 
economy, that it does not attack multinationals.
<P>
	This budget has spared the big unions. It has not done anything 
that would erode the rights of organized labour to earn a wage and 
to have its rights. In Quebec we have a situation where the 
Government of Quebec is attacking the public service unions. it is 
trying to cut their pay and benefits. I suggest to my colleague that 
we have a federal government that supports the traditions and 
rights of organized labour, yet we have a provincial government 
that has been threatening those very rights and those very incomes 
of organized labour. Could he comment on the situation in Quebec 
vis-à-vis what the federal government is doing?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, if the federal government had 
not cut transfer payments to the provinces, many things would be 
better. Second, unions in our province have made tremendous 
progress for many years.
<P>
	As a unionist, I think we must know what we want from society. 
We live in a society that is constantly changing, and I congratulate 
the Quebec premier for going through this exercise with the unions. 
There are  differences of opinion, but there are also many points on 
which both sides agree. I believe an agreement will be reached as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	Some things do not change, though. I am referring to the 
multinationals and the family trusts. I should also have talked 
about the banks. Banks make billions of dollars in profits. I 
understand the banking system, and I know that the profits belong 
to the shareholders. But why not ask the banks to make a greater 
effort? Why can we not get a little more out of them? This way, we 
could provide better protection for the poor.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	How dare the government take money from the unemployment 
insurance fund, which is financed in part by the unemployed and in 
part by the employers, to reduce the deficit? This is simply 
outrageous. I almost feel compelled to say it is robbery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member from the Bloc mentioned somewhere in his speech that 
there is something not right here, that this budget is not working 
and something is not right.
<P>
	I would like to point out to him that it is not just the budget that 
may not be right for Quebec, it is the fact that this whole separation 
movement in the province of Quebec is causing a lot of the poverty 
as well.
<P>
	There is a lot of uncertainty for businesses as to whether or not 
there is going to be growth. The numbers of businesses that have 
closed down in Montreal and Quebec City and that are moving out 
of Quebec must be obvious to the member. He must see that they 
wanted to separate, they lobbied to separate, they have tried to 
separate for four years, they had a democratic vote and the 
democratic vote resulted in a loss.
<P>
	Therefore, why do the separatists not give it up and try to change 
things in Quebec, make things better for Quebecers within 
Confederation, within the country? Then they would get growth in 
Quebec. They would get that $4 billion deficit eliminated. The PQ 
is not doing a very good job either in running that deficit. That is 
how they can help people in their province. They should take some 
responsibility and quit these shenanigans with a referendum vote 
every four years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, when Mr. Trudeau was Prime 
Minister, when Mr. Lesage was Premier of Quebec, we did not talk 
about separation. The expression was ``maître chez nous''. It was 
perhaps a first step, but we did not talk about that. Yet, at the time, 
the unemployment rate was high. Enough of confusing the issue.
<P>
	Since we started talking about it, people are increasingly gaining 
confidence in themselves. Look at the referendum results: the first 
was 40 per cent; in 1995,  it was 49.5 per cent; in a few years, in 
1999 or 2000 at the outside, it will be 52 or 53 per cent because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9202"> 9202 </A></B>
<P>
people will have more confidence in themselves. They are also 
saying that even with Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Bourassa, we got 
nowhere. We are now at the point where we have pride in 
ourselves. We have confidence in ourselves and we are going to 
reach our goal: our own country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I begin my speech in reply to the budget, I would like to commend 
the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane for what he said. In spite 
of his age, he has the courage to challenge the mistakes of his 
generation, which is very wise.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Today I am relieved I do not have to sing the 
praises of this marvellous budget. I am always surprised when I 
listen to members opposite. They have no choice. They toe the 
party line and have to praise this wonderful budget, the budget of 
the century, as much as they can, although they know perfectly well 
it is just a pre-election budget.
<P>
	We are not going to go back and criticize their policies in 
general, but I could talk about this for a long time, make no 
mistake. As the Bloc Quebecois critic for training, youth and 
literacy, I will deal with these areas, which are of particular interest 
to me. You know as well as I do that Bloc members maintain that 
these areas should be transferred to Quebec, which is in a far better 
position to find ways to deal with these problems. I think that is 
pretty clear.
<P>
	I have said it often enough, but when we visit community 
organizations, not just in Quebec but across Canada, organizations 
which help poverty groups or similar groups in connection with 
manpower training, people say that social programs should be 
tailored to their needs. And these needs are often regional.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Take for instance Quebec, where in many cases, the problems are 
not the same in Lac-Saint-Jean and Montreal, although it is the 
same province. Imagine the difference between Lac-Saint-Jean and 
Vancouver. I cannot say this often enough. Until we have our own 
powers, and even when we do, I will keep fighting for sovereignty 
because that is the solution, more often than not. We will have all 
the powers we need, and we will be masters in our own house.
<P>
	I would also like to comment briefly on my colleague's speech 
and on political party fund raising. When people say that politics is 
dirty or politics is fishy, I think that is very interesting.  When big 
business can pay lobbyists to influence the government or public 
servants to create legislation that would be to their advantage, to 
the advantage of the corporations, one might well ask some serious 
questions about democracy.
<P>
	We in Quebec have set ourselves a limit: only individuals can 
make contributions. Yes, it is hard to fund a political party, and I 
am pretty sure all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois agree with 
that, but at least this is more rational.
<P>
	To return to this budget, I really like to criticize, it does not 
bother me in the least to do so. But on the other hand I also really 
like to offer solutions. The best solution I can offer, however-and 
I am not the first to do so-is for us to be masters of all of our own 
actions. That will be the first solution.
<P>
	In the meantime, while waiting for 1998 or 1999 to come, we are 
still paying taxes to this Parliament, to this federation, so we are 
fully entitled to criticize, since it is our money. Before criticizing 
anything else, however, I would like to start by reminding you that 
the Bloc Quebecois has done a study on tax reform, since we know 
that there has been no review of the taxation system for a good 
number of years.
<P>
	One need only think back to the Bronfman family scandal, the 
family trusts, other similar tax evasions. At present, there are 
corporations, big companies in Canada that are not paying taxes, 
which is scandalous. When an individual commits tax fraud, 
someone who may be under the poverty line, and he is arrested 
because we have the means of arresting him, this is easy because 
only a small amount is involved compared to the big companies. 
They may not pay their taxes, but we let them get away with it. A 
large corporation does not pay tax, and it is legal-that is the worst 
part about it-and makes huge profits. That is all quite normal.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has, therefore, studied the issue of tax 
reform, and has even had some praise from the Minister of Finance 
on it-I am not sure that is a compliment, but there you are. He told 
us that it contained some extremely interesting things, as did the 
personal income tax reform. We said there were ways of getting 
money out of businesses, but there would also be a more 
left-leaning approach: personal tax reform, for there are currently 
many situations in which single parents with two children are 
having a great deal of trouble surviving. Many similar situations 
where reform would be worthwhile could be identified. So we did 
this, and proposed our reform to the government.
<P>
	I even brought it to Ottawa in English so that the public servants 
there could understand it.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I am going to take a little time over several points of this 
marvellous budget, which I will call a pre-election budget. I have 
been in politics for almost a year now-it will be a year next 
week-and it is still fascinating to see how politics works.
<P>
	Here is one example. This year we are told: ``There are no cuts, 
everything is dandy. The people of Canada have a fine government 
that will make no cuts''. What  you have to know, and the public 
will practically never know, because people have better things to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9203"> 9203 </A></B>
<P>
than to hang on every political word, is that last year cuts of $4 
billion were announced, to take effect this year. That is politics.
<P>
	Last year, which was not a pre-election period, cuts that would 
hurt were announced. But they were to take effect only the 
following year, which was not so bad. This year, there is no 
mention of them. That way, they go unnoticed.
<P>
	Another thing that is my responsibility is the youth employment 
strategy. Last year, the government released money and made a 
grand announcement of $285 million in spending a year. What 
happened? Last year they announced that they were going to spend 
this amount, but they did not. They waited a year.
<P>
	That reminds me of the saying of an old politician. He said a 
bridge is worth three elections. In the first election, you announce 
the bridge. In the second, you announce the construction of the 
bridge. In the third election, you boast about having built the 
bridge.
<P>
	This is how the present government seems to be operating. As I 
was saying, they announced millions of dollars last year; this year 
they are again boasting about making money available, but this is 
not the case for it was already available, except for the 
announcement that they have found a way of using it. They are 
going to use half this year and the other half next year. I am 
prepared to bet,Mr. Speaker, $10 if you like, that next year the government will 
make a lovely announcement about the youth employment strategy, 
telling us how they have developed wonderful programs, when the 
money has been available for three years. In the end, it starts to 
sound a lot like my bridge story.
<P>
	Another thing that fascinates me is tourism. They talk about 
creating jobs in this budget, of additional funds, and tell us that 
tourism is a future niche market, that it is important to invest $15 
million annually in tourism over three years. I have just one 
question. Will this be used to fund Attractions Canada? I cannot 
leave out this ``attractive'' tourist initiative.
<P>
	Throughout Quebec right now, and I imagine this is true all the 
way to Vancouver, there are posters about Attractions Canada. 
What does it do? We do not know. It is probably a quiz or 
something of the sort. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	I see that I have only about 30 seconds left, but there is one last 
thing I would like to mention. This week, weekly newspapers in my 
riding were carrying some wonderful advertising singing the 
praises of the federal system. It said that Quebec was receiving 
more than the other provinces.
<P>
	A word to the wise. Canadian solidarity and equity are 
important, I agree. But when Ottawa procures only 20 per cent of 
goods and services in Quebec, what kind of  solidarity is that? They 
say that 15 per cent of armed forces personnel come from Quebec, 
but that is almost 9 per cent less than it should be. Quebec receives16 per cent of federal investments, when it should receive 24 per 
cent.
<P>
	I could say a great deal more, but my time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague across the way with great 
attention. I have to tell you that his words cause me great distress.
<P>
	The reality is, whatever the shortcomings of the budget, and I do 
not think it has many shortcomings, it has done nothing to attack 
organized labour. It has not attacked unions. Indeed, other 
legislation is drawing a line in the sand on replacement workers. 
The government has taken very positive steps toward supporting 
organized labour.
<P>
	Does the member opposite recommend therefore that the 
government, in order to save money, should have attacked the 
spending on the unions? Should we have sought the rollbacks and 
cutbacks that the provincial government in Quebec and Mr. 
Bouchard are applying to the unions in Quebec? Is this the model 
that we should be following? Should we be doing what the Parti 
Quebecois is doing to the unions in Quebec? Is this what he wants 
the government to do? Please answer.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I really have no reason to criticize 
what the provincial government does. However, I can tell you that 
he does so because he has no choice: it is because of the $4.5 billion 
in cuts by the federal government. Politics is easy here in the 
federal government. One year the government makes huge cuts, 
slashing transfer payments to the provinces. The next year, it brags 
about reducing the deficit and eliminating it within three years. 
That is pretty easy to do.
<P>
	In the end, it just means eliminating one cheque. They call 
Quebec and say it will not have the $4.5 billion anymore. They 
shift the problem to another level of government. The Government 
of Quebec has a problem: it is not getting as much money as it 
expected. The Government of Quebec, which is closer to the 
people, has then to find solutions. So, when they have you by the 
throat up to here, you have no choice.
<P>
	I have no comment on the measures Quebec has taken, but, what 
does offend me is when the Liberal government boasts about 
reducing the deficit, when it did so on the backs of the provinces.
<P>
	It is easy being a federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9204"> 9204 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member from the Bloc is very keen and I enjoy listening to his 
speeches and comments. It is a view from a younger generation, the 
generation that is going to have to pay off the huge debt, if we ever 
get out the deficit which the government cannot get us out of nor 
can his own provincial government get out of its deficit.
<P>
	During his speech he said that the federal government is ignoring 
the wishes of Quebec and that the province of Quebec should be 
doing more for itself and the federal government should get out.
<P>
	In one way I support his concept that the federal government 
should butt out of a lot of areas. My colleague for Edmonton 
Southwest discussed this a few minutes ago. The provinces should 
get together and tell the federal government: ``This is what you are 
are going to do, these are the areas you are going to look after and 
these are the areas we are going to look after''. That should be the 
new Canada constitution. I am sure the province of Quebec could 
contribute to something like that without separating and look after 
the areas it wants to look after.
<P>
	Here is my point. Quebec looks after its own immigration policy, 
whereas in the rest of Canada the feds do it. Job training is going to 
be looked after by the provinces, including the province of Quebec. 
Quebec looks after its GST, whereas we in Alberta have to do it 
through the federal government. The CPP is looked after by the 
provinces. A lot of these programs are already administered by the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	I am suggesting to the hon. member that the Quebec government 
sit down with the federal government and say: ``These are the areas 
we want you to look after for us. These are the areas we will look 
after ourselves, thank you very much''. I would like to hear the 
member's comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must do my duty. Since I was 
elected to do so, I will promote sovereignty and try to explain it to 
the rest of Canada. I am surprised that people still do not 
understand, although we have been talking about this for so many 
years. I wonder why. I have travelled in the rest of Canada. I like 
Canada. I have nothing against it.
<P>
	What is wrong with wanting our own country, which may be 
smaller, easier to govern, when this is similar to what our big 
corporations are now doing? People realize that large corporations 
are too difficult to run, so they are making them smaller to be 
closer to the employees, to perform better. That is what sovereignty 
is supposed to do. We will have everything we need to meet the 
needs of the people of Quebec. We do not want to make Quebec 
sovereign just to penalize the rest of Canada. On the contrary, the 
rest of Canada would benefit.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Look at who is the official opposition in your country, Canada. 
These are members from Quebec. Quebec intends to have a real 
debate, it does not matter whether people are on the left or on the 
right. We will pass our own laws and collect our own taxes, and we 
will be able to talk to each other. No problem at all.
<P>
	I would like to continue this discussion, but you are signalling 
that my time is up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I recognize that I am joining in the debate very close to the 
end of the day's proceedings. What has brought me into it is the 
incessant carping of the opposition day in and day out. I hesitate to 
call the opposition a one trick pony, but it is getting close to that.
<P>
	The budget that we are debating is much more than the 
opposition gives the government credit for and most Canadians 
recognize that.
<P>
	I bought a car recently. When I was doing my shopping, I was 
pleased to have a salesman, at one auto dealer at least, tell me that 
one of the other cars I was looking at at another auto dealer was a 
good car. Yet, as the opposition carps on about what the 
government is not doing or what failures it alleges are there, I am 
not hearing anything constructive or realistic in the assessment.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> It is very true. One opposition party is telling us that 
the government is going to hell in a hand cart for whatever reason, 
and the official opposition is taking us to hell in a hand cart with its 
wish to lead Canada into its form of partition. I find it hard to 
believe that there are MPs in this House who would advocate the 
partition of this great country but, sadly, there are.
<P>
	Although many of us understand where some of them are 
coming from on policy issues, we have a country to run here and 
we are not going to survive if we continue to admit, even for 
debate, this myopic, down the tube, kind of mentality that I have 
heard around here in the last few weeks.
<P>
	I have about two minutes to talk about this. The government 
takes pride-and I am sure the opposition will allow this-in its 
fiscal record; that is, management of the government's finances. I 
do not have to go on and on because I am sure my colleagues in 
government have gone on and on about how well we have done.
<P>
	What the government has done has been recognized around the 
world as a stunning success in fiscal management. I hope 
Canadians will recognize that the next time they get a chance at the 
polls. We are on course and we are going to stay the fiscal course 
that the finance minister has set out for us. We have done darn well.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	We have excellently placed interest rates. We have a current 
account either in surplus or capable of generating it. We have solid 
economic growth.
<P>
	I just received a sheet of economic indicators. It is a forecast 
from the policy and economics analysis branch of the program at 
the University of Toronto. There are two items that must be 
mentioned. The first item is fiscal and the other item is 
macro-economic.
<P>
	The macro-economic note worth reading is that the country 
turned the corner on the debt to GDP ratio between the second and 
third quarter of 1996. It has dropped from a peak of 55.5 per cent 
and is now headed downward into the lower 50s and will be into the 
upper 40s fairly soon.
<P>
	The other note is fiscal. On a national account basis, the 
government will have no borrowing needs by the third quarter of 
1998, roughly a year from now. Canadians can take pride in this.
<P>
	Having noted those two major items on the economic front I will 
close my remarks.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 6.15 p.m., it is my

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a while ago I asked the Minister of Finance to explain 
to Canadians why the government had broken its election promise 
to create jobs in significant numbers to address the concerns of 
Canadians and how did he feel about the government telling 
Canadians that they will simply have to accept and get used to high 
unemployment, which both he and the Prime Minister had done.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9206"> 9206 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals have broken their promise about jobs. We know 
that. When they assumed office there were 1.5 million people 
unemployed. Now almost four years later there are still 1.5 million 
people unemployed.
<P>
	In the 1993 election campaign the Prime Minister said under a 
Liberal government that it would be like the good old days, but he 
did not tell Canadians he meant the dirty thirties.
<P>
	Young Canadians face a shameful unemployment rate, officially 
at 17 per cent, but we know it is much higher than that. That does 
not even count the thousands who have given up looking or the tens 
of thousands flipping burgers at Burger King for a living. The 
Liberals and Burger King are both famous for one thing, the size of 
their whoppers, whether it be burgers or broken promises.
<P>
	There are millions of unemployed Canadians and millions more 
who fear that each pay cheque may be their last. With millions 
unemployed and everyone else looking over their shoulder, surely 
that is a national tragedy in a country such as ours.
<P>
	Today with still millions of Canadians unemployed and under 
employed, millions of Canadians living in poverty, again the 
poverty numbers have increased over the last four years, another 
indictment of Liberal policy. With insecurity spreading across the 
whole of Canadian society, the last four years have shown beyond 
any doubt that you can never build a successful modern economy 
the Liberal way, on the crude and wasteful dogma of the free for all 
world.
<P>
	The Liberal government has proven that it cannot privatize, or 
down load, or slash and burn its way out of mass poverty, that it 
cannot as a government contract out of its responsibilities to 
society and it cannot build for the future on Liberal economics of 
greed, waste and blind short-termism.
<P>
	In place of the priorities that the government has forced on 
Canadians in a way which has failed Canadians, the country needs 
a government with a vision of working together for the greater 
good and the belief in the potential of everyone.
<P>
	This requires investing in Canadians. This means investing in 
jobs; equipping not just the few but the many with opportunities in 
education and employment; a dedication to equality and social 
justice; the certainty of action against unemployment; and an 
economic policy run in the interests not of the privileged few but of 
the whole community.
<P>
	Why has the government not required banks to reinvest in the 
communities that trust them with their funds? Why has it not 
fought to stop banks from choking small business, farms and 
families with service charges and inflated credit card rates?
<P>
	It is long past time that chartered banks started pulling their 
weight and made a real contribution to job creation in Canada. 
Since the finance minister has been able to show some progress on 
meeting deficit targets, and he should be praised for that, why does 
he not set job targets and meet them the same way as he has set 
deficit targets? We could avoid double digit unemployment rates if 
there was a serious and explicit unemployment target.
<P>
	New Democrats and Canadians believe that lives and jobs are 
more important than numbers done on an accounting sheet. Does 
the government not think so too? The Liberal message of a low 
paid job or no job is a message that Canadians totally reject.
<P>
	I ask once again, as I did some time ago, when will the finance 
minister, instead of paying for failure, begin to invest in success? 
At that time I also asked him why would he not consult the 
Saskatchewan New Democratic government which has the lowest 
unemployment rate in the country, which has pursued a partnership 
agenda and which has been successful in generating an 
unemployment rate which is the envy of the country. There is much 
to be learned there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite of the tired rhetoric, flawed 
logic, incorrect facts and the insults to the millions of Canadians 
who are employed in jobs that are not McJobs, I am going to 
answer this question as I have been asked to do. I might point out in 
beginning my response that in my city of Toronto 70,000 people 
work for the banks.
<P>
	The government is delighted with the low rate of unemployment 
in Saskatchewan. I applaud the Saskatchewan government's 
partnership approach to developing the economy. Successful as 
that government's programs have been, we must recognize that 
other factors have played a substantial role in Saskatchewan's low 
unemployment rate. Bumper grain crops and strong grain markets 
have been an important part of the province's success this year. 
Furthermore, Saskatchewan has historically been blessed with one 
of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.
<P>
	Like the Government of Saskatchewan, this government believes 
it is only through team efforts that we can harness the financial 
resources and the knowledge needed to implement effective 
strategies for continuing growth. That is why partnership is also a 
key part of the federal government jobs and growth strategy. The 
strategy has three main elements.
<P>
	The first is to set the appropriate macro-economic conditions. 
This has been done by setting and achieving inflation control 
targets and meeting and exceeding those targets. The pay-off is 
evident in the dramatic declines in interest rates to levels no one 
thought possible even a year ago. Even in the hon. member's 
province, he will know that mortgage rates, car loan rates, small 
business rates, are substantially less than they were when we took  
<P>

<B><A NAME="9207"> 9207 </A></B>
<P>
office in 1993. Those are real savings, real dollars back in the 
pockets of his province.
<P>
	Second, the government is also helping the private sector to 
create jobs in the near term to bridge the gap to stronger growth and 
the full impact of lower interest rates take effect. We have extended 
the Canada infrastructure works program, a program that involves 
partnerships between all levels of government and the private 
sector. We have reduced the EI premium to $2.90 in 1997, the third 
successive decrease in as many years and we will reduce it to $2.80 
in 1998.
<P>
	We also introduced a new hires program, giving EI premium 
relief to small firms that create new jobs in 1997-98. We have 
extended the residential rehabilitation assistance program for 
another year. We are increasing support for tourism and youth 
employment in partnership with the private sector. All of these 
things benefit the people of his province.
<P>
	Third, we have made strategic investment in new technology, 
worker's skills, labour market social reforms to increase 
employment opportunities for Canadians. The government is the 
first to admit that unemployment is too high. While no one can be 
satisfied with the pace but progress recently is important to 
recognize. We are making substantial progress.
