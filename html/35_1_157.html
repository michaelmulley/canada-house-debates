Speaker, I am tabling in both official languages pursuant to the 
relevant standing order, the special report of the correctional 
investigator made pursuant to section 193 of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act concerning the treatment of inmates 
and subsequent inquiry following certain incidents at the prison

Public Service Superannuation Act (annuity following job loss).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have the honour and pleasure of 
introducing in the House today a bill entitled an act to amend the 
Public Service Superannuation Act (annuity following job loss).
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to amend the Public Service 
Superannuation Act in order to address the plight of federal 
public servants who have lost their jobs after January 1, 1995 as 
a result of a public service downsizing program.
<P>
	This bill would allow those public servants who have reached 
50 years of age and who have at least 10 years of pensionable 
service to collect an annual allowance equal to the amount of the 
deferred annuity without penalty immediately upon losing their 
job.
<P>
	In light of the upcoming downsizing program, many public 
servants will be faced with the possibility of having to raise their 
families on 50 per cent of their earned pension. This bill would 
allow these public servants, who must leave the public service 
through no fault of their own, to receive the full pension they 
deserve and have earned.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House reject this government's totally inadequate target which 
reduces the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP within 2 years and will leave Canada, at 
the end of the period, with a federal deficit of about $25 billion, a federal debt of 
over $600 billion, $50 billion in annual interest payments and higher taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand today to speak 
to this motion, primarily because the Reform Party has broken 
tradition. This is an historic day. We have presented to the 
Government of Canada an alternate budget before its budget has 
been presented.
<P>
	It is a particularly historic day because opposition parties 
have always been noted for opposition, for saying negative 
things, for carping about the problems created by various 
governments. They have never had the courage of their 
convictions, nor the wisdom perhaps, to put together an 
alternative and bring it forward. In this way not only Parliament 
can see, but so can all Canadians, that there truly is an 
alternative to the thought processes that have driven Canada to 
its financial knees over the last 15 years. I am exceptionally 
proud of what the Reform Party has done and proud to be a part 
of it.
<P>
	I would like to read the section from our document that 
pertains directly to this:
<P>
	``Reformers understand that there are many compelling 
reasons to eliminate the federal deficit quickly and decisively. 
Among them are the unsustainability of the Chrétien 
government's current fiscal path; the twin threats of rising 
interest rates and a falling dollar, and the need to prepare 
responsibly for the next cyclical downturn in the economy.''
<P>
	``Two more are of particular concern to Reformers: the risk 
that Canada's dire fiscal situation poses to our social fabric and 
the need to restore the confidence of Canadians and investors in 
the government's ability to manage its finances.''
<P>
	``The greatest risk to Canada's social fabric are the threats of 
annual deficits and a rising national debt, which over the past 30 
years have crowded out many legitimate expenditures of 
governments.''
<P>
	``As was demonstrated most vividly in the last recession the 
government's ability to provide some stability during periods of 
economic dislocation is seriously strained''.
<P>
	At the news conference this morning where the Reform Party 
revealed all of the figures and the entire thought process behind 
our budget, there was a rather insightful question from a news 
reporter. He stated to the leader of the Reform Party: ``I do not 
understand. When you last put together your budget you were 
talking about a $9 billion to $10 billion decrease in non-social 
spending and another $9 billion decrease in social spending. 
Why have you just added to the social spending side? Why have 
you taken the social spending decreases from $9 billion to $16 
billion''?
<P>
	Our leader very accurately reflected the fact that since those 
numbers were put together in 1992, as a result of the direct 
spending of this government and the past government, we have 
now moved a further $100 billion into debt. As a consequence 
the reduction in the availability of funding for social programs 
has now been reduced a further $7 billion.
<P>
	For example the member for Beaches-Woodbine went 
before the press gallery yesterday and said: ``We are not over 
taxed. Companies are not over taxed. We seem to have bought 
into that kind of jargon and it is not true''.
<P>
	These people are rather out of step with reality. Reality is that 
the average family income is $46,488, of which $17,000 goes 
for food, clothing and shelter; $21,000 goes to taxes. Over the 
last 12 years corporations have had their tax load increased 69 
per cent while their profits have decreased 10 per cent. The 
member apparently does not understand the concept of down 
loading.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the federal government downloads to the provincial, 
municipal, hospital districts and libraries. We have to pay for 
water, different post office charges, sewage, garbage, all of the 
user fees as a result of the federal government downloading. 
Indeed Canadians are being taxed far beyond the max.
<P>
	However, the comment that particularly caught my eye was 
one from the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. He, 
being first elected in 1965, is quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> as 
saying: ``I helped build many of these things'', referring to the 
social programs, ``I have no intention of participating in their 
dismantling''.
<P>
	As long as the government refuses to recognize that by 
driving us further and further into the hole, thereby raising 
annual interest rates, it is destroying Canada's ability to fund 
social programs. It is just that simple and it is what this issue is 
about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9866"> 9866 </A></B>
<P>
	It was interesting that the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, in talking about being one of the 
people to bring in these programs, probably has forgotten that 
one of the main architects of medicare in Canada, Tommy 
Douglas, actually delayed its implementation in Saskatchewan 
because he knew that his government at the time could not 
afford it. The government that brought in these programs, and 
perhaps the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, at that time 
did not have the size of debt that Canada has now.
<P>
	We will see the consequences of the government's inability to 
restrain its spending and to get things under control as starting 
the erosion of these programs. The erosion of these programs 
will occur because we are going further and further into debt by 
borrowing money to pay the interest on the money we have 
already borrowed. The debt in the last year grew at a rate of 10.3 
per cent. Tax revenue grew at a rate of 3.3 per cent thereby 
creating a 7 per cent spread.
<P>
	I notice one of the members from the other side, who is 
knowledgeable about these things, is shaking his head. If he 
goes to a document prepared for the Council for Economic 
Education with figures from his department he will find a 
reflection of the figures I just gave the House. The debt is 
growing at a rate of 10.3 per cent and tax revenue is growing at a 
rate of 3.3 per cent. That growth is entirely to pay the interest on 
the money we have already borrowed.
<P>
	It is quite fascinating to give the House an idea of how far out 
of step the members on the other side are when on Friday last 
week the member for Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe 
rose and said: ``I rise in the House today to indicate my outrage 
that Moody's bond rating agency would place Canada's credit 
rating under review only two weeks before the federal 
government's budget comes down. Why did it not just place a 
horse's head in the finance minister's bed?'' Maybe that is what 
needs to happen in order to get the attention of the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	The reality is that when the Prime Minister stood in front of 
the nation, indeed in front of the world on January 16 and said: 
``We are doing all that we can on the expenditure side but we 
have to do something on the taxation side'', the interest rate 
went up one full percentage point. In fact, what happened was 
that the dollar still dropped one-third of a point.
<P>
	Last night, to show just how delicate this situation is, in a 
12-hour period the Canadian dollar went up one full cent and 
down one full cent. We are literally on the edge. It is no wonder 
that Moody's and other people like the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and 
all of the other publications that advise people who make buying 
decisions of our Canadian debt and our Canadian currency, are 
spooked. They are spooked because the government refuses to 
realize that we can no longer go further and further into debt.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	One final note, and I apologize to you, Mr. Speaker and to the 
House. I failed to inform you that I was going to be splitting my 
time with another member. I have one final comment.
<P>
	Mexico, the precursor of where Canada is going in this issue, 
today has 50 per cent interest rates. Oil payments are being 
confiscated by the U.S. in order to make sure that the U.S. will 
stand behind them. Is that really what the government wants? If 
it is, I can tell the House it is not what I want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
not had the opportunity to see this alternate budget to which the 
member referred in his remarks.
<P>
	I did see an alternate budget put out by the Canadian Centre 
for Policy Alternatives last week. It looked at balancing the 
budget by looking at the expenditure side and some of the tax 
loopholes, the foundations that have been set up for the wealthy 
and the tax breaks there and so on.
<P>
	Yesterday I had the opportunity to go through a paper put out 
by the Council of Canadians which looks at the question: Are 
social programs to blame for the federal debt? It clearly points 
out in the analysis that program spending as a percentage of 
GDP has remained relatively constant in social programs over 
the years.
<P>
	Your remarks seem to indicate an attack on the social program 
side. I am wondering if you in your budget, do you have any-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. While we are in the 
early stages of debate on the opposition motion, may I take the 
time to remind the House to make all their interventions through 
the Chair and not directly to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member for 
Kootenay East could tell me if in the proposals, they have made 
any suggestions to close some of the tax loopholes. Does he have 
any suggestions to deal with the speculative trade in the dollar 
that is happening in the international financial markets.
<P>
	I recognize that speculators are playing games with the 
Canadian dollar, but does he not see the need to try and control 
that in a global sense so that countries can retain some 
sovereignty over their finances?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate both of those 
questions.
<P>
	Being a member of the Standing Committee on Finance-and 
I notice another member from the Standing Committee on 
Finance-he would probably agree with me that the committee 
has been looking at family trusts as well as at a number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9867"> 9867 </A></B>
<P>
different areas. In fact, these so called loopholes are really just 
myths.
<P>
	There are some specifics where there has to be some 
tightening up. I attended a briefing by the revenue department 
yesterday where we were looking at some of the propositions 
within the revenue department to tighten up on certain areas. 
These gaping loopholes simply are a product of wishful 
thinking.
<P>
	With respect to controlling speculation, the difficulty is that 
in the last 10 years the percentage of federal marketable 
security, that is our bonds and our debt instruments in the hands 
of people outside of Canada, has increased from 10 per cent of 
our federal marketable securities to 28 per cent.
<P>
	In other words, federal marketable securities are now 
controlled or in the hands of people outside of Canada to the tune 
of 28 per cent of the total amount outstanding versus only 10 per 
cent 10 years ago. That has occurred because the previous 
government and this government refuse to get spending under 
control, and as a consequence we are at the mercy of these 
traders.
<P>
	To try and get control over a trader in Hong Kong or in London 
or in New York is a non-starter. It is simply not going to happen. 
These are myths to which I am happy to speak.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I rise today to talk about this most serious topic, 
the most serious thing to threaten Canada as we know it, our debt 
and deficit.
<P>
	I can state in no uncertain terms that this is the number one 
problem facing our country and that the citizens of Canada are 
demanding action. As I speak our federal debt alone is over $550 
billion. It is increasing at almost $40 billion per year.
<P>
	This is a financial crisis. We have to stop kidding ourselves 
and we have to start facing reality. The sheer size of these 
numbers is so gigantic that most Canadians, myself included, 
have a tough time really understanding what they mean to us. 
When we bring things down to an every day level, we see just 
how dramatic this problem really is.
<P>
	The interest on our debt is a staggering $80,000 a minute. All 
of that money goes up in smoke, most of it to foreign investors. 
If the government were allowed to spend that money more 
productively on necessary services, on all of the jobs that are 
being threatened, on the social programs now threatened by this 
loss, if we could just put that money toward those things, how 
much more productive this country could become.
<P>
	To put that in common terms, if we were to give away 288,000 
colour television sets every day, after a month every home and 
apartment in this country would have one of those colour 
television sets. If the month has 31 days instead of 30 days the 
money for that one extra day of government could buy 4.431 
million cases of beer, even more if it does not have alcohol 
content in it. That poor suffering taxpayer could have a few cold 
ones while  watching ``Hockey Night in Canada'' on his new 
colour television set.
<P>
	The numbers are simply astounding. By the time I finish my 
10-minute speech the money shelled out in interest on our debt 
could have paid a year's worth of university tuition for 270 
Canadian students.
<P>
	What is the government going to do about this ridiculous 
situation? What is its plan? According to the red book the 
government is aiming to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP 
by the end of its term. The finance minister says with pride that 
he will meet his targets come hell or high water. What does it 
really mean to Canadians?
<P>
	It means an unspeakable high debt of over $600 billion. It 
means we will still be overspending by $25 billion per year. It 
dooms Canadians to higher taxes and it begs for a financial crisis 
of epic proportions. I think it is safe to say that the government 
was not elected to do any of these things. If it wants to prevent a 
crisis, it had better start setting some realistic targets.
<P>
	I have no doubt that the government will claim that it has 
inherited a legacy of the past, the accumulated mismanagement 
of nine years worth of Tory rule. Not only is this an unacceptable 
case of passing buck, it is also completely irrelevant. The 
government must play the hand that it has been dealt and do it to 
the very best of its ability. The citizens of Canada are demanding 
that the government take action.
<P>
	It is a disgrace that on election day we had a debt of 
approximately $489 billion and today we have over $550 
billion, $61 billion higher than it was the day we started this 
Parliament. That is a disgrace.
<P>
	How should the government deal with the deficit? Because the 
Reform Party cares we have asked the people of Canada through 
electronic national town hall meetings, many town hall 
meetings across the country, in curling rinks, service clubs, 
chambers of commerce and people on the streets. They have told 
us clearly what should happen. The people of Canada are willing 
to bite the bullet and take their medicine. They are willing to do 
this because they know the price today, though painful, will be 
much less than if they slide and go deeper and deeper into the 
hole.
<P>
	If only the finance minister had that message a year ago. Since 
his disastrously weak budget last year our dollar has dropped 
steadily, our interest rates have soared and now our credit rating 
is being reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Last year the finance minister refused to take on a role of 
leadership and it has now cost all Canadians dearly. I hope that 
this will never happen again. The budget must make the tough 
decisions and it must make them now.
<P>

<P>
	Throughout the prebudgetary process the Reform Party has 
not only emphasized that the government targets were 
ridiculous, but that they were ridiculously low and inadequate. 
We have come up with our own suggestions as to where the cuts 
should be allocated. That is because we wanted to be 
constructive and not just adopt the traditional opposition role 
of criticizing the government after the fact.
<P>
	Therefore this morning we have released the taxpayers' 
budget-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Certainly all members of 
the House can refer to materials, studies and texts of every 
nature. However, none should be used as props. I say that to 
caution everyone who will engage in this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
this is an important point because if the opposition party is 
basing this on a document which it is willing to produce to 
Canadians, it should have distributed it. I would point out that it 
is not available to the government at this side.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have already dealt with 
the matter. Certainly while the hon. member wanted to make a 
point, it is not a point of order. Again I would caution members 
on both sides of the House that props will not be accepted in this 
debate or in any other debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, copies are available at 
Room 200 West Block for anyone who would like one. This 
morning we released this budget, which charts a course that 
would eliminate the deficit in three years with no tax increases. 
No other opposition party in history has achieved this and we are 
very proud of our accomplishment. We have worked hard as 
critics and as members of this party to make that happen.
<P>
	I am sure that the government's spin doctors and certain 
members of the media will see this as a great opportunity to cast 
our party in a negative light. They will read through our 60-page 
budget searching for that one sentence which they think will 
make us look bad.
<P>
	It will not work because Canadians are smart enough to know 
how hard the Reform Party is working to provide an alternative 
vision for this country, smart enough to appreciate that we are 
being honest with them about the size of our economic problem 
and smart enough to ignore the mischief of political spin doctors 
who think they can manipulate people with the stroke of a pen.
<P>
	The days of old line party manipulation are gone. The people 
of Canada are now in charge. They have shown it through the 
referendum, they have shown it through the last election.
<P>
	The targets we have set in our taxpayers' budget are real and 
achievable. They are tough but they are fair. They are explicit 
and come with explanations as to why we are making the 
suggestions. I urge all Canadians to get a copy of the budget or 
the summary and read it for  themselves. The Reform Party is 
willing to accept the judgment of the people of Canada, not the 
spin doctors.
<P>
	We want our alternate budget compared with the Minister of 
Finance's budget next week. I believe that Canadians will agree 
that the government's target of 3 per cent of GNP is just not good 
enough. When Canadians read through our document they will 
notice there is a wide array of expenditure reductions. I would 
like to talk about the ones that affect my area, foreign affairs.
<P>
	Over the past year the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
has conducted a comprehensive review and made a number of 
suggestions for possible cuts. Although we were not successful 
in convincing the committee that there should be these cuts, I 
might summarize the three areas where we suggested them: in 
bilateral government to government aid; in international grants 
and non-mandatory contributions; dropping memberships in a 
number of non-essential international organizations.
<P>
	We belong to hundreds of organizations. Some of them are not 
even functional any more. We want the minister and Prime 
Minister to stop using this aid package as a slush fund every time 
they take an international trip. We also believe that there should 
be a substantial cut to the operating expenditures for foreign 
affairs in CIDA. In total the Reform Party is proposing a cut of 
$1.3 billion to our international commitments over the next 
three years. We are proposing not only cuts but a much greater 
emphasis on accountability, transparency and efficiency in 
delivering the service.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	While these cuts are steep, we believe they reflect the 
priorities of the grassroots of Canadians. We believe they could 
be implemented in a way that would preserve those programs to 
the greatest of their value.
<P>
	In conclusion, the people of Canada are sending a clear 
message to cut the deficit to zero in three years and not to raise 
taxes. The government will either do its job and listen or it will 
travel the road the Tories took, the road to nowhere. This is the 
government's last chance. For Canada's sake I hope it will 
choose the right road.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to speak for a few minutes. I have 
heard all kinds of things since being elected to this House a little 
over a year ago and I have sincerely tried to understand our 
friends from the Reform Party. It sure is not easy. I sometimes 
get the feeling that they have rocks in the head. Something is 
wrong with them. Perhaps they have bats in their belfry. For 
whatever reason, they are not quite with us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9869"> 9869 </A></B>
<P>
	It is obvious that everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody 
wants to die. We all agree on that. When Reformers talk about 
cutting government spending, I agree with them that cuts have 
to be made. The point was made that extravagant expenditures 
were made in the past, on embassies, for example. It happens 
that certain things slip by the government unnoticed. The 
Reform Party estimates that the major part of government 
expenses responsible for the national debt approaching $600 
billion are expenses the government made in an effort to help 
Canadians by developing social policies, in an effort to put 
Canada on the map with a number of social projects.
<P>
	If drastic cuts were to be made in all this today, as suggested 
by the Reform Party, some 33 to 40 per cent of Canadians would 
just starve. This is unacceptable on the part of a political party, 
although I must admit it shows that Reformers have a lot of guts. 
I am impressed by their courage in tabling budget number one of 
the era of Reform. I am not as impressed, however, with the 
contents of the document. They are attacking multiculturalism, 
Canadian bilingualism, and Canadian subsidies. But do they 
know that $900 million is granted every year to Western 
producers, in their home region?
<P>
	If this was cut overnight, what would happen to these people 
back home? Western farmers would simply be condemned to die 
slowly but surely of starvation. Now, this is not what politics is 
about. One has to know when and where to cut so that it is as 
painless as possible. It may be great fun to cut back the federal 
civil service by 30 per cent, but if you just drive civil servants 
out of A to force them onto B, B being welfare, and have no 
money to pay for welfare through federal-provincial transfers, I 
fear that Reform Party voters will have to tie their wallets to a 
chain, as some people have already started doing. This country 
will be subjected to widespread plunder.
<P>
	Our social programs are also used to buy social peace. Take 
that away and the Reformers may well see prison populations 
swell, which is what they want, as a result of their fiscal policy. I 
do not know. I am just trying to understand.
<P>
	This budget number one of the Reform Party does not strike 
me as a serious one. I would suggest that it goes back to the 
drawing board and come up with something practical, not prima 
facie grandstanding, something that makes sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly there were a 
number of questions there.
<P>
	I guess the first one is that the socialist utopia that we often 
hear mentioned by the other parties is just not reality any more. 
Therefore what we have done is attempted in our budget to 
empower senior citizens, students and our native people so that 
they can start taking care of themselves more and more.
<P>
	Our program of an RPSP goes a long way in that area of taking 
care of people. What we have to do is target those people who 
need it most. That is the most important aspect.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	We should mention as well that these cuts must be fair across 
the board. Most farmers in the west, as was mentioned by the 
member, are prepared to say: ``Get government out of my face. 
Let me handle my own business. I am quite prepared to do that''. 
He mentioned those cuts; we have been advocating them for 
years. They are nothing new. They are asking just to get 
government out of their lives.
<P>
	Basically we want to put money in the hands of people. There 
will not be people lying on the streets who cannot take care of 
themselves; they will be taken care of. That is the whole nature 
of the program.
<P>
	The member is welcome to review the document and discuss it 
at length with me or any member of our party. We would be glad 
to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the third party for bringing 
the motion to the floor of the House, beginning with its press 
conference at nine o'clock this morning.
<P>
	I will be very measured in my response. It is very rare that I 
can be so angered as a parliamentarian with the presentation of a 
case by the opposition parties. However when one cuts corners 
to the extent of deluding Canadians about the task that faces us, 
it is something that all parliamentarians should take seriously 
and look at closely.
<P>
	This is an opportunity for Canada to turn the corner. I do not 
think any of us discount the anger felt by taxpayers and 
Canadians in general about the nature of the debt we now face. 
As a government we have undertaken with a great deal of pride 
and deliberation to ensure that our deficit is under control. We 
are the first government to set targets. We are the first 
government to meet its targets. We have approached the problem 
with a reasonable determination to succeed. We believe 
Canadians want success in deficit reduction more than anything 
else.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise to anybody in the House that this debt 
is one that tragically encumbers our ability to be successful as a 
government. Speaking on behalf of the government, the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance, we will succeed in these 
objectives.
<P>
	In this context we have an opposition party that has sought to 
play with fire. Those of us who have been in Parliament for a 
while all know what happens when a parliamentarian plays with 
fire. Scenarios and perceptions are created perhaps deliberately 
or not deliberately that are simply false. People are given the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9870"> 9870 </A></B>
<P>
impression that a solution is just around the corner or  that a 
solution is merely writing things off with the stroke of a pen.
<P>
	I come from a very poor constituency. I have seen families in 
economic difficulty. The hardest thing is to say to them: 
``Things are not likely to be better for one or two years, but if 
you really stick to this poor paying job and your family gets an 
education things will be better''. It is hope for a better future 
that makes us all work together as Canadians.
<P>
	We cannot go to families encumbered by a lot of debt and say: 
``In two or three months things are going be fine''. We cannot 
tell Canadians that in one or two years things are going to be fine 
because I do not think they will be all better within two years. Do 
I think it will be better in the near future? I actually think that. 
The government believes that and will work toward that 
objective.
<P>
	Let me refer to some small items. The non-votable motion 
before us takes the government to task for its deficit reduction 
targets ``within two years''. The taxpayers' budget, the 
so-called document of the Reform Party, talks about three years. 
On the one hand we have set out a two-year program. We have 
been silent on the third year except to say, again in a very 
determined fashion, that we will meet the new targets we set. 
Those targets will get us closer and closer to a balanced budget.
<P>
	By this sleight of hand the leader of the third party talks about 
his three-year plan and juxtaposes it with our two-year plan to 
get within 3 per cent of GNP. That is the unfair nature of the 
document.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	I have another point. He opened his address this morning and 
very carefully chose not to be in Parliament where he could be 
criticized and subject to scrutiny such as the Minister of Finance 
will be next week or the week after or whenever the budget is 
presented. He very publicly said that we must not be subject to 
the $40 billion of debt that we borrow from foreigners each year.
<P>
	We did not go to the debt market for $40 billion. The 
opposition critic and his assistants who he very nicely 
complimented during his speech know that under Bill C-14 our 
borrowing limit was far below $40 billion. We have not come 
back for an amendment. At no time this year did we say we 
would be borrowing $40 billion. In fact, if last month continues 
to be as suitable as the first 11 months of the fiscal year, it will 
probably be closer to $30 billion under Bill C-14. That is either 
poor research or a deliberate effort to tell Canadians something 
that is substantially not what it is.
<P>
	The opposition party also plays footloose with the tragedy 
that happened to the Mexican economy and the difficult remarks 
made by Moody's last week. It takes glee in telling us: ``I told 
you so. We are almost a basket case''.
<P>
	Does the party opposite realize the cost to Canadian 
homeowners? Does the House realize the cost to the  housing 
market or the price we all pay because of these international 
factors? We should not take with pride that the Mexican 
economy collapses. We should not join the chorus of the <I>Wall 
Street Journal</I> and some editorial writer saying: ``We think 
Canada is just like Mexico''.
<P>
	When the opposition party puts that into public record, some 
researcher in a Wall Street office or over in London looks it up 
and says: ``Gee whiz, there are parliamentarians in Canada who 
think Canada is like Mexico''. That is the finance critic. Then 
interest rates go up another half a per cent or another per cent. 
The housing market gets into difficulty. Families find it 
difficult. Credit card rates go up and we are charged greater 
prices. Then they can turn around in April, May or June and say: 
``See, I told you that you were getting into difficulty''. That is 
essentially irresponsible.
<P>
	The opposition party went through its taxpayers' budget and it 
went through $10 billion of cutbacks in government programs. I 
thank that party, as I did during the finance committee hearings, 
for the directness and willingness to work on the issue. The 
finance minister and the government in program review are 
looking for significant ways to cut federal expenditures. As I 
said in my opening remarks, we will not in any way, shape or 
form back off from the objectives we have set ourselves.
<P>
	There is an honest way of doing it and there are other ways of 
doing it. Let me suggest one point. The top item all of us on this 
side agree with is to reform MPs' pension plan, eliminate 
excessive travel of federal officials and reduce the number of 
ministers of state and parliamentary secretaries for a savings of 
$10 million. Now $10 million is a lot of money. Everybody 
knows that the pension plan produces no savings in the next 
three years. There are roughly 20 parliamentary secretaries and 
we all get the grand sum of $10,000. That would save $200,000. 
The ministers of state get a bit more. Let us say the total savings 
would be $500,000.
<P>
	That leaves us with $9.5 million for excessive federal travel. 
The $9.5 million at $1,000 a trip would amount to 9,500 trips 
every year. That is a lot of unnecessary trips. If we look at each 
week, it would be 190 trips a week out of the Ottawa 
International Airport. This is excessive federal travel. If a 
deputy minister or a minister thought that level of excessive 
travel was happening, we would find the responsible public 
servants and politicians reined in. I would argue that this type of 
oversimplification is what brings the wave of anger across the 
country on to the floor of Parliament and does not filter as a 
responsible parliamentarian would what is honestly wrong with 
the system and what is not.
<P>
	As long as they play to the crowd that this is corrupt place, a 
place where people do not work and a place where people try to 
rip off the system, the country will not feel good about itself.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9871"> 9871 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	The major transformation we have to make, which the 
government has taken to its Prime Minister as the primary 
responsibility of governing, is to ensure Canadians have 
confidence in their government, confidence in the way their 
dollars are being spent and confidence that we have a plan for 
the future. Each of those objectives is being met by the 
government. We are not about to roll over and allow cheap 
criticisms in any way, shape or form to pull us down from this 
honourable sense of purpose.
<P>
	Empowering individuals, families and communities: if we 
read each of these items carefully we see that the Reform is 
promising tax relief.
<P>
	Let us go back. We want to balance the budget. One of the 
most difficult things to do at the federal level is to protect the 
integrity of the fiscal base of the central government. We are 
under a lot of pressure. We have an underground economy about 
which people argue as to its depth. We have many thousands of 
concerned Canadians voicing their opinions. I received petitions 
on behalf of newspapers and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation 
yesterday.
<P>
	There are many hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are 
disturbed by their level of taxation. We would be wrong to 
ignore that in the context of making a budget.
<P>
	Empowering seniors-long term tax relief or reform. Why do 
Reformers include that? They announced a $3 billion dollar 
cutback in payments to seniors within the next three years. I 
know the member for Kingston and the Islands would be 
interested to know that they are going to do it after consultation. 
That means this year is lost. They also do not recognize the fact 
that the senior population is increasing. If we do not do anything 
in this government, the actual current levels of expenditures go 
up because of an increasing population.
<P>
	They are not taking out $3 billion but $5 billion. That is fair 
enough, but they should say $5 billion and not say $3 billion. 
They should do their research to understand how people are 
being helped and not being helped.
<P>
	Empowering families: strengthen the capacity of families to 
care for themselves with tax relief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> How much is that worth?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> What is the price attached to that? It is not 
known.
<P>
	Empowering the unemployed and job creators: tax relief or 
reform. Empowering citizens to meet education needs: this is 
after suggesting that we should get out of education.
<P>
	What do they say? They refer to an annual federal-provincial 
conference to define national standards. Have they ever gone to 
a federal-provincial meeting where they did not contribute 
anything and did not have any authority? Who is inviting them? 
What are they doing at the table? Nobody cares if they are there 
if  they are not contributing something. However they have said 
that is what we are supposed to be doing.
<P>
	Empowering those who cannot help themselves: tax relief. 
Those who cannot help themselves get tax relief. If I were to tell 
the people on social assistance in Winnipeg North Centre that I 
was going to help them with tax relief, they would be very 
curious about what taxes I was relieving them of when they 
cannot afford anything and they get about $400 a month on 
social assistance.
<P>
	Empowerment for aboriginals: many Canadians are frustrated 
with the administration and the development of 
self-government in Canada. It would be wrong to deny that. The 
Reform Party suggests a substantial savings on the aboriginal 
community. It is about $500 million; I do not have it in front of 
me.
<P>
	What do we do when that population base increases about 6 
per cent per year? The baby boom within the aboriginal 
community is the most pronounced generational problem in the 
country. If we did that we would not just be freezing money, but 
on a per capita basis when dealing with questions of housing, 
education and assistance to young people within the aboriginal 
community there would be phenomenal cutbacks.
<P>
	The Reform Party has pronounced a huge cutback in the CBC, 
with a savings of $375 million. Those of us who look at the CBC 
carefully know there have been a lot of criticisms. I am sure the 
CBC understands this, but to cut $375 million would probably 
end CBC television.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	This morning when the leader of the third party stood up in 
room 200, what did he arrange to have? Well, well, well, 
national broadcast by the CBC. What does he want to use? He 
wants to use national broadcasting to promote the end of the 
company doing that national promotion. Does he ever mention it 
in his speech? No, he just swerves right by it and remains silent 
on the whole issue. That is the nature of this presentation.
<P>
	This goes on day after day. Those members talk about 
equalization. The first thing this government did, Bill C-3, was 
to stabilize equalization for the poor provinces across this 
country. This is a very important point because as we move 
toward other funding and as we begin to deal with the provinces 
and as we can tell from the report of the federal-provincial 
meeting last week, these are going to be difficult times for many 
of the provinces which have to be given credit for the fact that 
they have shown leadership and produced near balanced or 
balanced budgets.
<P>
	Pretty well all the budgets in western Canada, for example in 
my own region, are getting close to being balanced. Different 
strategies are being applied, some gradual, some very abrupt 
strategies but nevertheless they have been stabilized. 
Equalization is an opportunity for the federal government to 
make sure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9872"> 9872 </A></B>
<P>
that the other provinces which have a more difficult time have 
some stability.
<P>
	They suggest a $500 million cutback in stabilization. 
However, if we look at it, stabilization increases about $500 
million a year. Therefore to freeze it at the level they are doing is 
a much more extensive cut than they have said. Sixty per cent of 
equalization payments in this country go to the province of 
Quebec. It is a very important contribution that the federal 
government makes.
<P>
	I would suggest as we are moving into a very difficult year in 
fighting out the referendum. All parties should appreciate the 
extent to which the federal government supports the economy of 
Quebec and not undertake budget initiatives which destabilize 
that economy at a very important time in our history.
<P>
	To not acknowledge in the paper whether or not they 
understand the relationship between equalization and the 
economy of Quebec, whether or not they just choose to ignore it 
is a moot question which I am sure they will be willing to 
address later on.
<P>
	However, the federal government has a responsibility when it 
set out a program in March of one year to the next year to 
continue that program and to continue the stabilization.
<P>
	They go on to talk about the reform of the social security 
structure. They have a new program to come out which is 
basically to disband the RRSP idea. One of the most expensive 
programs that we have in this country, the way the federal 
government helps families and individuals, is through pensions. 
It is through support of the RRSPs and through the support of the 
registered pension plans. We by most estimates allow $15 
billion of contributions to go into those plans without taxes. 
That is one of the major tax expenditures that we have.
<P>
	If one wants to have a balanced budget within three years, I 
would suggest that there are limits to ways that one can extend 
new programs. To put out the feeler or just a vague idea to 
Canadians that there is going to be tax relief, there is going to be 
tax reform, it is going to be made easier for them in the future is 
a subtle signal that it cannot be sustained by any logical 
argument.
<P>
	The last part of what they talk about is a taxpayer protection 
plan. This has been tried in other countries. The fact is that the 
last government played with the idea also. We have a 
parliamentary system. In the parliamentary system it is very 
difficult to contain a government from doing what it wants to do. 
That goes back to Walter Bagehot and the English Constitution.
<P>
	Whether one likes it or not a parliamentary system does have a 
lot of power. To argue that by law one can change the behaviour 
of a government is wrong. In reality one has to change it in the 
spirit of the government and by the moral commitment it makes 
to be reasonable with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	That moral commitment, that fiscal commitment, is here in 
this government. To offer taxpayers protection act again puts out 
this phoney signal that there is a solution just around the corner: 
``If only the government would agree with our act''.
<P>
	Here is where silence is not golden. They talk about 
taxpayers. What do they not define? The taxpayer. Who is one of 
the most common taxpayers? Corporations and banks. Are they 
saying that tax base should never be changed, that there should 
never be another tax, that Canadians are happy with the 
corporate and bank tax structure in this country, that none of us 
have ever heard people ask what we are going to do about the tax 
on this and the tax on that? What about the foreign ownership of 
the Canadian economy? Are we going to remain silent on that, a 
taxpayer issue that we are going to put into the Constitution?
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	My time is limited and my comments are extensive. I have 
tried to contain my frustration with an opposition party which is 
misusing an opportunity immediately before a federal budget to 
give Canadians the false hope that there is an easy solution, that 
we can somehow magically eliminate all the problems and all 
the bad judgments made by governments over the last two 
decades. Yes, I include the government and my own party in 
that.
<P>
	We have accumulated a lot of debt. To acknowledge the 
accumulation of debt is also to admit that we have a very 
difficult problem ahead of us. All of us will have constituents 
who will suffer. If any member in the House thinks that their 
own constituency is going to be exempt, that their own lifestyle 
is going to be exempt, that we will not feel the effects of this 
budget, they are kidding themselves. Our job is to maintain a 
consensus in this country, not to have a social struggle, not to 
have class bitterness, but to understand that we are all in this 
together.
<P>
	I thank the House very much for the opportunity to participate 
in this debate and I look forward to comments from other 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose on the other side of the coin I share the member's 
concern about having to keep one's feelings in a proper 
perspective in the spirit of debate in this House.
<P>
	I found it particularly difficult when he was standing and very 
selectively making comments and extracts from where we were 
talking about Canadians being able to help themselves. Rather 
than going through the whole process of points one through five, 
he chose to stay on only one point. I find that really unfortunate 
and I do not think it really does anything for the level of debate 
in this House.
<P>
	He has a complete lack of understanding of the rage that there 
is on the part of Canadians at this moment. The reason there is a

demand for a taxpayer protection act is that we currently have a 
government in Canada  whose leader stood before the people of 
this country and said there would be no tax increases for two 
years. The election was in October 1993. That is less than two 
years and this government will bring in tax increases. Canadians 
want the ability to be able to make politicians accountable.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, when he was on the stump, said there 
would be no tax increases except in the case of war. The last time 
I looked the only war was the war which this government is 
creating on social programs by its constant overspending.
<P>
	The hon. member suggested that the Reform Party is doing a 
disservice, that investors somewhere or people doing research 
are going to take a look and say there is a member of Parliament 
who is actually speaking up and saying things that are said in 
this week's <I>Maclean's</I> magazine which reported:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nevertheless, even Canada's best run governments and companies are now 
bracing for the sting of a credit downgrade. The federal government's credit 
rating is a ceiling that no other Canadian credit can vault. And if Ottawa's rating 
falls, Moody's has already served notice that it will also slash those of the 
provinces, including British Columbia, as well as eight triple-A rated 
municipalities across the country. One of those is London, Ontario, which 
currently has a debt of $83 million. ``A downgrade would have a significant 
impact on our borrowing costs''-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is also going to affect Sun Life Assurance, Imperial Oil and 
the rest.
<P>
	I do not understand how this member or any of the other 
members can stand in this House and say that just because the 
Reform Party is saying it like it is that somehow it is wrong. This 
is supposed to be a House of truth.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> last Friday, quoting from Moody's 
Investor Service, reported:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``We downgraded Italy in 1993 and it was very controversial'', recalled 
Vincent Truglia, the senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service Inc. responsible 
for yesterday's review of Canada's debt ratings, which could result in 
downgrades.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the case of Italy, Truglia concluded that though the country's economic 
picture was brightening, given the nature of Italian society it would be very 
difficult for the government to maintain fiscal austerity in the medium term.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Everyone disagreed with us at the time and thought we were crazy'', said 
Truglia, but Moody's analysis, ``has in fact proven to be the case quite 
strongly''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	These are warnings. I ask the parliamentary secretary to the 
finance minister why will the government not at least 
acknowledge these warnings? Even on the front page of the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> last Friday the finance minister said that he was 
surprised, he was shocked, he was outraged. These are warnings. 
Should we not be taking these as warnings rather than simply 
saying it is too bad the Reform Party is bringing up these terrible 
issues in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see the member for Kootenay 
East is doing serious reading. He started out with <I>Maclean's</I>, 
went to the <I>Financial Post</I> and then the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. I am 
glad he stopped his reading list right then and there.
<P>
	I think there are more serious ways of looking at what rating 
companies do. There is no doubt that everybody is concerned 
about it. The Minister of Finance expressed his own concern in 
answering questions in the House of Commons last week.
<P>
	I am not going to downplay the concerns that we have about 
how the world sees us and the volatility of the money markets 
over the last 12 months dealing with issues such as the 
referendum, dealing with the national debt and the provincial 
debt. All these questions weigh heavily on the government. To 
belittle them would be self-denial.
<P>
	The question becomes how we approach the country. Do we 
approach it as a sad sack? Do we approach it as if this is about to 
be the end? Or do we say to ourselves this is a strong country, we 
have a tremendous economy? The OECD says we will continue 
to lead the industrial world for the next two years in economic 
growth, that we have the fastest growth rate, around 4.5 per cent. 
This is strength. These are companies and individuals going out 
and doing something.
<P>
	We have rates of expansion in our export markets which are 
second to none in the world. We have strength. What we should 
be doing as parliamentarians is adding to that strength and not 
exercising the negative.
<P>
	Yes, the report from Moody's was a very negative report. That 
does not necessarily mean it is correct. It does not mean that we 
should all sort of give in and say this is a terrible country, why do 
families stay here, why are we bothering doing anything here. 
As parliamentarians our job is to say that this is a pretty good 
country. What we should be doing is building upon this base and 
not trying to destroy it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to build on the last 
sentence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, that we are here not to just talk about fiscal discipline 
but we are also here to talk about creating an environment for 
growth that will put people back to work.
<P>
	As I review the taxpayers' budget put forward by the Reform 
Party today I felt that specifics related to job creation and 
putting people back to work were pretty thin.
<P>
	I would like to get reassurance from the parliamentary 
secretary that we as a government have not wavered from our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9874"> 9874 </A></B>
<P>
commitment and our focus on putting Canadians back to work. 
Ultimately I believe that the two million plus people who do not 
have work are a heck of a lot more concerned about our 
commitment to that reality.
<P>
	This whole debate on deficit and fiscal discipline which has 
pretty much crowded that part of the debate out also needs some 
discussion. I wonder if I could get some reassurance from the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, this government was elected on the 
question of jobs. We have created over 400,000 jobs. More 
important, the economy has created 400,000 jobs.
<P>
	We are very supportive of companies, particularly small 
businesses that are expanding. We will form a budget that 
supports the creation of jobs in small, medium and even large 
businesses in this economy. Our job here is to support others 
who create the jobs.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister responsible for 
industry is very interested in the tourism industry. He believes, 
as does the government, that we can really create jobs by 
supporting our tourism industry. I have no compunction about 
saying in the House that we will do everything we can to support 
tourism.
<P>
	With respect to cutbacks, there is only one area the third party 
will not cut money from. It is not tourism. It is not regional 
development. What is the one area that it will not take a penny 
from? Jails. Members of that party can only be positive about 
jails. If we stop and think about it, we wonder what kind of 
perverted logic that is. We are looking at the way government 
spends money and the only thing they can be positive about is 
jails.
<P>
	To their credit they are also supporting the Department of 
Justice on gun control by allowing money for that, and it is 
appreciated. However, we have to be concerned with more than 
just jails. We have to be concerned about job creation, about 
creating another 40,000 jobs, building enthusiasm and showing 
support for the entrepreneurs and companies in this country that 
are trying to rebuild our economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we have a good example of the financial trouble we are in: a 
government which does not do anything, which does not realize 
the magnitude of the problem, and an extreme right wing 
opposition ready to impose a drastic remedy on all citizens.
<P>
	Allow me to come back to the Reform Party's motion, 
although I do not feel it is worthwhile spending a great deal of 
time on it. Many of the things we do in this House are not always 
very helpful, and we are maintaining this tradition this morning.
<P>
	If we have a quick look at government finances, we see that, 
first of all, this year's deficit will still hover around $38 billion. 
We will continue to get into debt for the 24th year in a row. Our 
debt will exceed $545 billion, while interest rates will add 
$85,000 a minute to our debt.
<P>
	Our structural deficit is $28 billion, which means that even 
with phenomenal growth and a fully functioning economy, this 
deficit would persist. The Canadian economy is plagued by 
many structural problems. The Reform Party's discussion paper 
does not have much to say on this. Interest on the debt amounted 
to $38 billion last year and will reach $45 billion this year.
<P>
	Our external debt represents 44 per cent of our total debt. 
When referring to our external debt, we must also take into 
account provincial governments, municipalities and businesses. 
Forty-four per cent of our economic activity is in foreign hands. 
The problem with foreign debt is that our savings rate is 
insufficient and our economy is far from operating at its full 
potential.
<P>
	I will also touch on what our Reform friends are suggesting 
this morning. I find it hard to call them ``friends'' when I read 
their document. This paper is a all-out attack against Quebec. 
Let us see what policy sectors they are going after. As we know, 
because of history and a number of factors, Quebec receives 
equalization payments, social assistance and unemployment 
insurance from the federal government.
<P>
	These are the only sectors where federalists can say that they 
send Quebec more money than they receive from it. There is no 
reason to boast about sending Quebec more money in these 
sectors, whether it is social assistance, unemployment insurance 
or equalization payments.
<P>
	This is how they compensate for the fact that Quebec does not 
get its fair share of subsidies allowing it to better structure its 
economy, as in research and development and other such 
sectors. They compensate with transfers, a kind of social 
assistance for the provinces.
<P>
	Today, Reformers are telling us: ``We will put some order into 
this. Not only will we not touch those sectors where Quebec is at 
a disadvantage, but we will cut UI, social assistance and 
equalization payments''. The figures speak for themselves.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The Reform vision would include cutting a total of $15 billion 
from our social security system. That includes $3 billion in 
equalization payments. As we all know, equalization is one area 
where Quebec receives a fairly substantial amount. It does not 
work out to much per capita, for instance, but since our 
population is larger, the total amount is still quite substantial.
<P>
	They want to cut in this area. They also want to cut $2.5 
billion in welfare payments and $3.4 billion in unemployment 
insurance. These are the three biggest items they want to cut, but 
they also want to cut $6.6  billion in cash transfers to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9875"> 9875 </A></B>
<P>
provinces. This is incredible, and I am amazed that they failed to 
consider the regional impact of this so-called budget.
<P>
	Perhaps the Reform Party should stop and think what the 
consequences and the impact of this budget would be on the 
Maritimes. They would also cut in other areas such as funding 
for official bilingualism and multiculturalism and the rest.
<P>
	It is my impression that the Reform Party still acts like a 
regional party, a party whose vision does not go beyond the few 
regions it represents, a party that is incapable of looking at 
Canada as a whole, which is typical of the political situation in 
this country today. And it also says a lot about the future of a 
party that hopes to govern Canada someday. I would not wish 
this on any Canadian. In any case, we may not be around, but I 
would feel sorry for Canadians if they were ever governed by a 
party like the Reform Party. Besides, it would not be in the best 
interests of Quebecers for Canadians to suffer the impact of the 
lack of vision of these people on their social policies.
<P>
	Just consider other cuts they would make. Three billion 
dollars cut from pension benefits. Three billion dollars, which 
works out to a 15 per cent cut in the income security system for 
senior citizens. Are they going to apply those cuts across the 
board? Fifteen per cent of everybody's pension cheques? Is that 
what they want to do? Hard to say. They do some simple 
arithmetic and come up with $3 billion, just like that.
<P>
	They would make additional cuts totalling $3.4 billion in 
unemployment insurance, although they know perfectly well 
that this year, the Unemployment Insurance Fund will generate a 
very high surplus. They probably want to let the surplus 
accumulate or reduce premiums. It is not clear how they want to 
do that.
<P>
	They would also make cuts of $200 million in funding for 
education. We know that they supported Minister Axworthy's 
plan that would raise tuition fees and let students pay a larger 
share of education costs. So it is not surprising that the Reform 
Party should suggest that. I am not sure what we should call this 
document, to do it justice. Perhaps we should call it an essay that 
would hardly get a passing mark.
<P>
	There are another $10 billion in cuts that should be examined 
more closely, but basically, it is an all out attack against social 
programs and especially those that benefit Quebec.
<P>
	What is the basis of the Reform Party's approach? It is 
generated by some kind of conservative ideology according to 
which the rich drive the economy and our social programs have 
burdened us with debt, and the only solution is to make drastic 
cuts in those programs in order to put public finances on a sound 
footing.
<P>
	Their document does not talk about tax equity. Not at all. It 
does not talk much about fighting the underground economy. It 
does not mention the tax treatment of corporations or businesses 
because according to them, these are the people who generate 
economic activity and they should be praised for doing so. Their 
god is the ``invisible hand'' of Adam Smith at its best. 
Government has no place in the economy or the social sector, 
and if they could privatize social security completely, they 
would. But of course, they cannot go all out in that respect.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I heard them say in their introduction that they were proud of 
what they had done, proud of this document. If this document 
were actually in effect, however, I doubt they would be quite so 
proud about facing people in the street, sinking ever deeper into 
poverty.
<P>
	Clearly they took their inspiration to some extent from the 
model provided by Alberta, which is going to fix up its public 
finances and will succeed in getting out of the deficit. However, 
one has to understand the Alberta model. Yesterday, there was a 
very good report on <I>Le Point</I>. If I am not mistaken, 30,000 
welfare recipients have left Alberta. Where have they gone? 
Whose responsibility have they become? It is easy to do 
something in isolation, but others have to carry the cost of it. 
Where are they now? In British Columbia, Manitoba or 
Saskatchewan, and surely being provided for by another 
provincial government.
<P>
	Some of them will no doubt re-enter the labour market, but 
still. So it is easy to do something in isolation when you can pass 
problems or costs on to others. It would be just about impossible 
to apply the Alberta solution to all of Canada. The additional 
revenues generated by the oil industry in Alberta this year could 
not be duplicated for Canada as a whole. The situation there is a 
highly specific one.
<P>
	We should have a look as well at what all of this is doing to the 
health care system and to hospitals. I would like to quote a few 
passages from the Reform Party's document on 
decentralization, which echoes the Liberals in talk of new 
federalism, decentralized federalism, federalism on the move, 
developing federalism and everything else they would have us 
believe, but always with the same idea behind it all.
<P>
	They suggest transferring financial problems to the 
provinces, which is what decentralization is all about, while 
maintaining national standards. Page 24 of their document 
provides that the federal government would use equalization to 
make these national standards attainable. However, further 
along in the figures, we see that they are going to cut 
equalization payments. They are therefore denying the means to 
those who need it to attain the national standards. Not only do 
we keep 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9876"> 9876 </A></B>
<P>
national standards high, but we cut the money and then we force 
them to meet the standards. How are the provinces, the 
recipients of equalization payments, going  to attain these 
standards? This would be the worst decentralization scenario, if 
it were handled this way. We would of course keep all the 
departments on overlap service.
<P>
	Further on, the document states that, in terms of the health 
care system, essential services must be maintained so that they 
may be covered. What is an essential service? What does it 
mean? Under this kind of health care system, does it mean that 
essential services will be available to anyone, at any hospital, on 
any given day? Do they know what the impact of all this will be? 
It is said that prevention is one of the weak spots in our health 
care system and in our society in general. I would be curious to 
see the impact that only covering essential services will have on 
that.
<P>
	People with health problems that they consider minor will not 
get out and get treatment. What kind of health problems will that 
lead to? Obviously, they do not talk about this. Their approach is 
overly simplistic. If I were a teacher in a CEGEP-I suppose 
that such projects could not be considered university level-and 
I had to mark this project, I would be hard put to give it a passing 
mark.
<P>
	I would like to touch on what could be done. There are some 
things that we should do to improve government finances, 
because they have been suggested. There is a difference between 
making things even more difficult for people, which is what the 
Reform Party would do, and doing nothing, which is what the 
current government is doing-it did nothing to reduce the 
deficit in its first year, then decided to put changes off for a year 
and is too afraid to make a move before the referendum in 
Quebec.
<P>
	We must not think that we can fix 24 consecutive years of 
overspending in 15 or 20 minutes of debate, as the Reformers 
would have us believe, or by jotting a few things down on paper; 
it is much more complex than that. We must take progressive 
steps, like the ones we need for our tax system.
<P>
	I have been lucky enough, in these times, to travel throughout 
Quebec with the youth commission on the future of Quebec and 
to hear many visions for the future; how to build the desired 
society and the principles on which it should be built, be it 
Canada or Quebec. The values and principles mentioned most 
frequently are those of fairness and justice.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	No one has any solutions to offer, apparently. We are told to 
emphasize certain things. There is little mention of collecting 
unpaid taxes, which would reportedly amount to some $6 or $7 
billion. We can certainly not collect all of it, but we could at 
least collect part of it, even if it is only $2 or $3 billion per year 
over the next two years.
<P>
	As for overlapping and waste by the federal government in 
particular, a great deal of money could be saved in this area, 
perhaps a few billion more. The only matter on which we agree 
with the Reformers is that of business subsidies. We can indeed 
eliminate subsidies which are in any case not effective and 
which distort the market. In the area of defence, more cuts can 
be made; $1.5 or $1.6 billion in additional cuts could easily be 
made.
<P>
	We would also have to look closely at certain tax rules. We 
have talked about family trusts ever since we came to the House, 
so much so that I am getting fed up with the whole subject. Talk, 
talk, talk, but nothing happens. We must also reconsider the 
approach of investing in megaprojects. A restrictive tax policy 
would lead to a slightly more relaxed monetary policy, 
especially in regard to short term interest rates. The impact on 
our economy would not be negligible.
<P>
	Certain measures would serve, over the next two years, to 
restore public finances to a level which would make foreign 
investors more confident, decrease pressure on interest rates and 
improve Canada's economy on the whole.
<P>
	I shall conclude with the choices available. For a good number 
of Quebecers, 1995 is the year for making choices. For 
Canadians as a whole, it is also the year to make financial 
choices and, as the time draws nearer, a greater number of 
possibilities emerge, such as the Reform proposal, a proposal 
which has not been put forward in Quebec. Reformers need only 
look at the results of the byelections in Brome-Missisquoi and 
even in Saint-Henri-Westmount to see that their vision of 
society in the future, their vision is not catching on at all in 
Quebec and probably never will because it is out of touch with 
reality.
<P>
	If this vision is becoming widespread in Canada, no wonder 
the union between Quebec and Canada is in trouble. So, if this is 
how Reformers see things, let us not be surprised if this vision 
has an impact on the choices Quebecers make, because they see 
things differently. So, I really wish they would stop wanting to 
cut in the financial assistance provided to Quebec on account of 
the fact that it receives more in terms of social assistance, 
unemployment insurance and transfer payments. I wish that 
Quebecers could levy their owns taxes and spend these amounts 
effectively so that they would not need to be on the receiving end 
of such programs, so that fewer people would be in need.
<P>
	But for that to happen, half the economic lever must not be 
left in the hands of someone who could not care less anyway 
about economic development. In that respect, the Quebec 
government has come up with a solution, a solution it is putting 
forward with the support of the Bloc Quebecois and perhaps 
even another party, the Democratic Action Party, which is 
making it increasingly clear it wants Quebec to be fully 
sovereign.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9877"> 9877 </A></B>
<P>
	So, there is growing support in Quebec for sorting out our 
problems on our own and letting others do the same, but I am 
still not convinced that this vision of the Reformers is shared 
by all Canadians. I certainly hope that is not the case, because 
this is no way of looking at the future, this is not something 
desirable.
<P>
	To conclude, there is a whole range of possibilities between 
doing nothing, which is the Liberal approach, and laying off 
everybody and putting everyone on the street, as the Reform 
Party is suggesting. Good for them. Preparing this budget has 
kept them busy for a few days, but I do not think it will be very 
useful in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, to put the 
fiscal house in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
heard a lot of criticism of our budget from the hon. Bloc 
member, but I would like to ask him where the Bloc's numbers 
are. If you are going to criticize a solid plan like we presented 
here today, then you had better have something to offer in-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Recognizing, like all 
debates, that this one will bring some strong views, by the same 
token I continue to remind members to direct their interventions 
through the Speaker so that we can continue this debate in the 
finest parliamentary tradition.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say again, if the hon. member is 
going to criticize, which is good, then he should offer a positive 
alternative as we have done with this budget. I ask the hon. 
member for some specifics on what the Bloc party and what he 
would offer as an alternative.
<P>
	In particular, I am really surprised that the member from the 
Bloc pointed out a concern with what we have mentioned and 
with what we have presented in this budget in terms of transfer 
payments. In fact, we have proposed to give more control to the 
provinces. I thought this was something that Quebecers wanted.
<P>
	I will read a little bit from our budget on the principle of 
decentralization that the member referred to. ``As a general 
principle, government services shall be delivered by levels of 
government closest to the people. The federal government 
should respect in practice as well as in law, provincial 
jurisdiction over natural resources and the delivery of social 
programs''.
<P>
	The hon. member has criticized us for this. This actually 
means giving a lot more power to Quebec and all other 
provinces. I want to hear specifically why the member has a 
concern with this area. I ask for his suggestions, other than 
separation which appears to be an option that Quebecers are not 
going to accept.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to go over the whole 
decentralization approach for the second time, an approach on 
which the Liberals and Reformers agree. It is how they see 
decentralization. They tell us that they will let the provinces 
manage social programs.
<P>
	They mention natural resources. I would remind my colleague 
that, under the constitution, some if not most natural resources 
should come under provincial jurisdiction, just like health and 
education. How generous of them to tell us that they will let us 
manage these sectors in the future.
<P>
	They tell us we should be happy that we will now be 
responsible for these sectors. We would also like to have the 
revenues to manage them. They cannot transfer expenditures 
without the revenues that go with them. While the federal 
government continues to collect taxes as in the past, it will 
transfer responsibilities but less money. They will tell us about 
their flexible federalism, which left them broke so that they will 
now return the favour by aggravating our difficulties.
<P>
	In addition to giving us administrative responsibility, they 
will give us jurisdiction, and then impose national standards. 
They say that in their paper. They say ``in co-operation''. 
Talking about federal-provincial co-operation is all fine and 
well, but we know who always ends up setting national 
standards.
<P>
	They also say in their paper that equalization payments will 
allow all provinces to meet these national standards. Their 
figures say the exact opposite: we cut your transfer payments 
and equalization but maintain the same standards. There is 
something wrong with their logic.
<P>
	A little further, there is a statement about health care. It seems 
national standards would only apply to essential medical 
services. There is no explanation of what that means.
<P>
	This is hardly decentralization. Real decentralization 
involves providing financial resources in amounts that are 
equivalent, sufficient and fair-take your pick.
<P>
	There is another element missing from this document. In 
economics, it is very difficult to do an accurate assessment of 
the mathematical impact of a measure. Economic forecasts are a 
good example. People think economics is an exact science. 
Making an economic forecast is like predicting that, when I 
leave the House, I will either go straight ahead, to the centre or 
to the left, but since around noon I usually have lunch at the 
cafeteria in the West Block, it is far more likely I will turn right. 
On the basis of a number of set assumptions, one can say yes, he 
will turn right. However, anything can happen.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The document fails to consider some of the more predictable 
consequences of cuts in welfare payments and unemployment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9878"> 9878 </A></B>
<P>
insurance. This money is often recirculated into the economy. 
People who receive  welfare payments do not keep the money. 
They spend it. So if we cut those payments, we get the so-called 
negative spiral effect on the economy, and the document fails to 
factor in the negative impact of these cuts.
<P>
	We cannot cut $15 billion in our social programs without 
affecting government revenues. No way. These people buy 
things, and the store owner uses that money to buy what he 
needs. That is the positive impact of dollars that circulate. 
Dollars that no longer circulate, that are kept by the government 
to reduce the deficit, have a negative impact. This aspect of the 
issue seems to have been ignored.
<P>
	I am not saying that we should continue going into debt. I am 
merely saying that the negative impact of the proposed cuts has 
not been evaluated. I am convinced that their proposal would not 
lead to a balanced budget.
<P>
	As for the suggestions made by the Bloc, I am sure we were 
agreed on one of them, the one involving business subsidies. We 
talk of cutting the government's administrative expenditures 
where overlap exists, senseless expenditures-the Senate could 
be completely abolished, we would not be sorry to see that, but 
that will be debated after we are gone-collecting unpaid taxes, 
the defence department, and so forth.
<P>
	We are ready to consider tax expenditures, but they do not 
believe in such things. They think that there are only budgetary 
expenditures. Some expenditures are tax expenditures. Is a box 
at a Toronto Maple Leafs or Montreal Canadiens game a revenue 
generating expenditure which should be a tax deduction? I have 
my doubts. The tax system could be tightened up.
<P>
	But there is no mention of revising anything, of changing 
anything to do with taxes because they are afraid-these people 
are very fond of such measures which allow them to make taxes 
less progressive. Our progressive tax system is diminished by 
such taxation measures. At a certain level of income, it becomes 
difficult to maintain the progressive nature of the system 
because people use the tax system to circumvent it.
<P>
	This cannot be changed, these are the same people who 
advocate a flat rate of taxation across the board. That is their 
idea, it is part of what they are demanding. This is all based on a 
peculiar vision of society which does not allow for any 
redistribution of wealth whatsoever, and that is its greatest fault.
<P>
	I would like them to show me how they would redistribute the 
money, how they would narrow the gap between high income 
earners and low income earners which has grown steadily in the 
last fifteen years. Why is this not mentioned in their document? 
Redistribution is not one of the Reform Party's priorities, so it is 
not mentioned.
<P>
	It is clear and quite plain that we will never get involved in a 
program like that. There are other ways of going about things. 
All it takes is a bit of imagination and to stop repeating the 
theories of right-wing economists.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member from the Bloc is right. He and his colleagues in the 
finance committee do talk endlessly about tax loopholes. In 
spite of having been given the opportunity on repeated 
occasions to be able to point out to the finance committee what 
these tax loopholes are and quantifying them, they have been 
unable to do that to this point.
<P>
	However, so that he can come up to speed on the whole 
concept of tax points and how they affect things, the hon. 
member should look at our document, if he has a copy of it 
before him.
<P>
	On page 57 he will see the impact on post-secondary 
education of decreasing the cash transfers from the federal 
government which we have proposed of $200 million. If we 
transfer the tax points and give the provinces of Quebec, British 
Columbia and Prince Edward Island the ability to tax in place of 
the federal government taxing, he will see from the graph that by 
the year 2014 there is a very substantial net increase in funding 
for post-secondary education.
<P>
	I recognize that we released this document just this morning. 
Perhaps he and some of the Liberal members have not had time 
to come up to speed.
<P>
	As another example, if the hon. member would look at page 52 
where we are talking about a 15 per cent cut in the entitlement 
going to seniors, he would see it. The very first line says: 
``Focus OAS and GIS on those most in need''.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	In answer to the question in his speech about whether this 
means everybody will be cut, no, it does not. However, I am 
really interested in the concept that we are proposing to transfer 
the ability of the respective jurisdictions, be they provincial or 
municipal, to deliver the services at the point of need and also to 
have the tax room for funding.
<P>
	Apart from the ``vive le Québec libre'' kind of thing they are 
getting into, is that not exactly what they are after? I do not 
understand why there is a conflict between his and our own point 
of view on this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, how very generous of them to say 
that, for $200 million, they will give us the equivalent tax points 
while at the same time they will cut something like $1 or $1.5 
billion in equalization.
<P>
	To my understanding, this is not about recovering equivalent 
tax points. So, their whole way of going about reallocating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9879"> 9879 </A></B>
<P>
transfer payments will have a negative impact on Quebec. A two 
minute analysis of the document makes this patently obvious. In 
any case, I have no intention of spending the whole day looking 
at it; I have more important things to do.
<P>
	The hon. member corrected what was said about seniors by 
saying that not everyone would face a 15 per cent cut. It is true 
that that is not the case. They say the focus will be on those most 
in need, but, here again, it is not defined, just as they do not 
really define either who will be targeted by the UI cuts. They do 
not say who is going to be affected by those.
<P>
	This is how it works. When they do not have enough 
information to provide more details, they stick to basic 
principles, which do not take into account the overall impact. It 
is easy to talk about cutting $1, $2 or $3 billion dollars. When we 
start looking at the workings or into the details, we see that a lot 
is missing. Fine principles are easily espoused, but hard to put 
into practice. The Reform Party cannot get around it. This 
document is not worth any more than the paper it is printed on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will continue in Reform to split our time.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in the House today to address Reform's 
opposition day motion. I am also pleased to be here as a member 
of a team that has the gumption, the fortitude and the 
imagination to come forward with an alternative budget ahead 
of the government's own. It indicates to Canadians and to the 
House there are better ways of doing business and getting us out 
of the crisis we are fast approaching.
<P>
	For the benefit of people who have just tuned in I would like to 
read the motion of the day: ``That this House reject this 
government's totally inadequate target which reduces the deficit 
to 3 per cent of GDP within two years and will leave Canada at 
the end of this period with a federal deficit of about $25 billion, 
a federal debt of over $600 billion and $50 billion in annual 
interest payments and higher taxes''.
<P>
	The operative word is that we reject the government's target. 
Many in the House may ask what is the purpose of our motion. Is 
it simply partisan politics? I will admit there is a political 
overtone to our motion. However, its purpose is anything but 
partisan.
<P>
	Its purpose, if adopted as a motion, would be to show to 
Canadians and to the international financial markets that the 
government is serious about getting its debt under control. This 
is a very important goal because Canadians must know that any 
sacrifices they may be asked to make as a result of the upcoming 
budget are designed to take a serious bite out of the staggering 
debt and deficit situation. It is also important to show 
international financial markets that the government understands 
the severity of the fiscal situation and is prepared to take 
concrete action to deal with it.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In November the prestigious C. D. Howe Institute issued a 
report urging the government to move faster in the area of deficit 
reduction. It said the target of 3 per cent of GDP was not 
acceptable to the money markets. We now see that this sentiment 
is shared by other influential members of the financial 
community. To the consternation of members across the way, 
last week Moody's bond rating agency announced that it is 
reviewing Canada's AAA credit rating. In fact it was probably to 
the consternation of all Canadians. News of this review caused 
the dollar to fall and interest rates to climb. We simply cannot 
afford this type of reaction to the government's relative 
inaction.
<P>
	We must renounce the government's shortsighted and 
inadequate deficit reduction plan by adopting the motion that is 
before the House today.
<P>
	Why do I say that we can no longer afford to follow the 
government's reduction plan? It is because the problem is of 
such a size that we can no longer afford to ignore it. We ignore it 
at our peril.
<P>
	That problem is a projected annual deficit of approximately 
$40 billion, which incidentally is about the same size as the debt 
financing we are paying. Think what we could do with $40 
billion to spend on programs. We have to bring the deficit under 
control. This deficit of $40 billion will get added to the national 
debt, which is now more than $550 billion. It is a debt which is 
growing by more than $1,400 every second of every day.
<P>
	The government's idea of deficit reduction is to trim a $40 
billion shortfall to $25 billion. It is not enough.
<P>
	Currently each Canadian taxpayer is in debt over $39,000, 
while the debt of every man, woman and child in this country is 
more than $19,000. They need relief and they need it now. We 
cannot afford to wait longer for the government to get serious 
about deficit reduction, or should I say deficit elimination.
<P>
	I hope that I have established the need for us to act. I would 
now like to offer the government some suggestions as to how to 
reduce the deficit. If it does not want to take the time to go into 
the taxpayers' budget, here are a few things from my particular 
area.
<P>
	First, we must get hold of the deficit by spending reductions 
and not by tax increases. We have said that over and over again 
but I think we have to say it over and over again. Canadians are 
already taxed to the max and they cannot, nor should they, 
tolerate tax increases of any type. There are many places where 
the government can cut back on its spending. I would like to 
focus on an area for which I happen to be the spokesperson in our 
party, official languages.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9880"> 9880 </A></B>
<P>
	My Liberal colleagues will no doubt shudder at the idea of 
trimming anything having to do with official languages. 
However, given our dire financial straits we can no longer 
afford to feed this sacred cow with the same unbridled abandon 
that we have for almost the past 26 years.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Just before I detail the cuts I propose, I would like to state 
very clearly again that Reform supports the use of two official 
languages in Canada. We believe Canadians have a right to 
receive services from key federal institutions where there is a 
justifiable demand. That is why later today I will be calling on 
the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages to support 
my motion which would ensure people in minority language 
communities get the services they are entitled to from the 
federal government in the language of their choice.
<P>
	People have a right to these services but, at the same time, all 
Canadians have a right to have their tax dollars spent wisely. 
This is why I believe we can reduce spending in this area without 
sacrificing minority language rights such as services to the 
public.
<P>
	I have reviewed the more than $600 million in annual official, 
official languages spending. I say official because there appears 
to be more spending in this area which does not appear in the 
official documentation so I am just looking at the nominal book 
value of $600 million. I have been working on this for over a 
year so I know there is much more there that is out of view but I 
have not been able to put my finger on it yet.
<P>
	My research shows that we can save roughly $300 million in a 
year by making the following changes to current government 
spending practices. This is only $300 million, but if we get $300 
million here, $300 million somewhere else and $300 somewhere 
else we have $1 billion. If we keep doing that we can come up 
with the answers.
<P>
	First, I propose a savings of $80 million by trimming the 
amount the government gives to the provinces for second 
language education. Education, as we all know, is a provincial 
jurisdiction and the federal government should stop meddling in 
this area. Much of this money is used for programs such as 
French immersion, which has in itself been called into question 
by several noted scholars, including Professor Hammerly of 
Simon Fraser University. Federal funding of immersion has also 
resulted in the creation of a two-tiered education system in 
many districts. This in itself is a good reason to discontinue this 
funding.
<P>
	However, coupled with our desperate need to get our finances 
in order, it is an area of spending which must be eliminated. 
Under my proposal over three years we would save federal 
taxpayers more than $240 million.
<P>
	Another area we can save in is the promotion of official 
languages. This program costs us more than $41 million in the 
current fiscal year. We can support official  language groups in 
communities without spending copious amounts of money to do 
so.
<P>
	I had better wind up by saying that the government's deficit 
reduction policy is inadequate. It is not enough to tackle our 
serious debt problem and it is not enough to inspire confidence 
among Canadians or the international money markets.
<P>
	I urge the government to take this situation very seriously. We 
will try to help by offering suggestions such as I have just done 
as to the areas where we can cut.
<P>
	I support the motion and I urge members and the government 
to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the 
opportunity to glance at the budget presented by the Reform 
Party. It was not readily available until later this morning.
<P>
	One of the concerns I have is that Reformers identify the debt 
as being a major problem. Certainly the government recognizes 
that. My concern is what their actions might do in terms of 
causing pressure on interest rates. They have done well in that 
regard because they have exerted upward pressures on interest 
rates. I returned from Calgary on the weekend. I had an 
opportunity to pick up Friday's edition of the Calgary <I>Herald</I> 
and there was a front page story about that.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It is important to reflect on the cuts Reform members are 
talking about because they affect very real people. This story 
talked about how the social services department cut off of 
welfare a 60-year old mother who was caring for her disabled 
29-year old daughter. Given her medical condition, the daughter 
suffers from continual seizures. As a matter of fact, it talks 
about her having had 210 since January 17.
<P>
	If the decision to cut off of welfare that 60-year old mother 
who has worked all her life were allowed to stand, it would have 
resulted in the 29-year old daughter being put in care at a cost of 
$100,000 a year. It seems to make little sense to have policies in 
place that would allow that kind of tragedy to occur.
<P>
	I bring that forward because you can be penny wise and pound 
foolish. I think the Reform Party is rather light on analysis and is 
rather light on the fact that there are real people involved.
<P>
	Does the member believe it is better not to pay $600 in welfare 
to a 60-year old mother so she can look after her 29-year old 
disabled daughter? Or does he think money is better spent by 
forcing the 60-year old mother into retraining and having the 
state support the 29-year old daughter in an institution at a very 
excessive cost?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that the question 
is a serious one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9881"> 9881 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, I am not a spokesman for Premier Klein of 
Alberta. Second, the observation, while very interesting, has 
nothing whatsoever to do with the presentation I have just made 
in this House. It is totally irrelevant. It might be directed to 
some of the detail in the budget, but I cannot honestly take the 
question seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, reference is made in the Reform Party budget to 
particular cuts in social security spending. In particular, 
reference is made to senior citizen benefits being reduced by 15 
per cent. In a country where the number of seniors is increasing, 
there is no recommendation for stable funding in that area but 
rather a reduction of 15 per cent.
<P>
	Could the hon. member perhaps elucidate in what manner 
these particular cuts are proposed to be made to senior citizens?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, this is not directly 
relevant to the speech I have given, but I would be happy to 
answer it in any event since it seems to be a sincere question.
<P>
	We would target seniors, such as myself, who do not need the 
old age pension. That is where we would do the cuts. We would 
target things properly. Those who need it either continue to get 
it, or in some cases perhaps they should get more. Those who do 
not need this sort of support should not get it. I think the 
majority of those would agree with this analysis and say to put it 
where it is needed, not where it is not needed.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to speak today as one of our party's critics on human 
resources development and social policy and particularly to 
address our motion contending that the government's 3 per cent 
of GDP deficit targets are totally inadequate. I would like to 
address it from the perspective of the impact of this policy on 
social programs in this country.
<P>
	It was the Trudeau Liberal government of which the present 
Prime Minister was once a senior member and finance minister, 
which first sold Canadians on the myth that big governments can 
solve most of our problems. Government then designed program 
after program to take over some of our personal responsibilities 
and provide for our basic needs.
<P>
	Government help and handouts are now regarded as a right. In 
fact, today when someone claims a right for something, he is 
probably asking for goods or help from the government. The 
pervasiveness of this attitude was demonstrated to me this 
December when, as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development, I attended hearings on the 
social reform proposals of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Although very few Canadians were given the opportunity to 
address the committee, 159 advocates for special interest groups 
were paid almost $4 million taxpayer dollars to come and plead 
their right to continued or even increased public funding. This is 
funding that will have to be extracted from current and future 
fellow Canadians, from you and me and our children, in the form 
of higher taxes or debt.
<P>
	Sadly, the pipe dream of big government as a solution to our 
problems has not only brought us close to bankruptcy, it has led 
to an abdication of personal responsibilities and has set 
Canadians against Canadians. Hard working Canadians are 
becoming increasingly incensed to have the fruits of their labour 
confiscated to fund an ever growing number of non-essential 
programs. Needy Canadians are told that they are entitled to 
more help from their fellow citizens and that they can rightly 
resent anyone whose hard work, risk taking or good fortune has 
provided them with a measure of wealth.
<P>
	The problems we are facing today are not just the result of a 
lack of money, but are directly related to the role we expect 
government to play in our lives. We are now beginning to realize 
that many government services are dysfunctional, unaffordable 
and have a negative effect on self-reliance, independence, 
responsibility, personal dignity and the social fabric of our 
society.
<P>
	For a quarter of a century Canadians have been encouraged to 
increasingly rely on the government, and they have done just 
that. A vast amount of our national wealth goes to pay for 
security measures. Fully one-half of all federal government 
spending is on social programs. Two-thirds of all federal 
government spending, after it pays its interest payments, is on 
social programs. Spending on social programs by all levels of 
government is about $155 billion every year. That is over 20 per 
cent of our country's entire income of $750 billion.
<P>
	On top of that, Canadians spend a significant amount of their 
own personal resources on security measures. These include 
additional health insurance, savings for old age, post-secondary 
education and training, insurance against a whole host of 
unforeseen adversities, and personal savings.
<P>
	Even if we stopped funding any of this social spending with 
borrowed money, we still would spend more than adequate 
amounts of our national wealth to achieve the level of security 
we need. Yet welfare state programs are paid for not only by 
heavy taxation but by borrowing from future generations.
<P>
	The disastrous consequences of these Liberal policies are now 
threatening the very programs that Canadians have been 
encouraged to rely on to meet their security needs. Let me 
explain why.
<P>
	In order to borrow, someone has to lend us money. When 
someone lends the Government of Canada money there has to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9882"> 9882 </A></B>
<P>
something in it for them. That something is interest. The interest 
has to be paid every year until the money is returned. Our 
government has not been  returning any borrowed money. Far 
from it. Instead, for 25 plus years in a row it has borrowed more 
and more money every single year on which it must pay more 
and more interest. Not only does the interest burden increase, it 
compounds.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Just think about the logic of what we have done. We have 
borrowed money to keep expensive, welfare state, give 
everybody a cheque programs afloat. Every dollar in interest 
paid on that borrowed money is a dollar that we cannot now 
spend on needy people in our country.
<P>
	This year the Canadian government paid out $42.7 billion in 
interest. Just think for a moment how much security that $42.7 
billion could have provided to the people of this country. Next 
year we will have to pay about $47 billion in interest. So next 
year we will have $4 billion less to spend on social security, and 
less the year after that, and even less the year after that until 
almost all our national wealth is consumed to service the debt 
that our reckless and incompetent political managers, mostly 
Liberals with help from so-called Conservatives, have saddled 
us with.
<P>
	The tragedy is that it is not just us today who must face the 
huge drain of interest dollars endangering our future security. 
Shamefully, our children and our children's children will have 
to carry the burden of our government's lack of self-control. 
Their futures have been heavily mortgaged because 
governments were not willing to pay their own way.
<P>
	For 15 months this Liberal government has allowed this 
incredible fiscal disaster to continue. In these 15 months it has 
borrowed another $61 billion. That means that every single 
month this government, this team which claims to be so 
competent, has overspent by $4 billion. Every month this 
government has put $4 billion more on your credit card and 
mine, Mr. Speaker. That is $137.93 for every single Canadian 
every month. That debt is the inheritance our children have to 
look forward to. And now the finance minister even wants to tax 
that.
<P>
	With this kind of fiscal insanity on the record one would think 
this Liberal government would now be telling Canadians it has 
cleaned up its act, will be living within its means and has 
stopped the interest drain on our economy. Instead, what the 
government is telling us is so incredible that it has citizens 
across the country rising in outrage.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the finance minister say they intend 
to confiscate even more of our income for their own spending 
purposes. They also tell us with pride in their voices that they 
intend to continue to put us in the hole a minimum of $25 billion 
for every year we leave them in charge of our affairs. They refer 
to this incompetent management as good, honest government.
<P>
	Our children will have to cough up in the neighbourhood of $8 
billion every single year to pay for the spending spree of this 
government not to mention the $40-odd billion every single 
year they get to pay on the spending sprees indulged in by 
previous Liberal and Conservative governments. I expect our 
children will have quite a different name for this kind of 
management.
<P>
	It is not hard to figure out that a dollar spent on interest is a 
dollar that cannot be spent on social programs. A dollar spent on 
interest is a dollar that cannot be used to help the poor and 
disadvantaged. A dollar spent on interest is a dollar that cannot 
be used by business to expand, to improve products, to take 
advantage of trade opportunities and most of all, to create real 
long term jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Members of this government make a big production about 
their commitment to helping people. They constantly wax 
eloquent about the virtues of fairness, equity and compassion.
<P>
	I am willing to bet that every single one of these kind and 
caring Liberals will vote to put us and our children over $100 
billion in the hole during their term in office. Every one of these 
Liberals will stand by and see an additional $8 billion plus 
sucked out of our social programs, sucked out of our job sector, 
sucked out of our future security over their term in office.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	How fair is that to Canadians struggling to support themselves 
and their families? How equitable is it for us to spend today and 
hand the bill to tomorrow's citizens? Where is the compassion in 
eroding the sustainability of social programs because the 
government cannot get a grip on its appetite for borrowed 
money?
<P>
	For 15 months Reformers in Parliament have steadfastly 
pressed for a change in direction and have kept the issues of our 
borrowing and our debt and the interest drain on our economy on 
the national agenda. Reformers are telling the Liberal 
government it is time to change direction. Canadians deserve 
better than to end up where the Liberals are taking us.
<P>
	We need to downsize government, re-evaluate and restrict its 
functions, and stop living on borrowed money. We need to find 
better ways to effectively help those in need, ways that are 
affordable and encourage people to take responsibility for 
themselves, their families and those around them through 
communities, churches, schools, charities and other social 
groups. Public assistance should be reserved for those who need 
it most.
<P>
	My colleagues and I in the Reform Party are doing our utmost 
to get the message of fiscal responsibility to those who sit across 
the floor of the House. Unfortunately as opposition we cannot 
bring about real change, a fact that is as frustrating for many 
Canadians as it is for me. That will not stop us from doing what 
we can to influence the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9883"> 9883 </A></B>
<P>
	Today Reform has taken the unprecedented step of taking a 
government by the hand and showing it the way to a balanced 
budget within one term of office, within three years. I do not 
expect members opposite will be permitted to support such a 
common sense proposal, but I invite Canadians to continue to 
demand a return to fiscal sanity in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the second opposition party for tabling what 
can be called a shadow budget. It becomes part of a general 
dialectical process of discussion that the finance minister 
launched some months ago and which has been highlighted by 
discussions of citizens' groups, household groups, learned 
society groups, all people putting in ideas and suggestions to the 
government to help the finance minister in preparing for his 
budget that he will table in the next week.
<P>
	Members will pardon me, though, if I say-it is not intended 
as a criticism-that one finds in the feedback from the various 
groups consulted, and we could say this is true of the shadow 
budget from the second opposition party, that it is formulated at 
a fairly high level of generality and abstraction, that it lacks the 
tethering detail of examining concrete cases against an 
empirical record which is the responsibility of a government.
<P>
	One is reminded of General Secretary Khrushchev celebrated 
rebuke to the Albanians. I will not translate what he said in 
Russian exactly. He referred, I think we can say in English, to 
people jabbering. Basically it says: ``Look, it is one thing to talk 
without having responsibility but when you have to make 
decisions you have to point out concretely what this means''.
<P>
	In other words, if we have suggestions to make and we do not 
want cutbacks in our own backyard, whom would we want to cut 
and why? What are the criteria?
<P>
	It is very easy to say without responsibility for the 
government that one would eliminate $40 billion or $50 billion 
from federal spending in three years, but a government has to 
justify that in the concrete cases and examine what cuts in one 
sector of the budget would do to other sectors of the budget and, 
second, what impact it would all have on federal-provincial 
relations which without necessarily any action other than from 
historical forces is with us again as a key issue in the next few 
years, the Quebec issue to mention only one of these things.
<P>
	We were warned during the last general election by financial 
analysts of some reputation and by the International Monetary 
Fund that reckless and radical financial restructuring without 
proper attention to empirical detail would have unforeseen 
effects on unemployment and on the economy.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	This is why the government, as its first approach to the 
budget, recognizes the basic truth that any budget is a balancing 
act. It requires balancing competing interests, social and 
economic interests, choosing between them and offering 
justification for that.
<P>
	As a government we are charged with keeping Canada 
together. We have to recognize the conflict in economic 
attitudes in many parts of the country. For the economically 
dynamic western provinces in which my own seat is located this 
means cutting the deficit as top priority. In Quebec and the 
Atlantic provinces we are getting the message that jobs may 
have a higher priority than that. We have to balance those 
interests.
<P>
	Our predecessor government, the Mulroney government that 
has disappeared into history, had a fixation on cutting without 
serious consideration of the revenue side of the balance sheet. 
To take one example, some economists estimate that each public 
sector job results in seven spinoff jobs in the private sector. For 
many companies, for better or for worse, the public sector today 
is their largest customer. They have to be weaned off public 
spending. Public sector jobs have to be cut at a pace at which the 
private sector can absorb them.
<P>
	Coming back to the budget and the balancing of interests, 
there is a little bit of voodoo economics from the second 
opposition party. President George Bush's-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A little bit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> We understate, as the parliamentary 
secretary who intervened knows very well. It is our tradition to 
understate.
<P>
	There is a little bit of voodoo economics in some of the 
proposals put forward by the second opposition party. For 
example, cutting provincial transfer payments with a 
corresponding transfer of tax points does not result in lowering 
the overall public debt. It is simply to transfer federal problems 
to the provinces.
<P>
	Alberta and Saskatchewan already have their own economic 
houses in order but other provinces have not. I do not think they 
are going to appreciate a federal government abdication of 
responsibility.
<P>
	Let us take another example. Broad brush cuts look very 
simple. There is a proposal that has been floated to automate 
lighthouses on the west coast. It is a major issue for people on 
the west coast. Many sincere, decent people have discussed this 
subject with me. I have 25,000 names on a petition in my office 
opposing this one budgetary cut. I accept the sincerity of the 
proposals, the logic of the argument, but I also recognize that we 
have to make cuts.
<P>
	I have to pose the question: ``Whom would you cut and why? 
Is the deficit to be cut everywhere but in one's own backyard?'' 
These are the hard problems that a finance minister must 
struggle with.
<P>
	The Indian affairs department has been referred to. It is a 
favourite target for many people who do not bother examining 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9884"> 9884 </A></B>
<P>
empirical data. It is in the process of devolution that is being 
spearheaded in Manitoba. The department has cut its workforce 
by 45 per cent in the last several years. Some bands are ready for 
self-government, although that is not totally defined, and  some 
bands are more ready for self-government than others.
<P>
	Consideration of further cuts in the Indian affairs department 
has to be related to the progress to self-government and to the 
concept of moving by steps which the government rightfully on 
all empirical political experience has accepted as the best road 
to self-government.
<P>
	Transferring responsibility to what is called the family 
ignores current social structures that exist as the living reality 
today in Canada. I would suggest the second opposition party 
has a rather restricted particularistic definition of the family. 
One would raise the question and not simply rhetorically: 
``What about Canadians who do not have a well-to-do family to 
rely on? What about them?''
<P>
	There are too many contradictions-antinomy is the technical 
term-in the shadow budget of the second opposition party that 
are simply not resolved. Empowerment of individuals is brought 
forward as a buzzword but is really a code word for abandoning 
those in need. Basically it calls for people to look after 
themselves whether or not they can.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This contradicts what in another part of the second opposition 
party's proposal, the shadow budget, is called equalization. 
Again one talks of national standards but this contradicts the 
principle of cutting transfer payments. If we want to impose 
national standards as a federal government in a domain where 
the federal constitutional power has to be stretched to the limit, 
how do we do it without using the tool of transfer payments? The 
contradiction is there in the shadow budget of the second 
opposition party. It simply has not bothered to try to resolve it or 
to suggest how to do it. That again stems from the fact of 
absence of responsibility in making the hard decisions that we 
must make as a government.
<P>
	Again to take a further contradiction on a contradiction, the 
equalization principle contradicts the idea of cutting transfers to 
the provinces as such. I believe there is one basic truth here 
which all of us must recognize. The budget to be brought in by 
the finance minister within the next week will be the toughest 
budget Canadians have seen in 127 years. That is the reality. It is 
going to be a very tough budget. That is our responsibility.
<P>
	Since I am not privy and constitutionally could not be to the 
finance minister's plans until he actually announces them in the 
House, I do not yet know what is in the budget; but I am on 
record, as are many of my colleagues in the government, as 
supporting drastic reform of the pensions of members of 
Parliament. I am on record, as are some of my colleagues, in 
advocating that Parliament bring MPs' pensions into line with 
those in the private sector.
<P>
	There has been reference to foreign travel. I personally have 
not partaken of any foreign travel at taxpayers' expense since 
my election. Many government members are in the same 
position.
<P>
	I support unemployment insurance reform. Indeed the most 
imaginative part of the green paper on social reform brought 
forward by the minister charged with social security concerns 
unemployment insurance reform. Many Canadians are paying 
$1,200 per annum in premiums even if they have never made a 
claim. The seasonally unemployed and the manufacturing 
industries which include unemployment insurance abuse in their 
business plans should be made to be more self-supporting 
through increased premiums, fewer weeks of benefits, more 
weeks to qualify and mandatory retraining.
<P>
	These are the materials before the finance minister that have 
been given considerable consideration by committees, by task 
forces and by other groups. They are the sorts of decisions a 
government must make, big tough decisions, balancing the 
interests, choosing among the conflicting interests and 
resolving the antinomies.
<P>
	I support, as do many government members, the 
commercialisation of as many crown corporations as possible 
and a rationalization of those remaining. The government 
accepts that responsibility. It will be reflected in the choices that 
it has to make in the budget.
<P>
	We all support the elimination of overlapping government 
services. We support the transfer of powers to the provinces in 
such areas as natural resources, fishing and health 
administration, without sacrificing national health standards. 
These proposals have been part of our historical debate for the 
last 30 years since the quiet revolution.
<P>
	We welcome the suggestions put forward by governments in 
Quebec, by the Bourassa government and by its present 
government, for study in this area but we recognize the impact 
upon the budget in adopting proposals of this sort.
<P>
	I am really saying that the shadow budget of the second 
opposition party does not really tackle concretely the problems 
of making those hard choices. To the extent that it does, it seems 
to me that like the previous Mulroney government's approach to 
the economic situation there is a give it up philosophy there.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not enough to slash government expenditures. We need, 
and this was our proposal in the red book and in the general 
election, a dynamic policy of creating new jobs. We need new 
export industries. We need more foreign trade. We need to be 
competitive there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9885"> 9885 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has made his trips to Asia accompanied 
by our leading business specialists and to South America. This 
is part of the new politics. We need to harness science and 
technology in aid of economic growth and that requires a strong 
federal presence. This is the key to the infrastructure program 
that the government has been carrying forward since its 
election. It is the key to areas such as western economic 
development, but it is a recognition. The slashing of 
expenditures, if that is all it is, is a descent into economic 
pessimism. It reminds one of the policies of the economists who 
failed in Germany at the end of the 1920s and who failed in 
the United States in the Hoover period.
<P>
	The country is strong. To echo the remarks of the man who 
replaced President Hoover, we have nothing to fear but fear 
itself. What we need are new jobs, new markets and new tax 
revenues. This is a positive, dynamic way of controlling the 
deficit and reducing the external debt. Create the new jobs, build 
the new revenues from the new incomes. It is a new, dynamic 
and optimistic approach to the Canada of the next century. This 
will be the thrust in the budget to be presented I am sure in the 
next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am shocked and appalled when I listen to a speech like 
this. I think a speech like this is a symbol of what is wrong with 
this government.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member ramble on giving excuses for his 
government's inaction. He continued to explain why it cannot do 
anything about this or that. I think the height of irresponsibility 
is to do nothing. It is analogous to criminal negligence.
<P>
	Why do you not have a plan after almost 10 years in 
opposition and after a year in government, after fighting an 
election campaign that you knew was there and-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I want to once 
again remind the House that all of our interventions have to be 
made through the Chair, through the Speaker. It is not to engage 
one member with another but collectively for the House in 
making sure that our debate is done in a parliamentary fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> I am sorry, Mr. 
Speaker. I am too emotional from his presentation. I feel so 
strongly that this issue is a key issue that we need to address.
<P>
	I believe the country is tired of hearing excuses about how we 
have such an onerous task and it is so difficult. This is the 
government opposite. As a government it cannot keep 
criticizing Reformers for what they propose unless it can come 
up with a better proposition. That has to happen. When someone 
is drowning and is going down for the third time he or she would 
like to see a life preserver thrown to him or her, not another 
weight. Increased spending and increased debt and deficit is 
simply another weight. I think it is inexcusable that this  kind of 
rhetoric continues to be spouted out by these people.
<P>
	I would like to know what plan the government has? What 
does it propose in a positive manner that will give hope for 
Canadians that they will begin to see the light and not continue 
to be thrown more weights as this member suggests?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have waited patiently 
through a sea of clichés and tired metaphors for a general idea or 
a question. When finally the question emerged, the only 
response one can give is pay attention to empirical data. Read 
my speech when it comes out in <I>Hansard</I> and the responses are 
there. Please do not remain in the realm of cliches. Give us some 
empirical data. Do not be an Albanian in Mr. Khrushchev's 
terms.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
reflection of what my Reform colleague said, I must say that the 
Dr. Feelgood kind of thing this government seems to be into, 
trust it, everything is going to be fine, is very difficult to 
swallow when one realizes that this very day this government is 
going to the financial marketplaces all over the world, cap in 
hand to try and find $110 million.
<P>
	I have the good fortune, if I can be permitted to be a little 
personal, that this week I am expecting to become a grandfather 
for the first time. As a consequence, it is a sincere and very 
personal concern for me that we have a government in power 
today that is prepared to encumber my grandchild to be with the 
spending of today.
<P>
	The Reform Party came forward with its zero in three plan in 
1992 and here we are just three years later. There is only so much 
that can be taken out of non-social spending. As a consequence 
for us to get to zero, which we must do in three years and what 
this motion is all about, we have now accelerated and gone from 
only taking $9 billion out of social spending to having to take a 
further $7 billion out of social spending. That has happened in 
two and a half years.
<P>
	I ask the member in good conscience, and I am sure he will 
realize that I am being deeply sincere, whether it is really not 
immoral for this Parliament to go ahead and transfer the 
spending of today probably to my future grandchild's 
grandchildren. Is there not some kind of problem in the thinking 
of this member and perhaps in the thinking of the government 
that we should be doing that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the thoughtful 
question from the hon. member opposite. We welcome his 
co-operation and his party's co-operation in finding concrete 
ways for cutting government waste and cutting expenditure. We 
accept the burden of reducing the national deficit, reducing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9886"> 9886 </A></B>
<P>
external debt. We believe the positive way is by expanding the 
economy by creating more jobs. If more jobs are not created, we 
will never get rid of the deficit. That is why we say the two go 
together. There cannot be one without the other.
<P>
	I welcome his co-operation and his party's co-operation in 
tackling the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
real pleasure for me to take part in this debate on the motion 
introduced by my Reform colleague for Kootenay East.
<P>
	Today is really the tale of the threes. I added a third three after 
listening to the intervention by my colleague from Kootenay 
East. The first three I had down was 3 per cent of GDP which we 
are talking about today as being not sufficient to address our 
current problems. Another three is the zero in three plan we 
introduced while we were campaigning in 1993. The third three I 
added was my three-year old grandson Nicholas. In many ways 
that is what this whole debate is all about. It is about the future 
of our children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	Let me deal with the last three first. We in this House have 
been part of the generation that has accumulated the tremendous 
debt that we are all burdened under. We are not going to be 
around to pay the bill. We have accumulated this debt and we are 
leaving it on the shoulders of future generations; taxation 
without representation.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I have been part of that overspending and I have not been very 
proud of that. I am pleased that I am here, elected to this place to 
do what I can to bring the government to realize that we have to 
start living within our means.
<P>
	Let us go to 3 per cent of GDP as the target that the 
government has set. What does 3 per cent of GDP mean? It 
means after we achieve this target we will still be overspending 
on an annual basis by $25 billion. However, at that point we will 
be facing federally a $650 billion debt and the interest payments 
on that debt will have reached $50 billion. What is worse, there 
is no plan to eliminate the overspending. It is somewhere down 
the road but there is no definite plan in place to address it.
<P>
	I would suggest that without a plan to attack it, it will not 
happen. The 3 per cent of GDP is too little, too late. We have 
already lost a year. A year ago we were looking at a $490 billion 
debt and as we stand here this afternoon we are in debt to $550 
billion. Our situation has worsened by $60 billion.
<P>
	Let us take a moment to look at our zero in three plan which 
we campaigned on last year. We were honest with the Canadian 
voter when we campaigned. We spelled out where we were going 
to make the cuts, the departments we were going to make the 
cuts in and how much those cuts would be.
<P>
	I would remind members that we were the only party that did 
that. We actually put some numbers to paper and presented it to 
the Canadian voter. Two and a half million voters supported us 
knowing where we were coming from. The deficit at that point 
was $30 billion. As we stand here this afternoon we are looking 
at a potential $40 billion deficit.
<P>
	The deficit can be eliminated within a specific timeframe and 
we say three years. In eliminating that deficit we will create 
employment. We will restore investor confidence in our 
economy and they will come in and they will create the jobs that 
our children and our grandchildren need, full time, meaningful 
employment.
<P>
	By getting our spending under control we will start to offer for 
the first time tax relief. Canadian voters will be able to see down 
the road that there is some tax relief coming and that we will not 
continue to attempt to go deeper and deeper into their pockets.
<P>
	We speak a lot about the safety nets. Getting our spending 
under control and eliminating the deficit is the answer to saving 
our social safety nets. We are not the ones out to destroy it. We 
are the ones facing reality and we are the ones who want to save 
those safety nets for those who are in need.
<P>
	The budget that will be coming down next week to my mind is 
the most important in Canada's history. If we do not do what is 
right in this budget we will pay some very serious consequences. 
The Canadian taxpayer is concerned. The financial markets are 
concerned. The warning bells are going off, the red lights are 
flashing and yet they are being ignored. As a matter of fact, we 
are shooting the messenger. We are being warned that we cannot 
go any deeper in debt, that we have to make some spending cuts. 
We are being warned by the people who buy our bonds, the 
people who have allowed us to go deeper and deeper in debt.
<P>
	We appreciate it when they buy our bonds, but we do not like 
the fact that they are warning us that we are getting ourselves 
into a position where we cannot sustain that debt and are in 
danger of hitting the wall.
<P>
	As I said, thousands of concerned taxpayers have spoken out. 
The message has been unified: no more taxes, reduce 
government spending, they are taxed to the limit.
<P>
	The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has gone across Canada 
holding tax alert rallies that have been attended by thousands of 
taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday we presented petitions signed by 230,000 
concerned taxpayers and as I said, the message is uniform: no 
more taxes. Government spending must be cut.
<P>
	Small business gave us the same message. The Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business in its survey of small 
business states that 88 per cent of those that responded said the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9887"> 9887 </A></B>
<P>
best thing the government can do  to help small business is to cut 
spending. Get off their backs and out of their pockets.
<P>
	It is happening all across Canada. In our homes and in our 
businesses, we have cut back in these times of restraint. We have 
had to make the cuts in order to survive. Government must do no 
less than what Canadian taxpayers and Canadian businesses 
have been doing.
<P>
	When I was a youngster, I was told that there are only two 
things that were certain in life, death and taxes. What we are 
now finding out is that one is causing the other. The Canadian 
taxpayer is being taxed to death. Canadian taxpayers are fair, 
compassionate and reasonable but they have reached the limits. 
The message is that we have no more to give. The government 
does have room to cut its spending.
<P>
	Protests have been going on across the country. Radio shows 
have been encouraging their listeners to phone their member of 
Parliament. I am sure all members have received phone calls 
because of the tax alert rallies or tax alert programs.
<P>
	I want to relate one of the many phone calls that I got in my 
riding. It was from a young mother. She said: ``I am 24 years old. 
I have three young children. My husband has a good job. He 
makes a good wage but we are just getting by. Please do not raise 
taxes. Do what you can to make sure taxes are not raised. We just 
have no room to move''.
<P>
	I said to her: ``I understand where you are coming from. I will 
do my best to see that your tax burden is not increased''. Just 
before she hung up she said: ``There is one other thing that really 
bothers me. I know the social programs are important but I have 
a neighbour who is on social programs and in many ways that 
family is living much better than we are''.
<P>
	The message was that there are people riding in the wagon that 
she and her husband are pulling who are enjoying more benefits 
than they are. That has to stop.
<P>
	Raising taxes are counter productive. For 25 years now we 
have told the Canadian people that we have to raise taxes and we 
are going to address the deficit and the debt. In fact what has 
happened in those 25 years is the exact opposite. While we have 
raised taxes, the deficit has increased and as a result, the debt 
has increased.
<P>
	There is absolutely no justification for any tax increases. 
They achieve the very opposite to what they are supposed to 
achieve. We already have a huge underground economy because 
the Canadian taxpayer has said: ``I am giving you more tax 
dollars and I am getting less service. I am going to find a way to 
escape this tax burden''.
<P>
	That underground economy is very difficult to get a handle on. 
I have heard figures from $5 billion to $30 billion. Whatever the 
number is, it is huge. By increasing the tax burden, we will only 
inflate that figure, whatever it is.
<P>
	Today we introduced the taxpayers' budget. It is the first time 
this has ever happened in Parliament to my knowledge. No party 
in opposition or third party has come forward with an alternate 
budget.
<P>
	We said when we were campaigning that we would offer 
constructive criticism. That is what we have done. We have been 
saying cut. In this budget we are outlining where those cuts 
should be made and the departments in which they should be 
made.
<P>
	Twenty-five billion dollars in three years is not a draconian 
target. We are talking about $8 to $9 billion a year from a $750 
billion GDP. That is about 1 per cent a year. It can be achieved 
and it must be achieved.
<P>
	It will bring some pain but it will be short term pain for long 
term gain. The cuts have to be made in all sectors, not just in the 
social services. We have to do it in the public and in the private 
sectors.
<P>
	I get concerned when I hear the message that we are out to 
destroy the social programs. That is not true. We have been 
spending $80 billion on these social programs. What we are 
talking about is $65 billion. That is not destroying the social 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	If these people really wanted to protect those truly in need, 
they would be working with us to see that the cuts are made. 
There is lots of room to improve the efficiency of those 
programs and deliver them in a better way at far less cost to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	When taxpayers hear that they do not understand what they 
are asking for when they ask for reduced spending, you are 
insulting their intelligence. They do understand. The taxpayer in 
many ways is miles ahead of the politicians, and when taxpayers 
read that their protests are futile, we forget who is working for 
who.
<P>
	We are dealing with an aroused and an informed voter. They 
understand. They are aware of the situation. No longer are they 
prepared to roll over and take it. They are speaking out. They 
spoke out on the cable situation and found out that they can 
make a difference. Government will ignore the messages that 
are being given to us at its peril.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I might ask the member

time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Yes, I am splitting my time, 
Mr. Speaker.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9888"> 9888 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
I stand here with a great deal of pride in being a Reform member 
of Parliament who was a part of the Reform team that put 
together the taxpayers' budget that was presented across 
Canada. I am proud of that, but what we are talking about today 
goes far beyond partisan politics.
<P>
	It goes to a problem that truly threatens the country. It deals 
with a problem which has come from successive flawed 
assumptions under which governments have been operating for 
some time. I will talk about those flawed assumptions later.
<P>
	I would first like to talk about the warnings that have come 
from various sources which the government must not ignore. 
These warnings come from various groups and individuals 
across the country and from around the world. They are telling 
the government that its target of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent 
of GDP in three years simply is not good enough.
<P>
	These warnings have come, as I have said, from a variety 
sources. Most recently they came from Moody's Bond Rating 
Agency. They have come over the past from the C.D. Howe 
Institute, and from the Fraser Institute at various times. The 
warnings that this target is not good enough came from the <I>Wall 
Street Journal</I> and the Washington <I>Post</I> just a few weeks ago.
<P>
	I attended a conference in Toronto in November entitled 
``Hitting the Wall'' at which the warning came from a wide 
range of speakers from various backgrounds who had been 
involved in governments which had gone through economic 
collapse and had been part of government and opposition parties 
who were involved in the clean up after the economic collapse. 
Their warning was very clear. It was that the scenario we are 
living right now is so similar to what they lived through in their 
countries that Canada should heed the warning.
<P>
	The warning came at this conference from a Japanese bond 
buying agency that said that already Canada is paying 
unnecessarily high risk premiums on money that it borrows 
from outside the country. The reason I say that the risk 
premiums are unnecessarily high is that if governments in the 
past had been more serious about setting targets far stronger 
than the 3 per cent of GDP in three years, we would not be 
paying interest rates nearly as high as we are paying now. The 
warnings came from a public sector actuary who talked about 
the fact that the Canada pension plan is non-sustainable. It is not 
actuarially sound and it cannot be sustained under the present set 
of rules.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The warnings came from others, but there were several 
consistent messages that came from each and every one of the 
speakers at the conference. I know the government has heard 
these messages before but it should hear them again. The 
messages are as follows.
<P>
	First, Canada has a serious overspending problem. It is a very 
simple and direct message and the government must hear it.
<P>
	Second, the problem must be dealt with quickly. Again, this 
message has been given by people from across the country and 
around the world but it does not appear to have been heard.
<P>
	The third message is that the Minister of Finance's budget is a 
last chance budget. The speakers at this conference, ``Hitting the 
Wall'', to a person said that this is the last chance. If the 
government does not get serious beyond the target of reducing 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in three years there is a very real 
possibility of economic collapse.
<P>
	This is a last chance budget because it will be much more 
difficult for government to deal with the problem next year than 
it is this year. It will not happen. The political will just will not 
be there to make the extremely tough cuts and to take the tough 
measures that will be necessary a year from now.
<P>
	Compounding interest, rapidly increasing debt, 
ever-increasing proportions of government spending going to 
interest payments on the debt would all make it much more 
difficult next year. These speakers said that there is no precedent 
in the world where a government has taken the tough measures 
necessary without going through economic collapse.
<P>
	The warnings are there. The Liberals should consider this 
Reform budget as another warning. There are a lot of measures 
in it that I have heard expressed as recommendations by people 
in my constituency and in other places across the country who I 
have spoken with over the past several months and years. These 
are not just measures which were dreamed up by a group of 
Reform MPs. These are measures that have been proposed by 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to go through something that is presented in our 
budget material and talk about the flawed assumptions which 
have led to the mess we are in now, the flawed assumptions 
which this Liberal government will continue to operate under. 
Then I would like to go through the positive results that would 
arise from the new set of assumptions which the Reform Party 
has presented. I will begin by reading the motion which we are 
debating today. The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House reject this government's totally inadequate target which 
reduces the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP within 2 years and will leave Canada, at 
the end of the period with a federal deficit of about $25 billion, a federal debt of 
over $600 billion, $50 billion in annual interest payments and higher taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the motion we are debating today. This motion stems 
from one of the flawed assumptions under which this Liberal 
government has been operating since it came into power a year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9889"> 9889 </A></B>
<P>
and a half ago. I will go through these and talk briefly about the 
consequences which arise from them.
<P>
	The first assumption is with respect to jobs. The assumption is 
that government can solve the unemployment problem through 
public spending. That is the flawed assumption we have laid out 
in our budget today. In fact, that assumption was presented an 
hour or so ago by a member from the Liberal Party when he was 
talking about all of the things which his government had done. 
One of the wonderful things that member said was that his 
government had created jobs. I believe he said that his 
government created 40,000 jobs.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	When Reformers reminded the member across the floor that it 
probably was not his government that created those jobs, that it 
was probably the private sector, the member backed off on that 
statement. He realized the error of his ways, at least for the 
moment. The error was that government does not create jobs; 
private business does.
<P>
	The consequences of this flawed assumption and operating 
under this flawed assumption are that government spending is 
now at an all time high and there are over a million unemployed 
people in the country. If government spending would create jobs 
I would suggest that all Canadians would have more than one 
and more than they need.
<P>
	Governments have been overspending to a point where we 
have an accumulated debt today of over $550 billion. 
Governments have been overspending for 30 years. Has that 
helped to deal with the problem of unemployment? The answer 
is no, we have over a million unemployed Canadians today and 
that is an unacceptable level of unemployment.
<P>
	The second flawed assumption is in the area of social security. 
The assumption is that government is the best provider of social 
security through publicly financed universal programs. I think I 
can fairly say that is the assumption the Liberal government and 
past governments have been operating under.
<P>
	The consequence of operating under this flawed assumption is 
that despite big government programs, the social fabric of 
Canada is unravelling. Health care, pensions and other programs 
are in financial trouble. Programs like UI and welfare create a 
disincentive to employment.
<P>
	The third flawed assumption is that government spending, 
deficits and debts are okay if they are incurred in the name of 
jobs and social security. The consequence is that government 
spending and overspending are the biggest threats facing 
Canadians with regard to social programs today.
<P>
	I invite members opposite to read our budget with an open 
mind and to consider its contents seriously in the final 
preparations of the budget to be presented next week. I certainly 
welcome their questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been here for a good part of the debate today and 
I am dismayed to learn that Reform Party members in making 
their remarks are not really addressing their budget document.
<P>
	Indeed I was here for the opening two speeches this morning 
from the Reform Party and they like the last one constituted 
really nothing but denunciations of the Liberal Party position 
which they are waiting to hear in the budget next week.
<P>
	However they managed to use their document as some kind of 
launching pad for attacks on a non-existent government budget 
at this point. They are still attacking last year's budget and 
saying that government measures are inadequate when they have 
not yet learned what they are.
<P>
	It surprised me that I could not get copies of the Reform Party 
budget for the longest time. I have finally obtained one. We were 
told in all the news reports this morning that their budget was 
going to be announced in the House. I am surprised that we have 
not heard more about the Reform budget.
<P>
	I have some questions that I would like the hon. member to 
answer. I know he has very limited time, having wasted most of 
his presentation on attacking the government instead of dealing 
with the positive aspects, if there are any, in the Reform budget.
<P>
	What is in his own party document that will be so popular with 
Canadians? Or, is it so unpopular that they do not want to talk 
about it in the House today? They want to use the opportunity to 
try to blame the government for all the ills instead of looking at 
the document they have produced, coming clean with Canadians 
and telling them what bad policies they have proposed in their 
budget document.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Why have they not discussed it? They keep referring to it but 
they never give specifics. Would the hon. member give us 
specifics and tell us what cutbacks in social programs his party 
proposed in their budget document so all Canadians can hear 
what the Reform Party has in mind?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary 
commented on copies of our budget not being available. Of 
course they were. We announced that our budget would be 
unveiled in West Block, Room 200, at nine o'clock this 
morning. Liberal members of Parliament were more than 
welcome. I was pleased to see that one attended the unveiling. 
Copies have been readily available. They are certainly available 
in the lobbies now, as the member knows.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9890"> 9890 </A></B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary of all people should know that 
when debate is on a certain topic we should try to stick to the 
debate as much as possible. The debate today is on the Liberal 
government's very weak deficit reduction target of 3 per cent 
of GDP in three years.
<P>
	We will talk about our budget as we have been today. We have 
presented some important information regarding the budget. 
However we have to make sure it fits in with the topic for 
discussion today, the motion that has been presented rejecting 
the 3 per cent of GDP in three years as a target.
<P>
	In terms of specifics, if the hon. member has read this 
document which is available and which he acknowledges he now 
has, he would know that we presented a lot of specifics. We 
presented detailed numbers in terms of reductions in the social 
program spending area and in areas outside social programs.
<P>
	We cannot only look at spending when we talk about this 
budget. We also have to look at the empowerment measures that 
Reform has presented along with the numbers. The numbers are 
important in the budget but they are there for anyone to see. It is 
important to balance that. If we are talking about spending cuts 
in the area of social programs and other areas, it is really 
important to show the empowering measures to help people deal 
with the coming cuts.
<P>
	This approach is far more valid than the Liberal approach of 
pretending that we do not have a serious problem and therefore 
not bring forward a budget to deal with the serious problem we 
in fact have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
shocked at the message I have heard from Reform members 
opposite today. It is difficult to believe that a party would be so 
irresponsible as to easily play the game for international 
monetary traders and talk about problems that do not even exist: 
rhetoric and no specifics.
<P>
	I have read the document and I have seen no specifics in it. I 
would call the paper put forward by hon. members opposite 
Reform draconianism. That would be a good description.
<P>
	The facts are contrary to what the motion states. We have the 
first Minister of Finance in ages who has set targets and is 
prepared to meet them. He is willing to take the tough measures 
in a reasoned and planned way.
<P>
	Could the hon. member opposite name the cuts specifically in 
summary? Could he bare them to the bone so that we can see 
what he is specifically talking about in the paper he mentioned?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a list in our budget 
document that explains in detail our proposed cuts and the 
background supporting information on why it is necessary to 
make cuts in those areas. As we go through our debate today 
these numbers will be presented. They are here to read. Surely 
Liberal members can read as well; I believe they can.
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque talked about Reform 
draconianism. I want to talk about that. The reality is that if we 
continue down the path we are taking now with government 
overspending to the tune of $38 billion this year and a debt of 
$550 billion, we will lose the bulk of social programs.
<P>
	Which is more draconian: losing the bulk of social programs 
or reducing spending on social programs by $15 billion out of 
total government spending of about $155 billion in that area, 
that is reducing federal and provincial spending together to 
about $140 billion? Which is more draconian: saving social 
programs and targeting them to the people in need or losing 
them?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to 
me that Reformers are Tories in a hurry and we know what the 
Tories did to the country.
<P>
	Everyone knows we must get our fiscal house in order. We 
must reduce spending and a draw a line on further taxation. We 
must reduce borrowing. We need to move toward better 
accountability in government programs and allow people to 
participate in these decisions to a greater degree.
<P>
	I have been amazed by my colleagues in the Reform Party. 
That party supports the concept of a flat tax. We might as well 
call the earth flat. In a statement the leader of the Reform Party 
proposed a flat tax allowing lower income families to be 
exempt. Interestingly enough, those with average incomes in 
excess of $94,000 are currently paying 66 per cent of all 
personal income tax in the country. If one was to create a flat tax 
it is clear that income tax would have to be collected more from 
the middle class.
<P>
	It certainly has been a strange week for me debating with 
Reformers and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. People are 
saying no more taxes, while these members with their hidden 
agenda intend to increase the relative burdens of the middle 
class.
<P>
	The Reform Party talks about funding of special interest 
groups. I object to the funding of these groups. However, what 
special interest groups do the Reform Party represent? I do not 
remember a groundswell of opinion of people in the country to 
transfer tax burdens from the wealthy to the middle class. The 
middle class is taxed beyond belief. Forty-five per cent of the 
average family income goes to some form of taxes. The concept 
of reverse Robin Hood is not supported in any progressive 
jurisdiction in the world.
<P>
	For my own part I have initiated what I like to call a 
taxpayers' bill of rights which basically has three components. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9891"> 9891 </A></B>
<P>
It is a private member's initiative of my own. It talks about 
accountability, the accountability of existing and future 
government programs, that they must be costed in totality and 
on a taxpayer basis. If this legislation had been in place I believe 
taxpayers and the electorate in general would have made better 
decisions  that would have possibly prevented us from being in 
this mess today.
<P>
	I also proposed a taxpayers' ombudsman that would act as an 
ombudsman between taxpayers and tax collecting authorities to 
protect from onerous collection procedures that often occur. As 
members of Parliament we can all think of how acts have 
actually been to the detriment of many honest law-abiding 
people in Canada.
<P>
	Another part of that bill talks about freedom from undue 
taxation. It basically sets a cap of 55 per cent in totality of 
income on which total taxes can be paid. It simply attempts to 
reduce that by one per cent a year for the next 15 years. It starts 
with a 55 per cent cap and reduces it. It is a clear solution to 
some of our spiralling taxation problems.
<P>
	The motion is just more of the Reform Party's fantasy world. 
It must be nice to get up in the morning to all this glittering tinsel 
but, alas, it is truly a wonderland.
<P>
	To move too fast in the direction of deficit reduction is just as 
problematic as moving too slow. As programs are cut it will 
reduce the federal government's share of income taxes, 
exacerbating the problem. Let us remember the legacy of the 
Tories reducing spending, increasing taxes and spiralling 
deficits, caught in a continual loop. This is where the Reform 
Party would take us but only faster.
<P>
	We must break the back of deficit and debt. However we need 
to walk the fine line between reductions and allowing the 
economy to grow. We would have thought that a party from the 
west would be familiar with the tight-fisted policies of R. B. 
Bennett and how these turned the west into a virtual wasteland 
of the thirties.
<P>
	People come to rely on aspects of government programs 
whether social or rapid write-offs for capital investments by 
businesses. That does not mean they cannot and indeed will be 
changed. What we are talking about here is a rapidity by which 
change occurs.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Creating uncertainty in the business sector as well as other 
sectors of the economy may well witness a flight of capital. To 
the extent that we create contraction in the economy, other 
countries will look more promising to invest in. An outward 
flow of investment will result in the loss of jobs, further 
exacerbating our deficit and ultimately throwing us into a 
recession or worse. I am talking about a situation of reverse 
economics. Clearly to take government moneys and contract the 
economy is going to create a bigger deficit than we already have.
<P>
	These are the policies of the Reform Party, the policies of 
wrack and ruin. It has taken us 20 years to develop the situation 
we now have. Regrettably we have to deal with it. The question 
is how quickly.
<P>
	A slash and burn mentality does not work. We have to 
maintain the underpinnings of the social fabric of this nation. 
More important, we cannot afford to turn the corner that is 
basically going to put us into a recession or worse than that, a 
depression. Other countries have dealt with this matter in 
similar circumstances and have created some of these negative 
spiralling effects that will actually drive the economy into worse 
shape.
<P>
	Clearly the way to get out of a deficit problem is to slowly 
grow the economy. As the economy grows, revenues from 
governments increase. By going too fast we run the risk of 
contraction. That contraction will just exacerbate our problems. 
The Reform Party does not seem to recognize that. The Reform 
Party would have us driven into a recession or depression within 
the next three years. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	What is the solution? Keep the economy growing. Gradually 
reduce the deficit with targeted or slightly better than 3 per cent 
of GDP. Increase foreign trade.
<P>
	Of the component aspects of national income another very 
important one is our current account deficit. As we can attract 
more foreign dollars into our country we can deal with the 
deficit more aggressively. I am happy to see that during our 
tenure that account deficit has been reduced from $30 billion to 
$15 billion.
<P>
	Trade initiatives such as China, South America, more trade 
with the United States through NAFTA, these are all positive 
things to bring Canada out of its deficit situation and controlling 
debts and deficits as they continue in the future. This is clearly 
the way to go, not through a tremendous contraction of the 
economy.
<P>
	In conclusion, we simply cannot afford pushing our economy 
back into recession. Worse, we cannot afford the luxury of 
letting the upper income brackets of this country shift their taxes 
to the middle class.
<P>
	Once again it has been amazing to me in the last two or three 
weeks to watch the large crowds the Reform Party has put 
together. People are saying to cut spending. The other day in 
Pickering a gentleman was sitting with a sign which read ``cut 
spending''. After the meeting he came up to me and said: ``I live 
in your riding. I am on unemployment insurance and I need a 
training grant''.
<P>
	It is clear that Reform Party members are misleading people, 
that somehow these cuts do not affect their own people. Worse 
than that, the flat tax, or as I say the flat earth tax, is an 
allocation of taxes from the upper income groups to the middle 
income earners. Do the middle income earners really know that 
is the Reform Party strategy, that they will bear proportionately 
more of the taxes?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9892"> 9892 </A></B>
<P>
	I can think of no other country in the OECD or any other 
nation on the earth that subscribes to this policy. The Reform 
Party will tell us this gives incentive, it creates jobs. What it 
really does is it lines the pockets of the rich. This is not the 
policy of the Liberal Party and never has been.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Progressivity in the income tax system is accepted throughout 
the western world. As I said, I do not think the Reform Party has 
been totally honest with Canadians and with this Parliament. In 
conclusion, clearly we cannot afford the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the hon. member's suggestion that a reduction of 
government spending equal to 1 per cent of GDP would cause an 
economic contraction and downturn in this country. Surely the 
Canadian economy is not that feeble.
<P>
	The hon. member stands there and uses the old Keynesian 
magic of pump priming. Just spend more money. Get the 
government involved as deeply as it can in the economy and 
everything will be fine.
<P>
	If that discredited philosophy worked, this country would 
have no problems. Canadian governments have spent like 
drunken sailors for 30 years. If Keynes was 100 per cent right, 
then there would be no unemployment in this country. There 
would be no debt. There would be no deficit.
<P>
	We have heard it all. The previous two governments have 
done it all. They have wrecked this country by abiding by their 
faith in this wonderful pump priming philosophy. They should 
have the gumption to face up to reality, see what has been 
happening in this country and perhaps join the new parade. Start 
to realize the people out there know what is going on. That is 
why they come to these rallies. The ordinary common people are 
speaking and telling us as parliamentarians to get our act 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we are talking in 
some similarities. We know we are going to have to cut 
spending. All my Liberal Party colleagues have talked about 
cutting spending, so this is not new.
<P>
	To start off on a little study of economics, the Keynesian 
philosophy was basically correct. The problem with Keynesian 
economics is that we did not take the other side of it which is that 
during periods of expansion in the economy we save. We 
continued to spend during good economic periods and we are 
paying the price for that.
<P>
	Having said all that, Keynes also talked about levelling off the 
areas of the ups and downs of the business cycle. These are the 
things the Reform Party does not understand. In other words, we 
cannot have a situation where we create a tremendous 
contraction in the  economy so that there is no growth. In fact 
there would be negative growth. There would be a recession.
<P>
	By moving too quickly on the deficit, this is where the Reform 
Party will take us. We will be going nowhere. We will be in a 
worse situation because we will not have any tax revenues and 
our deficits will continue to spiral. It is very important that we 
continue to foster growth in the economy, to create certainty and 
to keep and meet our deficit target.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the question that the Reform Party asked about the federal 
government's deficit and debt will obviously get a lot of press 
because they are very serious issues. We all know it.
<P>
	I think that the cuts that the Reform Party will propose will 
not fix the monstrous problem facing Canada. The Reformers 
will table their budget, a bogus budget containing $15 billion in 
cuts to social programs.
<P>
	This is nothing new, since their policies centre on eliminating 
social programs, even though they have contributed the most to 
Canada's success up to now.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	They propose another $10 billion in cuts to government 
operations, for a total of $25 billion, and they think that these 
cuts will stimulate an economic recovery and that the economy 
will create jobs all by itself.
<P>
	I must concede that the Reform Party had the best intentions 
when it made this recommendation-the deficit and debt are 
very serious problems-and I must agree that when we look at 
these problems from a critical distance, they are very 
disquieting. Moody's already issued a warning to Canada last 
week regarding the budget. Several foreign investors are also 
worried, all the more because, according to the federal 
government's own calculations, it is projected that Canada's 
debt will reach $800 billion by the year 2000.
<P>
	In other words, they project that it will climb by around $50 
billion per year in the next six years. It is as if the federal 
government were stuck in a vicious circle of debt increases, and 
of deficit increases even, because I have yet to see tangible proof 
of the government's intention to reduce the deficit and to get the 
debt under control. We can only hope that they deliver 
something concrete in the next budget.
<P>
	Up to this moment, we have been grappling with a debt and a 
deficit that are out of control. We have a federal system that, for 
all intents and purposes, is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, 
like a ship that is slowly sinking to a watery grave. That is the 
situation in which the federal government currently finds itself, 
a serious one indeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9893"> 9893 </A></B>
<P>
	I would even go so far as to say that the problem goes beyond 
simple economic calculations. It is also a historical issue. This 
debt and deficit were not created yesterday, they are not the 
result of poor management. A country, like a political system, 
is not a business like any other. There are needs and policies. 
We invest in programs which are not cost effective, unlike other 
businesses. This may be one reason among many why the 
current Canadian federal system is creating a debt, as well as 
a deficit, and is poorly managed.
<P>
	There is a problem within the federal system. Right within the 
Canadian federal system, there is a mechanism which allows 
money to be wasted, to be spent in certain ways while the debt 
merely increases. I would like to give you a few examples. Let 
us consider some of the history of the federal system.
<P>
	One must recognize first of all that Canada was founded on 
concepts which are no longer valid today. It was founded on the 
concept of uniting east and west. This is the great Canadian 
dream. This country, as we know, was shaped by an ideology 
which may have had validity at the time, but is now completely 
outmoded. We know that true, concrete and cost-effective 
economic trends involve a north-south dynamic, whereas for 
years and even a century the federal system has attempted to 
implement an unnatural system, basically between the east and 
the west, going against the natural north-south dynamic.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	To achieve this goal, the federal government had to introduce 
several very costly policies. This attempt to keep east and west 
unified was of course no easy matter. It was very expensive; it 
has been very expensive. Considerable investments were 
necessary to maintain a system which was, shall we say, 
artificial.
<P>
	In cultural matters, for example, think of the billions of 
dollars invested to create a Canadian culture, while most 
English Canadians now wonder what that culture is. But if we 
consider the billions of dollars spent on creating this culture, the 
image of a unified country, we would have to say it has been a 
waste of money. In the area of culture alone, we can think of 
cultural industries that were set up after the second world war, 
after the Massey commission, which set up the Canada Council 
and the National Film Board, and which made all sorts of 
demands on the CBC.
<P>
	They set up, so to speak, with great panache and a lot of 
money, an industry to try to create an image of Canadian cultural 
unity. It did not work. It cost a lot, however, but it did not work. 
So, today, we are left with all the debts from this unfortunate 
undertaking, this unfortunate policy. Now we are paying these 
debts off and we are paying dearly. Those of us in this House are 
not overly concerned, because we will not be the ones to pay, 
really. It will be future generations, for sure. We can see from 
the policies of the federal government how the young people in 
particular will be paying.
<P>
	I would like to give you another example. I could give quite a 
number of examples of mistaken policies by the federal system, 
which established these grand policies in an attempt to ensure its 
own survival as a system. The federal system established these 
policies in order to survive as a system. Not to protect the 
interests of the public, not to protect the interests of the regions 
or of communities, but to protect its own priorities here in 
Ottawa. It is as if the federal system in Ottawa had a life of its 
own. The policy of bilingualism, for example, established by 
Pierre Trudeau, which cost a lot, was not necessarily what was 
recommended by Quebec, the major stakeholder in this issue.
<P>
	Of course, bilingualism cost billions of dollars and we know 
very well that, if we look at it analytically, that investment 
achieved nothing at all. There was no positive spin-off 
whatsoever following the investment of billions of dollars in 
that policy. We all know very well that anyone who knows 
anything about francophones outside of Quebec knows that 
those billions of dollars were spent with the best of intentions 
but they were attempts at artificially resuscitating communities 
gasping for their last breath. This was another unsucessful 
policy.
<P>
	We can say the same for several other areas, including health. 
Just look at how the federal government has imposed itself on 
the provinces since the 1940s in areas falling exclusively under 
provincial jurisdiction, like health and education. The federal 
government did this in order to survive as a system. Once again, 
today, we find ourselves in a situation where our system is on the 
brink of bankruptcy, is insolvent, and is unable to continue to 
apply its policies because they were senseless from the start and 
are still senseless today.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say to you that one of the reasons Quebecers 
want sovereignty is to get out of this absurd system. It is not only 
weakened by a monstrous debt, but, considering all of the 
policies the government is trying to enforce across Canada, it is 
absurd.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague from 
Québec-Est. I would like to ask him a question in the context of 
his remarks that Canada as an entity always trades north-south 
and that a lot of the east-west trade we have is arbitrary, 
expensive and not profitable.
<P>
	Do I take it he would recommend the Quebec dairy producers 
trade only north-south, that milk marketing arrangements 
between Quebec and the rest of Canada, particularly Ontario, 
should be dismantled forthwith and Quebec would be better off 
if it traded only north-south in that context?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9894"> 9894 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the the member for his 
question. It is quite interesting. However, I think he has 
misunderstood what I said with respect to east-west economic 
ties in Canada.
<P>
	It does not take an expert to explain and every economist 
recognizes that the east-west link in Canada is historically and 
artificially built and that the natural tendencies in our economic 
trade are north-south. However, this is not to say that Quebec 
when it becomes sovereign will not want to trade with western 
Canada, Ontario or the other provinces.
<P>
	Those economic bonds that have developed between Quebec 
and the other provinces are good and should continue. It is good 
not only for those provinces, Ontario and the west, it is good for 
Quebec as well.
<P>
	Let us not be simplistic in our economic approach. It is not a 
question of severing those good things in the system. It is a 
question of liberating us and all the regions in Canada to be able 
to develop where economic development is due.
<P>
	Take Alberta for example, a province well represented by the 
Reform Party. If we look at its economic situation, we will see 
that 40 per cent of its trade is with British Columbia, and another 
40 per cent is with Asian countries, with the far east; a small 20 
per cent with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	It is totally normal. It is not a political statement to recognize 
those facts. It is just normal, economic practice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great 
deal of attention to the rather passionate but highly erroneous 
speech by our colleague opposite.
<P>
	I find it strange to hear them describe the Canadian federation 
as being bankrupt. I do not think this is true. I am sure that if you 
look around you, and I see the hon. member opposite-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know that speeches can 
be passionate, but I would remind the House that all comments 
must be made through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We must keep in mind 
that we can count on a secure market of almost 30 million 
people. It is important to stress that this market is very 
important for Quebec products.
<P>
	That said, the Canadian federation remains a system where we 
give priority to financial equalization by helping those 
provinces always in need of financial or infrastructure support.
<P>
	Let us look at Quebec, for instance. As you know, for the last 
year, Quebec will receive over $3 billion in equalization 
payments. Quebec comes out a winner as a result of belonging to 
the Canadian federation. I find it regrettable that they question 
federal government services such as Telefilm Canada, the 
Canada Council and Radio-Canada. The Bloc Quebecois is 
wrong to say  that the system never worked for Quebec, when we 
know full well that Quebec receives nearly 40 per cent of federal 
budgets allocated to certain federal government services. That is 
something we must keep in mind, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	They also talk about international markets and say that things 
are not going well for Quebec, but we must remember that 
well-known Quebec businesses such as Bombardier and Tembec 
and many other new small businesses received help from several 
federal agencies. They received help because of the partnership 
with the federal government.
<P>
	We must not forget that many of these officials are from 
Quebec and believe in Quebec products within Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can think of several possible 
ways of answering the muddled remarks of hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	He is telling us that Quebec always got what it asked for from 
the federal government. Quebec did get a number of things, but 
Quebec cannot be said to have been the big winner on things that 
mattered and here are two examples.
<P>
	First, the most important industry in terms of economic 
development has been the automotive industry. As the people 
from out west will tell you, it has all been concentrated in 
Ontario. You know how important this industry is; it drives the 
economy. If you need another example, think of the energy 
sector in Canada.
<P>
	What happened in that sector in terms of funding? Over the 
past decade, the federal government has invested $12 billion in 
the development of atomic energy in Ontario. And each year, 
another $100 million to $130 million in new funds are spent on 
atomic energy in Ontario. During this time, how much did the 
federal government invest in hydroelectricity in Quebec? Not a 
cent.
<P>
	This is only one side of the story. We must think about what 
the people in Western Canada, and Alberta in particular, have 
gone through. Think how they we taken in by the federal 
government decision to tax oil produced in Alberta. They are 
certainly justified in thinking that the federal system is unfair, 
because we are dealing with investments made essentially to 
serve the petty interests of that system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
that when they read the motion introduced by the Reform Party, 
many Canadians, Quebecers and foreign investors would agree.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9895"> 9895 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the target to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP 
within two years is an absolute minimum. In fact, it will not 
be that difficult since this year, the deficit is expected to be two 
or three billion less than forecast.
<P>
	The trouble with the Reform Party's proposal is that it is 
accompanied by a series of proposals to reorganize the 
government. We agree with some of them but on the whole, it 
reflects an ideological vision that focuses on government 
operations and government spending and ignores all other 
aspects of the economy.
<P>
	To Reform members, any government is a problem, except for 
policemen and prisons, because if we look at how they want to 
amend the Criminal Code, soon 10 per cent of all Canadians will 
be in prison and they will need accommodation. Pretty soon it 
will be like California, where the biggest budget item is not 
health care but police forces and prisons. In Canada and Quebec, 
we still prefer to see more money spent on health care and 
education than on prisons and police forces.
<P>
	They forgot to include a huge prison construction program in 
their budget.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I appreciate the 
fact that in the course of their speeches, members may wish to 
refer to certain texts, but they are not supposed to use props.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think people realize I was 
referring to the budget proposals of the Reform Party. As I was 
saying, they forgot to include a huge prison construction 
program which would probably be the only job creation 
component of their party's platform.
<P>
	Of course we are concerned. I think we have reason to be, and 
we share their concerns as we share those of many Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	We must understand that, at present, the Canadian economy is 
operating at about 92 per cent of its potential without inflation. 
This means that there is room for another 8 per cent increase in 
production without causing any increase in inflation in Canada. 
How did that come about? You must know where you are coming 
from to know where you are going. It is simple: the 1980s saw 
two major recessions aimed at breaking the cycle of inflation. 
Because of a total lack of co-operation between the various 
regions and economic agents in Canada, the rate of inflation was 
allowed to rise during the 1970s and into the early 1980s, when 
it averaged 12 per cent. It was just plain insane. The Bank of 
Canada used the big stick because people capable of managing 
the Canadian economy in co-operation, like in Germany and 
several other countries, could not be found in this place. That is 
why the big stick of interest rates had to be used.
<P>
	So, interest rates skyrocketed and precipitated a major 
recession, which in turn caused unemployment to increase 
sharply and, of course, inflation to fall from an average of 12 per 
cent to 5 per cent. Economic recovery  was under way, but we 
never recovered from the jobs lost. In 1989, the Bank of Canada 
decided once again to aim for zero-inflation, at a time when the 
average rate of inflation was about 5 per cent. It did meet its 
target, but at what price? By jacking up interest rates so as to 
stifle the economy in Quebec and Canada. So much so that our 
production rate fell down to 90 per cent. It fell so drastically that 
for the next three years, the economy grew only marginally. 
There was no real economic recovery in Canada while the 
United States had already recovered.
<P>
	So, this is a duly-considered policy, because of the lack of 
co-operation in this country. This must be pointed out, even 
though it is not at the forefront any more, now that inflation has 
been curbed for a little while, but this inability to co-operate, to 
work in co-operation in this country is still a problem.
<P>
	Think back to the 1980s when the Economic Council of 
Canada and other agencies made it clear economic co-operation 
was urgently needed in order to curb inflation. As some of you 
may remember, at the beginning of his mandate, Brian Mulroney 
organized a great Canadian forum to initiate a consultation 
process, which was a failure, but achieved his inflation-fighting 
goals by using the stick approach. Ontario was very prosperous 
at the time but it let its spending get out of control and now finds 
itself saddled with an annual deficit of $10 billion. We were 
never able to make people listen to reason.
<P>
	Part of the problem is that we have to realize our economic 
potential as soon as possible without causing inflation. That is 
why we need economic growth. We see that, in the last year, 
government revenue went up by between 7 per cent and 8 per 
cent because more people are working and therefore paying 
more taxes. UI benefits went down not only because of the cuts 
but also because more people are working. We still have a way to 
go before realizing our full potential.
<P>
	On the other hand, the actions taken by the Bank of Canada 
and the stick approach that was used have made the Canadian 
dollar very volatile. Our dollar went from 69 cents to 87 cents, 
then back to 70 cents. We are playing with foreign investors' 
nerves by allowing the value of our currency to fluctuate by 25 
per cent. This does not make any sense. We must hold economic 
consultations so that these fluctuations can be avoided.
<P>
	If Canada's interest rates are what they are today, it is partly 
because of the debt, but also because confidence in the Canadian 
dollar has been shaken by our inflation-fighting policy.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I am not saying that it would have been better not to do 
anything about inflation. The problem is that we must use 
different methods to fight it. Many people say that we are living 
above our means. This is partly true. There is a very simple way 
to find out: one only has to look at our balance of international 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9896"> 9896 </A></B>
<P>
payments. And now, with our dollar at 70 cents, we have 
restored that balance, to a great extent.
<P>
	The challenge for investors and Canadians alike is to 
determine if we can hold on long enough. Our tourism deficit 
has gone down, and this year we will have a very substantial 
trade surplus of $17 billion, but we still have a cumulative debt 
on which we pay about $30 billion annually in interest payments 
to foreign investors.
<P>
	Even if we start living within our means, compared with other 
countries, we have to keep paying, because at one time we spent 
more than we could afford, and now we are stuck with interest 
payments we have to pay abroad. This situation has to be turned 
around as well.
<P>
	What makes people worried? Why was Moody's worried last 
week, for instance? Did Moody's say: Listen, social programs 
are too expensive? Not at all. Moody's said: Structural 
reorganization is necessary. For instance, there are practically 
no more fishermen left, but the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans still has the same number of employees. The department 
has more employees that we have cod. This does not make sense.
<P>
	The same thing happened at the Department of Energy, Mines 
and Resources. The national energy policy was abolished in the 
early eighties, but they kept the same number of employees they 
had when they were still managing this energy policy.
<P>
	The federal government has increased its involvement in a 
wide range of sectors-and not only in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction-to the extent that it is no longer economically 
feasible. We need a major reorganization, and of course we are 
looking forward to the budget.
<P>
	Relations with the provinces are a problem, not only because 
structures are unwieldy but because they are inefficient in some 
areas. Years ago we came to the conclusion that manpower 
training was essential, and in this particular area there was no 
agreement at all between the federal government and the 
provinces-and not just Quebec-and there is no way we can act 
effectively.
<P>
	Of course in Quebec the situation is even worse. Why? For the 
simple reason that Quebec was Canada's first industrial 
heartland. This means we had more mature industries in the 
railway sector, shipbuilding, and so forth, than in other 
provinces. When these industries started shrinking, new 
industries came in. There was a very substantial restructuring of 
our economy, but we did not have manpower training to ease the 
transition for a machinist from the railway sector to the 
aeronautics industry. There were no resources to provide for that 
transition. The situation was worse in Quebec for the very 
simple reason that we had a much larger share of Canada's old 
economy.
<P>
	The problem is now becoming acute in Ontario, because while 
Quebec's economy has largely been restructured, Ontario has a 
problem with its own mature and very mature industries like the 
automobile industry, where like recovery is temporary, and the 
steel industry. They now have to cope with problems that 
Quebec experienced 10, 15, or 20 years ago, problems we were 
never able to solve with the help of the federal government.
<P>
	Reorganization is needed, and here I am speaking from the 
Canadian, the federalist point of view. I am not talking about 
being capable of developing our aspirations as a society. I talked 
about it this week in the debate on the Young Offenders Act, 
when referring to the fact that Quebec's perspective was entirely 
different from that of the present Minister of Justice. I could 
have elaborated on this, but there is a big problem, even if we 
wanted to stay in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying 
to the member for Rosemont that I too share his view that the 
obsession with ratcheting inflation down to zero per cent during 
the last four years for all intents and purposes killed the 
economy of this country. It broke the entrepreneurial spirit of 
thousands of small and medium size business men and women, 
which ultimately led to unemployment numbers that we are still 
fighting to cope with and put people back to work.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	My concern is the fact that the member did not put forward 
some specific recommendations on how we can fire up that 
economy again. I realize that the member talked about excessive 
numbers of public servants when we have done some 
downsizing in energy and other departments of government. The 
cost by having those public servants working or the savings that 
would have been made is not enough to really get this economy 
going again.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would put a couple of specific 
recommendations on the floor of this House on how we could 
fire up this economy and get people back to work. As I have said, 
it is important to have fiscal discipline in this country but my 
concern is that we are not spending enough creative time in 
dealing with constructive ways, creative ways on how we put the 
2.2 million people who are unemployed in this country back to 
work.
<P>
	Could the member put a couple of specific ideas on the floor 
of the House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his question. Given our time constraints, I would 
refer him quickly to the ten recommendations by the Bloc 
Quebecois which he may read himself instead of my listing them 
now.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9897"> 9897 </A></B>
<P>
	I think it is clear that if we want everyone to put his shoulder 
to the wheel, and that is what these recommendations are based 
on, people must share the same concept of fairness. In our 
recommendations, clearly, we denounced tax situations which 
are totally unacceptable. I think fairness is the essential 
foundation upon which dialogue and the will to work together 
are based. I am referring for instance to family trusts, to the 
delay in reviewing the Income Tax Act in regard to resource 
companies, and to the fact that they are now to be given up to 
$1.2 billion. It is therefore an issue of fairness.
<P>
	There is also an issue of effectiveness which involves 
occupational training first of all. Even if jobs are presently 
being created in certain sectors, we know that occupational 
training must definitely proceed at a faster pace to allow people 
to take those jobs.
<P>
	My time is up, Mr. Speaker; as you can see, I could have gone 
on a few minutes more.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you retain the right, if you wish, 
to resume speaking after question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to

concerns of my constituents of Lambton-Middlesex.
<P>
	Taxpayers in my riding say they simply cannot absorb any 
more tax increases. While they can appreciate that this year's 
budget must be a tough one it should not be at the further 
expense of middle class Canadians.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents I would ask that the Minister of 
Finance not raise personal income tax rates. He should also note 
that for millions of Canadians RRSPs will be their main source 
of retirement income. The minister should focus instead on 
meaningful spending cuts and more efficient delivery of 
government programs and services.
<P>
	The residents of my riding are very aware of the pressing need 
to reduce and eventually eliminate Canada's deficit, but there 
has to be fairness in accomplishing this goal. If the sacrifices are 
spread fairly then I am convinced that all Canadians will support 
us in our efforts to put this country's financial house in order.

debates in this House have revealed how reticent and hesitant 
federal politicians are to call attention, with figures to back

outside Quebec.
<P>
	Federalists never mention the 38 per cent rate of assimilation 
of Franco-Ontarians, the 75 per cent rate of assimilation of 
francophones in British Columbia or even the 8 per cent figure 
for Acadians. These unfortunate data clearly contradict the 
claims of the supporters of federalism, who say nothing about 
the fact that these francophones must continue to fight for 
schools, health services, government services and cultural 
services.
<P>

francophones are assimilated, while federal politicians continue

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after 25 years of negative experience, affirmative action is under 
fire all over the United States. In June the Supreme Court may 
discard it altogether because of the growing body of evidence 
against it. However, in Canada the Liberals plod ahead in spite 
of evidence and public opinion proposing expansion of 
employment equity provisions through Bill C-64.
<P>
	Employment equity encourages a mentality of victimization 
among Canadians. It harms morale in the public service and 
damages the self-esteem of designated groups. It poisons the 
workplace when jobs are awarded on the basis of sex or skin 
colour. Employment equity is costly and it overlaps with 
provincial and municipal programs.
<P>
	While the government should ensure equality of opportunity 
and not equality of results, this government is now legislating 
offensive practices of discrimination.
<P>
	Employment equity is unjust. It is expensive. It will not work. 
It is bad policy. Though well intentioned, it is wrong for Canada 
and the government must shelve this discriminatory legislation.

objectives must be balanced. Improved energy efficiency can 
contribute greatly to meeting our long term environmental 
goals.
<P>
	We have begun the process to improve efficiency in our 
facilities through the federal buildings initiative. Cabinet 
ministers are committed to this initiative. The Minister of 
Natural Resources has undertaken to make Natural Resources 
Canada the most energy efficient department in the federal 
government.
<P>

	At the same time, we must strike a balance between economic

important challenges.

1959 and 1963. During his long political career, he held three

Speaker, a certain member of this House has recently reminded 
Canadians that he was Minister of Finance during the years 
1977, 1978 and 1979. The budget deficits for those three years 
were $10.4 billion, $12.6 billion, and $11.5 billion for a three

<P>
	One can add up the budget deficits from 1976 all the way back 
to 1954, the first post-war budget deficit year, and only get to a 
total of $25.9 billion.
<P>
	History tells us that two Liberal finance ministers went on a 
spending spree and overspent more in three years  than their 
predecessors had overspent in 21 years. Canadians turfed that 
irresponsible government out in 1979.
<P>
	Do you know who the Minister of Finance was for the 1978 
and 1979 budgets? Why of course, it was the present Prime 
Minister. This country cannot afford the kind of experience that 
was brought to us by the present Prime Minister.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing,

Service of Canada's policy on strip searches of women prisoners 
and the atrocious mishandling of some of these women by male 
corrections officers at Kingston's prison for women on April 22, 
1994.
<P>
	Following an investigation by CSC officials, it was suggested 
that appropriate measures were taken in using the riot squad 
which includes male prison staff to strip and search the women 
and their cells.
<P>
	CSC's policy states that searches should be conducted by 
members of the same sex, except in cases of institutional 
emergency. It is now clear that the female prisoners behaved in a 
passive manner and offered no physical resistance. This is a 
complete contradiction to the official version of events offered 
by the CSC which is nothing more than a one-sided whitewash 
of the incidents that occurred.
<P>
	I am pleased that the Solicitor General has finally acted today 
to investigate this serious question. Serious issues still exist 
with regard to the lack of energy and speed with which the 
commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada and the 
Solicitor General pursued this matter.

the opportunity to read what the Reform Party really plans for 
Canada, I believe there are some serious questions Canadians 
must ask about their alternative budget.
<P>
	What is the true impact going to be for Canadian seniors? At 
what income level will benefits start to be clawed back, $40,000, 
$30,000 or $20,000? How can Reform members talk about 
national standards on one hand while large cuts to equalization 
payments will restrict the ability of some provinces to deliver 
similar levels of service to their citizens?
<P>
	How do those 86 per cent of Canadians with incomes below 
$20,000 who already do not make contributions to RRSPs find 
the resources to make sufficient contributions to cover 
unemployment insurance,  retirement, post-secondary 
education and personal catastrophes? And will these resources 
be sufficient during tough economic times?
<P>
	Canadians understand that tough problems do not always have 
simple solutions. I hope Canadians ask these and many other 
questions so that they can understand the impact these proposals 
may have on them, their families and the very essence of 
Canadian society.

Bank of Canada has just increased the bank rate from 8.07 per

<P>

federal system, including in the area of overlap and duplication, 
before interest rates rise significantly?

Minister of Finance acknowledge that the pressure from the 
financial community is a signal that he should tackle the deficit 
problem by making massive cuts in government spending, 
which has to be the preferred approach, rather than raise the 
taxes of the middle class, as he himself proposed, which would 
considerably delay an economic upturn?

close to ensure that the wealthiest Canadians do their fair share 
to correct the fiscal situation. Unfortunately, the minister once 
again targeted social programs in his strategy to combat the 
deficit.
<P>
	Can the finance minister tell us when he will bring down the

<P>
	Having said this, I shall answer the hon. member's second

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the Reform Party outlined a taxpayers' budget 
that would eliminate the deficit in three years through spending

<P>
	We did so because many Canadians believe, and the 
international money markets agree, that the Liberal 
government's deficit reduction target is too weak and that the 
government is squandering its one opportunity to get federal 
spending under control.
<P>

means putting an addendum into his budget, revise the 
upcoming federal budget to set a firm target date for the 
elimination of the deficit rather than just its reduction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

	There were some very live debates within our caucus. All

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the reply but we were asking about 
revising the government's deficit reduction target. The minister 
has repeatedly mentioned rolling two year targets for the deficit. 
We ask, is the minister listening to the money markets?
<P>
	I quote Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at Wood Gundy, 
that a two-year target at the top of the business cycle is not going 
to satisfy creditors. The Bank of Nova Scotia vice-president 
stated that making non-ambitious two-year targets is really not 
what is needed. Moving toward a balanced budget is what 
investors want to see.
<P>
	Given the fact that our creditors, the people that are putting up 
$40 billion to cover the overdrafts, have no faith in the 
government's fiscal plan, will the minister abandon the idea of 
rolling two-year deficit targets and set a firm date for deficit 
elimination?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I made the same 
comment on Friday. The problem with members of the Reform 
Party is that they are so desirous of rehearsing their spontaneous 
lines for after the budget, they cannot wait until it is presented.
<P>
	Let me assure the House that when the budget is brought 
down, the desires of those who want to see us clean up the 
nation's finances in a humane way that will allow Canadians to 
get back to work while still respecting the values of the country, 
one of which is that governments should live within their means, 
will be very satisfied with the budget.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my final supplementary question is for the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Since the government's last budget, the Canadian bank rate 
has gone up by 4 per cent. It went up again today. The Canadian 
dollar has fallen by three cents. Canada is in danger of losing its 
AAA credit rating and its social  services network is 
unravelling. These are just four of the consequences of the 
government's fiscal policy.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister accept any personal responsibility 
for these consequences? Does he want to go down as the Prime 
Minister that drove the debt through he ceiling and the dollar 
through the floor or will he order a mid-course correction in the 
government's fiscal policy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to be remembered as running a very good 
government with a very good Minister of Finance, a government 
that has performed with 4.3 per cent growth rather than 3 per 
cent, with virtually zero inflation, with 450,000 new jobs 
created in a year.
<P>
	This is the first government since 1990 that has managed to 
have an operating surplus and that predicted a deficit of $39.7 
billion. The actual deficit will be lower than that.

the budget that not only are we going to hit our targets but that 
we are going to hit our targets based on very prudent 
assumptions. We are going to set in place the track that is going 
to clean up this nation's finances. The member can put that in his 
pipe and smoke it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not smoke.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has come up with a unique 
explanation of the failures of the previous government. He is the 
first one to explain that the Tories had standards that were just 
too high.
<P>
	Today interest rates went up, the bank rate went up to 8.38 per 
cent, the highest level since this government took office. This is 
with increased warnings from not just Moody's but now Wood 
Gundy, Dominion Bond Rating Service and others that the 
targets are not adequate.
<P>
	Will the minister not admit that the markets are already saying 
that with this government's targets Canadians will pay millions 
of dollars more a year on higher interest rates, higher borrowing 
and higher mortgage costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with some 
difficulty that I find that the members opposite continue with 
doom and gloom and continue to try to attack a country which in 
terms of its economy is doing very well.
<P>
	The member is simply not stating the facts. If he read 
Moody's statement he would have seen there was a general 
comment on the level of public debt in this country both at the 
federal level and at the provincial level. There was a very clear 
trend set out going back a number of years in terms of what 
previous governments had done and the failure of Canadian 
governments to come to grips with their problems. There was no 
comment on this government, our targets or the forthcoming 
budget.

	I would ask the hon. member, if he is going to ask questions, 
for heaven's sake please base them on some fact.

my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Members of the Kingston correctional services riot squad 
responded to an emergency at the Kingston Prison for Women in 
1994. In her report on this incident, the prison warden lied, 
saying that only female guards responded, when a video proves 
otherwise.

	However, just last week I received another report from the 
correctional investigator into the same situation which provided 
quite a different set of conclusions in respect of facts and 
interpretation.
<P>
	As a result of the conflicts between these two reports, the

there should be an independent impartial investigation to

the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	After today's rather scary announcement the women of 
Canada are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the Reform 
Party is not the government. Women want social security 
reforms to be sensitive to their plight and to that of their 
children. I know the minister has met with many women's 
groups and I know he is very concerned about child poverty.
<P>
	What measures has the minister taken to address the needs of 
Canadian women and their children?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the most important 
developments has been as a result of the changes and 
amendments we made to the Unemployment Insurance Act last 
year. Close to 200,000 low income Canadians with children and 
who are on UI assistance now receive close to an additional 
$1,000 a year as a result of the reforms to the UI system. We 
differentiated between the basic benefit and the benefit based 
upon dependency.
<P>
	It shows that when we can make serious reforms and look at it 
properly and constructively, we can really help poor people, not 
blow torch them, as the Reform Party wants to do.

whereby the federal government would transfer tax points to the

services in the areas of health care, advanced education and

how can the third party say that it is going to reduce the deficit 
when at the same time it is transferring tax points which are 
necessary to bring the revenue in so that it can reduce the 
deficit? There is major evidence of double counting that I would 
really like to understand.  Perhaps the member might explain it 
in his supplementary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> The

the most compassionate thing you can do if someone has cancer

<P>
	I must say that members on both sides of the House in 
response to their own constituents have made it very clear to the 
government and to the Minister of Finance that Canadians really 
feel they are suffering from an undue tax burden.
<P>
	It is something the government is very conscious of and it is 
not our intention in the next budget to proceed primarily through 
tax increases. I have made it very clear that we are going to 
proceed overwhelmingly in cutting government spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
encourage the finance minister, when he gets through the 30,000 
letters we delivered yesterday, to read our taxpayers' budget 
because we have balanced it without any tax increase.
<P>
	What could the finance minister tell Canadians who are 
already providing his government with $120 billion to convince 
them that it should have more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

presented by the third party.
<P>
	Let us be very clear. First, it causes an enormous amount of

is totally lacking in details. The devil is in the details. If they are 
going to do a budget they should at least have the courage to say

social programs, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Would he confirm this afternoon that when it comes to 
funding social programs the proportion of expenditures on 
social programs in relation to the GDP is the same today as it 
was back in the mid-1970s?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the point raised by 
the hon. member is a valid one.
<P>
	It is simply nonsense to make our social programs the 
scapegoat for the deficit. The reason we have a very high deficit 
is unfortunately the curse of compound interest, the fact that 
successive governments have allowed that debt to build up too 
high.
<P>
	The government is now stuck with a terrible problem. It is not 
a question of ideology but a question of arithmetic. The 
member's question is very well taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
trying to balance this lopsided debate. The minister 
acknowledges that social program expenditures have not caused 
the huge deficit and debt base in the country. He referred to the 
fact that one cause was compound interest.
<P>
	Would the minister confirm that a 1991 study from his 
department indicated that 96 per cent of our accumulated debt 
since 1984 was the result of compound interest on the debt and, 
more important, a whole set of tax loopholes as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt 
that tax loopholes and tax expenditures have deprived the 
government of needed revenue.
<P>
	On the other side of the question we must really admit that a 
number of those tax expenditures had a very specific policy 
objective. In fact it was very important to accomplish those 
objectives.
<P>
	The answer to the question is that it is not tax loopholes. It is 
not social programs. It is the curse of compound interest and the 
fact that the previous government simply did not face up to its 
responsibilities. We are going to do so.

<P>

precedent setting because the fundamental foundation upon 
which the IRB adjudicates is that every individual case gets 
decided on its own merits. Some will make it; others will be 
refused.
<P>
	Second, he knows full well that under the Immigration Act all

somehow it is not okay for a member of a social group who is

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a major portion of Reform's so-called taxpayers' 
budget has to do with its radical proposals for a $15 billion cut in 
social security spending. This is an ill thought out proposal 
which we heard before from Reform during the social security 
reform process.
<P>
	The reform of Canada's social programs is a necessary, 
valuable and timely exercise. Its impact will be better programs 
and services that deliver the best results. Its impact will be 
actions that meet our highest priorities. With those outcomes in 
the balance, it is a process that deserves thought, care and 
creativity.
<P>
	To date, and I include today's debate in this comment, it is not 
a process to which the Reform Party has added much beyond 
shopworn clichés and one track slogans. That unfortunate 
reality was exemplified by the Reform members' contribution, 
if I can use that term, to the recent report of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development. Much of the 
thinking, or lack thereof, that went into the Reform position also 
characterizes their interventions today.
<P>
	Reform Party members appear to have a problem with social 
programs: they cost money. In their vision of Canada, families 
take care of their own and charities take care of the rest. This is 
just like the 1930s.
<P>
	There is only one big problem for them in that vision: 
Canadians do not buy it. Canadians understand the value of 
social programs. They understand many of the flaws in the 
status quo and they want changes. However, they do not accept a 
social vision based on a déjà vu as the answer to every problem.
<P>
	Today's Reform Party budget has a principle of equality of 
contribution which states that the burden of reduction must fall 
least heavily on the most vulnerable members of our society. Yet 
Reform's proposals would have completely the opposite effect.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Instead of helping those most in need, Reform Party members 
would cut seniors pensions by $3 billion. How would this help 
the most vulnerable in our society? They would eliminate all 
regional differentiation and all non-UI components. How would 
this help the poorest regions of the country, workers who need 
training or women who want maternity leave? They would cut 
aboriginal programs by 24 per cent. How would this help one of 
the poorest groups and arguably the neediest group of 
Canadians? They would cut equalization payments by $3 
billion, or 35 per cent. How would this  help the poorest regions 
of the country or Canadians who really need help?
<P>
	These proposals would burden the most vulnerable members 
of our society, not help them. In the same vein, Reform's 
minority report was a sad collection of opinions desperately 
masquerading as fact. It showed the utter lack of depth in 
Reform members' thinking. It displayed a complete lack of 
attention to many of the important issues shaping our economy 
today, issues clearly outlined in the green paper released last 
fall.
<P>
	Canadians deserve better and this government is determined 
to provide that. In my remarks I want to talk about the vision 
behind the government's perspectives on social security reform. 
I want to look at questions that face Canada and its social 
programs, questions for which the government has offered real 
proposals. I will then compare that to the silence or simplistic if 
not outright contradictory opinions of the Reform opposition.
<P>
	Was the Reform minority report weak? This House may not 
simply take my word for it. Take the word of the hon. member 
for Calgary North. She was quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on 
February 8 that aspects of her party's report ``were not thought 
through very well before they were rushed into print''.
<P>
	Canadians expect much more from their members of 
Parliament. I could not agree more and I can see no evidence of 
improvement in the position taken in today's debate. On an issue 
of this significance do Canadians not have the right to expect 
thoughtful analysis and vision? The government has done its 
part. Why have my hon. friends on the opposite side not done 
theirs?
<P>
	Indeed, this government is committed to doing even more. 
Social security reform remains an integral component of the 
government agenda, rebuilding the system so that it meets the 
priorities of today and of tomorrow.
<P>
	These are important issues and will meet the objectives set 
down in the green paper. What were they? It was to help 
Canadians get jobs and keep them. It was to help the most 
vulnerable in our society with the focus on child poverty. It was 
to do that in an affordable manner.
<P>
	The report of the committee is one important contribution to 
determining how those changes will take place but of course it is 
not the only one. That takes me to the first point I want to raise in 
analysing the Reform's minority report.
<P>
	The first issue the Reform Party raised was that of 
consultation. Reading Reform's comments one might think that 
this report was the beginning and the end of the consultation 
process, that some ideologically high bound government had 
decided to set up a sham process that would freeze Canadians 
out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9910"> 9910 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask these questions: Would this be the same government 
that has already received more than 40,000 social security 
reform workbooks from Canadians? Would this be the same 
government that has helped more than 200 members of 
Parliament hold town hall meetings on social security reform, 
drawing more than 20,000 people? Would this be the same 
government that has communicated with 7,000 people via 
Internet, 35,000 via a 1-800 number, as well as receiving 3,000 
letters addressed to the minister directly?
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	This government is consulting. Reform Party members may 
not have liked to have heard from legitimate groups with valid 
perspectives as it travelled across Canada. They may have 
wished to have heard from more individuals, but you simply 
cannot make the leap from that complaint to the implication that 
there has been no opportunity for Canadians to offer comments. 
Far from it. This government has undertaken the most wide 
ranging consultation on any issue ever.
<P>
	More than 100,000 Canadians have had their say in one way or 
another during the past year on this issue. Most Canadians do 
not accept the extremist views displayed by the Reform Party. 
They do not buy what Reform is peddling on social programs.
<P>
	Canadians have made it clear that they want to see change, not 
destruction, and they are right. They believe governments must 
invest in people, address child poverty and support those 
individuals with low incomes. They are right. They believe we 
can do a better and more efficient job, and they are right. They 
want governments to work together and Canadians are right 
again. That is what the consultation process told us. That is what 
we, as a Liberal government, are prepared to do for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The second issue the minority report raises is a complaint 
about the alleged lack of scope in this exercise. From the point 
of view of the Reform Party, all social programs are alike; they 
are all drains on the public purse and should be treated as such. 
Of course, this is not surprising.
<P>
	The Reform symphony still only knows one tune, well over a 
year after its arrival in this House: the deficit is the only thing 
that matters. Of course the deficit matters. The government has 
been extremely clear on this issue. Our programs must be 
affordable. But the deficit is one consideration in designing a 
new social safety net. It is not the sole rationale for action or the 
sole test of options.
<P>
	Reform's commitment to take $15 billion from social 
programs leaves so many unanswered questions. Time does not 
permit me to even start listing just a few of them. I am content to 
let Canadians ask Reform members instead. That is the Reform 
idea of scope.
<P>
	For the government, the scope of this exercise is those 
programs and spending that relate to working, learning and 
security. The emphasis is on those programs that help people 
who are, could be, or will be in the labour market.
<P>
	Health care does not fit this and it is undergoing its own study. 
The needs of seniors do not fit this and they will be discussed 
elsewhere. Canadians understand this. They understand that we 
want social programs that help people prepare for real jobs.
<P>
	The so-called logic of the Reform Party would have included 
our defence and foreign policy reviews in this exercise. After 
all, does the deficit not matter in each of those too? No, the 
scope of this exercise is logical, intelligent and consistent.
<P>
	That brings me to Reform's third issue of division in the 
committee's report and the green paper. Most of the Reform's 
position in both the minority report and today's debate is based 
on allegations regarding the government's vision of social 
programs and a mish-mash of ideas that Reform members 
trumpet as their own vision.
<P>
	We can look and look through their comments and find a lot 
about the ``how'' of Reform's approach to slashing programs. 
What we will not see is any ``why''. Oh, there are claims about 
principles such as self-reliance and decentralization. But 
nowhere do we read a consistent, logical analysis of the social 
and economic issues facing Canadian families.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere do we find a thought through perspective on what 
social programs can do to help people and our economy. All we 
see is a series of other people's ideas and notes about programs 
that countries such as Chile and Singapore are trying. However, 
where is the social and economic vision to link them? There is 
not one.
<P>
	What vision there might be lies between the lines. For 
example, Reform members continue to critique our work to 
expand the number of good quality child care spaces in Canada. 
In fact, not long ago they found one. It was an unpublished study 
which they claim shows that the product of child care will be a 
generation of depressed, stressed criminals. We are dealing here 
with people who read one report which has very little 
relationship to reality.
<P>
	Given the real world, parents who must work to meet their 
family needs, how can they say those things? How can they 
ignore the mass of evidence that good child care can actually 
help kids, especially those from backgrounds which are far less 
privileged than those of the average Reformer?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9911"> 9911 </A></B>
<P>
	Forcing women out of the workforce by drying up good 
quality child care is not my idea of a sound social or economic 
policy. However, stands such as that make the Reform vision 
for Canada obvious.
<P>
	Now Reform members may say that is not fair, so let me ask 
my hon. friends to spell out the issues that face Canadians. What 
would be the most important priorities for social programs to 
address? How do we balance the competing demands for action, 
all of which have at least some legitimacy?
<P>
	I ask this because I realize that in the world inhabited by the 
Reform Party there is only one issue, the deficit. There are no 
other challenges. Government should set aside all other 
priorities and just hack and hack until the debt is eliminated. 
That is the beginning and the end of their vision on any subject.
<P>
	Obviously the deficit is a priority of the government. The 
need to bring expenses and revenues into line is essential. We 
are taking action to reach that goal, as we promised Canadians. 
However, Canadians expect governments to achieve many goals 
with intelligence, co-ordination and a sense of priority. The 
deficit is an important one, indeed a critical one, but it is not the 
only one.
<P>
	Families, workplaces and the entire society have changed 
dramatically in the decades since many of the social programs 
were first envisioned. Unemployment insurance, social 
assistance and training programs were designed in days which 
were very different from today. Today workplaces are full of 
people who juggle home and family responsibilities, often as 
single parents. They take part time courses to develop new 
skills. They face uncertain career paths. Above all, they are 
required to be more flexible in every facet of their lives than 
ever before. They recognize their responsibilities but they also 
need some help.
<P>
	Social programs can be improved to help people. We can 
identify the priorities for the limited funds that are available. 
That is the art of governing. It is what citizens have a right to 
expect from their government.
<P>
	The proposals that the government has discussed with the 
provinces, business, labour, social action groups and all 
Canadians reflect that vision. All are rooted in the jobs and 
growth agenda which the Prime Minister set out in his speech in 
Quebec City at the Chamber of Commerce last September. As he 
noted, our social and economic priorities are linked closely 
together. We cannot meet the needs of Canadians without a 
strong economy. No strong economy is based on a society 
polarized into haves and have nots. We know social programs 
that respond to the most important needs can build our economy, 
even if the Reform Party does not want to believe it.
<P>
	Let me discuss one aspect of our changing economy, learning. 
We are in a world in which skilled needs are changing faster than 
we can identify. We have a world in which people are challenged 
by new technologies and opportunities. The government's 
vision of social  programs will realize the potential of these 
changes and help Canadians to harness them.
<P>
	Compare that to the vision of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	I would ask my hon. friends where is their perspective on the 
training issues facing older workers? Where is their perspective 
on helping young people get real job skills that employers need 
in high technology fields? Where is the analysis of how to make 
life long learning work in an economy where people will change 
jobs and employers more often than ever before?
<P>
	Any talk of a new economy is utterly absent in the comments 
of the Reform Party. The government believes in working with 
employers and workers to address the needs of their industries. 
Our work with sectoral councils has identified needs and 
initiated action plans.
<P>
	What would Reformers do in the real world of these needs? 
Would they let the growth sectors of our economy wither? 
Would they claim that some magic tax cut will let them solve all 
of their problems? The government has done better.
<P>
	For example, we have begun to address both the needs of 
industries and the employment problems facing young people 
through innovative partnerships. The government has entered 
into agreements with employers, workers and educators in fields 
such as horticulture, tourism and automotive repair under our 
youth internship program. We are working with them to develop 
the training that young people need to fill the skilled jobs that 
are available. We are working with them to create a climate that 
will attract even more job opportunities to our country.
<P>
	Compare that to the do-nothing attitude of the Reform Party. 
We are working with provinces and territories to explore new 
and better ways of meeting the needs of people through our 
strategic initiatives program.
<P>
	This example of federal-provincial co-operation is alive and 
well with many provinces. We are working with them on a pilot 
project called Integrated Training Centres for Youth. This is to 
help our young people.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying that social security reform 
is a chance to recognize the real needs out there. The status quo 
does not meet them. It is a chance to cut today's suit to fit 
today's cloth and no one wants the tattered rags being flogged by 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again I am puzzled by some of the comments of yet another 
Liberal.
<P>
	It seems as though Reformers do not have parents who are in 
need of OAS. It seems as though Reformers do not understand 
what it is to be responsible for 80-year old people, that Reform-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9912"> 9912 </A></B>
<P>
ers somehow do not have friends and acquaintances who are 
falling through the cracks of our economic cycle.
<P>
	It seems as though we live in a vacuum and only those 
opposite have a way of understanding. I am sorry. We do have 
parents in their elderly years who depend on OAS. We do have 
people in our families who receive GIS. We do have people in 
our families and acquaintances who require child care. To 
characterize the Reform Party as not knowing or not 
understanding is just beyond my capability to understand.
<P>
	Perhaps I could help this member understand why these 
people are in that position, why they are dependent on the social 
welfare and the social safety net in the country. It is because the 
spending of the government is destroying our ability to be able 
to provide for them. That is why we came forward with the plan 
today.
<P>
	I find it really unfortunate that this member, along with many 
others, would choose to interpret the Reform document from 
some kind of weird perspective, as if we had landed from 
another planet. We represent the people in our constituencies. 
We represent people in this member's constituency. I had the 
privilege of conducting a couple of town hall meetings and 
getting input from people in his constituency. I reflect many of 
the values of many of his constituents.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of learning, I would like to ask the 
member if he has had an opportunity of taking a look through our 
document to page 47 where we show our method of lowering 
cash transfers but giving the provinces cash points. In fact, the 
amount of funding available for health and for education under 
our scheme actually increases.
<P>
	This is not cut and slash. This is a realistic budget which is 
more than I can say for the pipe dream that the government is 
continuing to give to us.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the pipe dream 
of the Liberal government. When we were elected on October 
25, 1993, may I add, and I will submit to you there are some 
Reformers-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would say this to all members. For 
reasons such as this we ask that members put their remarks to the 
Chair. Any time the word ``you'' is referred to, it is supposed to 
refer to whomever is in this chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, through you to the hon. 
member that attended a town hall meeting in my riding. There 
were people in my riding that voted for the Reform Party. 
Approximately 15,000 voted Reform and approximately 72,000 
voted for me. I understand that some people may share their 
opinion, but we will see if we can rectify that in the upcoming 
election.
<P>
	I would, first of all, like to address the concern raised by the 
hon. member, vis-à-vis the Liberal pipe dream. This is the same 
pipe dream that has put the economy back on its proper footing. 
We have created over 450,000 jobs since taking office, in 
co-operation and in partnership with the private stakeholders. 
We have increased the number of jobs for young people. We 
have the fastest growth of any of the G-7 countries.
<P>
	These statistics illustrate to me, as an objective viewer of 
what is going on in Canada, that things are getting better with a 
Liberal government at the helm. May I also add that my thoughts 
are reflected far and wide throughout Canada. I was in Alberta 
last week and people are generally happy with the direction 
which the government has taken.
<P>
	In reference to the deficit, we have used what I consider a 
more rational approach. We have targeted 3 per cent of GDP by 
1996-97. It is reasonable. It is a dual track approach. It will not 
hurt people as much as the Reform agenda would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad that 
we can have this debate. The Liberal government has a point of 
view and the Reformers have a point of view on how the finances 
of the country ought to be run. I hope that the people of Canada 
are paying very close attention because literally their future 
depends on it.
<P>
	I did a little mathematical extrapolation. When I first started 
this process it was 1992. The federal debt was about $420 billion 
and now it is around $550 billion, an average of around 9 per 
cent per year. At that rate, the debt would grow to over $600 
billion by the year 2000.
<P>
	Interest payments would increase from $33 billion in 1992 to 
over $50 billion in the year 2000. That $50 billion is not 
available for education, is not available for health, is not 
available for any of the social programs or anything else.
<P>
	I want to ask the member who just made the speech a question. 
We recognize if we do not cut spending that the debt will 
continue to grow. In fact, the deficit needs to be cut to zero so 
that we can start attacking the debt which is growing every day 
by $110 million.
<P>
	We have to do something. Does the government have any 
plans at all, and if so, where is it going to get the money? The 
$40 billion deficit is about equal to our $40 billion interest 
payment. Are we going to default on our interest payments? I am 
sure the member would say no.
<P>
	Are we going to take money out of running the government? 
That costs around $40 billion per year. It would mean shutting 
government down completely. That would balance the budget. I 
am sure he would say no. Let us keep at least some of it going.
<P>
	What is left then are transfers payments to the provinces. To 
say that the budget can be balanced and bring the financial 
situation under control without doing that, I submit, is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9913"> 9913 </A></B>
<P>
facing the facts squarely. It is being  very unrealistic. I think it is 
giving the people of Canada a false sense of security.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I would like the to member to respond on where he would 
actually cut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member. As he probably noticed, he was answering most of his 
own questions. Therefore this will probably give me an 
opportunity to address some real issues that are the minds of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to tell the hon. member that we will continue 
what we have been doing up to today. I think he has seen some 
cuts in expenditures. We are running a more efficient 
government than we have had. I remember my years in 
opposition watching the Conservatives squander money left, 
right and centre. We are not doing that. We are very fiscally 
responsible individuals.
<P>
	At the same time we are investing in people because we feel 
that one key role of a government is to help people get and keep 
their jobs, to help the most vulnerable in our society with a focus 
on child poverty in a very sustainable fashion.
<P>
	The results to date since our election would indicate that we 
are on the right track. We are creating jobs. We have great 
growth in our economy and Canadians are generally pleased 
with the way the government is governing.
<P>
	At the end of the day the real measuring stick of our success 
will be whether Canadians are happy with the way we are 
bringing the country forward. I would say to the hon. member 
that they are very happy with the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, sure the people are feeling happy. Do 
they have the correct information? Do they know what deep 
trouble we are in? Perhaps the government of the day with its be 
happy, don't worry attitude is convincing them of it but hiding 
from them the bitter truth of what is going to happen.
<P>
	The government has stated as its goal to bring the deficit down 
to $25 billion. That is a cut of $15 billion from the present 
deficit of $40 billion. Where are there cuts of $15 billion? I have 
not heard one of them. It is worry about one million here and one 
million there. That is important but it does not begin to touch the 
big question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not really hear anything 
worth nothing in what the hon. member said. I think if we have 
to deal with reality we can look at the state of the nation. 
Canadians are not happy fools, as the hon. member would have 
us believe. They are happy because they see all the economic 
indicators are looking good for the Canadian people and that 
hope and jobs are part of the Canadian fabric once again.
<P>
	I resent the fact that the hon. member would think that 
Canadians are fools. They are not fools. They look at the issues 
and examine the issues. They see the growth in the economy and 
they are feeling good about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to discuss this issue and talk about whether 3 per cent 
of GDP is a valid target for the government to be aiming at in 
two year's time and whether that is going to restore the 
confidence investors need before they will continue to leave 
their money in this country. There all kinds of implications that 
flow from that.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about some of the wants and desires of 
Canadians. I think when we design a program, when we put 
together a government we have to give some consideration to 
what Canadians want and need. If we listen to them they say 
things that are really just common sense.
<P>
	As taxpayers, Canadians want to keep their income. They 
want to have lots of disposable income and they work hard every 
day to try and grind out a living so they have some money for 
their family and so that they can retire some day, or if there is an 
emergency they can draw on some savings. That is what they 
want.
<P>
	As investors they want to be able to get a good return and also 
protect their capital. They do not want to see their capital 
jeopardized. As people who some day may have to rely on a 
social safety net, they want to know that it will be there and that 
it will be adequate, that it will be something they can count on.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As parents Canadians want to be able to know that there will 
always be a university there so that they can send their children. 
They want to know that there will be some kind of safety net in 
place for them as they move into their senior years. They want to 
know that there will be a health care system there for their 
children. Those are some of the desires and wants that I think 
government has an obligation to try to meet.
<P>
	It is not necessary for government to be in conflict with those 
wants and desires. A responsible government must align itself 
with those wants and desires and come up with ways of 
accommodating those wants and desires. To me it is obvious that 
there are ways we can do that.
<P>
	Reform presented a perfect example of that this morning. I 
would argue that this government has not got itself in line with 
Canadians' wants and desires. I would argue that Canadians are 
moving completely against that.
<P>
	A situation in which the government's best effort adds $100 
billion to the debt and leaves us with a $25 billion deficit at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9914"> 9914 </A></B>
<P>
very top of the business cycle in a couple of years, combined 
with the desires that I have just mentioned, creates in my 
judgment a very explosive situation. On the one hand we have 
the wants and desires of Canadians and on the other hand we 
have a  government that in my judgment has created a business 
environment that is completely contrary to that.
<P>
	Let me go back through the different hats people wear in their 
lives and talk about how their wants and desires are really in 
conflict with the disincentives that the government puts in their 
way to prevent them from achieving some of the things that they 
want to achieve and from getting the type of government that not 
only do they want but that they deserve.
<P>
	As taxpayers they work hard every day to try to make a living 
and provide for their families. Look at what massive 
government debt does to them. It imposes a fantastic tax burden.
<P>
	In 1963, if I remember correctly, taxes constituted about 20 
per cent or a little over that of where people's income went to. 
People worked hard and all that hard work and effort was a 
tremendous positive force pushing up and providing jobs and 
prosperity for the country. Then we had that 20 per cent of taxes 
pushing down a little but not nearly enough to stop the desires 
and incentives that people had to create some prosperity for 
themselves and their families.
<P>
	As the years have gone on we have seen more taxes piled on 
top of that positive force and now it is very difficult for that 
force to push up anymore. That is why a lot of people are giving 
up on Canada and giving up on staying in the working world. 
That is why we see people fleeing to the United States and other 
lower tax jurisdictions, particularly people who are highly 
skilled.
<P>
	Other disincentives are the perverse incentives that are a big 
part of a lot of social programs today, social programs that 
actually pay people to remain idle. People who are responsible, 
work hard, want to provide for their families and work long 
hours every week see this. They ask themselves: ``Why am I 
knocking myself out when the next guy over does not care and he 
is just laying on the system?''. There is a real inequality in the 
system. We have a lot of disincentives now piling up on top of all 
those desires and wants of Canadians. It is beginning to push 
them down and they are getting tired.
<P>
	As investors they expect to make a good return on their money 
but they also expect that their capital should be protected. We 
have been sent a message in the last seven days that investments 
in this country are in jeopardy to some degree because the 
government has not been able to get a handle on its 
overspending.
<P>
	Now the international community is wondering whether 
Canada is a place where it should be putting its money. The same 
applies to domestic investors who have lots of options other than 
their own country.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I saw in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> the other day a very scary graph 
that showed how indebted Canada is to foreign investors 
compared with other countries around the world. It was 
frightening. We have a foreign debt load twice what the next 
country in the world has. I found it frightening to know that we 
are so tied to the whim of foreign investors because successive 
governments have not been able to get a handle on spending.
<P>
	Now we have a situation in which this government is 
proposing to add another $100 billion to our overall debt load 
before we get down to $25 billion. That is its target and it is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	International investors have to deal with that, as do domestic 
investors. Although they want to invest in this country there are 
a lot of disincentives and a lot of pressure pushing the other way 
to prevent them from doing that and to dissuade them.
<P>
	As people who want to invest and want to have confidence in 
our social programs they are very concerned as well. In spite of 
the fact that we spend $150 billion a year on social programs we 
still have all kinds of unemployment. HRD's own studies show 
that social programs are contributing to unemployment, 
including the unemployment insurance program. In many cases 
we have people living at the bottom echelons of society with no 
hope, not because there is not a safety net there but because they 
are trapped in the safety net.
<P>
	I think it is crazy that in a country this prosperous relative to 
the rest of the world where we spend $150 billion a year on 
social programs we have people trapped with no hope in our 
social programs. Something must be done to help them out of 
that situation.
<P>
	This morning I believe that Reform came up with some 
alternatives that will get people out of that situation, give them 
some hope and give them some of the positive incentives they so 
desperately want to be in alignment with Canadians' wants and 
desires.
<P>
	People in the bottom echelons of society are as desperate as 
anyone else to see their dreams and hopes realized. However, 
this government and successive governments have placed all 
kinds of disincentives in their way to prevent that.
<P>
	The government has set no date for the elimination of the 
deficit. The best it can do is come up with a point two years down 
the road from now where it will reduce the deficit to $25 billion. 
It refers to its rolling two-year targets, whatever that means. 
Maybe it is like a moving target, one it does not want to hit and 
can keep moving it.
<P>
	Very often the government says it does not know what the 
future holds so there is no point in setting a date when it will 
eliminate the deficit or when it will balance the budget. It is true 
that we do not know what the future holds but it is ludicrous for 
the Government of Canada to say that it does not know what the 
future holds and  therefore is not going to set a date for when it 
can eliminate the deficit. That is crazy. It is almost criminally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9915"> 9915 </A></B>
<P>
negligent when one considers how many people's lives depend 
on what that government decides.
<P>
	It is a little like telling people who are saving for their own 
retirement: ``Yes, you should save some money but it does not 
matter how much because we do not know what the future holds. 
Perhaps somewhere down the road you will win the lottery or 
you will inherit a bunch of money so don't worry about it''. It is 
the same mentality that the government is applying.
<P>
	I fear very much for Canadians if we are going to take this 
situation so lightly that the government, in spite of what 
international investors have been telling us even this week, is 
going to say it does not matter, it does not know what the future 
holds and therefore it is not going to set any targets. I think it is 
absolutely crazy. The government must wake up for the benefit 
of all Canadians and acknowledge that it has to set a hard target 
and take some tough action right now so that it can move toward 
it.
<P>
	What Canadians really want is a government that is absolutely 
in line with their wants and needs. They want programs that 
encourage their deep desire to be self-reliant, not programs that 
work against it. They want an economy that rewards their work, 
not punishes them. They want a government that gets out of their 
face, not like this one which seems to have to have a finger in 
every aspect of their lives. The government has been absolutely 
without a single success that I can think of, in terms of really 
helping people over the long haul. I will talk about that in more 
detail in a moment.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Canadians want a federal government that recognizes its 
severe limitations. A federal government in a country this size 
that is so far removed from ordinary Canadians has tremendous 
limitations. That needs to be understood. The federal 
government has to allow lower levels of government, families, 
charities, communities and obviously, individuals themselves to 
take more responsibility for their lives and to empower people to 
do things for themselves and give them some of the hope that 
they truly need.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about some of the areas where government 
has failed dramatically and compare them with areas where 
individuals have absolutely succeeded.
<P>
	The first example I want to use is the Canada pension plan, 
and I will throw in old age security for good measure. I want to 
compare it with how RRSPs have done, a program that 
Canadians fund themselves and they are joining in ever greater 
numbers. In fact, I saw in the newspaper today that there has 
been a tremendous rise in the number of people who have gone 
to get bank loans so they can buy RRSPs.
<P>
	When the Canada pension plan was established it was done so 
with the belief that it would sustain people in their old age. I do 
not think there is anyone in the country, and probably not even 
anyone in all parties in  this House, who believes that is going to 
happen. Everyone knows the Canada pension plan is woefully 
underfunded. It is about $510 billion in the hole, if you compare 
it with other actuarially sound pension plans.
<P>
	Old age security started out as being a funded program. 
However, that was abandoned and now it comes out of general 
revenues. People understand that as the debt gets bigger, the 
amount of money that can go into OAS and other social 
programs is rapidly diminishing. Most people realize now, even 
if they did not a year ago, that they cannot rely on government 
programs.
<P>
	More and more people are starting to set aside money for 
themselves. That is why we see RRSPs growing tremendously. It 
is not a revelation to me that people believe they can save better 
for their own future than the government can. People all along 
have had more faith in themselves than in the government when 
it comes to these types of programs. However, it is only now, 
when the fiscal situation has become so acute, that people are 
taking this situation very seriously. They are scrutinizing how 
the government spends money and scrutinizing the form social 
programs take.
<P>
	If we ask people to compare which is more successful today, 
the Canada pension plan or RRSPs, people are going to say 
absolutely that RRSPs are much more successful. They know 
their RRSPs will be there and that the Canada pension plan has 
eroded over the years.
<P>
	I am going to get off the fiscal topic for a moment to talk about 
another area which is indirectly related to social programs and 
in which the same principle applies.
<P>
	The other day the minister of multiculturalism said that 
Canada has no Canadian heritage. I thought that was curious, but 
then I thought about it and I think I understand what she was 
saying. For 20-some years or maybe a little longer than that, the 
government has tried to cobble together an official heritage, 
some kind of an official culture for this country. It has failed 
miserably and I think the minister of multiculturalism truly 
realized that.
<P>
	Concurrent with that, there is a tremendous rise in Canada in 
the number of people who are going back to look at their own 
history. They are going through history books trying to figure 
out where their ancestors came from, where they lived in this 
country, and from which countries they originated.
<P>
	People are very interested in the heritage of this country, but 
there is a big difference in how the government or the minister 
defines it and how people define it. People are very proud of 
their personal histories. All that taken together gives us a very 
proud heritage in this country.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9916"> 9916 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	We could even expand on that a little bit. In many cases, 
people are very proud of their communities. I come from a small 
community in Alberta. People there take a tremendous amount 
of pride in some of the local sites. What they really do not get 
very excited about are programs like official multiculturalism. 
They see that as something the government created a long time 
ago, not in response to their concerns but it was something the 
government felt it should do, that it knew better than Canadians 
did of what constituted real culture.
<P>
	The comments of the minister of multiculturalism from a few 
days ago indicate that those types of top down programs have 
completely and utterly failed. The victims were the taxpayers 
who had to pay billions of dollars for those types of programs to 
keep them going.
<P>
	Let us not continue to make the same mistakes over and over 
again. Let us not continue to have top down government in our 
social programs when we have shown over and over again that 
Canadians are more than capable of standing on their own feet. 
If they are given the tools, they are empowered to do so.
<P>
	I want to talk about Reform's approach to empowering 
individual Canadians. We spoke this morning about a new 
approach to handling social programs. The member for Calgary 
North is sitting beside me. I applaud her and members of her 
committee for the tremendous amount of work they did in going 
out to really listen to Canadians and to come up with an 
alternative approach to Canada's social programs and safety 
nets, one that is really in alignment with Canadians' wants and 
desires.
<P>
	Reform talked a little today about how we can empower the 
different groups of people who make up our country. We talked 
about empowering seniors, how we need to focus OAS and the 
guaranteed income supplement on people who are most in need.
<P>
	This country is in tremendous financial difficulty. We have a 
debt that is over $550 billion. Just about everybody realizes we 
are going to have to target our social programs to people who 
actually need them. That is what we have proposed in our 
document this morning.
<P>
	We are going to eliminate mandatory retirement so that those 
who choose to work beyond 65 can continue to do so. There was 
an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today that talked about the high 
suicide rate among seniors once they are forced to quit at age 65.
<P>
	We are not saying that you have to keep working. We are not 
saying that at all. We are saying that if people want to, they can 
continue to work. Many people have a tremendous amount of 
potential and ability to still give to society when they hit 65 
years. Of course people are living longer now. We see elderly 
MPs who make a tremendous contribution to the House. We 
should not write people off because they have come to an 
arbitrary point set some years ago. Let us make sure that people, 
if they want to, can continue to fulfil their aspirations.
<P>
	We want to give this country long term tax relief which will 
help seniors and all Canadians. Seniors are just as hard hit as 
anybody by high taxes. We have to move away from a 
government and a system that really does encourage growth in 
taxes. To do that, we need some accountability in the system. 
Maybe that could be a discussion for another day.
<P>
	Of course, we have talked about our registered personal 
security plans. That is something we can talk about in more 
detail when we have some time.
<P>
	We have talked about empowering families, strengthening the 
capacity of families to care for themselves and their dependants 
with tax relief and tax reform. We would like to see child care 
assistance come in a neutral form so that people themselves can 
decide what kind of child care they want.
<P>
	I want to make a strong point. We are calling for a national 
registry so that people who have dodged their obligations to 
their families, those who are supposed to be making child 
support payments but have somehow dodged them will be 
eventually tracked down and forced to pay up.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I am proud to say that my office has helped track down a lot of 
deadbeat spouses. Eventually these people have had to pay up. 
They have to pay the money back to their children through their 
ex-spouses.
<P>
	The government has really not moved quickly enough in this 
area, although it has been in power for about 16 months. We very 
strongly advocate having a meeting with the provinces to work 
with them to put that registry in place. It is absolutely critical. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars out there are not getting to the 
children who really need the money. We are going to push very 
hard for that.
<P>
	As we have mentioned before, we do have our RPS plan which 
we are going to consult with Canadians on and hopefully, 
eventually put into place. It would be a way to give some power 
back to families and allow them to provide for themselves.
<P>
	We want to empower the unemployed and the job creators. I 
want to talk a little bit about the five-R jobs plan Reform has 
come up with. It is radically different from what the government 
has proposed in its infrastructure program.
<P>
	We are proposing to reduce and eliminate the federal debt and 
deficit. We are proposing to relieve Canadians of their 
oppressive tax burden. We are proposing to restore labour 
market 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9917"> 9917 </A></B>
<P>
efficiency and reduce social program dependency. We wish to 
remove barriers to internal and external trade. We want to renew 
Canada's physical and intellectual infrastructure. Those are the 
five steps we would take to get Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We could talk for a long time about these issues, but I know 
my time is up. I encourage the government to move quickly to 
establish a point at which it will reduce the deficit to zero and 
balance the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
speech by the hon. member. He was raving on about doom and 
gloom and negative things. I did not hear him speak at any time 
of the positive things this government has done since taking 
power.
<P>
	I did not hear him talk about the fact that Canada for the first 
time in 10 years has led the industrialized world in terms of 
economic growth. I did not hear the hon. member talk about the 
fact that in a matter of one year and four months this government 
has created more jobs than the previous government did over a 
period of 10 years.
<P>
	I did not hear the hon. member talk about all the progressive 
initiatives this government is taking in terms of embarking on 
major reforms, the foreign policy reforms, the social program 
reforms, the tax reforms. There are all of the major initiatives 
the government has taken on in order to look at the kinds of 
programs the federal government is suited to offer versus the 
provincial governments.
<P>
	I did not hear the member talk about the infrastructure 
program this government has put in place. Municipalities from 
coast to coast have endorsed it and have spoken positively about 
it. People have seen positive things coming out of it.
<P>
	I also did not hear the member congratulate the government 
on the fact that for the first time in a matter of 10 years this 
government will meet its deficit goals.
<P>
	The business community is fed up with this negativism. The 
business community tells us day in and day out that it wants 
positive talk. It wants us to stop talking negatively. When will 
my colleagues in the Reform Party stop talking about the doom 
and gloom?
<P>
	I will read a quote from a newspaper in Alberta where some of 
my colleagues were elected. The February 7 Edmonton Journal 
talks about the tax revolt which is being led by the Reform Party 
and states: ``That is why the tax revolt incited by Manning and 
played out by the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation has the reek 
of raw manipulation about it. It is a classic case of setting up a 
straw man, knocking it over and savouring the victory. Instead 
of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the hon. member 
subscribes to these conspiracy theories that the Reform Party 
has created the tax revolt. He should give Canadians more 
credit.
<P>
	There are a lot of people out there who are vitally concerned 
about the state of this country's economy. They are vitally 
concerned about the fact that they are being taxed to death. We 
did not have to invite people to talk about this issue. When the 
government was floating trial balloons about RRSPs there were 
many letters that came to the finance minister to tell him to get 
the government's hands off their wallets. We did not have to do 
that.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has talked about the fact that the 
country is leading the world in economic growth. What he did 
not say is it is because of the people in this country. It is not 
because of the government. He said the government has done 
this. He said the government has created jobs. Government does 
not create jobs. It was small businesses that created jobs. It was 
not because of the government, it was in spite of the 
government.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary talked a bit about the new 
initiatives that the government is taking, social program reform. 
That is a laugh. Even the human resources development minister 
admitted on national TV that it was dead, as dead as the dodo. 
That was a few days before the social program committee had to 
report. For crying out loud, the fact that it has started on an 
initiative is no guarantee it is going anywhere and that has 
certainly been the case with social program reform.
<P>
	The infrastructure program that he referred to has given 
Canada some boccie courts in Toronto, a canoe museum in the 
Prime Minister's riding, another $6 billion in debt. There is no 
doubt about that.
<P>
	There have been many things that the government has done, 
but let us not believe for a moment that they have been positive. 
They have added to our debt. They have contributed to the 
concerns that taxpayers and investors have around the world. 
That is why this government has been assailed by investors and 
by taxpayers over the last couple of weeks. If the member doubts 
me, pick up the newspaper and take a look.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the 
member. I cannot get over the fact that the member would try to 
compare the RRSP system, which is essentially a government 
created system, not for a large number of Canadians, with the 
Canada pension plan which is something that every Canadian 
has access to. It is probably only about 40 per cent of Canadians 
who have even the ability to participate in an RRSP plan.
<P>
	I want to challenge the member on one particular program of 
government that I personally am very proud of, 
multiculturalism. I happen to believe that multiculturalism is 
one the jewels 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9918"> 9918 </A></B>
<P>
of this country and  because of people being very frivolous with 
it we are about to lose it.
<P>
	For over 20 years, since 1971, we invested, promoted and 
encouraged Canadians to preserve their language and culture of 
origin. Today because of that investment by Canadian taxpayers 
we are recognized as one of the greatest trading countries on the 
planet. One of the reasons we are and that we have that trading 
advantage is that we have people who have preserved their 
language and culture of origin and it has given us very special 
access to these lucrative markets all around the world. 
Multiculturalism has also made us a tourism asset which if we 
ever got our marketing act together could be another envy of the 
world.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party should be very careful when it is 
criticizing these programs and just wants to sweep them away. 
Renew them, eliminate waste, fiscal discipline, I support all of 
that. We would be absolute crazies if we did anything to take 
away our multiculturalism policy which is the envy right now. 
The United States is now in the process of spending billions of 
dollars to try to promote a multicultural reality because it had its 
melting pot theory. We were so far ahead of it and the Reform 
Party has missed the whole point.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. parliamentary 
secretary must have been very discouraged when his own 
minister of multiculturalism acknowledged publicly that we 
have no Canadian heritage.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about some of the things the 
parliamentary secretary said. He said that we should have 
multiculturalism so people will preserve their language and they 
can use that for trade. I have more faith in people than that. I 
think there are people who have always preserved their language 
so they could trade.
<P>
	It is crazy to suggest that since 1971 there has been some huge 
jump in the amount of people who are preserving their languages 
so they can trade around the world. I do not have the statistics 
but I would love to see the statistics. I think I could convince the 
hon. member across the way that we did not need to spend $25 
million a year for the past many years to encourage people to do 
that.
<P>
	I think people are proud enough of their own heritage and that 
they will continue to preserve their own heritage at their own 
expense, without having some government program run by 
people who think they know better than individuals themselves 
what their lives should be like. That is crazy. It is time to give 
people some credit for being able to run their own lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in this debate. This morning I had an 
opportunity to pick up a copy of the Reform Party's taxpayers' 
budget, a plan to balance the federal budget.
<P>
	I thought it was very appropriate that today in question period 
the finance minister was able to rise in his place and with only a 
very short period of time to look at this advise the Reform Party 
this plan would not balance the federal budget. He went on to 
explain why.
<P>
	I want to give a few comments about what this document 
really means. It is important that the Reform Party has now put 
on the table what it really had in mind, the details it left out when 
it presented its balanced budget program to the finance 
committee last fall. It laid out $10 billion of cuts on non-social 
program spending, which only added up to $9 billion, showing 
the accuracy of the information it was given.
<P>
	It did not tell Canadians about the social program side of it. It 
is only fair to let Canadians know now. I appreciate the Reform 
Party is now letting Canadians know what its real agenda is. 
Canadians should know its real agenda.
<P>
	If you are on a guaranteed income supplement, the Reform 
Party is out to get you. If you are on old age security, the Reform 
Party is out to get you. If you are receiving Canada pension plan, 
the Reform Party is out to get you. If you are receiving health 
care benefits, the Reform Party is out to get you. If you are on 
socially assisted housing, the cuts in the CMHC, the Reform 
Party is out to get you. If you are on unemployment 
insurance-read the document-the Reform Party is now out to 
get you.
<P>
	I had an opportunity to review the document this morning. It 
is quite simply an incomplete document. There is no 
information on the economic impact of the proposed cuts. It is 
unclear which programs are going to be cut and the numbers it 
will cut from several government programs are not there.
<P>
	The leader of the third party admitted it this morning in the 
press conference. He did not have the numbers and details to 
support the numbers. It was simply an arithmetic exercise the 
Reform Party went through to say it can come up with $25 
billion.
<P>
	It did not cost out the impact of those cuts. It did not even take 
into account many fundamental assumptions that are necessary 
in preparing a budget. It is not being honest with the Canadian 
public. It is not telling Canadians the true impact of the 
proposals on seniors. It is not telling Canadians the truth.
<P>
	It does not take into account we have a growing number of 
seniors. It does not take into account which seniors will be 
affected by the proposed $3 billion in cuts. Rents for seniors will 
be impacted if CMHC is privatized. It did not say how much. It 
did not care about seniors when it did this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9919"> 9919 </A></B>
<P>
	During question period there was quite a debate going on 
about the word compassion. I can say in all sincerity that there 
is no compassion in this document. Slash and burn is the title 
of this document. The Reform budget is based on a philosophy 
that says families and charities should be the ones to take the 
burden for social programs. The Reform Party just wants to 
second the responsibility for these important programs to 
families and to charities that already are stretched to the limit.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	How many families can afford personal insurance RRSPs? 
Reformers are proposing that Canadians set up some sort of 
quasi-RRSP to provide for their own unemployment benefits, 
their own education, their own retirement and for their own 
non-essential health care.
<P>
	Today most Canadians cannot even afford to contribute to 
RRSPs and yet the Reform Party is saying it can eliminate old 
age security, the Canada pension plan, all of these things that the 
government does. All it has to do is let people contribute to 
RRSPs. This is not clear thinking at all. Reformers are out of 
touch with Canadians and out of touch with the basic 
communities.
<P>
	The Reform budget includes a two tier health system, the 
slash and burn to our health care system. It is unbelievable. 
There is a 25 per cent cut in transfers to the provinces. There is a 
proposed reduction in international aid. There is no question 
that there may be some cuts there but the Reform Party fails to 
realize the importance of international aid as it is tied into the 
promotion of our international trade which is a major source of 
new economic growth.
<P>
	The Reform Party has not addressed the accumulative impact 
on the regions of Canada, the cuts in equalization payments that 
it is proposing, the regional development and support programs 
to industry. There is not one detail as to the impact of those cuts. 
Simply we can cut the spending and they do not do anything 
anyway so the cuts will have no impact. That is fundamentally 
wrong.
<P>
	What are the main features? Reform has said it is going to cut 
$10 billion out of government operations and non-social 
program spending. This is the same or similar to the report of the 
finance committee of the House of Commons. These are the 
things that were dealt with, the business subsidies, et cetera. I do 
not think there is much argument there. However, the key 
component that was missing was the component with regard to 
the social programs and that is where it is going to cut $15 
billion out of social security spending, including $3 billion from 
the elderly, $3.4 billion from unemployment insurance and $6.6 
billion from transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	Let me deal very briefly with elderly benefits. Reformers are 
talking about a $3 billion cut. However, if one takes into account 
population growth and indexation, the real cut they would have 
to make is something like $5 billion. They have not taken into 
account the fact that we do have an aging population and  that 
there will be more people demanding those benefits presently 
being offered. That has not been taken into account. That is a 
fundamental flaw in the entire document.
<P>
	In addition, the programs include income thresholds and age 
requirements. I think the Minister of Finance today in question 
period basically laid out that if one were receiving old age 
security, under the savings that the Reformers are proposing in 
their plan the threshold for clawback would be something like 
$11,000. That means people who are receiving GIS would all of 
a sudden not be getting old age security.
<P>
	This slash and burn and trash people is the kind of thing that 
Canadians should know about, the vision and the plans that the 
Reform Party has for Canadians. The Reform Party is out to get 
you is the message this document shows.
<P>
	I wanted to talk very briefly about UI reform. Reformers said 
they would eliminate regionally extended benefits, lengthen 
work requirements and shorten the benefit entitlements to lower 
benefit payouts for repeat users with each additional claim. 
Reformers count the $3.4 billion benefit reduction to the deficit 
because they could not let premium rates go down but rather 
they would run up a huge-estimated at around a $12 
billion-accumulative surplus on the UI account until the 
overall budget deficit is eliminated.
<P>
	This kind of mathematics is simply numbers. There is no 
substance, no vision, no explanation and no detail to the 
impacts. There is no compassion in this document at all.
<P>
	What about the transfers to the provinces? Reformers are 
going to lower cash transfers under the EPF and the CAP but 
they are also going to transfer additional tax points.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	In question period today the finance minister pointed out very 
succinctly that you cannot have it both ways. Revenue is going 
to be impaired simply because of the transfer. Sure it is in there. 
It is in there to show the arithmetic works but if you do not take 
all the components into account, the budget will not balance. 
The Reform Party has not carefully managed the revenue stream 
that it is going to need.
<P>
	The $3 billion reduction in equalization would be a massive 
attack on the poorest provinces. Regional differences do not 
matter. The Reform Party represents Alberta. It does not care 
about the maritimes. It does not care about Newfoundland. It 
does not care about Quebec. All it cares about is, we can do it 
ourselves and why can you not?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9920"> 9920 </A></B>
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons have to speak on behalf 
of all Canadians. We have to have a national vision, a Canadian 
vision. We have to speak on behalf of all Canadians, not just 
on behalf of our own regional interests.
<P>
	The conclusion I reached in going over this document is that it 
is terribly vague but it does show some very important points, 
the most important of which is the absolute attack on seniors, on 
the elderly, on those who are in most need in our society. That to 
me represents what is contained in this document that the 
Reform Party says is going to balance the budget. Let us look at 
some of the facts.
<P>
	Canada's growth rate in the last year was 4.25 per cent, the 
highest in the G-7. The OECD predicts that Canada will 
continue to lead the industrial world for the next two years. Real 
exports are up. The Conference Board found a positive boost in 
investment, with 81 per cent of firms planning more investment.
<P>
	Over 450,000 new jobs have been created since the 
government took over. The 1994 budget laid the foundation. 
Today the Minister of Finance announced that next Monday, 
February 27 he will present the next budget for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	There we will see how a government shows compassion and 
also meets its fiscal targets of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the 
third year and lays the foundation for the next two-year cycle to 
bring Canada's budget into balance.
<P>
	That is what the Liberal Party stands for, not slash and trash, 
particularly seniors and those most in need in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
scared the Liberals are of the Reform Party when they make 
absolutely outstanding comments. This speech is just 
absolutely, totally off the wall.
<P>
	As I said to another member from the southern Toronto area, 
my family and the families of the people within our party have 
seniors who we are concerned about. We are concerned that this 
government is destroying the ability of government to fund the 
social programs on which they depend.
<P>
	He says about us: ``You are just doing to slash and burn, you 
are going to trash seniors''. I cannot imagine the fear that there 
must be within the Liberal Party that finally there is a party that 
is prepared to stand up and expose government overspending, 
expose its inability to get spending under control. Social 
programs are under threat from the Liberal government.
<P>
	I do not see anything positive about coming into the House 
and characterizing Reform members as being uncaring and not 
worried about social programs. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. In fact, that is the reason why we are here. That is the 
reason why we made such an effort today. We want Canadians to 
have an  opportunity to see an alternative to the silliness that is 
presently going on.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member a question. I know he has an accounting 
background and must be able to read a balance sheet. Surely he 
must know that while revenue is growing at a rate of 3.3 per cent, 
debt is growing at a rate of 10.3 per cent. The 7 per cent spread is 
growing. Every single solitary dollar of the $110 million that we 
borrow today is going to pay interest on the money we have 
already borrowed. We are going deeper and deeper into the hole.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member can tell us, as a professional 
accountant, how in the world can you possibly run a balance 
sheet when you are going into debt twice as fast as you collect 
revenue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member always talks as if 
the Reform Party would not increase the debt over the period 
that it is talking about. It never talks about how much it would 
increase the debt in implementing its plan.
<P>
	Let me read from the Reform Party's document. This is what 
that party is going to do to seniors. To Canada Mortgage and 
Housing it proposes a 24 per cent cut. Does that party not believe 
that seniors require assisted housing? If we look at seniors' 
benefits, there is a 15 per cent cut in all of their benefits. Clearly 
those cuts would be at the lower end where people can least 
afford it. To unemployment insurance it proposes a 22 per cent 
cut, and a 34 per cent cut in welfare.
<P>
	I do not have to go on. Simply look at the numbers. We can see 
that this document, which was prepared by the third party, 
represents an attack on Canadians who are the most in need.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in this life if you do not make a choice, someone will make it for 
you. That is what is happening to that motley crew over there.
<P>
	The government sounds like an opposition party, not a leading 
party. My colleague has done nothing but critique the Reform's 
proposals. The difficulty that I am having here is, what is the 
Liberal Party doing?
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member this. How much debt will 
the Liberals have incurred since taking office to the end of their 
mandate?
<P>
	The second part of the question is: At the end of the mandate I 
believe the Liberal Party will be overspending by approximately 
$26 billion a year. We say zero. Which is better for Canadians in 
the long run?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government election campaign 
was run in October 1993 on a platform which said that it would 
achieve 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the third year of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9921"> 9921 </A></B>
<P>
mandate. The Minister of Finance has brought down a budget. 
We are on track.
<P>
	If members noticed, the Minister of Finance said today that 
not only are we going to meet this year's deficit target, we will 
do substantially better. I think that is important.
<P>
	The hon. member asked a very important question. What 
would be better, zero or 25? It is the same question, the answer to 
which is basically that the operation was a success but the 
patient died. That is what the Reform Party is proposing. It is 
proposing an operation that will get us to zero, but at the same 
time Canada's social programs will die.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Now we will get some intelligent comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> You may not say that 
by the time I-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member was not in the 
Chamber earlier when I asked members to please put their 
remarks to the Chair. Anytime the word ``you'' is to be used it is 
to refer to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
sorry. I will make sure that I do that for the remainder of my 10 
minutes.
<P>
	I read most of this document today. My initial reaction was 
the following. I thought that the Reform Party had a lot of 
courage to put forward such a comprehensive document just 
before the budget. It is a great debating tool. The Reform Party 
will no doubt, as it will discover, face a lot of criticism for the 
flaws which are in it.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	However, the essence of this Chamber is to exchange and to 
debate ideas. We come here with different backgrounds and 
ideologies. Obviously there are a lot of things in this document 
that I would not support. However it will be useful for me when 
constituents come with your proposal. I may be able to point out 
some of the good things, while showing some of your flaws.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member who said he would not use 
the word you has used it twice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Three times and you 
are out. I am too close to the Reform Party, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	One of the reasons I was profoundly disappointed in this 
document was that members of the Reform Party campaigned on 
comprehensive tax reform during the last election. They 
campaigned on restructuring the tax acts. It is no secret to 
members that I was delighted when there were 40-odd members 
returned to the House who shared-at least I thought they 
shared-my view, as do many other members on this side of the 
House that it is time to overhaul the entire personal and 
corporate income tax structure.
<P>
	Canadians should know that in this document the only 
reference to proposals for a taxpayer protection act are one page, 
on pages 53 and 54. Canadians believed the Reform Party was 
truly committed to tax reform. In a document of 55 pages, to 
only have one page devoted to tax reform is not a serious effort.
<P>
	It is a serious flaw in the document because I happen to 
believe, and I know a lot of Reform members believe, that 
Canadians are frustrated with the current tax acts. The complex 
tax system we have is one of the reasons why people are putting 
money offshore. It is one of the reasons we have such a large 
underground economy. It is one of the reasons we have a lot of 
entrepreneurs who are not investing in creating jobs. On that 
issue I say that the paper prepared today, the taxpayers' budget, 
is misleading and it falls short.
<P>
	There is another thing that concerns me about this debate in 
total today. It is this total preoccupation with the federal deficit. 
I believe, as all members believe, that the deficit must be dealt 
with. I cannot imagine a member standing up anywhere saying 
that the deficit is not important.
<P>
	We have had enough debates on the federal deficit and the 
fiscal discipline side of this equation. We are not talking about 
the growth side. How are we going to put 2.2 million Canadians 
back to work? I wish we would spend more time speaking back 
and forth and I think Canadians would like to see more debate in 
the House back and forth on how we can put people back to 
work.
<P>
	I want to be very specific about what I mean. My colleague 
from Waterloo handed me a document he received today, a 
debating document called ``The Working Nation''. This is a 
policy paper on policies and programs from the Australian 
government.
<P>
	The Australians have an idea that I would like to share with 
members and all Canadians today. It is called the job compact. 
This is an idea they are debating in their House right now. The 
job compact will apply to all those who have been in receipt of a 
job search or a new start allowance for 18 months or more. A job 
compact will include more intensive case management, training 
and support to ensure the unemployed person is job-ready, a job 
for six to twelve months primarily in the private sector, a 
training wage which combines employment with training, 
leading to recognized and transferable skills. New work 
opportunities will encourage local proposals for employment 
generation, especially in regions where other employment 
opportunities are limited. Intensive job search assistance and 
referral to suitable vacancies at the end of the job compact 
maximizes employment outcomes for those assisted. There will 
be stronger penalties for job seekers who do not meet their 
obligations under the job compact. The paper goes on to 
describe how jobs will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9922"> 9922 </A></B>
<P>
obtained and how employers will be further encouraged to 
consider the abilities of long term unemployed, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	That is a specific idea the government is currently putting 
forward to give every unemployed Australian a chance to get 
back to work. That is the kind of thing I personally wish we 
could debate in the House. We have talked enough about the 
deficit and the debt.
<P>
	When all is said and done and the budget comes out next 
week, I am sure all the things in the red book will be there. 
However we still have to face the challenge right away of getting 
those people back to work. That is what I think is missing in the 
debate.
<P>
	The whole notion of human deficit is very important. As our 
human deficit grows eventually it will hit us like a ton of bricks. 
There are 700,000 university trained and educated young people 
who cannot find work. That is crazy. That is what I believe our 
focus should be on.
<P>
	I want to expand my point about human deficit. It is the reason 
we have a fiscal framework right now that is not very healthy. 
Not only are there unemployment costs and health care costs but 
there are all kinds of potential loss.
<P>
	My appeal to the opposition parties is that they have now 
made their point about the federal deficit and the debt. I believe 
all members of the House understand it well. I am confident, as I 
said earlier, the Minister of Finance will bring testimony to that 
realization next week.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to members of the House that our 
preoccupation in the next 60 or 90 days should be on identifying 
the priorities and government instruments we can use to 
stimulate entrepreneurship and to market the country to get the 
human deficit under control. Let us change our language from 
federal deficit to human deficit and let us attack it next.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated 
the parliamentary secretary's speech. He certainly gives a good 
perspective.
<P>
	We are concerned about the people of Canada. The real 
response to his intervention is not whether we want to look after 
the people but rather how to do it. The question arises: Is it good 
for jobs in the country to have the government spend 50 per cent 
of our money?
<P>
	To me the answer is obviously no. It would be much better for 
the government to spend less of our money and to allow 
individuals to promote and improve themselves in job situations 
because the private enterprise system is working much better. 
That is one of our main points of debate.
<P>
	I want to ask the parliamentary secretary a very difficult 
question. He may choose to talk around it instead of answering 
it, in which case I will assume that either he does not want to 
answer it because it is embarrassing to him to be on that side of 
the House and to answer it, or he may be equivocating and does 
not know. I do not know what he will say. However if he chooses 
to answer I would be very pleased.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The item of debate today is whether the 3 per cent of GDP is 
an adequate target. I am really quite convinced that it would be 
best if we eliminated deficit spending and stopped putting the 
government and the people more and more into debt.
<P>
	Is 3 per cent an adequate target? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think that is such a complicated question. The absolute hope and 
desire of every member of the House would be to go beyond the 
3 per cent and eventually eliminate the deficit. If the member 
gave us some magical way in which we could eliminate the 
deficit instantly, Mr. Speaker, do you think we would not want to 
do it?
<P>
	I want to make another point. We are debating priorities in the 
House right now. I would like to focus on one that I believe in 
passionately. Right now the Government of Canada invests $50 
million in tourism marketing for all of Canada; we spend $50 
million to promote Canada all over the world. Nike shoes spends 
$200 million in the United States of America.
<P>
	As a government priority I believe it would be good not just to 
spend $50 million of Canadian taxpayers' money promoting 
Canada and filling our hotel rooms, our theatres and our 
restaurants. I believe it would be a worthwhile tax expenditure 
to spend five times that amount because it would be money we 
would get back in 90 or 120 days. The job creation that could 
result would be incalculable in the short term.
<P>
	There is an ideological difference between us and the Reform 
Party. I do not believe the private sector alone can do all these 
things well. There are times when government has to intervene.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the parliamentary secretary for his speech today. We are down to 
discussing differences of opinion rather than getting involved 
with who loves their mother more. That is very helpful.
<P>
	I also agree with him that we need some major tax revision. 
We were looking at the process and have come forward with a 
substantial difference between the way the Liberals think about 
government and the way we believe Canadians want to think 
about government. We had to do a complete shift before we 
could come up with these numbers.
<P>
	I would like to run these assumptions on jobs by the 
parliamentary secretary. The Liberal flawed assumption on jobs 
is that governments can solve the unemployment problem 
through public spending. The consequences are that government 
spend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9923"> 9923 </A></B>
<P>
ing is now at an all time high. Yet over a million people are still 
unemployed or underemployed.
<P>
	By comparison, the Reform Party believes that the private 
sector and not the government is the engine of job creation in 
Canada. The government's role is to create a healthy economic 
climate by eliminating the deficit, stabilizing and reducing 
taxes, and reducing bureaucratic regulation and trade barriers. 
The result is that we would have significant increases in private 
job sector creation. Does the member agree?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
government does not create jobs. Government creates an 
environment that accelerates job creation potential.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that we agree with everything the 
member said. No one has accelerated privatization and 
offloaded government instruments after using up public policy 
usefulness faster than the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	We are not trying to build empires. We are working rigorously 
and quickly in many respects to try to do some of the things the 
member cited.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to debate the subject of whether the 3 per cent of 
GDP is acceptable as a target in reducing the deficit. My answer 
to the question is no, it is not acceptable. It is unacceptable for a 
number of reasons, but before getting into my more formal 
remarks I wish to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry. Once again he has demonstrated that there 
is at least one member on the other side of the House who 
actually reads some of the material we present.
<P>
	You are the parliamentary secretary of industry and not of 
transport. I am so happy the minister-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is a highly 
experienced member like his predecessor. I ask him to watch his 
use of the word ``you''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to make it 
absolutely clear that I was speaking to the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry and not transport. I am very 
honoured the Minister of Transport is in his place this afternoon.
<P>
	There are a couple of reasons I believe the 3 per cent of the 
GDP as a deficit is unacceptable. First, I was absolutely amazed 
to think of where that 3 per cent of the GDP came from. The 
following question was asked in the House: ``Why is 3 per cent 
such a reasonable goal?'' The Prime Minister answered at that 
point, I believe it was April 11, 1994, by saying: ``We have a 
goal that is achievable to reduce the deficit in relation to GDP to 
3 per cent per year. This goal is very reasonable because 3 per 
cent of the GDP is the requirement for any country to qualify in 
Europe to use the new currency called the ECU. If it is good 
enough for all countries in Europe to have that goal it should be 
good enough for Canada''.
<P>
	Why is that a problem? Is is because Europe has a totally 
different geography. The economies of the countries making up 
the European community are very different. The total debt 
structure is very different. The demographic distribution of 
population is very different. Their natural resource base is very 
different. Why is it that should apply it to our country?
<P>
	If it is good enough for them it ought to be good enough for us 
only if everything else is equal. Is it really relevant in that 
situation? I could not help but think of an analogy in our armed 
services. I thought about the uniforms some of our generals 
wear. It seemed to me it was something like going to the tailor 
and saying: ``If you want to make a good suit for the Prime 
Minister, go measure him really well. If the Prime Minister fits 
the suit it will automatically fit the Minister of Finance''. 
Nothing could be more ridiculous than accepting for Canada a 
similar goal that is set somewhere else and saying that it should 
be ours as well unless everything else is the same.
<P>
	Why do we not have a goal made in Canada for Canadians by 
Canada's government? That has not happened.
<P>
	Second, this goal is not acceptable because it is financially 
inadequate. There is a principle that all governments should 
observe: governments should not be allowed to spend what 
taxpayers are not prepared to pay for. The violation of that 
principle has put us into the mess we are in today. For the last 30 
years Canada's expenditures have exceeded revenues. Canada's 
debt has risen exponentially in the last few years.
<P>
	Third, foreign investors who hold about 40 per cent of 
Canada's debt are becoming concerned that Canada will not be 
able to service its debt. It is not that they are so worried about 
paying the principal of the debt but they are concerned about 
being able to service it, that is paying the interest on it.
<P>
	I am sure it comes as no surprise to anyone in the House that 
the deficit on an annual basis is made up of the interest payments 
on the principal of our debt.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	There may be those in this House who suggest that the debt 
problem is really that of more than one level of government. It 
certainly is.
<P>
	I go back to the ECU. That 3 per cent GDP figure includes all 
debt of a country, not just the federal debt. In Canada we are 
looking at 3 per cent of the federal debt and that is not sufficient.
<P>
	The suggestion is also made that somehow there is support in 
the economic community or in the business community for that 
level. I want to refer to October 18, 1994 when the Prime 
Minister said: ``We have faced up to our responsibilities. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9924"> 9924 </A></B>
<P>
were the only political party that put in writing in our red book 
exactly how we would achieve our objective. The financial 
community thinks that it is realistic and it is a realistic 
objective. A deficit of  3 per cent of the gross national product is 
the level required in Europe for all countries in the European 
community to qualify for the new European currency''.
<P>
	The justification is that our business community supports 
that. I simply refer to the suggestion that our credit rating will be 
dropped down. We have had since then a devaluation of the 
Canadian dollar. We have had an increase in our interest rates. 
Also I draw members' attention to the situation in November 
1994 when foreigners took a net $2.2 billion out of our country. 
Foreign investors reduced their holdings of Canadian bonds by 
$4.9 billion, a record for a single month.
<P>
	Some other points to observe are that by September 1994 
Nomura Securities Canada Inc. said that eight of the largest 
Japanese life insurance companies had cut their Canadian dollar 
exposure by 60 per cent from the previous year's level, 
reflecting mainly concerns over currency losses. The Canadian 
dollar decreased in value while the yen increased in value.
<P>
	The London based Warburg Asset Management director Tom 
Berger says that Canadian bonds because of the debtload no 
longer make up core holding in his portfolio but may be used 
opportunistically on a short term basis.
<P>
	Further evidence comes from Michel Doucet, economist for 
the National Bank, who observed that foreigners sold $3.4 
billion of Canadian bonds in the secondary market in November 
1994 alone reflects a loss of confidence in Canadian bonds.
<P>
	One of the reasons investors are worried is that the debt is 
rising faster than the economy. Particularly they are worried that 
the government will relax its hold on inflation targets and that 
the currency will devalue as a result.
<P>
	There are serious implications of the Moody's situation. I 
think it was two days ago that the president of Sun Life indicated 
that there is enough discomfort by that sort of thing happening 
that we rebegin to question whether the superintendent of 
financial institutions through the office of the superintendent of 
financial institutions is inadequate to control and monitor 
meaningfully the financial institutions of Canada.
<P>
	All we need to do here is milk the special white paper that was 
introduced last week by the secretary of state for finance. It is 
worthy to note as well that nothing has been said about the 
implications of the goal for our chartered banks and other 
deposit taking institutions of those kinds of downgradings.
<P>
	Let us not forget the billions of dollars that are found in 
RRSPs, GICs and other debt instruments. With one stroke of the 
pen to decrease the value of the Canadian dollar, a lot of damage 
can be done to the savings of Canadians.
<P>
	There is a third reason this is an inadequate target. It 
guarantees further indebtedness. At the rate of $25 billion per 
year, that means that there will be a $100 billion addition to our 
debt every four years.
<P>
	It is already growing faster than the rate of the GDP. That 
means it is as if the value of one's house were going down while 
the cost of one's mortgage was going up, a formula for disaster.
<P>
	Let us review some of the recent experiences with reducing 
the deficit as a proportion of GDP. In 1991 the deficit was 6.6 per 
cent of the GDP. In 1992 it was 9.1 per cent. In 1993 it was 7.1 
per cent and in 1994 it was 6.5 per cent.
<P>
	From that vantage point alone it seems a bit far fetched that all 
of a sudden we are going to get to 3 per cent. Canada's economy 
has been strong because the U.S. economy has been strong.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	There are now some pretty clear indications that the prospect 
of the U.S. economy continuing to roll along is not going to 
happen but that it is slowing down. It is likely that we are 
nearing the end of the current North American business cycle. 
That will make it increasingly difficult for the Minister of 
Finance to reach the goals he has set.
<P>
	Three years have been wasted. It should be no surprise 
whatsoever that business leaders and credit rating agencies have 
difficulty believing that the minister is serious about dealing 
with the deficit.
<P>
	The other part of the problem is the composition of the 
contemporary welfare state. Our welfare state works at the 
present time so that deficits rise when recessions hit and fall 
when the economy grows. Let us look at this in more detail.
<P>
	Canada's deficit soared nearly 7 per cent of GDP after the 
1981-82 recession but was under 3 per cent of GDP in 1988-89 
after several years of solid growth.
<P>
	This time in this increase the economy has been growing since 
1992 but because of Ottawa's position of inaction we have seen 
no improvement in the deficit and that is where the problem is. It 
affects the levels of all governments to borrow for their needs 
for capital expenditures such as roads, schools and things of that 
sort. There will always be a need to borrow money. If our credit 
rating drops down it will impact our ability to do so.
<P>
	If we use our credit to finance current expenditures for 
education, health and welfare we will be unable to finance those 
projects that are in themselves revenue generating. That 
situation compounds a difficult situation into an escalating and 
worse position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9925"> 9925 </A></B>
<P>
	I think this particular goal is deceptive. It sounds so good 
to be able to say 3 per cent of GDP. It is confidence 
generating-they have a number, they have to be right. The 
result is that the number, as we have indicated previously, 
cannot improve the long term health of our financial position 
because it will increase the debt of our country.
<P>
	It is illusionary. The deficit will never be eliminated by a goal 
where the deficit is a proportion of the GDP. It means a perpetual 
deficit and the accumulation of more debt.
<P>
	It transfers more of our responsibility not to ourselves but to 
future generations, in particular our children and our 
grandchildren. Instead of providing them with a more promising 
future we are saying they are going to pay more and more for the 
lifestyle that we ourselves were not prepared to pay for.
<P>
	It reduces the attractiveness of Canada as a place in which to 
invest money. Another reason why I believe this particular goal 
is inadequate is that it is manipulative. It creates the illusion as 
if something is being done when very little is being done that 
would instil confidence in investors and credit rating agencies.
<P>
	While Canadians on the one hand are urged to plan for their 
retirement, their children's education and so on, it is clearly 
known by the Minister of Finance that in pursuing this particular 
course the government's inaction will erode the future 
purchasing power of those savings through inflation and 
increased taxes.
<P>
	Thus what appeared to be a very well planned RRSP turns out 
to be a mere existence under the new economic conditions. 
Canada pension plan contributions were said to be deposits for 
the future of the depositor so they could retire in comfort, but the 
legislative provisions for the investment of those funds 
mitigated against them. Many of the returns on those invested 
dollars were uncompetitive.
<P>
	For these reasons I believe that this particular goal is 
inadequate. It is inadequate because the target was chosen not 
for Canada but for another series of countries. The fact that it is a 
rolling goal over two years and so on is not acceptable, as we 
heard so aptly this afternoon. It is based on the goal that we are 
supposed to be able to continue to grow and develop when there 
is nothing in the history of Canada so far to indicate that will 
take place. It is inadequate because it is not an honest position of 
giving hope to future generations. It saddles them with the 
responsibility of paying for a lifestyle which they did not enjoy 
but which we did.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	That is a moral question as well. I believe that I should be held 
accountable and responsible for the things that I enjoy and the 
things that I want to do. I should not go to my children and say I 
want to drive a new car, I want to be able to do all of these things 
and they are going to pay for them.
<P>
	This goal is a disincentive not only for us if our taxes are 
going to increase, which I understand from the minister, not 
directly but indirectly that they will, but it is also a disincentive 
in the sense that it provides little or no hope for our young 
people who will look forward to an increasing burden of debt. Is 
that the legacy we want to leave them? No, that is not what we 
want to leave them.
<P>
	Much has been said this afternoon about compassion. The 
greatest compassion we can have is give to our young people the 
hope of living a better life than the one which we have enjoyed, 
to give them a tax burden which is less than ours, not greater 
than ours, one in which they will be able to initiate their own 
ingenuity, their own entrepreneurship, their own aggressiveness 
to be able to build a life which is self-satisfying and fulfilling, 
better than the one we have been able to give them.
<P>
	We have not been giving them the example of managing 
money successfully and effectively. We have given them the 
impression that government can answer all questions, 
government can do all things and government can give them 
jobs. The answer is that government can do none of those things. 
As the parliamentary secretary said so clearly, it creates the 
environment in which these things can happen. This goal 
destroys that environment. We must change that. We must stop 
that and bring about a deficit which will reach zero in three 
years. That is what our plan is. That is what our party stands for. 
That is true compassion.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway-China; the hon. member for 
Frontenac-agricultural subsidies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to refer to a specific section with regard to retirement 
in the documents presented today by the Reform Party. It says 
that many seniors express frustration at mandatory retirement. 
Despite the fact that seniors are healthier and living longer than 
ever before, many of them are legally obliged to stop 
functioning as productive members of the economy once they 
turn 65. To complicate matters further, federally run pension 
programs start paying benefits at age 65.
<P>
	Specifically, I would like to ask the hon. member if this means 
they are proposing to raise the age at which seniors are eligible 
to receive Canada pension plan and whether that is something 
which they propose to do instantaneously or phase in over a 
number of years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9926"> 9926 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two parts to the answer 
to that question. The difficulty lies not so much in seniors 
wanting to retire at age 65, but that it is mandatory that they 
do so.
<P>
	The important issue here is that there be flexibility and that no 
person would be required by law to retire at age 65. If they are 
healthy and willing to work beyond 65, they should have the 
opportunity to do so. They should also have the privilege to 
retire at age 65 if they choose to do that.
<P>
	The second part of the answer with respect to increasing the 
mandatory retirement age or the age at which benefits would cut 
in, that it seems to me came from a meeting at which a Liberal 
person made a statement somewhere in Ontario. There is 
nothing in this document that says that we will increase the age 
requirement of the mandatory retirement age.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Okanagan Centre opened up his debate by 
questioning our 3 per cent GDP target and spent almost 70 per 
cent of his time wondering whether we would achieve that 3 per 
cent GDP target.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	In his preamble the hon. member stated that the 3 per cent 
GDP target was arrived at by looking at an area on the map of the 
world because of geography, demographics and natural 
resources. It seems to me those same criteria apply even more so 
to Canada.
<P>
	In 1993 in terms of objectives, there was a party that had zero 
in five, another party that had zero in three, and another party 
that had three in three. Canadians spoke and said that a target of 
3 per cent of GDP was acceptable to them.
<P>
	I question the whole approach of the Reform Party today. 
Whenever we talk about the deficit, with each dollar we look at 
there is always one aspect we must remember as 
parliamentarians: there is a person, a human being behind that 
dollar. We are going to touch every single human being with the 
decisions we make.
<P>
	Yes, a 3 per cent GDP target may not be ambitious for 
financial institutions and others, but it is an interim target. It is 
something Canadians can hold on to dearly. Even if we achieve 
that target the Minister of Finance in his address to the finance 
committee admitted publicly that we must strive for the day 
when we will have a balanced budget.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member where in his party's platform do they 
see that compassion, that understanding for the human face that 
is behind every dollar? Their proposals go after the weakest 
provinces, after those on welfare, after the unemployed and after 
seniors. We must show compassion, as the hon. member said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to 
address the question of compassion. The greatest compassion 
we can give is that of hope for a better future. There will be no 
better demonstration of that than to give to the Canadian people 
a balanced budget with the hope of reduced taxes in the future. 
That is true compassion.
<P>
	The other part of compassion is to give to those who cannot 
look after themselves the wherewithal to look after themselves. 
If we analyse the alternative budget presented this morning, we 
will see very clearly as one of the major principles in the social 
programs that those who cannot look after themselves will be 
the very first to receive the social program benefits. Those who 
must be looked after will be looked after. That is true 
compassion.
<P>
	It is when we kick people who are down that we have no 
compassion. For people who can help themselves, we let them 
develop the strength and empower them so they can look after 
themselves. That is also compassion, to let them realize what 
they are capable of becoming. Then we look after those who 
cannot do that for themselves. That is true compassion and that 
is the human being behind the dollar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in our electoral red book, which became the action plan 
of the Liberal Party during the 1993 election, we proposed a 
holistic way to look at government.
<P>
	We proposed to the Canadian people that the basis of funding 
services and programs has to be money, and budgetary 
considerations have to be paramount. At the same time, we 
proposed and suggested that there are social responsibilities a 
government cannot avoid.
<P>
	We admit that previous government administrations, 
including Liberal governments, have built a huge debt for which 
we are now responsible. We have to attack that debt, reduce it, 
and reduce our huge deficit. At the same time, we suggested we 
cannot do so at the expense of the government's responsibility to 
look after social programs and all the various services only a 
government can give.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	What we proposed is the formula adopted by the European 
community of 3 per cent of GNP after three years, the reduction 
of our deficit to $25 billion. As we have said, naturally this is the 
first phase. We will have to go farther than this. We are all 
conscious of that. At the same time however, we are convinced 
that we cannot do so at the expense of our basic fundamental 
responsibilities as a government.
<P>
	My colleague from Vaudreuil put it very well. In all the 
equations, in all the formulas about deficit and debt reduction, 
people have to come first. People have to be the priority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9927"> 9927 </A></B>
<P>
	The basic argument we have with the Reform Party is not that 
we should attack the deficit and the debt, but how we should 
do it and the timeframe in which we should do it. Reform's 
formula is an instant formula: make the deficit disappear to 
zero within three years. Ours is gradual. Ours says we will reach 
an important target. It will take tremendous sacrifices on the 
part of Canadians as the budget will show next week. At the 
same time, we feel it is the only way to avoid the pitfall of 
sacrificing the services and social safety net that Canadians 
depend on.
<P>
	I was struck by the budget presented by the Reform Party. 
There are all kinds of footnotes and references to economists, 
chambers of commerce, and institutes of actuaries in Canada. 
All the references, perhaps bar one, are of an economic nature. I 
have not seen any references to books, to social activists, to 
social reformists, or to community groups that might present 
ideas. I have not seen any references to an environmental 
network that might also have a say in how the affairs of a country 
are run. It is purely a budget relating to dollars and cents, added 
up and subtracted as if people do not count, as if people do not 
exist.
<P>
	For example, there is a reference in the Reform Party's budget 
to the U.S. economy which has produced consistently less 
unemployment than Canada since the 1970s. One thing that is 
not pointed out which is pretty obvious to me is that the U.S. 
market contains a population of 260 million. It is a huge internal 
market whereas ours has barely 30 million people. The U.S. 
market and the U.S. economy are huge compared to ours, 10 
times the size of ours.
<P>
	At the same time the point the famous Reform budget does not 
make is that if the U.S. has a lower rate of unemployment, 
maybe it could also say that the U.S. has a lower rate of interest. 
What is not said is that every year, 30 million U.S. citizens go 
without proper health care because there is no universal health 
care in the United States.
<P>
	We can compare countries, but if we are to make a fair 
comparison, we have to do it on a holistic and comprehensive 
basis. We do not select only the bits that are suited for our own 
arguments.
<P>
	The Reform budget talks about Ireland and Denmark, but I 
noticed that it does not mention New Zealand, the latest 
experiment in fast track deficit and debt reduction. The New 
Zealanders decided that overnight Minister Douglas was going 
to wipe out the deficit, so they deregulated the financial 
markets. They cut the taxes for corporate and upper income 
earners by half.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	New Zealanders drastically cut public services. In one day 
alone they closed 75 post offices because they cost too much. 
They significantly reduced any infrastructure dollars given to 
towns and municipalities for sewers, road works and other 
different infrastructure projects.
<P>
	The result was that unemployment went from 4 per cent to 16 
per cent. They went from being a very peaceful and safe society 
to one which is now experiencing a lot of violent crime. Poverty 
rates went up 40 per cent. New Zealanders now have to pay huge 
user fees to use medical services. They have no universal health 
care any more.
<P>
	The amazing part is that this huge deficit reduction curve did 
not help. In fact it made life even more difficult and more 
painful.
<P>
	We are saying that yes, let us reduce the deficit and the debt 
but let us do so progressively, responsibly and intelligently.
<P>
	It strikes me that with this simplistic approach we can have a 
magic kingdom with this magic formula in three years according 
to the Reform Party. However, this magic kingdom I read about 
in its report is full of little conditions. I will just quote a few of 
them.
<P>
	In social programs, the details of such longer run reforms of 
the social programs still have to be worked out. Yes, Reformers 
still have to work out the programs.
<P>
	With regard to seniors and the famous tax back in old age 
security, the details of such a program requires further 
discussion with Canadians and seniors specifically. I would 
hope that if they have a tax back on seniors, they will discuss the 
details with Canadians and seniors specifically. Obviously they 
have not or otherwise they would not write it as such.
<P>
	In regard to seniors, the Reform Party says: ``We should 
abolish retirement at age 65''. I was part of a commission when I 
was in the Government of Quebec. One minister at the time 
when I was in opposition decided overnight to lift the retirement 
age at age 65. I remember questioning him as to whether he had 
actuarial figures to show what the impact of this was going to be. 
I asked him if he had any studies to show what the impact was 
going to be on young people who would not get a chance to be 
employed if there was no retirement of seniors.
<P>
	However, in the magic kingdom we just do this and retirement 
no longer happens at 65, regardless of the consequences to 
younger people who want to find a slot. I have a young daughter 
who is a teacher. In the first few years of her teaching life she 
cannot find a job because people do not retire at the top. 
However, Reform will do this and suddenly the magic has 
happened. Before proposing anything we have to know all our 
facts and figures.
<P>
	On page 46 of the Reform Party's plan it says it would also 
investigate the possibility of equalizing UI premiums for 
employees and employers rather than making employers bear a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9928"> 9928 </A></B>
<P>
heavier payroll burden. Reformers say they will investigate and 
then they tell us that their figures are watertight.
<P>
	Over the long term the Reform Party is investigating a number 
of options for the renewal of Canada's UI system. Reformers are 
still investigating a number of options for renewal of Canada's 
UI system yet they tell us with so much cockiness and assurance: 
``Oh yes, we are going to wipe that deficit to zero by a great 
magic. You can't but we can''.
<P>
	Reformers talk about the principles of social reform. The 
principles of social reform are to have families look after 
themselves. They want to put the accent on families. I am for 
that 100 per cent because I am a family man. Let us empower 
people in communities and I am with that too.
<P>
	In the simplistic way of looking at things, once Reformers 
have looked after families, once they have looked after 
empowerment, once they decide to only take care of the 
needy-they do not explain who the needy are, the needy 
according to the Reformers, I wonder who the real needy are 
according to them-then everything else will take care of itself.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I will give my own personal experience. I have a retarded son. 
For 20 years or so, I have worked in community groups relating 
to the intellectually handicapped. We built schools, we built 
pre-schools. We started with volunteer groups trying to get out 
of the glue, trying to raise funds by selling bricks for schools, 
holding lotteries and fund raising events. Eventually it was only 
through government programs that we were able to set up a 
proper network which gave the services that eventually enabled 
the intellectually handicapped to find a place in the sun, to 
integrate into society.
<P>
	Perhaps what the Reform Party does not want to accept is that 
we are an evolving society. Twenty or 30 years ago my son 
would have been kept hidden behind the bushes somewhere, but 
today people evolve. We have autistic children, we have 
severely handicapped children that go to schools because we 
have given them the means through expert help of finding a way 
to better themselves, to enhance their own personalities, their 
own beings.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party ignore the evolution of society. 
They think it is a static society. They talk about seniors as if we 
have a static group of seniors, whereas aging in Canada is 
happening at a rate which is exponential: to date something like 
12 per cent of the population in some areas, and tomorrow it is 
going to be 18 to 20 per cent. They do not provide for that. All 
the figures are static. We are going to make seniors carry on, 
working beyond 65. We will have a tax back on old age security 
and somehow we are going to retrieve all this money and the $17 
billion that is left we are going to distribute very evenly among 
all those that need it without saying how this criteria is going to 
be built.
<P>
	They do not talk about what is happening in a society that is 
fast evolving with problems that are immense. We never knew 
Alzheimer's 20 years ago. We never knew the tremendous rate 
of cancer in society, of AIDS. We have all sorts of fantastic 
problems to face today. They are so complex and require so 
much money, require expert services, that private institutions 
cannot give them. Only government can give them because only 
government has that responsibility to the people who need it 
most. Whether we like it or not, the private world is geared to 
profit motives mostly.
<P>
	What they do not say in their document which we say in our 
red book is that to all the problems of society, whether they be 
financial, whether they be educational, whether they be 
illiteracy, whether they be a social dysfunction in families, have 
root causes. We have to address the root causes of them.
<P>
	I do not see anything in their budget that addresses the root 
causes. It is strictly an economic document that talks about 
dollars and cents, that balances columns, that adds up and 
subtracts and arrives at $25 billion; $15 billion that they will 
take out of security and social systems and $10 billion in 
government operations and that will cure the world.
<P>
	If they say it is only the Liberals that are crazy, that do not see 
their great magic, I will read to them that some critics from 
outside feel differently. ``With this $25 billion in cuts to annual 
federal spending the deficit indeed will soon stand at nothing. 
So too might the country. It is here that Reform's proposals fall 
short. It is one thing to present some specific solutions, which 
the party has done, but it is another to set out the consequences, 
which the party has not done''. That was written by the 
Edmonton <I>Journal</I> from the province from which many of them 
come.
<P>
	It says in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on November 29, 1994: ``The 
Reform Party does not know what impact the deep spending cuts 
that it is proposing will have on the economy or on individuals, 
party finance critic Ray Speaker conceded on Monday''.
<P>
	In another editorial it states: ``If you picture government 
spending as a runaway bicycle the Reform would jam a stick in 
the front spokes. It gets the job done but odds are that you will 
not recognize the face of the nation afterwards, nor would you 
want to look''. That is the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	``Reform Party's Preston Manning's shrill call for absolutely 
no tax increase sounds simplistic and irresponsible. The 
Liberals seem ready to chart a realistic course of how to get out 
of debt city and on to recovery road. It certainly beats the 
Reform 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9929"> 9929 </A></B>
<P>
Party's slash and burn shortcuts which would take Canada 
nowhere fast''. That is from the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>.
<P>
	Then the Calgary <I>Herald</I>: ``Reform, for its part, would rapidly 
slash federal government spending so as to create a fiscal 
balance while creating a huge social deficit in the form of 
greater unemployment and social polarization''.
<P>
	I challenge Reformers to show us how they really arrive at 
zero deficit in three years without raising taxes. Remember, if 
they do not raise taxes and suddenly cut everything in sight, they 
arrive at zero deficit. Then in their magic kingdom, 
empowerment, family life, giving the community the 
responsibility to administer all this, suddenly everything will 
come right.
<P>
	The amazing part is that this does not take care of fishermen 
out of work in Newfoundland. I see that typically all the Reform 
members come from western Canada. I do not know if many of 
them travel to Newfoundland, to Prince Edward Island or Nova 
Scotia or New Brunswick or Quebec, or the Gaspé coast where 
thousands of people are out of work, where unemployment 
insurance is not something that people want to have because 
they feel good about it, but because it is needed for them to 
sustain a dignified living, to try to look for some other way to 
recycle themselves while they have no work.
<P>
	Fortunately, sadly, these responsibilities cannot be passed on 
to somebody else. They have to be the responsibility of 
governments. Governments have to continue to be involved, to 
be responsible.
<P>
	I believe that our budget approach of reducing the budget 
gradually to the point of 3 per cent of GNP by the next fiscal 
budget is a responsible approach. Then we go on to reducing it 
further.
<P>
	In the meanwhile, the pain, the hurdles will be formidable 
enough as they are. Canadians are being asked to make 
tremendous sacrifices already. I believe their sacrifices will be 
worth it but certainly we should not ask them for more and the 
magic kingdom of the Reform is for naught.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
sincerely respected the speech we just heard, particularly at the 
personal level.
<P>
	Again I would like to state what we are really talking about 
here, to put it on a proper level of debate, is a different 
philosophy in arriving at the same goal. The Reform Party is not 
out to destroy social programs. What the Reform Party sees is 
the Liberal government, with its present course of action, in the 
process of destroying the ability to fund social programs.
<P>
	I hope that the member and I could come to an agreement that 
we are both out for the same objective but we are attempting to 
arrive at the solution from different perspectives. I am sure the 
member is not suggesting that we do not desire to see the social 
programs not only continue but to be available for people.
<P>
	With that in mind, I would draw this to his attention. We 
receive in the House a publication called ``Quorum''. On page 
17 of ``Quorum'' he was quoting from the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>.
<P>
	This quote is from the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> of February 18 
where the energy minister, who is a member from Alberta, 
called the Moody's downgrade ``irresponsible''.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	``It angers me when we are working very hard to get our fiscal 
house in order''. She said Moody's should have waited until the 
budget is tabled, ``and then if they do not think we have done 
enough; fine. Then they can let us have it.''
<P>
	``The truly important factor in all of this is that until we deal 
with our fiscal situation we are going to be held hostage by the 
Moody's and the others of this world. What they are doing is 
slowly undermining our sovereignty.''
<P>
	To me, that is a reflection of where Liberal members are 
coming from. They do not realize that when they look in the 
mirror and see broccoli on their teeth they should not smash the 
mirror, there is broccoli on their teeth. The problem in this case 
is that the Liberal government has been going out of its way to 
say Moody's is wrong. Moody's happens to be advising all of the 
people. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> is wrong. All of these people are 
wrong and the Liberals are right.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary would not agree that 
the remarks we are hearing from Dominion Bond Rating 
Service, from Moody's, and from all of these other publications 
are trying to tell us something, that in fact the 3 per cent level 
that the government has chosen will have the effect of 
destroying Canada's ability to be able to fund the programs that 
he and I want to maintain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the Minister of 
Finance several times. He has met us in various meetings. I have 
listened to him here in the House.
<P>
	We have gone to the people of Canada during an election 
where we put forward our electoral platform very clearly. We set 
in it exactly what we were going to do. We were going to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP within three years. We are on 
target to do this.
<P>
	We set out the various programs that we wanted to keep, the 
programs we wanted to maintain as a social safety net, the 
programs we wanted to enhance, and we have set it out in very 
clear language with figures backing it up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9930"> 9930 </A></B>
<P>
	All the various financial houses were aware of what we were 
trying to do. The budget is going to come down within a week. 
We should all wait to see what it says, what it does, what thrust 
and direction it takes, whether it follows in the same path as 
the first budget, which it will do, and whether we are on the 
right target.
<P>
	I am convinced that once the budget is down, once the facts 
are known, that all the various naysayers will agree that Canada 
is going in the right direction and following the right path, and 
that certainly we are keeping to our commitments in a very 
credible way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
make a couple of comments and then ask a couple of quick 
questions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	First of all, I want to touch on his reference to New Zealand. 
The parliamentary secretary in referring to New Zealand said 
this was an example of what tough deficit reduction can do and 
has done. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime 
Minister should know that in fact New Zealand chose not to take 
tough deficit reduction action, and as a result its economy 
collapsed. Exactly the same thing happened there as Canada is 
facing right now.
<P>
	One day there was no one willing to buy the bonds that New 
Zealand floated, and Canada is very close to that. That is what 
Moody's and the others are warning about. The parliamentary 
secretary had better do a little bit of reading on what happened in 
New Zealand so he can speak factually about what did happen. I 
thought I would correct him on that.
<P>
	I would like to also talk about the target of 3 per cent of GDP 
in three years that he refers to as the target set in the Maastricht 
treaty. It was a deficit target but it was based on all government 
debt, not just federal government debt, whereas this Liberal 
target is on federal government debt only. The target the 
Liberals have set is nothing like the target set under the 
Maastricht treaty.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There did not appear to be a question in 
that. We are at 5.30 p.m. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary 
does not need to respond.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., it is my duty to inform the House that 
pursuant to Standing Order 81(19), the proceedings on the 
motion have expired.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from Thursday, December 8, 
consideration of the motion that Bill C-216, an act to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act (jury service), be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak in favour of the bill tabled by the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur and tell him that we, the official 
opposition, truly hope that this private members' bill will 
become law.
<P>
	It is indeed a flagrant injustice that people collecting 
unemployment insurance lose their benefits when they accept 
jury duty. It is an injustice of the kind that could compromise 
justice in all of the provinces and in all of Canada.
<P>
	Some people have said that this provision should be covered 
by provincial law. I think it should be the opposite. In fact, what 
we have before us is an amendment to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act that would guarantee that jurors would not lose 
their entitlement to UI benefits because they are on jury duty. I 
must point out that, for the act to apply, the person submitting 
the claim for benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act 
must already qualify and continue to qualify under this bill.
<P>
	It is difficult to be a juror. It is certainly more difficult than 
being a member of Parliament who is trying to deliver a speech 
when everyone is talking. They have to carry out certain duties 
and we should at least make it easier for them. In fact, it is 
thanks to jurors that we have a justice system that is based on 
decisions made freely by citizens-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, would you please 
stop talking and show a little respect for the hon. member who 
has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It seems to me that 
this issue is important enough to give a member of Parliament 
the right to a modicum of attention, in the same way that 
unemployed jurors merit to qualify for benefits.
<P>
	The current provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act 
prevent UI claimants from accepting jury duty. I believe that one 
factor should weigh heavy in the decision that this House and 
eventually the government must take, and that is that, day in, 
day out, including any allowances to be made for Quebec, on the 
average 30 per cent of all those who are able to work or have 
worked are on unemployment insurance. Not everyone milks the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9932"> 9932 </A></B>
<P>
system until their benefits run dry. What is more, with the new 
cuts we are seeing, it is not everybody who qualifies for 
unemployment insurance for several months.
<P>
	There is therefore a significant number of citizens who, each 
year, rely on unemployment insurance. Something does not 
make sense when the judicial system must pass over these 
citizens, who are available anyway, only to call on others.
<P>
	Furthermore, it hardly makes any sense either that those who 
must serve as jurors are only paid the meagre allowance of $25 
per day.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It is not merely a question of amending the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to ensure that people chosen for jury duty may 
exercise their right to do so-recognizing that they are not 
handsomely paid since, as people say, no one gets rich on 
unemployment insurance in any case-and continue to receive 
at least the minimum to which they were already entitled under 
the Unemployment Insurance Act, thereby allowing them to 
perform this function which is eminently necessary to a 
democratic system, namely being chosen at random from the 
population for jury duty.
<P>
	I say to the minister that this is not only a reform worth 
carrying out, but rather one that should have been carried out a 
long time ago because of the many negative consequences for 
ordinary people. In that way, we would be sure at least that 
persons receiving unemployment insurance benefits would not 
try to avoid this important role which is also very demanding 
physically and morally.
<P>
	Since certain responsibilities are already being imposed on 
them, we would like to allow them to keep at least some peace of 
mind, which is in any case greatly diminished since 
unemployment insurance is hardly a king's ransom.
<P>
	So I would ask the House to vote for the amendment proposed 
by my colleague from Restigouche-Chaleur and I say to him 
that Bloc Quebecois members will vote for this amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak in favour of the 
private member's bill of my hon. colleague which will enable 
those claiming unemployment insurance to receive their regular 
benefits while they are engaged in jury service.
<P>
	First, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur for the thoughtfulness and thoroughness 
he has shown in redressing this problem in the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. Through his efforts the House has learned that it 
is difficult or impossible for unemployed Canadians to fulfil 
their legal responsibilities as citizens of the country when asked 
to perform jury duty.
<P>
	However, what is most impressive is that through the efforts 
of my hon. colleague, the Government of Canada is now in a 
position to rectify an unfair situation. This is an excellent 
example of how people can use the system to make changes that 
benefit all Canadians. A constituent  has voiced an important 
concern and as a result of my hon. colleague's actions we now 
have a bill before us that will redress an injustice faced by many 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am sure we all agree that private members' initiatives such 
as this one provide a valuable direct link between the concerns 
of our constituents and positive legislative change. 
Furthermore, the enthusiasm of our government to support the 
process can only strengthen the democratic parliamentary 
process.
<P>
	The government's support of the specific bill clearly indicates 
that we are open to reviewing all aspects of our social programs 
and correcting flaws therein. We know our current programs are 
far from perfect. Some may have outgrown their usefulness and 
others have not kept pace with time.
<P>
	In this case we must ensure the system does not penalize 
people who are merely trying to fulfil their responsibilities and 
duties as Canadians. To vote in support of the bill is simply to 
acknowledge that UI claimants should not be penalized when 
they engage in jury service. They are, after all, serving their 
country by doing a stressful job that ultimately benefits all of us.
<P>
	It makes no sense for one arm of government to force a person 
into service while another arm of government punishes a person 
for providing that service. With no alternative at hand, more and 
more judges have little choice but to excuse UI claimants from 
jury duty. This is not a solution but merely a stop gap measure. 
Judges have stated their disapproval with the current system to 
both the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Justice. Exempting UI claimants from jury duty 
removes the claimants from an unfair situation. The question we 
must ask, however, is: Why not simply stop creating the unfair 
situation in the first place?
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Judges have pointed out that by excusing UI claimants from 
jury duty on compassionate grounds it makes it more difficult to 
ensure the accused will receive his or her right to a trial by a fair 
and true jury of peers.
<P>
	There are two reasons for this. In regions of higher 
unemployment, for instance, the routine exemption of potential 
jury members because they are on UI arbitrarily decreases the 
pool of jury members available, often to the point where it is 
difficult to ensure that a jury is selected from a broad 
cross-section of society.
<P>
	Furthermore, as my hon. colleague from 
Restigouche-Chaleur has pointed out, in trials where the 
defendant is unemployed the automatic exclusion of all UI 
claimants from the jury could have a serious bearing on the 
defendant's right to a trial with a jury of peers who understand 
the circumstances and life situation of the defendant. Under the 
current system, however, judges 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9933"> 9933 </A></B>
<P>
have no other road open to them except to excuse UI claimants 
from duty.
<P>
	There are good reasons Canadian citizens are legally 
obligated to engage in jury service when called upon. Each one 
of us has a right to trial by a jury selected from among our peers. 
This is a principle we cannot afford to tamper with. The 
principles involved and their accompanying social 
consequences surely warrant the small increase in 
unemployment expenditures that would be involved.
<P>
	Finally, we must emphasize that most employees continue to 
be paid their normal salaries while fulfilling jury duty 
obligations. Their collective agreements protect them from the 
injustice of losing their jobs or losing income when they 
perform this service. It therefore seems unfair for the federal 
government to cut off UI claimants when so many employers are 
not permitted to lay off or fire employees for the same reason.
<P>
	The bill will help our fellow Canadians to fulfil their civic 
duty without undue hardship. It will also help to ensure that the 
fundamental principle of a fair trial by jury is maintained. For 
all these reasons I am convinced all my colleagues in the House 
will vote in favour of the bill.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleague for bringing forward this important 
piece of legislation. I encourage all members of the House to 
support the bill before us today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again I rise to speak against this private member's 
bill. The bill would allow unemployment insurance claimants to 
collect unemployment insurance while serving on juries. It 
clearly demonstrates why the country is in such a serious 
financial crisis. Instead of finding ways to save millions of 
dollars, the government is busy running around finding more 
ways to spend millions of dollars.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> I hear the jeers 
coming from across the floor. I would appeal to members of the 
House to listen to reasoned debate. If every member would 
listen to the issues at stake in the bill and each vote according to 
his or her conscience, I believe the result would be very different 
from voting along purely party lines.
<P>
	It is essential to look at the issues. I have heard the description 
of the problem but there are some options the government has 
refused to consider. That is why I oppose the bill. I will speak to 
it and give the reasons for opposing it.
<P>
	I will say right now, and I will say it openly, that the Liberals 
just do not get it. Canadians are sick and tired of governments 
that spend more than they take in. Canadian taxpayers are sick of 
members of Parliament who are more concerned about paying 
unemployment insurance claimants to sit on juries than they are 
about them looking for work.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member's intervention. It reminds me of 
somebody who looks at his bicycle and sees that one tire does 
not look the same as the other. One is flat and one is not. He 
decides he is going to make them both look the same and 
punches a hole in the one that looks good. Then they both look 
the same. That is the Liberal way of solving some of these 
problems. If we have a problem with the justice system we do 
not fix it with the UI system. It is that simple. We are creating 
inequities. I am getting ahead of myself. Let me get into this 
reasoned debate that the members need to listen to.
<P>
	The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur quite rightly 
identifies the problem with the poor compensation that 
provinces pay citizens to sit on juries. Rather than doing 
something about the specific problem, he attempts to avoid the 
real problem by giving jurors a handout from the unemployment 
insurance program.
<P>
	Do you think it will ever be properly solved once you do this? 
The answer is obvious, no. Once we start going along this path, 
it will not be properly solved in the justice system where the 
solution should take place.
<P>
	In this bill the hon. member proposes to break the 
fundamental insurance principle that all UI claimants should be 
available for work in order to collect UI benefits. The 
government has strayed so far from the rules of a true insurance 
program that many Canadians already think that unemployment 
insurance is a social program, and that is a fundamental mistake.
<P>
	I am here to remind the hon. member, the Liberal government 
and all taxpayers in Canada that unemployment insurance is an 
insurance program, not a social program.
<P>
	When the Reform Party forms the next government we will 
put an end to all this social engineering nonsense and return the 
UI program to its original purpose, an employer-employee 
funded and administered program to provide temporary income 
in the event of unexpected job loss. That was the original intent.
<P>
	The hon. member says that this non-insurance measure will 
only cost $2 million or $3 million. Does he really think that 
voters want their government to spend $2 million or $3 million 
more to pay UI claimants in this way? Has he asked the voters in 
his constituency if they had $2 million or $3 million to spend if 
this would be their priority?
<P>
	I do not think this member would get this support if he had 
gone to his constituents. I do not think they would support the 
direction of this government and the way it is heading with this 
bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9934"> 9934 </A></B>
<P>
	He gets several individual complaints. I have talked to the 
member. People are giving comments across here, but I have 
talked to him directly and he has received several complaints. 
This is not a big push from across the country, believe me.
<P>
	Here we are in the midst of the most serious financial crisis 
the country has ever faced and the best bill that this member can 
come up with is a bill that would spend $2 million or $3 million 
more. If we eliminated all the special handouts like the one 
proposed by the hon. member which the Liberal government has 
added to this UI program since 1971 we would save billions of 
dollars.
<P>
	Why has this government got its priorities so mixed up? 
Again, I say it just does not get it. Taxpayers do not want to 
spend more. They want to spend less. Workers and employers do 
not want high UI premiums. They want lower premiums. This 
will force them up.
<P>
	What kind of petitions has this member received in his office? 
Has he received any petitions? How many hundreds of letters 
has this member received complaining about this issue? Has any 
MP received even one petition concerning this? I receive 
petitions and letters complaining about the government's gun 
control proposals and I receive many petitions and letters 
opposing the government's plan to include sexual orientation in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. I receive many petitions to 
balance the budget and not raise taxes. Is this hon. member 
saying that he has received these petitions? I doubt it.
<P>
	If he is I have to question the hon. member on his priorities in 
bringing this bill before Parliament. Who supports this bill 
besides some Liberals who have their thinking locked into the 
1970s?
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The senior officials at unemployment insurance certainly do 
not think it is a good idea. Talk to the people there. They know it 
goes against their own insurance guidelines and they were 
opposed to it until it went to the standing committee.
<P>
	Their claims adjudication guidelines state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a general rule, a UI claimant who is on jury duty is not considered to be 
available for work during a trial. The unemployment insurance plan was not 
designed to provide compensation for lost wages in such circumstances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The experts at unemployment insurance add that the problem 
is not with the UI rules on availability but rather the poor 
compensation provided for jurors. Reformers agree.
<P>
	There is the problem. That is where it should be solved, not 
with the unemployment insurance plan. The research branch of 
the Library of Parliament also concurs with us:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary issue in this matter seems to be that adequate remuneration for 
jury duty is the responsibility of the provinces rather than that of the employers 
and employees who contribute to the unemployment insurance program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are the experts in the Library of Parliament.
<P>
	If the government actually gave the employers and employees 
who pay for the UI program a real say in how their money was 
being spent, I do not think they would agree to provide benefits 
to claimants while they are serving on a jury.
<P>
	If the voters are not clamouring for this change, if the experts 
at unemployment insurance say it goes against insurance 
principles, if the researchers at the Library of Parliament agree 
it is the responsibility of the provinces, and if the workers and 
employers who pay UI premiums are not asking for it, who is? 
Only the hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur and his 
misguided supporters in the Liberal caucus can answer that.
<P>
	The law is simple. If UI claimants are serving on a jury, they 
are not available for work. If they are not available for work, 
they are not entitled to unemployment insurance. Fix the system 
where it is broken.
<P>
	UI claimants are supposed to be looking for work while they 
are receiving benefits. If they are serving on a jury, they cannot 
be actively looking for work. Unemployment insurance is not a 
guaranteed annual income and should not be treated as such.
<P>
	Everyone collecting unemployment insurance must be 
actively looking for work and ready, willing and able to accept a 
job immediately. If the Liberals compromise the insurance 
principle of availability to allow jurors to collect UI, who is the 
next group they will designate as deserving special treatment 
and special status? They opened the door and they are going to 
have to accept other people with similar excuses.
<P>
	Reformers say the UI program must be returned to a true 
insurance program. In order to do this all of the special 
programs, exemptions and exceptions, including the 
discriminatory elements such as variable entrance requirements 
and regional extended benefits, have to be eliminated.
<P>
	If unemployment insurance ran like a true insurance program, 
anyone who collects UI repeatedly would have to pay higher 
premiums. Any employer who regularly lays off workers would 
also have to pay higher premiums. This private member's bill 
takes us in the opposite direction to where Reformers want to 
take unemployment insurance. This is the main reason we 
cannot support this bill, but not the only reason.
<P>
	I hope everyone is listening carefully to this next point, 
because for a government that claims to be the champion of 
equality, it goes against that basic principle. If this bill were 
adopted even the principle of equality would be jeopardized. An 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9935"> 9935 </A></B>
<P>
employed person is expected to take time off work for jury duty. 
Often they are not compensated for their lost pay.
<P>
	Now we have the situation with a worker sitting on a jury, 
losing money because he or she is doing public duty. Beside him 
is someone being paid by the public purse, a UI claimant getting 
paid by the government to do the same job.
<P>
	No one I have heard speak from the other side or even from the 
Bloc has addressed these two problems. Fix the system where it 
is broken. Fix the justice system. What are they going to do 
about the inequities they create with this kind of system?
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	That answer has not been forthcoming. It should be answered 
before he supports this bill. The hon. member raises the point 
that often employers pay their employees while they are serving 
on a jury and that it is unfair to UI claimants to have their 
benefits cut off.
<P>
	If this charge were allowed to pass, what does the member 
think will happen? If a worker is called to do jury duty, the 
employer will lay him off so that he can go on UI and collect 
payments. In other words, one is opening the floodgates to have 
many people collect UI who normally would not be able to do so 
because they are laid off by their employers when they have to 
serve on a jury.
<P>
	Those members are creating a problem. They are not solving a 
problem. They are making two flat tires instead of fixing the 
system where it is broken. This would undoubtedly lead to an 
increase in UI claims for people serving on juries and therefore 
an increase in cost to the UI program, which is already billions 
in debt.
<P>
	While there may be a problem of fair compensation to all 
persons who serve on a jury regardless of their employment 
status, we do not believe that tinkering with the Unemployment 
Insurance Act and intruding into this area of provincial 
jurisdiction is the way to solve it.
<P>
	A simpler solution we propose is for judges to use their 
discretion to excuse UI claimants from jury duty, as has been 
done in the past, or else have the provinces deal with the 
problem. It is their problem.
<P>
	In closing, it is obvious that jurors are not fairly compensated 
and on this point my hon. friend and I agree. It is inexcusable 
that jurors are asked to work for days, weeks and in some cases 
months for $15 or $20 a day.
<P>
	The Reform Party was founded on the principles of equality, 
fairness and common sense. That is lacking in this bill. We find 
that this is an area that needs to be addressed, but this is an area 
of provincial jurisdiction. Reformers believe the federal 
government should not be interfering in areas that are clearly a 
provincial matter.
<P>
	The flawed logic behind this type of thinking has this country 
$550 billion in debt. Every time there is a problem, they do not 
fix it where it is broken. They simply throw more money at it. 
This type of thinking costs us $40 billion in interest payments 
every year; it is this type of thinking, this debt and the interest 
payments that are the biggest threat to the future of most of our 
social programs.
<P>
	Canada cannot afford to make these kinds of decisions with 
our hearts instead of our heads. Reformers will vote against this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no other members who 
wish to speak, I will call on the sponsoring member to close the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not take too much time. It 
has been four years since this subject came to Parliament. Much 
has been said in committee and in the House. Rather than review 
all that, I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues 
from the Liberal Party who supported me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the 
support provided by the Bloc Quebecois
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank my colleagues from the Reform 
Party who have certainly enlightened us on their point of view in 
this debate. I appreciate that. They have their point of view. I 
appreciate their point of view, but again we have ours.
<P>
	I would like to thank every one of my colleagues but I would 
be remiss if I did not thank the officers of the Chamber who have 
helped me immensely. They have guided me whenever I needed 
guidance with regard to the bill. Also my own staff have been 
very efficient in helping me with this bill. The clerks and 
personnel of Private Members' Business have been super in 
giving me information and advice. I thank them this evening and 
I look forward to their support on this bill.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURALSUBSIDIES">AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I was asking the Minister of Agriculture about 
agricultural subsidies, and, more specifically those allocated to 
grain transportation in western Canada. On the eve of the 
budget, my concern was to try to find out a little more about the 
intentions of the minister, who wants to review all agricultural 
subsidies.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance ended the suspense this afternoon. 
The budget will finally be tabled at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, that is, 
in a week's time. We will then discover the fate of agricultural 
subsidies. We will discover, finally, whether existing rail carrier 
subsidies will be replaced by direct subsidies to western grain 
producers.
<P>
	So, in answer to my question, the minister gave a rather vague 
response. He said his colleague in transport and he had been 
involved in discussions with the primary stakeholders and that 
the details of the discussions would be made available once the 
budget was tabled in this House.
<P>
	The message is clear. We will not have any more information 
until next week. The minister's response to this, in a minute or 
two, will be, I expect, a good couple of minutes of fine 
speech-making, devoid of content. Why do I bother, you might 
ask, Mr. Speaker? I do so to protest the government's attitude in 
this matter.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister said that Western grain transportation 
reform had been debated quite often during the past 25 years. As 
far as I know, his party, the Liberal Party, has been in power for 
the past 25 years, longer than it deserves, and it never had the 
guts to take action in this respect. What we have been seeing 
lately seems to be a rerun of what happened in the past. And that 
is what bothers me.
<P>
	Last summer, the Minister of Transport announced that the 
Crow rate would be abolished. His colleague at Agriculture and 
Agri-Food hastened to say his department would pick up the 
slack by making the necessary changes. The committee on 
payments to producers examined the question and made a 
number of recommendations, which included transferring the 
subsidy directly to producers to help them adjust to the new 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	We expected the minister to let us know whether he supported 
this approach. Not a word from the minister.
<P>
	Since that time, it seems the minister has seen talking and 
consulting quite a lot. That is why I am anxious to hear what 
kind of measures the minister will implement to make this an 
effective and satisfactory subsidy for producers, while meeting 
international trade standards.
<P>
	There is a risk, however, and this will affect farm producers 
across the country, that the $566 million paid to Western rail 
carriers will be paid directly to Western producers only, who 
will then be able to diversify their operations and, in the process, 
compete with farm producers in the rest of Canada, which would 
improve their competitive position.
<P>
	Imagine, for instance, that with the help of the subsidy, 
Western producers would be able to raise hogs more cheaply 
than producers in Quebec or Ontario. This would mean unfair 
competition with the help of public funds. Can you see farm 
producers in Quebec and Ontario paying Western farmers to 
compete unfairly on the hog market? I am using hogs as an 
example, but it could any kind of livestock that would allow 
Western farmers to compete with producers in Quebec or 
Ontario or the Maritimes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but I did not notice the hon. 
member's time had expired. We will now proceed with the 
response from the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food meets regularly with industry 
leaders, including l'Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec.
<P>
	These discussions have led to legislative amendments to the 
Western Grain Transportation Act which were tabled in 
December. These amendments will ensure better use of scarce 
taxpayer dollars as well as protect our producers from 
potentially damaging trade actions.
<P>
	While important, Bill C-66 will not be sufficient in itself to 
fix all that ails our grain handling and transportation system. 
Broader reforms are necessary for four very strong reasons.
<P>
	First, we must deal with the harsh reality of fiscal limitations 
and the battle against the debt and deficit. Second, we must 
comply with the requirements of the new GATT agreement with 
respect to the disciplines that apply to trade distorting subsidies. 
Third, we need to unlock new grain handling and transportation 
efficiencies leading to a lower cost and faster system overall. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9937"> 9937 </A></B>
<P>
Fourth, we need to foster greater agricultural diversification and 
a trend toward more value added processing.
<P>
	To accomplish these objectives the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food and the Minister of Transport have been 
conducting two sets of comprehensive consultations for all the 
players in the Canadian grain handling and transportation 
system. This will go far to solving the problem.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHINA">CHINA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to follow up on a 
question I originally asked in this House on November 1 last and 
then followed up with a further question on November 16. These 
questions related to the visit of the Prime Minister and a group 
of cabinet ministers, including the Secretary of State for 
Asia-Pacific and others, to China and to Asia.
<P>
	At that time I raised concerns, in particular on November 16, 
with respect to the issue of Canada's support and particularly 
that of the Prime Minister for the Three Gorges dam in China. I 
am appalled that the government would support such a project 
which would have an enormously destructive impact not only 
environmentally on China, but also on its people. This project 
would involve displacement of over one million Chinese from 
the Yangtze river area.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition they took a very 
different position. The Secretary of State for Latin America and 
Africa said: ``While I realize the building of this dam would 
provide Canada with substantial business opportunities, is it 
worth the cost? The dam will impoverish and dislocate 
millions''.
<P>
	In addition I would note that any opposition to this dam was 
ruthlessly suppressed in China. The authors of a 1989 book 
called <I>Yangtze Yangtze</I>, a group of distinguished Chinese 
officials with scientific and technical degrees, had their book 
banned. One of them was jailed and fired from her job and others 
were taken into custody.
<P>
	It is appalling, as I said, that this government would support 
this. I am pleased that the premier of the province of British 
Columbia has indicated that the province of British Columbia 
would not participate in any way in the contracts for Three 
Gorges.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity during the time of the 
United Nations commission on human rights to urge the 
Government of Canada to support in the strongest possible 
terms the resolution which is coming before the commission 
with respect to China. I would note that resolution in its draft 
form includes a specific reference to Tibet as well and the 
concerns around the very serious human rights violations in 
Tibet. I hope that there will not be any attempt to water down 
that resolution and to refuse to make reference to Tibet.
<P>
	Finally, I want to note that human rights concerns continue to 
be a matter of great priority. I was disappointed that the Prime 
Minister apparently only paid lip service to these concerns 
during his visit to China. The premier of Nova Scotia did not 
even notice that he had made reference to it. Afterwards he was 
reminded that perhaps he had. We saw in December of last year 
the fact that Chinese courts have handed down terms of 
imprisonment of up to 20 years, terms of 20, 17, and 15 years for 
non-violent peaceful Chinese dissidents. This is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I expect our government to speak out. I expect our 
government to speak out as well with respect to the issue of East 
Timor at the United Nations commission on human rights and to 
support a strong resolution on this issue.
<P>
	I welcome an assurance from the Secretary of State for 
Asia-Pacific that this government will come to its senses and 
will withdraw its support for Three Gorges and for the sale of 
Candu reactors.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the interest of my colleague 
across the floor. He brought up quite a number of issues, but 
today I would like to take this opportunity to respond to his 
concern on the Three Gorges issue.
<P>
	We have to recognize that the decision by the Chinese 
government on the Three Gorges dam project is not based on the 
support of Canada. The hon. member spoke about quite a 
number of reasons on the negative side, but I would also like to 
bring the attention of the House to the positive aspects of that 
project.
<P>
	The Chinese have begun work on that based on several 
reasons, one of which is the urgent need to protect some 10 
million people from flooding below the dam site and also China 
currently uses coal based energy sources, which we all agree 
have a large negative impact on the environment. Hydro 
electricity is a cleaner source of energy. China faces critical 
shortfalls in electric power which hamper the creation of jobs in 
a disadvantaged region of China. There is a need to improve 
navigation on the Yangtze River so as to allow shipping to reach 
Chongoing, one of China's largest cities.
<P>
	In a Chinese context, the Chinese government, faced with the 
urgency of the region's requirements, considered the solution to 
be both viable and optimum. It is implementing the project. That 
decision is not based on what Canada has decided to do.
<P>
	On balance we see the contribution of Canadian companies as 
positive. Canada is a world leader in the environmental 
technologies and services sector. Canadian companies, 
therefore, have an important and significant contribution to 
make to China as it 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9938"> 9938 </A></B>
<P>
addresses the environmental aspects of this project. Their 
participation could introduce management and technical 
features that would reduce the project's negative impact. That is 
why the government will support Canadian firms. Their  
environmental practices and expertise could positively 
influence the project.
<P>
	Also it is important to note that the Canadian power sector has 
identified China as a key market to bridge flagging domestic 
demand and to ensure its survival over the next decade. They are 
using a Team Canada approach to China. Their participation in 
the Three Gorges project could create some 35,000 jobs in 
Canada, many of which would be in the troubled high value 
added electrical industry and SME suppliers.
<P>
	Canadian hydroelectric and environmental firms are among 
the best in the world and are therefore well placed to win 
contracts. However international competition will be intense. 
Business and the attendant jobs in Canada will only be won with 
strong government support.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the hon. minister that 
his time has expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38 the motion to adjourn the 
House is now been deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
