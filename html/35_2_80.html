in Canada of the use, production, stockpiling, sale, trade and 
transfer of all anti-personnel land mines;  to work for an 
international convention banning these activities; to substantially 
increase Canadian contributions to the UN fund for assistance in 
mine clearance for indigenous and other humanitarian mine 
clearing initiatives; and to increase Canadian funding and other 
types of assistance to rehabilitate mine victims.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a petition from places like Prescott, Oxford Mills, Kemptville 
and Brockville, Ontario in my riding.
<P>
	The petitioners are concerned about the unborn and the rights of 
the unborn. They would like to see legal protection for children 
both before and after birth.
<P>
	The petitioners go further and ask for a national referendum to 
be held in conjunction with the next federal election to ask the 
people of Canada if they think that we should be spending our 
scarce health dollars these days to promote abortion on demand. 
The petitioners believe that legally and morally it should not be 
allowed and that funding for it should be very limited.

	The House resumed from October 1, consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-41, an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders 
and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, 
Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5022"> 5022 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the House will recall that on Tuesday when I spoke last on this 
bill I only had two minutes to speak on it. I am pleased to have 
a few more minutes to intervene and to add some considerations 
to my colleagues' interventions who will be voting on this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is an act to amend four other long acts. The intent of 
the bill is to strengthen the provisions and terms under which 
people who are responsible to pay child support are enforced and 
dealt with. There are four main provisions of this bill. I will speak 
to each one and outline how sufficient the legislation is in dealing 
with each of these areas.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	The four main provisions are: to have a grid or some legislated 
guidelines for child support amounts; to open up Revenue Canada 
databases so that defaulting parents can be located; to allow for the 
garnishment of public service pension benefits and seamen's 
wages; and to mandate or allow for the withdrawal of federal 
licences. The term federal licence is defined in such a way as to 
include passports. There are other provisions in the bill but those 
are the four main areas in which the government is attempting to 
tighten up the whole area of child support and the enforcement of 
maintenance payments in support of children.
<P>
	When we deal with issues relating to children and issues relating 
to family breakdowns, the allocation of responsibilities and the 
onus that is being placed on parents in a divided family situation, 
very strong feelings come forward. This is not at all surprising. Our 
families, our children and our own personal emotional difficulties, 
hurts and disappointments that necessitate the kind of legislation 
we are dealing with today call for some very strong feelings and 
emotions.
<P>
	I know other members, like myself, have had calls from very 
concerned and upset custodial parents, mostly women, who are 
beside themselves that the father of their child, who is no longer 
part of the marriage picture, chooses to be derelict in his duty and 
responsibility to assist the mother as the custodial person. They 
find it very difficult to understand why a simple court order 
allowing them to provide the necessities for their children cannot 
be better enforced. They are demanding that there be a better 
enforcement mechanism. It is in response to those kinds of 
demands that this legislation has been brought forward and was 
needed to be brought forward.
<P>
	It is also fair to point out that there have been calls from many 
parents who are paying child support, who are mostly men. They 
have been very concerned about the one-sidedness of this kind of 
legislation where only the monetary responsibilities they have been 
given are enforced, dealt with and seem to be important. The other 
rights and responsibilities they have as parents seem to  be ignored 
and violated without any corresponding concern on the part of 
government and legislators.
<P>
	One of the things we need to look at is whether the balance and 
thrust of this legislation, while it is necessary and clearly to the 
benefit of ensuring proper support for children, is as it ought to be.
<P>
	There is a tendency sometimes in the debate on enforcement of 
child support, to talk about deadbeat parents, parents who abdicate, 
ignore and renege on their responsibilities to the children they have 
brought into this world and seem to have no care or concern as to 
whether these children have proper income so that they can be fed, 
clothed, educated and raised properly. There seems to be some 
concern about putting the emphasis on money and treating fathers, 
as one gentleman said to me, like a wallet, but ignoring other 
parental responsibilities and prerogatives.
<P>
	I happened to pick up a copy of <I>Psychology Today</I> this summer. I 
read an interesting article about violence against women. In that 
same magazine was an interesting article about the roles of fathers 
in the lives of their children. The article cited studies that showed a 
father has a very complex role in the emotional and intellectual 
growth of his child. Although a father may interact with his child in 
more physical and less intimate way than a mother, he has a key 
impact on his child's development. The article also stated that a 
father with emotional problems will have a more dire effect on his 
child than a mother with similar problems.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	This is only one article that looked at studies. There are many 
others that state it is very important for children that fathers 
continue to have a role in their lives. Many fathers are asking that 
their responsibility for support be looked at. They would also like 
ongoing access to their children to be part of the equation. That is 
not the case in this legislation.
<P>
	Other speakers have raised the concern that if we are going to 
deal with the matter of ensuring the well-being of children, we 
should include in their need for monetary support their need for 
emotional and intellectual support in ongoing relationships and 
training.
<P>
	I recommend that the government seriously consider this whole 
area. When it brings in legislation to deal with the well-being of 
children it should look at other aspects of their well-being, other 
needs. It should not suggest by the way it frames legislation that as 
long as money is coming to the custodial parent that is satisfactory. 
That is not the only thing needed to be looked at in relation to the 
best interests of children.
<P>
	One of the main provisions in this legislation is that a grid or 
guidelines for the amount of child support payable will be put into 
place. According to some of the information that has been put 
forward by government, these guidelines were drawn up after a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5023"> 5023 </A></B>
<P>
broad consultation with people who were familiar with the area of 
child maintenance and child support, and I think that is good.
<P>
	We can accept that the amounts on the grid and the guidelines 
represent a reasonable and honest effort to put in place amounts 
based on the income and circumstances of the parties. Generally 
speaking, that will be fair.
<P>
	My concern is with what this legislation does not deal with. A 
one size fits all award of maintenance is not practical when one 
considers the wide variety of circumstances and employment 
realities that are factored into calculations of the need, the 
reasonableness and the propriety of a particular monetary award for 
child support.
<P>
	There is concern that the discretion of the courts, which have 
many judges-most judges have a great deal of experience and 
background in calculating these awards for support-will be taken 
away in favour of a rigid one size fits all system. There must be 
more thought and debate before this happens.
<P>
	There is a great deal of concern about rigid awards, particularly 
where circumstances change quickly and often. Parents who are 
paying child support simply cannot come back to court on a regular 
basis every time their circumstances shift. In this economy, for 
example, many people are under-employed. Many people are 
unemployed. Many people are concerned about job loss. Many 
people are self-employed on a consulting basis and have irregular 
income. These hard and fast awards, guidelines and grids, are not 
properly reflective of the economic realities of the citizens. They 
create hardship and frustration for the people who must adhere to 
them. I would ask the government to reconsider the rigidity of the 
rules which it is trying to implement.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Certain areas in the legislation provide for a variation of the 
awards handed down under the grid, however, the provision for a 
variation or for taking into account unusual or different 
circumstances is too narrow to be of much assistance to most 
parents who are paying child support.
<P>
	Second, the legislation will allow Revenue Canada databases to 
be opened in order to locate parents who default on their child 
support payments. Most Canadians believe that parents have a 
strong obligation to their children. Children need to know that their 
needs are going to be met by both parents on an ongoing basis. That 
is a very important consideration for them.
<P>
	Parents have the primary responsibility for the care and support 
of their children. This burden should not be placed on other 
members of society simply because parents decide to be 
irresponsible.
<P>
	Any measures which will ensure that parents carry out their 
obligations should be applauded. However, we must ensure that the 
opening up of Revenue Canada databases does not unfairly or 
inappropriately breach the privacy rights of the parent who is under 
a maintenance order.
<P>
	Substantial concerns have been raised about whether access to 
private financial information will be fairly administered. Will the 
databases be opened up when there are substantial arrears or when 
there is simply an allegation of arrears? Will private information, 
which is not necessary to locate the defaulting parent, be given to 
other parties? We need to look very closely at the issue of fairness. 
There can be a number of circumstances involved in a default 
situation. Perhaps a default has been alleged but has not taken 
place. The rights and privacy of all parties concerned need to be 
protected.
<P>
	Sometimes there is a tendency to hammer everyone involved 
and, in doing so, violate the rights of everyone, rather than the 
minority who are at fault. Most parents who are under an 
agreement or a court order to support their children do so. They do 
so gladly, regularly and in a responsible manner. We have to be 
careful to ensure that the majority of parents are not unfairly 
treated simply to get at the minority. Caution must be taken 
because a lot of lives and rights will be affected. Third, the 
provisions being brought forward for the garnishment of public 
service pension benefits and a broader ability to ensure that every 
parent who is obligated to pay child support actually does pay are 
good. Again, we need to be careful of the fairness factor. 
Unfortunately, the regulations that will show how these measures 
will be implemented are absent. They will be introduced later. They 
will not be debated. They will simply be put into place.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	We have a real responsibility to the people who are going to be 
affected by the legislation. It is important that their human rights 
and freedoms are not unduly impinged upon because of the way 
this legislation is constructed. The same principle holds true when 
we are withdrawing rights of citizens such as drivers' licences and 
passports.
<P>
	It is fair to say that the sentiment behind this legislation is good, 
however, it is not as balanced as it needs to be. There are a lot of 
unanswered questions about how it will actually be administered at 
the end of the day.
<P>
	On behalf of citizens who will be very seriously affected by this 
legislation, I would ask for a re-examination of it to see whether it 
can be better balanced and whether more fairness and certainty can 
be assured when it is finally implemented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was very interested to hear the comments of my hon. 
colleague from Calgary North on this very critical piece of 
legislation concerning families, especially children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5024"> 5024 </A></B>
<P>
	In light of some of the legislation that has been passed, 
particularly in California, Florida and Washington state, among 
others, which reflects those governments' policies of encouraging 
parenting by both parents after divorce, I wonder if my colleague 
could give us her views on what steps she might feel the 
government could take to encourage and develop that type of 
legislation and that thinking in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, when we have legislation of 
this type, it should not just address one injustice, one problem or 
one difficulty that relates to the well-being of our children. It 
should be balanced and talk about the other needs of children as 
well.
<P>
	A measure that could bring a greater involvement into children's 
lives by their father, which many studies show is vital to their 
well-being, would be addressing this whole matter of access.
<P>
	As my colleagues are aware, orders relating to children in 
separation or divorce situations not only address monetary support 
for children but also the ongoing involvement through access and 
other areas where fathers particularly, or the non-custodial parent, 
continue to have as strong and healthy a relationship with their 
children as possible.
<P>
	I would suggest that, if legislation of this type were as strong on 
ensuring that parents' involvements and responsibilities were 
equally upheld and enforced, it would be to the very great benefit 
of children.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from Calgary North. 
She always brings a different perspective to this question when we 
debate it in the House because of her experience in law. I think she 
may be able to help me on this particular issue. I wonder if my 
colleague could comment on the prospect of mediation before 
access and custody is even decided or settled, usually prior to 
divorce. It would then be agreed by both parents and hopefully on 
the needs for the child and the ability of the non-custodial spouse to 
pay. Hopefully that would make for a better and lasting settlement 
and would probably result in payments being made on a regular 
basis.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Would my colleague also comment on the program called 
parenting after divorce? It became mandatory in Alberta after 
February 1, and Alberta justice minister Brian Evans said that the 
program is intended to help children and also to save the courts 
time and money since our courts are already overburdened. The 
program was basically brought in to minimize the impact of 
divorce on children. Would my colleague comment on whether she 
feels mediation would help and if so, should it be in the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, it certainly has been my 
experience in my practice of law and some of the  work I did in the 
area of divorce that the divorce proceedings and process are 
unnecessarily adversarial, particularly when it has to be considered 
that a good relationship with both parents on a continuing basis is 
absolutely vital to the well-being of children.
<P>
	If there is an adversarial situation where someone is the bad guy 
and somebody is the good guy, a very difficult situation has been 
set up for children. Very often they are put in the position of 
judging who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Whereas, their 
real needs and what is best for them would be to sorrowfully accept 
that parents have differences that are not going to allow them to 
live together, but that these are both people they be proud of, 
respect and have good relationship with.
<P>
	I think moving more toward a mediated approach or mediated 
settlement of the issues in a divorce situation would be much 
healthier for the children.
<P>
	My colleague from Mission-Coquitlam also mentioned the 
training which is being implemented in Alberta which assists both 
parents in the kind of training, education and skills building that 
would be necessary for both parents to continue to play a very 
positive and very necessary role in the lives of their children. I 
would certainly recommend that the government look at those 
kinds of measures to make the legislation more balanced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before I get into my remarks today on Bill C-41, I would 
like to take a moment or two to reflect on what happened in this 
place yesterday. I feel it is very relevant to everything we as 
individual members of Parliament endeavour to do in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Yesterday we witnessed not only the breaking of a Liberal red 
book promise, but I believe the powerlessness of individual MPs 
was truly revealed. The Prime Minister promised during the last 
election campaign to give individual MPs, those in opposition as 
well as his own backbenchers, a greater say in the running of 
government. Yesterday showed how seriously he took this 
commitment to the Canadian people.
<P>
	Yesterday the government brought in time allocation to cut off 
debate on Bill C-45, a bill which we should never have debated in 
the first place. This in itself is not surprising, because the Liberals 
have closed debate about 24 times in this 35th Parliament, despite 
their howls of protest to the Tories in the last Parliament when the 
Tories took similar parliamentary action.
<P>
	In this place we should have been debating the repeal of section 
745 of the Criminal Code as outlined in the private member's bill 
of the member for York South-Weston, Bill C-234.
<P>
	I believe it is obvious to all here and, more important, out in the 
real world just how hopeless it is for an individual MP to affect 
change in this place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5025"> 5025 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians were and are demanding the repeal of section 745. 
A member responded by drafting and introducing a private 
member's bill in response. The majority of the members in the 
House of Commons supported it, sent it to the justice committee 
and it disappeared. Democracy. It is enough to make a grown man 
weep.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to Bill C-41 which seeks to make some 
sense out of this country's system of child support payments. Here 
we have yet another example of the Liberal government's attempt 
at patchwork legislation. Canadians have been clamouring for 
change in how child support payments are determined and 
enforced. The Liberals pretend to be listening and respond with 
proposals that do not truly address the basic issues of child custody. 
While this bill does take some great strides in improving the 
enforcement of child support payments, or getting tough on 
so-called deadbeat dads, it entirely skips the issue of custody 
arrangements and mediation of disputes.
<P>
	The federal government plans to involve itself in a strong arm 
approach to enforcement without looking at original access issues. 
This includes revoking or refusing to renew passports, the use of 
Revenue Canada's data banks in order to locate defaulting parents, 
the garnishment of public service pensions to pay child support as 
well as the wages of those working at sea.
<P>
	This get tough attitude toward delinquent support payments is 
appropriate only after all circumstances surrounding the original 
custody arrangements have been thoroughly analysed and only 
after attempts at voluntary support have been exhausted.
<P>
	This means that before taking such invasive measures it must be 
shown that the non-custodial parent is getting the entitled access to 
their children and that all other outstanding questions surrounding 
the custody arrangements have been resolved.
<P>
	Automated steps to withhold someone's passport, crack open 
their private income tax information or garnish their wages are 
irresponsible if used without a thorough investigation of the 
individual case. This bill does not include proposals to do this.
<P>
	There are two sides to every issue and while there is no doubt 
that children across this country are suffering because child support 
payments are going unpaid, Bill C-41 ignores that many children 
are also suffering because their right to see and enjoy the love of 
their non-custodial parent is being denied.
<P>
	I join with most of the members of this House in getting tough 
with parents who do not meet support commitments, but let us not 
encourage the problem with unfair laws. There is a relationship 
between access to children and non-compliance in support 
payments. A non-custodial parent who sees his child more often is  
much more likely to make his payments. This bill does not even 
touch on this aspect. In many cases the denial of payment is rooted 
in the non-custodial parent's frustration at being denied access to 
their children.
<P>
	According to a 1995 study by the U.S. bureau of statistics 
non-custodial parents with visitation and or joint custody were 
much more likely to pay support; 79 per cent of those with access 
paid support while only 59 per cent of those without access paid.
<P>
	A May 1992 a study by the Canadian Research Institute for Law 
and the Family found that almost 75 per cent of non-custodial 
parents reported problems in visiting their children. This shows 
that access and visitation rights in Canada are not working and this 
results in many problems, including non-compliance in child 
support.
<P>
	On March 20 of this year I introduced a private member's bill in 
the House that would also amend the Divorce Act so that joint 
custody would be automatic. Right now custody automatically goes 
to one parent unless an application for joint custody is made. Bill 
C-242 says it should be the reverse. Kids need the love and security 
of both parents. Joint custody should be automatic except in cases 
of abuse, neglect or where it is not in the child's best interests.
<P>
	We would no doubt see the number of delinquent support 
payments drop significantly once joint custody eliminated many of 
the access disputes that lead to non-payment in the first place. In 
many cases non-payment boils down to an issue of guaranteed 
access to both parents, not dollars and cents.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	In 1992 Canadian courts awarded joint custody only 16 per cent 
of the time. Sole custody is awarded to mothers approximately 72 
per cent of the time and to fathers in only 12 per cent of divorces.
<P>
	This brings about another point to consider when looking at the 
non-payment of child support. How much potential child support 
money has been tied up or wasted in fighting over access rights in 
the courts? The separation and divorce industry drains parents of 
thousands of dollars. With automatic joint custody legislation that 
is money that could go to the children instead. It can be difficult for 
a parent to pay child support while they are doling out $10,000 in 
legal fees just to see their child.
<P>
	If the custodial parent moves a child to another province or 
country, the non-custodial parent is suddenly left with no 
opportunity to see their child or faces great travel expenses to do 
so. Making certain that non-custodial parents are accountable for 
continued financial support even when they have chosen to move to 
a different provinces is a common goal of the courts and all levels 
of government. When it comes to ensuring that non-custodial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5026"> 5026 </A></B>
<P>
parents have reasonable access to their  children, the governments 
and courts are strangely silent. This is a double standard.
<P>
	In my riding of Prince George-Peace River in British Columbia 
and in other northern areas a divorce can often result in the 
custodial parent moving with the children to the lower mainland, 
severely limiting access for the non-custodial parent. It is little 
wonder that some parents withhold support payments in protest.
<P>
	Under Bill C-41 the fact that the parent's right to access was 
arbitrarily taken away would not be considered and the federal 
government would simply start proceedings to enforce payment.
<P>
	This would overlook even a supreme court ruling in May of this 
year concerning a Saskatchewan mother who choose to move with 
her daughter to Australia against the wishes of her ex-husband. The 
supreme court's decision took into account the effect of a custodial 
parent's geographic move on the access rights of the former 
spouse.
<P>
	Did the Liberals consider this when they attempted to address 
the issue of child support payments? I do not believe so. The 
Liberals have spent a good part of their mandate reviewing child 
custody and taxation issues, yet they still did not get it right. The 
finance minister has said that the first obligation of a parent is 
financial. I could not disagree more. Yes, children need financial 
security, certainly, but the emotional security of access to both 
parents cannot be overlooked. Until such time as the federal 
government is willing to take a look at the entire issue of child 
custody, the complete picture, it is not qualified to proceed with 
enforcement.
<P>
	At the very least in the absence of legislating automatic joint 
custody the federal government should be encouraging the 
provinces to be more vigilant in enforcing access problems before 
they agree to help with the enforcement of child support payments.
<P>
	The Canadian Council for Co-Parenting, a custody and access 
support group for divorcing couples, agrees that the deadbeat 
scenario is not that simple. On its position paper on custody access 
and child support the CCC claims that many loving parents are 
deparented by a legal system content with the win-lose approach. It 
says that many non-custodial parents withdraw disgusted, 
dismayed and angered by the inequities and imbalance of many 
court decisions.
<P>
	The justice minister should be familiar with the Canadian 
Council for Co-Parenting. The CCC has formally stated its 
dissatisfaction with Bill C-41. I will quote from a letter which the 
CCC sent to the justice minister. These are words which is he 
obviously ignoring: ``Our position on Bill C-41 guidelines released 
in June of 1996 is that they must be reworked. They are seriously 
flawed in their omission of shared parenting principles of treating 
both parents fairly. No loving parent, male or female, in a time of 
great turmoil or anger should be ostracized from the lives of their 
children for no good reason. C-41 aggravates and enhances the 
current inhumane imbalances in family law''. Of course the CCC is 
just one of many organizations and individuals concerned with the 
ramifications of Bill C-41.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Another issue that this bill neglects involves spending 
accountability by the custodial parent. Unfortunately, it is a sad fact 
that some custodial parents are not using child support payments to 
properly feed or clothe the child. That parent may be receiving 
substantial amounts of money from the non-custodial parent but 
they are not required to account for how the funds are spent. There 
is no mechanism in place that ensures the child support is used for 
example to buy a winter coat for a child instead of being spent by 
the custodial parent on alcohol, cigarettes or whatever.
<P>
	I want to be perfectly clear that I am not saying this is a prevalent 
occurrence. However, before the federal government begins 
vigorous enforcement actions, it must recognize that non-payment 
of child support may be due to the non-custodial parent's 
awareness that their child is not the one benefiting from those 
support payments.
<P>
	Once again there are many ambiguous questions surrounding 
child custody cases. A responsible enforcer must first scratch 
beneath the surface, investigate and then take action based upon 
complete knowledge of all the pertinent facts.
<P>
	I would like to further clarify my position on child custody laws. 
It is not my intent or desire to take sides on this issue. I am neither 
an advocate for the mothers or the fathers. I am not siding with 
custodial parents or non-custodial parents. My goal for introducing 
Bill C-242 and opposing Bill C-41 as it is currently drafted is 
twofold.
<P>
	First, the law should be administered as fairly as possible, 
treating both parents equally. When married and the relationship is 
intact, it is assumed that both people are good parents. Why assume 
otherwise just because they are divorced?
<P>
	Second and most important, I believe in supporting the children. 
When a relationship ends, they are the innocent victims. I believe 
very strongly that their emotional and psychological welfare is best 
supported by maintaining physical contact with both parents and 
there are studies that bear this out. In other words, I am an advocate 
for the kids.
<P>
	If we remove the issue of who will have sole custody from the 
equation, parents will obviously no longer be able to use custody as 
a bargaining chip. Fathers would not be able to threaten to seek sole 
custody unless the mother agrees to unreasonably low 
maintenance. Mothers likewise would be prevented from holding 
restricted access over the father's head to obtain a better divorce 
<P>

<P>
settlement. If both parents knew ahead of time with reasonable 
certainty that custody would be awarded jointly and therefore was 
not going to be an issue, there would be one less issue to fight 
about.
<P>
	As a loving parent, I cannot imagine anything worse than being 
prevented from seeing my kids. The mere thought of not having 
access to them on a continual basis provokes angry, protective 
emotions.
<P>
	When a marriage ends it is natural for the spouses to blame each 
other, to have lost respect for each other as a spouse, a lover and a 
friend. However, if the separating couple can be assisted and 
encouraged to still respect each other as loving and caring parents, 
it will provide as positive an environment as possible for the 
children.
<P>
	The awarding of joint custody in the vast majority of cases will 
nurture this respect for each other as parents and will remove the 
greatest fear every parent faces: the loss of a child. It will also 
reduce the chances of partners remaining in a potentially abusive 
relationship because they know that if they walk out without the 
children, it will be currently held against them at the custody 
hearing.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is an inadequate piece of legislation. It is inadequate 
because it does not responsibly and fairly address child custody 
laws in their entirety. This is yet another example of quick fix 
legislation. The government knows there are problems with the 
child support system and that Canadians are demanding change. 
However, instead of looking for the root of the problem, the 
government is proposing superficial and brash changes which it 
believes will appease voters in the next election.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	In its current form Bill C-41 will bring little satisfaction to 
anyone. It will only result in further emotional suffering for the 
children who are caught up in these tragic child custody laws.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
the Liberal government became involved in the issue of child 
support payments, the system was that the payer deducted the 
amount of child support payments and the recipient paid the tax on 
it. The logic for that was that usually the person who received the 
child support payments was in a lower income bracket and 
consequently would be taxed less and would therefore have more 
money available. Also, the person who was making the payments 
would be more willing to give the maximum because the payments 
would be deductible.
<P>
	The justice minister has changed that system and now child 
support is non-deductible and non-taxable. The non-deductibility 
aspect of child support payments will mean that the government 
will receive an additional $300 million in revenue. The government 
claims it will put the money into some form of child support 
subsidy or child care benefit for the Canadian public. We will have 
to wait and see.
<P>
	My concern is, with the government having made these changes, 
eliminating deductibility will encourage those people who have to 
pay to give less. Ultimately the children will suffer. They will 
receive less in benefits because less money will be given to them.
<P>
	I recognize that my colleague does not wish to pick sides on the 
issue between mother and father, but let us pick on the government 
a bit. Let us see if in its wisdom the government has actually done a 
great service or whether it has made it worse with its half measures 
and tinkering.
<P>
	I wonder if my colleague has a comment on the effect of the 
impact of what appears to be another tax grab by the government to 
generate $300 million in revenue at the expense of children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of my hon. colleague from Calgary 
Centre.
<P>
	He is quite right. I do not see the logic behind the changes which 
the government has made. I recognize there is a problem in the area 
of taxation of child support and the government moved on that. The 
reality is that the children will be poorer for it. As he correctly 
pointed out, the money will now flow into government coffers 
rather than staying in the hands of the children.
<P>
	While I recognize that Bill C-41 is moving toward setting some 
base rates for child support so that we will not see it diminish in 
cases of real need, I believe that the changes which have been made 
by the government have actually created more of an adversarial 
approach. That is unfortunate because there is already enough 
adversary surrounding divorce. It is one of the reasons in many 
cases that these things drag on for so long. They get tied up in the 
courts and people get more and more angry with the whole process.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I believe quite strongly that we have to move toward more 
mediation in these matters. The issue of who would get the tax 
credit could be decided between the parents and in the best interests 
of the children. As I said earlier, I am involved in this issue because 
I feel very strongly in being an advocate for the children, which is 
why I am speaking against this legislation.
<P>
	I will quote an expert in the field, Professor Ross Finnie of 
Carleton University School of Public Administration, on Bill C-41. 
He calls for Bill C-41 to be revisited by the justice department. He 
is not a Reformer criticizing the government. I heard an hon. 
colleague from the other side say a minute ago that nothing is new 
in that we should be criticizing the government. Part of our role is 
to criticize the government when we see there are things wrong 
with what it brings forward. In this case it is not a Reformer making 
this observation but an acknowledged expert in the field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5028"> 5028 </A></B>
<P>
	In his review, ``Good Idea, Bad Execution: The Government's 
Child Support Package'', Professor Finnie comments: ``In short, 
the basic unfairness incorporated in the current guideline 
proposals might undermine the basic goal of the whole guideline 
exercise''. He argues that overall the package is likely to worsen 
the child support situation in Canada.
<P>
	This is an expert in the field making his comments on Bill C-41. 
It is important to remember that it is not just a few Reformers, 
people like myself and my colleagues, who are being critical of the 
government; there are also people with a lot of background 
knowledge who are calling into question this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand in my 
place today to support Bill C-41 which amends various existing 
legislation to ensure that child support reforms become law.
<P>
	I am proud to do so because the Department of the Status of 
Women Canada and my predecessor, the hon. member for Mount 
Royal, played a major role in bringing this legislation to the fore. 
The hon. member did so by going around this country with a three 
person task force to meet with women, with custodial and 
non-custodial parents and the public in general. They listened to 
some of the problems and ideas that came from women, men and 
children with regard to child support. As a result, some of this 
legislation was brought into the fore.
<P>
	This was also brought about by working with the Law Reform 
Commission of Canada which again has the body of expertise that 
can understand and deal with the law. The family law committee of 
federal, provincial and territorial representatives brought 
understanding and expertise on what happens when people divorce, 
on what happens to the child.
<P>
	This piece of legislation speaks clearly to and in support of one 
person in this problem: the child. It speaks to one group of people 
who have had no one to advocate for them very strongly. This 
government has decided that we will advocate for the child.
<P>
	Above all, this reform is a tribute to the hundreds of people 
across Canada who contributed to the dialogue. We heard from men 
and women, advocates for children, for mothers and fathers. We 
heard from accountants, lawyers and social service providers to 
name only a few.
<P>
	The result before us is a law that will create a system of child 
support that is fair, equitable and beneficial to all Canadians. But 
above all, this legislation represents a balanced approach that is fair 
for children. It puts children first.
<P>
	If I could summarize this bill in one phrase, it would be that 
child support is not a discretionary payment. Both parents must 
assume responsibility for their children,  whether they live together 
or not. This is a duty, a responsibility. It is not something that a 
non-custodial parent can choose to ignore because the 
non-custodial parent has suddenly assumed a new life and wants to 
undertake a new lifestyle. The child is a responsibility of both 
parents.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	We have seen clearly that children live in the same 
socioeconomic status of the custodial parent. I am using the term 
custodial parent, but we know that the majority of custodial parents 
in the country are women and that the majority of single women 
with children are living in poverty. These children must be 
supported first and foremost by both parents. They must, if 
possible, be assisted in support by the state wherever it can be 
done. This is where the working income supplement will apply.
<P>
	When families break up it is generally the children who suffer. 
As a physician who has spent 25 years in practice, I can say that 
children suffer greatly. Many children of divorce who live with the 
mother do not have the same access to post-secondary education 
that other children have. We know many of these children are 
living pretty close to the poverty line. They are a shared 
responsibility. It is the right of the child to be financially supported 
by both parents.
<P>
	We would then create a system where families would still be 
united. But there are divorced parents and the children, therefore, 
live in different status purely because they happen through no fault 
of their own to be living in a divorced situation. Children should 
not have to bear the brunt of that. There should not be two classes 
of children in this country.
<P>
	The government applied gender based analyses to these reforms 
to ensure that neither women nor men are unfairly disadvantaged 
by the legislation. We have ensured that the outcome of the changes 
are fair and equitable to both men and women.
<P>
	The child support strategy rests on four very important pillars. 
One is the tax treatment of support payments for children. I want to 
stress the tax treatment of support payments for children, not of 
spousal support. We are talking only of child support. We have set 
up guidelines that will make it clear across the country that we are 
no longer going to have to depend on the discretion of lawyers, 
judges or courts. It will be a fair system of guidelines, based on the 
income of the non-custodial parent. It takes into consideration 
whether the non-custodial parent can afford to pay or not. It also 
makes very clear that afford to pay does not mean that child support 
for a non-custodial parent comes after the car, the holidays and the 
investments, but that child support is considered as one of the first 
and foremost duties of the non-custodial parent and not as a second 
thought.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5029"> 5029 </A></B>
<P>
	These guidelines are clear, equitable and they will be the same 
no matter where those people pay live in this country. It takes into 
consideration the cost of living, the standard of living and the tax 
treatments of each province. Different provinces will have clear 
guidelines for what the non-custodial parent must pay, based on 
the number of children, as a percentage of the income of the 
non-custodial parent.
<P>
	The third pillar on which this rests is enforcement of child 
support guidelines and child support, period. We know that many 
children do not get child support. This is a major problem. I do not 
think hon. members across in the third party would disagree that 
enforcement is extremely important.
<P>
	The fourth pillar is the working income supplement. This is the 
so-called tax grab that the hon. member just spoke about. We know 
that by changing the tax treatment of child support the federal 
government will receive a windfall of money. That money is not 
going back into federal government coffers. After $50 million of 
that money has been taken to set up the data bases and to assist 
provinces to get this going, the rest will go into a working income 
supplement which will assist 700,000 children.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	As a state we need to ensure that our children are clearly 
supported and that our children are treated equally whether their 
parents can afford to or not. Children are the future of this country.
<P>
	The first pillar of change is the way in which the child support 
system is taxed. This system has been place for 54 years. It has 
become outdated. It was an inequitable system which said parents 
who live together and who are bringing up a family do not get to tax 
deduct the money they spend on their children, but if they become 
divorced all of a sudden their child because a tax deductible 
expense. This did not make any sense at all because it was creating 
an uneven playing field.
<P>
	It was saying that if you were divorced it was better for you to be 
able to support your child because you got the tax deduction. If you 
live together as a family you were in fact being discriminated 
against in terms of caring for your children because caring for your 
children is not a tax deductible expense. It is not an expense of 
business. It is not a discretionary expense. It is a duty and a 
responsibility for parents.
<P>
	Under the new system the full amount of the support payments 
can be used to care for the child so that when a custodial parent is 
given a sum of money that custodial parent knows that all of that 
money is going to the child and that some of it does not have to go 
back to Revenue Canada so that the child only gets part of the 
money.
<P>
	Child support payment under a written agreement or court order 
made on after May 1 will therefore not be deductible to the payer or 
included in the income of the recipient for tax purposes. This has 
finally given us an equitable system and not a system that is based 
on the fact that if the custodial parent can afford a good lawyer, 
then the custodial parent gets a better amount of money for the 
child.
<P>
	We know that many custodial parents did have the money and it 
really rested on who could afford the better lawyer. This has been 
taken away now. The system is going to be fair and equitable and 
that is the second component of the pillars of this legislation. The 
guidelines are clearly set and clearly written down so that there is 
no more trying to see who could argue their way out of the paper 
bag that we have had in the past in terms of how child support has 
been accepted.
<P>
	The tax rules, however, will not automatically apply to existing 
orders. Governments cannot unilaterally change support 
agreements between parents negotiated on the basis of another set 
of rules. This is not going to be grandfathered. We know that if 
parents are not happy with the way their child support has been 
structured they can go back and seek to change it and bring it under 
the new rules if they work together to do that and if they work 
together in the best interests of the child.
<P>
	Implementation of the new rules will not take effect until the 
spring for two very important reasons. First, we expect there will 
be a large increase in applications to change existing orders to 
conform to the new child support rules because in many cases 
much of the child support that is today given is not being enforced 
and is not enough. It would cause chaos if the federal government 
did not have the provinces to establish a more efficient way to deal 
with the sudden influx of support orders.
<P>
	For that reason we have established a $50 million fund that will 
be used in partnership with the provincial government to develop, 
pilot and implement efficient and cost-effective mechanisms to 
help parents obtain, vary and update their awards.
<P>
	The second reason for leaving the implementation until May 
1997 brings me to the second pillar of child support. The 
implementation date allows us time to enact federal child support 
guidelines. These guidelines are going to make the system 
equitable.
<P>
	If I could sum up this bill in one phrase it would be that child 
support is the single most important thing that we can do for our 
children tomorrow. This legislation introduces a number of 
measures that the provinces and the territories can draw on in 
partnership with the federal government to enforce support 
payments.
<P>
	Federal pensions can be diverted so that we can garnishee from a 
federal employee who is not paying child support. We can 
garnishee out of that federal employee packages, whether it be 
pension funds or some sort of benefit funds, in order to ensure the 
child gets the support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5030"> 5030 </A></B>
<P>
	Revenue Canada's data base will now be used for the federal 
information network so that we can track defaulters. In other 
words, they can move from province to province and they can run 
but they cannot hide.
<P>
	Passports and even certain federal licences can be suspended if a 
debtor is in persistent arrears. We will develop finally a 
standardized data base across this country so that there will be 
compliance with the support orders in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	This will help both levels of government to design more 
effective mechanisms for support enforcement. In addition, the 
legislation provides for measures to help the provinces streamline 
the collection of out of province orders. In these ways the federal 
government will help the provinces to pursue what is really their 
jurisdiction which is to support enforcement programs.
<P>
	Although it is not covered in this legislation it will be noted that 
the fourth pillar of our child support strategy is the doubling of the 
working income supplement of the federal child tax benefit. This is 
the tax grab the hon. member across spoke about and conveniently 
ignored, that the money is to be going over the next five years, half 
a billion dollars, to support approximately 700,000 low income 
working families. About one-third of these families are single 
parents. These single parent families are predominantly led by 
women and they predominantly live in poverty.
<P>
	We as a government are making a very strong statement. We are 
saying that we as Canadians, all of us, whether we have children or 
not, whether we are living together with our children or not, owe it 
to all Canadian children to prepare them for the future, to prepare 
them for tomorrow, to give them equal opportunity so they can 
realize their fullest potential, so we do not continue to foster two 
sets of levels of children, those who have and those who do not 
have and who will be the people we look to carry this country 
forward in the next century. If we do not give them the tools and the 
skills, if we do not give all our children the opportunity and value 
our children, we are not truly looking to our future for tomorrow.
<P>
	The four pillars in our child support strategy reinforce one 
another. These changes have long been overdue. The government 
has studied these issues carefully and we have worked closely with 
all the stakeholders, not only the public but accountants, men and 
women, and lawyers to talk about this issue and to find the right 
answers. This is not a thrown together piece of legislation, as hon. 
members across the floor would have us believe. This was 
discussed in public hearings. I do not know if the hon. members 
even went to the public hearings or even listened to some of the 
information we heard from men and women who spoke on behalf 
of the children of this country.
<P>
	More important, our children deserve the right to be treated 
fairly. They deserve the right not to have to be forced to live with 
<P>
the consequences of what their parents have done and with the 
power struggles between parents as we have seen in the past. Our 
children deserve to be given every opportunity. This bill does 
exactly that for all our children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to summarize this bill in one word for the hon. parliamentary 
secretary who spoke with such glowing words. It is a mistake.
<P>
	It is a mistake in a lot of ways. There were some misconceptions 
within her statements that I would like to clarify. The 
parliamentary secretary is concerned about child support and how 
children are important and I agree 150 per cent. However, the way 
the government is going about will hurt the children more than help 
them.
<P>
	In that tax grab that we talk about, which she has now identified, 
in the neighbourhood of $.5 billion, 30 per cent to 40 per cent of 
that goes, as she admitted herself, into overhead, into a federal 
bureaucracy, into a federal administration. She said initially it will 
take $50 million of that. That is not helping children. That is 
creating jobs in government. That is what it is doing. It is hurting 
the children, at the expense of children.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary talks about how the person who 
pays used it as a tax deduction and a person might as well get a 
divorce because they got a tax deduction if they have children. The 
adjudicator determined between the couple divorcing in the case of 
children the amount of money paid based on need and ability to pay 
and an amount was set. Yes, it was deductible and taxable. What 
that really is, if the parliamentary secretary considers this for a 
moment, is if the amount is $10,000 and the individual makes 
$50,000 to $60,000 in income, it is a deferral of $10,000 of income 
to the person who is looking after the children.
<P>
	The principle of taxation is that we tax income. That deferral 
from the $50,000, $60,000, $25,000 or $100,000 is a deferral to the 
custodial parent. That parent paid the tax. Do you know what? In 
that system, that is a tight system. There is no leakage there. There 
is no government bureaucracy taking 30 or 40 per cent of that 
money. All the money is going to the children. The taxes paid on 
that are paid at a lower rate.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I submit that the single biggest mistake in this bill is doing away 
with deductibility and taxability of child support. Arbitrarily 
setting amounts across the country no matter where a person 
lives-this is the amount-is a good principle. It should be applied 
to UI as well.
<P>
	Why should somebody in Alberta paying $1 get 75 cents in 
benefits and somebody in Newfoundland paying $1 getting $3.75 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5031"> 5031 </A></B>
<P>
in benefits? If the parliamentary secretary would apply that same 
principle to UI, then the government might be making some sense.
<P>
	This bill is a mistake. It is a mistake to intrude into the lives of 
people in a way that will just support more government 
bureaucracy. It is a mistake to intrude into the lives of people and 
say that government will now look after the children, not the 
parents. Government is taking money away from the parents' 
ability to look after the children.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, I find the hon. member's question to 
be so absolutely typical of someone who does not really 
understand. He has never been there and does not even understand 
the reality of the lives of divorced families and of children of 
divorce.
<P>
	This is the kind of statement that you would hear from an upper 
middle class male who does not have a clue. The hon. member talks 
about child support and that the adjudicator takes into 
consideration the real need and ability of the parent to pay. That is 
absolute rubbish.
<P>
	Child support has, in the past, been dictated by who had the 
better lawyer. Invariably the custodial parent did not have the 
money to have the better lawyer and was at the wrong end of the 
stick. The point here is that it is the children who suffer.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about income tax and child support. The 
interesting thing is that we get this kind of information coming 
across the floor because when you try to answer the question, you 
are not even given the courtesy of their listening to the answer. 
Misinformation continues to be fostered. They really do not want 
to hear the answer. The answer is that child support is not spousal 
support. Spousal support is income in the hands of the custodial 
parent. Child support is income in the hands of the child.
<P>
	Parents who live together do not deduct the support for their 
child. They do not get to deduct it. Why should it be that we have 
this uneven system of parents who are not living together with their 
family get to deduct child support? Child support is not a 
discretionary thing. Child support is an absolute duty to the child.
<P>
	I also heard the hon. member asking me about using 30 to 40 per 
cent of the half a million dollars in order to create a bureaucratic 
structure. I am not a mathematician. I certainly never claimed to be 
one. However, when I last looked 40 per cent of a half billion was 
not $15 million. This is grade 2 arithmetic we are talking about 
here. It is interesting that this kind of arithmetic comes out. Fifteen 
million dollars is not half of a half billion dollars. That is not 40 per 
cent of it.
<P>
	One of the important things to remember is that if there is a 
system that is fair and equitable, that is going to be tracking people, 
you have to use the technology so the information is available 
across this country. That has been the major problem of 
enforcement. People leave provinces. They go to other provinces. 
No one can find  them. They do not know where they are. If the 
defaulter cannot be tracked, support payments cannot be enforced.
<P>
	It is a clear issue. We know that 43 per cent of non-custodial 
parents in the province of Ontario today do not pay a penny of child 
support. Of the remainder, only about 30 per cent of them manage 
to pay the full amount.
<P>
	We are talking here about major default. We have to set into 
place the structures to help these children. Saying that this is a lot 
of rubbish actually means that the hon. member does not even 
understand the issue to start off with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the minister with interest, especially in her response to 
the comments to the member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	What I heard the minister say was that the non-custodial parent 
had a duty to make payments but that the payments were not put in 
the hands of the custodial parent but in the hands of the children. 
That simply is not true. The custodial parent administers the 
payments that are made to those children.
<P>
	The minister also said earlier in her speech that the non-custodial 
parent has a duty to make sure there was an enforcement of child 
support payments. I agree with that, but I would like to ask if she 
thinks there is also a duty, on behalf of the custodial parent, to 
spend that money on the children. We all know of cases where the 
money is not necessarily spent on those children. Is there not a duty 
for the custodial parent as well?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question. Maybe I 
did not make my point clearly enough. I did not say that the money 
for child support was not money put in the hands of the 
non-custodial parent. It was not directed to the custodial parent. It 
was directed to the child. Of course if the child is a minor then the 
custodial parent has a duty to use the money in the best interest of 
the child. This is different from spousal support which is not what 
we are talking about here. Spousal support is income in the hands 
of the custodial spouse and is tax deductible and should be. We are 
talking about two very different things here.
<P>
	The hon. member asks whether it is the duty of the custodial 
parent to take the money for child support and spent it on the child. 
Yes, it is the duty.
<P>
	Whatever stories or anecdotes we hear from the hon. member 
opposite to try to support his position that most custodial parents 
take that money and fritter it away on something for themselves is 
absolute nonsense. Most children of divorced parents are living a 
very low income status. The custodial parents are trying very hard 
to use that money in the best interest of the child. Often these 
children are not clothed or fed properly because the  money is given 
back in taxes to the government. We are saying that is no longer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5032"> 5032 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate. Money should go directly to the child and not to the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to join my colleagues to debate Bill C-41. One of my hon. 
friends said that it is a mistake that this legislation is before us. We 
just had a long speech from the Minister of State for the Status of 
Women and not once did I hear her say she cared for and supported 
families, that she wanted to nurture families, that families were the 
fundamental building blocks of our society and that if we were to 
focus on nurturing, supporting, protecting and building the 
families, a lot of the problems we have would not occur.
<P>
	Instead, we find that the government wants to probe, analyse, 
tax, regulate and push around families, as if they are something like 
a vehicle that everybody jumps into and they can just control the 
vehicle.
<P>
	The point is that the government has it wrong. This whole 
concept that families can be probed, analysed, regulated and taxed 
and the money can be passed through the government's pocket, that 
they take from one and give to another and pay the bureaucrats in 
between. Surely we should be talking about protecting, nurturing, 
building and strengthening families. We should ensure that 
families play the real role in our society. No one can raise kids 
better than families. That is why the bill is a mistake.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of State for the Status of Women talked about how 
important it is that we are going to regulate the system, how 
important it is that we are going to collect all this taxation, how 
important it is that we are going to have a new program and how 
important it is that we are going to give the money back to the kids. 
The government has missed the point. Where is the support?
<P>
	We have known for years that the Income Tax Act penalizes 
families. We know that the Income Tax Act has given a greater 
benefit to families that break up rather than to the families which 
stay together. That is a terrible indictment for a government which 
is in charge of helping our society. It seems to be quite happy with 
the concept of regulating. If the family breaks up the government 
will give it another program. If the family breaks up the 
government will collect taxes in a different way and channel them 
back through the bureaucracy.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have always said that the dollars 
which are left in the hands of the families will be better 
administered than if those dollars are handed back to the families 
through a program. The government has missed the point entirely.
<P>
	I had an accounting business before I got into this game. I met 
many families which had broken up. The statistics published by 
Statistics Canada confirm what I  saw personally. There is hurt and 
damage. Self-confidence is destroyed. Job stability is threatened. 
The family breaks apart and one-half moves to a different location. 
Sometimes the family is destroyed. There is little doubt that in 
many cases the standard of living goes down. That is unfortunate. 
We have to help these people.
<P>
	We do not help them by bringing in legislation which contains a 
bunch of rules and regulations. On page 22 of the bill, at clause 77, 
after the government has poked and probed and administered and 
regulated and pushed around all these families, Her Majesty, in 
right of Canada, disclaims all responsibility for discharging the 
obligations under the act. While the government figures that it can 
get involved in the day to day administration of families, in the 
running of families, and so on and so forth, if it screws up, do not 
blame the government.
<P>
	The Minister of State for the Status of Women mentioned the 
hearings which were held across Canada where women could say 
this and women could say that. I did not hear anything about men 
being invited to participate. That being so, we have to take a look at 
the failure of the Liberal policies over the years.
<P>
	Back in the sixties the government introduced the great concept 
of universality for pensioners. It said: ``Do not worry. We are here. 
We are going to look after everybody. Everybody is going to get the 
same old age security. Everybody is going to get a pension''. The 
first thousand dollars of pension money that a senior would get 
would be tax free. That rule has been in place for many years. That 
universality is gone. In 2001 it will be gone. Pensioners will not get 
old age security because in the year 2001 there will be no old age 
security. It will be gone. The first thousand dollars of income tax 
deduction which pensioners have relied on for many years will be 
gone. The age deduction for seniors in the year 2001 will be gone. 
The guaranteed income supplement for the poor in the year 2001 
will be gone. Universality is going out the window with it and in 
comes another seniors benefit program. We are going to massage, 
regulate, poke, administer and push around all these seniors though 
all the paperwork they will have to file. Their universality program 
for seniors failed. So they just walked away.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Now the Prime Minister stands in the House and says: ``Health 
care. We go for universality, one of the five principles; universality 
of health care in this country. That it is important to Canadians''.
<P>
	Remember, the federal government says that universality across 
the country is provincially administered. I have a letter on my desk 
from someone who lives in Edmonton. This person happens to be a 
Canadian missionary who lives here and travels the world 
spreading the good word, doing good work with the poor and the 
underprivileged. She also works in countries in Africa where the 
standard of living is abysmally low. She returns to Canada for
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5033"> 5033 </A></B>
<P>
some months to visit with her family and then returns to foreign 
countries. She is a Canadian citizen and she has no health care.
<P>
	She comes and goes as resident of Canada, a Canadian citizen, 
paying Canadian taxes. Under the universal health care program 
promoted by the Prime Minister and the Liberal government she 
has nothing, absolutely nothing. The universality of health care is 
eroding.
<P>
	The government said: ``We blew it with pensions, health care is 
crumbling. What about kids? Let us move on to kids''. Bill C-41 is 
now the social engineering for kids. We heard the minister of state 
for the status of women say that all kids are going to be equal. We 
are going to ensure that all kids are equal. There is no such thing as 
equal opportunity anymore, but there are going to be equal results. 
Therefore we know that when there are equal results it means 
poverty for all. There will be no opportunity to rise above and be 
the best possible because as soon as a person says he is going to 
work hard a be a great Canadian, do the best he can to have a good 
standard of living-zap, taxation.
<P>
	These are the types of things, this social engineer, the 
government is trying to do and must be stopped.
<P>
	There is no mention in the bill about mediation. I am married, I 
have a wife and two kids and sometimes we have our 
disagreements so we have to mediate and resolve our differences. 
Families that break up are those that have differences they cannot 
resolve by themselves. Mediation has proven to work. It works to 
help families stay together. It works in every other environment. 
Employers and employees mediate.
<P>
	General Motors and its union last night mediated to the point 
where they disagreed and said they agree to disagree. But they will 
get together one day soon and the workers will get back to work 
through mediation. Families that have problems need mediation.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	But Bill C-41 says no, we are going to regulate this broken 
marriage, we are going to regulate the kids and we are going to 
collect the taxes from one and give to the other because we know 
how it is done. We know that one shoe fits all, one rule fits all and 
there is no such thing as families being themselves. The 
government is going to get right into administering the families and 
right into the bedrooms.
<P>
	Remember Mr. Trudeau said the government has no business in 
the bedrooms of the nation. Here is an interesting side note. Last 
week Statistics Canada phoned a couple in my riding. The 
questions asked by its representatives do not belong in this House. 
Questions about the personal intimate things that go on in the 
bedrooms of the nation are being asked by Stats Canada: ``Can you 
tell me all the things that go on in there?''
<P>
	And when they finished with the questionnaire, the Stats Canada 
representative asked for my constituent's Alberta health care 
number so they could go back to the record and know who gave 
certain answers to the questions: ``Now I can relate these questions 
about bedroom activities with their health status''.
<P>
	This government is getting far too intrusive. It is time for it to 
recognize the sanctity of the family, to promote the family, to help 
the family. When families need it, they should get mediation.
<P>
	The government introduced a grid to make everything fair, so 
everyone would get the same. We have judges who make $130,000 
a year and we give them the right to determine if somebody will be 
locked up for 25 years or longer or if he will walk free. We give 
them the total and absolute freedom to make decisions on many 
things.
<P>
	They decide on the validity of multi-billion dollar contracts. 
They decide who gets what. They have total and absolute power 
over everything, but we do not give them the discretion to take a 
look at the family standing before them to decide what is best.
<P>
	These people are educated. They are the best trained in the 
country. They are compassionate people. They have the interests of 
the family in mind. But this government says that while judges 
have authority on everything else, it will not trust them with 
deciding how much should be paid in child support.
<P>
	It is a disgusting disgrace that this government wants to impose 
that type of an affront on the judiciary of this country which is 
perfectly capable of making these decisions itself. Because every 
family is unique, judges should be given the opportunity to decide 
what is important.
<P>
	Think of the commission salesman. Think of the seasonal 
employee whose income goes up and down. But he will get a court 
order that every month he must come up with this cash. When the 
family was together its fortunes rose and fell according to his 
income. As a seasonal employee, in the good months the cash 
would flow in and the family could enjoy a little luxury, but it had 
to tighten the reins when the money was not so readily available.
<P>
	It is the same with the commission salesman. If he has a good 
month, he will get a big paycheque; if he has a bad month, his 
income will go down. And the family goes along with it.
<P>
	Not anymore. The non-custodial parent is going to see these 
fluctuations through on their own, and according to this grid the 
family will be protected from the vagaries and fluctuations of the 
non-custodial parent's income. That person will be hounded 
practically down the road for his last dollar if he does not live up to 
his agreement. Is that helping families?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5034"> 5034 </A></B>
<P>
	This government has not thought about these kind of people. 
It has not built that into the system.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	With regard to violation of privacy, we have a longstanding 
tradition in this country that says our income tax files are private, 
but not anymore. Through social engineering, Bill C-41 allows 
people to have access to Revenue Canada.
<P>
	On page 16, section 19, it says section 15 of the Family Orders 
and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act is replaced by the 
following: ``Information banks that may be searched under this part 
are the information banks designated by regulations from among 
the information banks controlled by the Department of National 
Health and Welfare, the Department of National Revenue, Canada 
Employment and Immigration Commission''.
<P>
	If there is a deadbeat non-custodial parent out there you can 
guarantee he is not going to file a tax return anymore. You are not 
going to get your money and the family is not going to get the 
money and we now have two losers instead of one because this 
government's heavy handedness says there is nothing that we want 
to protect from intrusion. Privacy means nothing when it comes to 
the government. The information banks we always thought were 
private are no longer private. Therefore you can guarantee that we 
will not see any income tax return or any taxes collected from 
someone who wishes to evade the whole system.
<P>
	It is very unfortunate that this government will not support 
families. The member for Mission-Coquitlam has talked long 
about grandparents rights; visiting rights for grandparents who 
when a family breaks up, if they are the parents of the 
non-custodial parent, cannot see their grandchildren. The love and 
the nurturing that grandparents want to bestow on the children are 
denied sometimes, and this government does not care.
<P>
	Surely that is what it is all about, the love and nurturing of 
families, not the regulation, the taxation, the poking, the pushing, 
the managing and manipulating this government is going to do.
<P>
	Let me leave it there. It would please me if the government 
would withdraw this bill and bring in something positive that 
would help families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I truly 
enjoy rising when a member of the third party is done because it is 
easy to ask questions of his intervention in the House. I have a few 
questions. I will make them quick because I would like to get up on 
my feet again to ask another series of questions if I get the chance.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the member's speech as to where the 
Reform Party stands. In all that rambling I heard in the last 20 
<P>
minutes he never once told us what the Reform would do as it 
relates to individuals who, as the member put it, are not capable of 
reconciling whether it be through mediation or one process or 
another.
<P>
	The member was unclear but he was suggesting in his remarks 
that an individual who happens to be divorced, in most cases a 
mother who has one, two or three children, is not a family. Can the 
member explain to me why he seems to think the only definition of 
a family is someone that has two parents and a number of children, 
whether he agrees with the reality of the situation that in Canada it 
is a pretty close even split that there are many families that have 
only one parent either because they decide to through divorce and 
cannot reconcile or a parent passes away and they carry on as a 
single parent.
<P>
	I would like those two questions answers. The one that is the 
most important is the definition. The other one, and I am not 
surprised, is what is Reform suggesting in that it does not like this 
bill? That is acceptable I suppose to us on this side. That means it 
must be a pretty good one. What would Reform do to replace it?
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I am rather surprised that the 
member would ask where the Reform Party stands, when it is the 
government that has brought forward this bill. I thought it was this 
bill that we were debating but I am pleased to answer the member's 
question.
<P>
	We stand for families. Government should help nurture and 
encourage families rather than regulate and tax them. Remember, 
as I said, the Income Tax Act has always discriminated against a 
family that has stayed together and a family that splits apart. That 
is discriminated against. Yet we know that families are the building 
blocks of our society and we discriminate against them.
<P>
	The second point is families that have children usually start off 
with a couple of parents, as far as I am aware. They come together 
and unfortunately through problems they do not stay together. They 
are people, they are Canadians and we have to respect their right to 
live, work and try to be the best that they can be.
<P>
	My experience is that when a family falls apart, everyone 
suffers. The non-custodial parent suffers and the custodial parent 
suffers and it is what we call a broken family. There are children 
involved and usually they are innocent of the causes of the broken 
family, but they are definitely, according to the research we have, 
the group that suffers the most.
<P>
	That is why I said we believe in mediation first because 
mediation works within families who stay together. Mediation 
works in other environments but there is not the slightest hint of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5035"> 5035 </A></B>
<P>
one nickel of time, effort or any other commitment by this 
government toward mediation to keep that family together.
<P>
	We say get the grid out of there because a judge who makes 
$130,000 and passes judgment can surely decide what is best for 
that family when it is sitting or standing in front of him. As in the 
couple of examples I gave, a grid will destroy individuals, not help 
them.
<P>
	I am totally opposed to the income tax change because people 
will stop filing tax returns. The government will lose. The 
government will not collect the money. There will be no 
opportunity for parents to get back together. It will drive a wedge 
between them and will force them even further apart.
<P>
	As I also mentioned, grandparents are a part of families too. My 
hon. colleague from Mission-Coquitlam has tried hard to get this 
government to recognize grandparents who want to love and 
nurture their grandchildren. They are not even recognized by this 
government as playing any role whatsoever. They can play a major 
role in helping children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, for the record, the member was not 
willing to verify whether he or his party agree that a single parent 
with children is a family. He skirted around it and said they were 
good Canadians and the whole bit but he would not say whether he 
thought they were truly a family like every other family which 
happens to be in Canada.
<P>
	I want to ask the member about this whole issue of intrusiveness 
in the family and the whole issue of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I will refer to what has been taking place in the provincial 
legislature in Ontario in the last few days. Members on the other 
side like to talk about their great friend the Mike Harris 
government and how close it relates to the Reform Party. That 
government just introduced a child support payment bill. I want to 
bring to the member's attention a couple of areas in the bill and ask 
him if he agrees or disagrees with what the Ontario government is 
doing. It is important if in fact he believes that our bill is so 
intrusive.
<P>
	In the new bill that was presented to the legislature this is what 
the Ontario government is proposing to do. Parents who default on 
payments under the government's family support plan could have 
their driver's licences suspended and their names could be reported 
to credit bureaus.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Also included is obtaining financial statements of defaulters and 
making support orders against third parties who shelter the 
defaulter's assets; seizing 50 per cent of any funds in a joint bank 
account with the delinquent parent's new partner; and seizing 
lottery winnings of more than $1,000. Keep in mind that 77 per 
cent in default owe more than $1 billion in the province  of Ontario. 
In fact, 97 per cent of those defaulters are fathers of that family the 
member talks about.
<P>
	I want the member to answer one question. Does he think this is 
too intrusive? It sounds similar to what we are proposing to do 
when he talked especially about obtaining financial statements. I 
would like to know whether he agrees or disagrees with the Ontario 
government's move in relation to trying to deal with what is called 
in this article, deadbeat parents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, let us remember that this 
government is setting up this whole regulatory process before 
mediation. There is no mention of mediation. There is no mention 
of positive help for a family. All it is concerned about is picking up 
and regulating the broken pieces.
<P>
	Yes, there are situations where people try to avoid their 
responsibilities. The Reform Party is concerned about those as 
much as anyone else. These are the unfortunate types of things that 
have to be dealt with as a last resort but this government is dealing 
with them as a first resort. That is the point I want to get across. 
The government's first resort is: let us regulate, let us browbeat, let 
us help ourselves, let us seize, let us take away, let us tax. There is 
no help, no sympathy, no recognition of these people as 
individuals. If we could help them get back together, all this 
regulation would then be irrelevant, except in a small number of 
situations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate. I would like to remind the hon. members in this House that 
we are now in the 10-minute speech period with no questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to join in this debate, although most 
everything has probably been said. When I listened to the 
comments coming from across the floor, certainly everything there 
is being said again because it simply does not seem to get through.
<P>
	I just listened to the member for Kenora-Rainy River for some 
reason try to trap my colleague from St. Albert into some kind of 
remark about families including single parent families. Of course 
no one on this side of the House would deny that single parents 
with children are families. Certainly I will not apologize and I do 
not think anyone should apologize for supporting the traditional 
two parent family with children. That is the ideal.
<P>
	If we were to talk to single parents anywhere in this country, be 
they men or women, they would choose to be in a relationship with 
two parents and with children. That is what everyone in this 
country strives for. We in this party make no apologies for 
supporting the traditional family and opposing the government in 
its recognition of all manner of alternative arrangements it would 
propose to refer to as families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5036"> 5036 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been huge problems around the whole issue of 
divorce, family break-up, child support and child custody. There 
is a need in this country for the government to address those 
issues.
<P>
	The minister of state said earlier that they had travelled across 
the country listening to Canadians on the issue before the bill was 
drafted. Unfortunately what I see in this bill, if they truly went out 
and listened to Canadians, is not what Canadians were telling them. 
It certainly addresses one issue that probably one segment of 
Canadians would have them address, but it does not address the 
whole issue in a comprehensive way.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In some instances the failure of non-custodial parents to pay 
child support is a major problem and needed to be addressed in a 
pretty substantive way. This bill establishes four different areas of 
federal guidelines for support. There is the grid we have heard so 
much about. I will talk more about each area a little later.
<P>
	There is also the opening of the Revenue Canada databases for 
search in cases of payment default; the denying of passports and 
licences to individuals who are persistently in arrears; and a 
provision for the garnishment of wages from public servants and 
seamen. On the last one, I find it interesting that the government 
would single out individuals working at sea. I do not know where 
that one comes from. Why do individuals at sea warrant specific 
attention any more than individuals working anywhere else? 
Maybe it has something to do with the longstanding reputation of 
sailors around the world. However, it seems strange that it is in 
there.
<P>
	This issue is a major problem and I applaud the government for 
at least attempting to address part of it.
<P>
	I listened to the minister talk at some length about child poverty, 
the favourite Liberal buzzword. It always disturbs me when I hear 
parliamentarians refer to the absolute necessity of solving child 
poverty in this country. It is unrealistic. We do not solve child 
poverty without solving family poverty.
<P>
	If addressing the default in support payments is an attempt to 
address the problem of family poverty, it should strike fear into the 
hearts of non-custodial parents everywhere. If they are expected to 
solve the problem of single mothers with children living in poverty, 
then a huge responsibility is being put on them. I do not believe that 
is fair.
<P>
	One of the problems all of us in Canada are quite familiar with is 
that 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce. Most of us have either 
been touched by the reality of divorce or have personally 
experienced it. As a member of parliament, I have certainly heard 
many divorced mothers and fathers discuss the problems 
surrounding this issue. There are a lot of real issues that need to be 
addressed. I wish the government had used a broader brush when it 
dealt with this matter and had  dealt with some of the other issues 
besides support payments.
<P>
	While at first glance the bill certainly looks broad and all 
encompassing, when one examines it, the bill is lacking. One of the 
issues we heard discussed earlier which has not been addressed in 
the bill but should have been is the whole issue of tax deductibility 
of child support payments as announced in the last budget. The fact 
that the government took half a billion dollars out of the hands of 
single mothers and custodial parents and put it into the government 
coffers saying that it was much more able to provide benefits to 
children by taking that away from parents and providing the 
benefits through government programs is assuming an awful lot on 
the part of government. One of the other issues that I hear about 
when I talk to divorced fathers who do not have custody of their 
children is the problem of access. Because of the adversarial court 
system, it is not the children going to court against the parents, it is 
one parent going to court against the other parent. One parent loses 
and one parent wins. That is the nature of court settlements. Often 
what is good for the child is not taken into account. In many 
instances custody is not dealt with fairly and access has not been 
addressed. It is unfortunate that the issue of access was not 
addressed by this bill.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	This is a piecemeal bill, not unlike many other initiatives which 
the government has brought forward over the last three years. The 
Liberal government addresses the issues that the Canadian public 
wants it to address, but it only deals with the issues that are easy to 
deal with and avoids the more controversial ones. That is 
unfortunate.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kenora-Rainy River asked what we 
would do in this situation. It has been stated before, but I will 
repeat it. We would approach the whole problem in a more 
comprehensive manner and would deal with the issue as a whole. 
We would focus on the issue of family support payments and 
enforcement of those support payments. That part of the bill is 
good. However, we would begin with a compulsory mediation 
process.
<P>
	Those of us, like myself, who have been married for 30 years and 
have raised a family, know what it takes to make a marriage work. 
A willingness to mediate disputes is one of the things which keeps 
marriages together. When a marriage is falling apart, a system of 
compulsory mediation would go a long way in getting the marriage 
back on track. If it failed, at least it would make the split less 
painful for the children.
<P>
	We would also include access provisions for both parents, unless 
that was not in the best interests of the children. Of course there are 
cases when a parent should not have access, but those truly are the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5037"> 5037 </A></B>
<P>
exception. We would also include access provisions for the 
extended family, which would include grandparents.
<P>
	We would also deal with the way the tax system treats families 
and give all the benefits and encouragement that we possibly could 
to traditional family units under the tax system. It is quite clear that 
we would take a much broader approach to this whole issue.
<P>
	I would like to address briefly the grid issue. It would be nice if 
everyone's life was as structured as the grid would have it. We 
could lay out the grid and someone making this much would pay 
this much money. That would be great, but unfortunately that is not 
the way life is. Different families with the same family income 
certainly do not have the same standard of living, nor do they enjoy 
the same benefits. Everyone has different circumstances and 
everyone manages their lives differently. It is unfortunate the 
government is trying to make everyone fit into these square holes. 
There needs to be more flexibility by the courts in addressing 
different circumstances. It is very unfortunate that the bill is so 
rigid-

moved that Bill C-55, an act to amend the Criminal Code (high risk 
offenders), the Corrections and  Conditional Release Act, the 
Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the 
Department of the Solicitor General Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to a bill that will make an important 
contribution to the safety of our communities. The high risk 
offender bill responds to a problem that Canadians have told us is 
their priority concern in the criminal justice area, namely the threat 
they perceive from sex offenders and other violent offenders.
<P>
	In effect, Bill C-55 lays out a new sentencing regime for the 
worst categories of offenders. It changes and fortifies several parts 
of the Criminal Code and I invite members to give close attention 
to these amendments, particularly to the amendments that have 
potential to help the police, the prosecutors, judges and 
correctional authorities to do their jobs better.
<P>
	These amendments improve the dangerous offender procedure of 
part XXIV of the Criminal Code, create a new long term offender 
sentencing category targeted at sex offenders, and establish a new 
form of judicial restraint order that will place controls on persons 
who clearly pose a threat to the security of our communities.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has held the portfolio for three years. He 
recognizes the passions and fears that the issue of crime inspires in 
many Canadians. The government has acknowledged the challenge 
of violent crime in the first speech from the throne. Since then the 
Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of Justice have 
worked steadily to develop effective anti-crime legislation.
<P>
	The government has sought the views of all Canadians in this 
process. The Minister of Justice has tried to meet as many 
Canadians as possible to obtain their insights into community 
safety and how to ensure it. He has frequently met with victims 
groups, police groups and crime prevention committees.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	He has discovered that Canadians want the justice system to be 
more focused as far as violent crime is concerned. They want to see 
tough measures applied to high risk offenders but the more he 
consults, the more he hears that people do not want simplistic 
solutions.
<P>
	Whether talking about crime prevention, policing, sentencing or 
parole, Canadians expect governments to devise well crafted well 
focused laws that really home in on the categories or sub-categories 
of offenders who commit serious crimes of personal violence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5038"> 5038 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me turn to the proposal for a long term offender sentencing 
category because it is central to the package and exemplifies what 
I believe is a well tailored and well focused strategy.
<P>
	The new long term offender procedure would be created in the 
Criminal Code to help us in the sentencing of repeat sex offenders. 
I am referring to pedophiles, the various levels of sexual assault, 
sexual touching, sexual exploitation, exposure and sexual 
interference. These are offences which may involved children or 
adults as victims. These are offenders who, unfortunately, 
frequently show a long pattern of offending.
<P>
	Under the new procedure, when the prosecution identifies such 
repeat offending, it can make an application for a special hearing 
into the risks posed by the persons found guilty under these 
sections of the Criminal Code. Where the court finds that there is a 
pattern of repetitive behaviour showing a likelihood of the offender 
causing death or injury to other persons or inflicting severe 
psychological damage, it can declare him or her to be a long term 
offender.
<P>
	The judge will then impose a penitentiary sentence-in effect 
the normal sentence for the sex crime in question-but also make 
an order which can add up to 10 years of intensive community 
supervision. This long term supervision period begins only when 
the long term offender has finished the full prison sentence, 
including parole and any other period of conditional release.
<P>
	Thus, for example, someone convicted of sexual assault might 
receive a sentence of eight years imprisonment with an added ten 
years of supervision. Eight years from now, after completing the 
full sentence of imprisonment and any parole time, the offender 
would begin 10 years of supervision. The National Parole Board 
would set whatever conditions were necessary. These could involve 
very intensive rules for the offender, controlling his conduct, his 
use of alcohol, his access to places where children congregate and 
so forth. A requirement to report to a Correctional Service of 
Canada supervisor as often as is deemed necessary could also be 
made a condition.
<P>
	We are giving teeth to this supervision system. We propose a 
new Criminal Code offence of breach of an order of long term 
supervision. This is an indictable offence carrying a maximum 
penalty of 10 years imprisonment. A charge can be laid whenever a 
long term offender without reasonable excuse fails or refuses to 
comply with the order. These new sentencing tools will extend the 
authority of the criminal justice system to monitor and control sex 
offenders.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to clarify the relationship between the 
long term offender category and the dangerous offender procedure. 
The question will be raised, should not the dangerous offender 
procedure, which carries an indeterminate sentence, be applied to 
all these sex offenders? The short answer is that it often will  be. 
Most of the sex offences in the long term offender category, such as 
sexual assault, can equally support a dangerous offender 
application.
<P>
	The solicitor general, a colleague of the Minister of Justice, 
released a research study in May which showed that 92 per cent of 
the successful dangerous offender applications involved sex 
offences. Dangerous offender and long term offender sentencing 
are complementary but they are not necessarily redundant.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Over the past 20 years dangerous offender rulings averaged 13 to 
15 offenders annually. However, several hundred sex offenders are 
admitted to federal penitentiaries each year. Some may be potential 
dangerous offender candidates but many more, though certainly not 
all, could be candidates for the long term offender application. The 
difference is, in the assessment of risk in a long term offender case, 
the court must find not only that there is a substantial risk of 
reoffending but at the same time there is a reasonable possibility of 
eventual control of that risk through community supervision.
<P>
	As I have described, the judge will then structure the sentence 
with the appropriate combination of penitentiary time and the 
community supervision order. In effect, prosecutors will have 
flexibility in seeking a dangerous offender finding or a long term 
offender finding.
<P>
	When a conviction for a serious sex offence occurs the crown 
can ask the court to remand the offender for a detailed assessment 
of the nature and degree of risk posed by that individual. The crown 
can then decide which way to go, dangerous offender application or 
a long term offender application.
<P>
	Actually Bill C-55 provides that if the court does not find that 
the criteria for a dangerous offender finding are satisfied it can still 
make a long term offender finding and sentence the offender 
accordingly.
<P>
	Some will ask why we are not simply increasing the prison 
periods for all sex offenders. We are calling this the high risk 
offender bill, not the throw away the key bill. The Criminal Code 
already provides for lengthy sentences for sex offences. For 
example, sexual assault causing bodily harm carries a maximum of 
14 years.
<P>
	Our goal is not simply to lock up every sex offender indefinitely 
although, as noted, an indeterminate dangerous offender sentence 
remains an option in some cases. Our goal is to reduce the risk 
posed by this special group of offenders. The reality is most 
offenders will eventually return to the community having served 
their time. Community safety is not assured by the sudden release 
of offenders from a prison environment.
<P>
	We need to control sex offenders through a combination of jail 
time and managed reintegration. A long term supervision order
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5039"> 5039 </A></B>
<P>
can result in an effective doubling of the period that a sex offender 
remains under the control of the state, the control of Correctional 
Service Canada.
<P>
	I share the concern of Canadians about recidivism by pedophiles 
and other sex offenders. Now we will be able to structure the 
sentence, closely monitor the conduct of the long term offender and 
provide the support the offender needs to successfully readapt to 
the community.
<P>
	I am sure figures will be thrown at me showing that pedophiles 
remain an ongoing risk, that the risk of reoffending is still there 
even after several years. Do not forget that long term offender 
procedure includes enforceable conditions. Any breach of the 
conditions of a long term supervision order can result in the 
offender's being immediately brought back into custody and if 
serious enough lead to the prosecution for a newly created offence 
of breach of an order.
<P>
	On the other hand, it seems that full compliance over a 10 year 
period with the potentially stringent conditions of a long term 
supervision order will be a good indication of a reduced risk of 
reoffending.
<P>
	I have mentioned the dangerous offender procedure several 
times. We are introducing amendments to improve part XXIV of 
the Criminal Code without changing the essential elements of the 
system which the Supreme Court of Canada has described as a 
valid form of sentencing. It will no longer be possible for the court 
to hand down a fixed sentence to a dangerous offender. An 
indeterminate sentence will be the only option. Of the 176 
dangerous offenders to date only 7 have received a determinate or 
fixed sentence.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, we believe that it makes little sense for the courts 
and the prosecution to go through the extensive dangerous offender 
procedure only to obtain a fixed sentence that might be close to 
what the offender would have received in ordinary circumstances. 
The core of the dangerous offender finding is that the individuals 
represent an ongoing risk, the limits of which cannot easily be 
predicted.
<P>
	An indeterminate sentence is the appropriate one. Currently a 
dangerous offender gets an initial parole review at the third year 
point; that is, three years after being taken into custody. We 
propose to move the initial parole review date from the third year to 
the seventh year. Subsequent parole reviews would occur every two 
years thereafter.
<P>
	We feel this change is justified by the fact that dangerous 
offenders present a very high level of risk to the public and that risk 
is not likely to soon abate. In fact, no dangerous offender has 
obtained parole on the first review.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice discussed the dangerous offender 
procedure on several occasions with the ministers of justice and 
attorneys general of the provinces. After all, it is the provinces that 
are to be making the prosecutorial decisions in these cases. The 
minister's provincial colleagues unanimously agree that part XXIV 
is a useful mechanism and there are signs that dangerous offender 
applications are being used more frequently across the country.
<P>
	The dangerous offender procedure requires the prosecution to 
meet a high standard of proof, proof of a pattern of offending, of 
brutality and of risk. This is as it should be given that the sentence 
provided is the most serious of any in the Criminal Code with the 
exception of life sentences for murder.
<P>
	The prosecution should be able to gather the necessary evidence 
at the time of trial and conviction. There may be rare exceptions, 
however, where the crown believes that additional information not 
available at the time of trial may exist to support a dangerous 
offender application.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will allow the prosecution to bring an application 
within six months of conviction in respect of convictions for 
serious personal injury offences.
<P>
	I would emphasize that this is a very limited window of 
opportunity for the crown. The prosecution must give notice at the 
time of conviction of its intention to apply and must actually do so 
within six months. Furthermore it must show that relevant evidence 
that was not reasonably available at the time of the imposition of 
the sentence became available in the interim.
<P>
	There is a third pillar to this legislation, one that I believe will 
strengthen the community policing capacity of our police forces 
across this nation. This bill proposes a new form of judicial 
restraint order in the Criminal Code to become section 810.2. This 
comes within the part of the code entitled ``Sureties to Keep the 
Peace''.
<P>
	The Canadian legal system has always provided for various 
forms of restraining orders, both common law and within the 
Criminal Code. In 1993 this House adopted a special form of 
judicial restraint order contained in section 810.1. It allows the 
court to impose an order where there are reasonable grounds to fear 
that a person will commit a sex offence against someone under the 
age of 14 years. The order can last up to a year. Conditions can be 
attached to the order and a breach of conditions constitutes a 
distinct offence.
<P>
	The potential victim need not be named, nor does the section 
explicitly require that the person be a convicted child sex offender. 
Police forces and provincial prosecutors report the law is proving 
useful. It is frequently used in Ontario and Manitoba, and 
successively used.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5040"> 5040 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposed new judicial restraint order, let us call it a section 
810.2 order, has been modelled on the existing section 810.1 
which I have just described.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The order would apply for up to 12 months and would include 
conditions. It would be used where there are reasonable grounds to 
fear the commission of a serious personal injury offence. The focus 
therefore is on serious sex offences and other serious crimes of 
violence. The persons potentially at risk need not be under the age 
of 14, although they could be.
<P>
	Section 810.2 allows the judge to set conditions with the overall 
objective of securing the good conduct of the defendant. In 
addition, Bill C-55 will specify that the judge can order the person 
to report to a provincial correctional authority, an appropriate 
police authority or to comply with a program of electronic 
monitoring provided that such a program is available in the place 
where the person resides.
<P>
	I do not claim that this provision will be a panacea to the 
problem of individuals who pose a risk to neighbourhood safety. 
Rather, it is a crime prevention measure that will assist police and 
prosecutors to do their difficult jobs in a better fashion.
<P>
	We are building on the initial promise of the existing section 
810.1 provision by establishing a limited form of judicial restraint 
where it is clearly established that a risk of committing a serious 
personal injury offence is present.
<P>
	I will not feel slighted if anyone characterizes this bill as a get 
tough package. It is that, but it is not a simplistic package. It does 
not climb on to the American bandwagon of simply adding prison 
time to every felony or, in our case, every indictable offence.
<P>
	Some in this country regard the American experience as the 
model for us, following the American justice system down the road 
of three strikes and you are out or two strikes and you are out, 
whatever the flavour of the day happens to be, more imprisonments 
and massive prison construction.
<P>
	I also watched the American experiment with grim fascination. 
There are now 1.6 million United States citizens in jail. The state of 
Texas now incarcerates more of its citizens than were imprisoned 
in the entire country several years ago.
<P>
	California, with its constitutionally entrenched three strikes law, 
is spending more on new prisons than it is on higher education. 
Something is definitely wrong with that model. We are not 
interested in repeating that experience in this country.
<P>
	I am not interested in amending the Criminal Code for the 
benefit of a new prison industry. There are some useful American 
approaches to criminal justice policy, but the facts show that too 
often prison is seen as the solution to every crime problem 
resulting in too many non-violent and low risk offenders being 
caught in the net.
<P>
	It is too simplistic, too expensive and it simply does not work. 
The alternative is the one that this government has proposed, a 
targeted approach where we use imprisonment for serious 
offenders and use community based controls for others.
<P>
	I want to briefly mention the federal-provincial co-operation that 
has gone into the development of this legislation. Unlike many 
other countries, our Constitution confers legislative authority over 
criminal law to the federal Parliament.
<P>
	This division of power ensures a consistent criminal law 
nationwide. It also dictates that the federal government be sensitive 
to the role of the provinces which, for the most part, administer the 
law.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has received extensive help from the 
provincial attorneys and solicitors general in this instance. Most 
recently, in May 1996, they expressed strong support for the major 
components of this bill despite the recent comments by the Ontario 
solicitor general about our resolve in the area of high risk policy.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The federal Solicitor General and the Minister of Justice have 
introduced a series of measures in the House over the past two 
years that keep the focus where it belongs: on the prediction and the 
management of risk. The punishment must match the crime. The 
overall sentence must match the risk.
<P>
	I am very pleased that chapter 22, the sentencing legislation, is 
now in force. It sets out clearly the fundamental premises of 
sentencing in criminal cases. The bill being considered today is 
totally consistent with these principles in its strategic use of 
imprisonment, supervision and crime prevention, and its focus on 
risk management.
<P>
	Our other legislation is equally consistent and focused. Bill C-45 
for example tightens the rules and criteria for lifers who want to be 
considered for early parole. Bill C-104, which was proclaimed in 
July, improves the ability of police to investigate serious crime by 
allowing them to obtain DNA evidence. Bill C-17, now in 
committee, contains over 140 separate amendments to the Criminal 
Code that modernize the administration of justice and the criminal 
law.
<P>
	To bring this full circle, let me reiterate that this bill, by 
improving sentencing options in regard to sex offenders and other 
high risk offenders, is consistent with our approach to the most 
serious kinds of crimes. It is consistent with a series of bills we 
have introduced in the area of sex offences, for example: Bill C-72, 
now in force, dealing with self-induced intoxication; Bill C-46, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5041"> 5041 </A></B>
<P>
addressing the question of evidence in sex offence cases;  and Bill 
C-27, concerning child prostitution, child sex tourism and stalking.
<P>
	Certainly there is more to be done, but I would urge the members 
to support this bill as an important step. I would urge members to 
support this bill as one of the many bills that have been introduced 
by this government to toughen up and improve the criminal law of 
this country.
<P>
	This government continues to pursue its agenda, strategic, well 
targeted, tough minded, to ensure that all citizens of Canada can 
live secure in safe homes on safe streets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River's speech on Bill C-55. Let me say right off the bat that both 
his speech and Bill C-55 contain some things I like, other things I 
do not like at all, and yet other things that are in a grey area.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River talks 
about improving the law, about protecting society, in some regards 
I can only agree with his statements of principle. For example, the 
hon. government member who tabled this bill talks about convicted 
criminals, especially sexual offenders. The cases that are being 
raised the most often and that we find particularly troubling are 
obviously those associated with pedophilia and with sexual assaults 
against people.
<P>
	Let us look more closely at the pedophilia cases. Incarceration 
does not cure pedophilia. Pedophiles are sexually attracted to 
children. Keeping a pedophile behind bars for five, six or seven 
years will not cure him. Society will be protected, but once the 
sentence has been served and the person released, he remains a 
high-risk offender. Unless we resort to extreme measures like 
chemical or surgical castration, there is no way to guarantee that he 
will not reoffend.
<P>
	Under the new provisions in Bill C-55, after serving their 
sentences, convicted sexual offenders may be kept under 
supervision for up to 10 years. So by keeping them under 
supervision after their release, we can exert a measure of control. I 
think that is reasonable in a free and democratic society, where a 
happy medium must be found between individual rights and the 
right of the community to protection.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Incidents like those witnessed recently in Sherbrooke for 
instance are the kind of thing we must strive to prevent as much as 
possible by increasing the level of awareness of the decision 
makers, be it only regarding parole. If the provisions of the Parole 
Act had been enforced in Canada, we would not have cases like the 
one in Sherbrooke and the one involving young Isabelle  Bolduc, 
because the offenders in these cases would not have been released 
when they were.
<P>
	Bill C-55 also aims to make it easier for the crown to have a 
convicted offender found to be a dangerous offender or a long-term 
offender. This new terminology will have to be incorporated into 
our criminal law.
<P>
	Basically, the crown will no longer be required by law to select 
one or the other immediately after the verdict is rendered and 
before sentencing. The crown will now have six months to make 
application for a court hearing to have a person who has been found 
guilty of a crime declared a dangerous offender or a long-term 
offender.
<P>
	This six-month period sounds like a good thing to me in that it 
will give crown attorneys, who, in most judicial districts in Canada, 
are already overburdened, the time to assess the case properly, 
seeking the advice of social workers, police and the community 
involved on whether or not this person should be declared a 
dangerous offender or a long-term offender. This will make for a 
more considered decision.
<P>
	There will be less chance of the crown's overlooking obvious 
cases or missing cases on which it should have acted because, at 
present, if the crown does not make its case immediately after 
conviction, which means before sentencing, it loses any right to do 
so. It sounds reasonable to me. I agree that it is an improvement 
over the existing legislation to give the crown another six months 
and to ease the crown's burden of proving, with the help of two 
psychiatrists, that an offender has to be declared a dangerous 
offender and now a long-term offender, according to the new 
terminology used in section 752.1 of the Code.
<P>
	The aim of this bill is to have an individual considered to be a 
dangerous offender or a long-term offender given an indeterminate 
sentence. At present, in Canada, there are orders-not many 
admittedly-that set specific dates. In the future, the rule will be 
the same for everyone: indeterminate sentence. I think this shift 
will also foster a more uniform application of the law in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, one last measure regarding dangerous offenders and 
long-term offenders. A person who has been declared a dangerous 
offender or a long-term offender will now have to wait not three 
years, but seven years to apply for parole to the National Parole 
Board. We can agree, in essence, with measures like these ones, 
given the rise in crime in society.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is true that, in Canada, the trend generally is to say that crime 
is on the decrease. However, there is a rise in certain types of 
crimes we have not had to deal with in the past.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5042"> 5042 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposed amendments are the new tools to deal with these 
different forms of crime. Traditionally, murders, theft or armed 
robberies accounted for some 80 per cent of the crimes brought 
before the courts.
<P>
	In order to deal with specific crimes, we must give ourselves 
specific tools and modernize criminal law.
<P>
	My comments apply to the bill generally. I also said at the 
beginning that I am not so happy about some provisions, while I 
truly dislike other ones, including section 810.2.
<P>
	Should the bill be passed as it now stands, clause 810.2 and the 
ones that follow it would allow a judge, who has acquitted an 
individual, to impose measures to have the individual monitored. 
This contradicts traditional British criminal law, which is premised 
on the presumption of innocence and on the weight of an acquittal. 
How can we sentence someone who was acquitted? If one is guilty 
of a crime, he must pay for it by going to jail or, if the offence is 
minor, by paying a fine. However, a person who is acquitted can go 
home, unless he is being detained for another offence committed 
under other circumstances. A verdict of acquittal means the person 
is free to go. There is no grey area between the two possibilities.
<P>
	The bill introduces the notion whereby someone can be acquitted 
but still be under probation. It basically says: ``You are acquitted, 
but something about you makes me feel you are a risk to society. 
Therefore, for a period of some ten years, you will have to 
regularly report to police authorities, and you will have to stay 
home between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m.''.
<P>
	We cannot function with such rules in a society where the rule of 
law prevails. This is a debate that took place almost 320 years ago. 
In 1679, when the law of habeas corpus was passed under King 
Charles II, the issue was precisely that some people, whose face or 
behaviour the prince did not like, were detained in the Tower of 
London, by virtue of an order bearing the sovereign's seal. 
Parliament reacted by passing the law of <I>habeas corpus</I>, which 
gave people, and which still gives them, because it is enshrined in 
the Canadian Constitution, the right to petition a judge on any scrap 
of paper available-a piece of toilet paper was once used-to have 
the jailer bring them before the judge and justify the legality of 
their detention. That was what <I>habeas corpus</I> meant in 1679, and 
that is what it still means today. It is not often used in our country, 
precisely because it is there, a sword of Damocles preventing the 
violation of citizens' basic rights.
<P>
	When a writ of <I>habeas corpus</I> is issued, prison authorities must 
explain why someone is being detained. One justification may be to 
show that there was a warrant of committal following sentencing 
by a judge at the conclusion of a duly held trial. But if there was an 
acquittal, the accused, who is no longer the accused, however, 
because he was acquitted and told: ``I acquit  you'' is also told that 
now, for ten, three or five years, he will be the object of certain 
special measures.
<P>
	In the provinces where it is possible, he could even be 
electronically monitored. He is told: ``You will be required to wear 
a small bracelet and stay near a telephone line, and when the signal 
is interrupted or cut off, will come to your home to see if you are 
there'', well, the accused, it would seem to me, is justified, under 
the Canadian Charter, under the rules of <I>habeas corpus</I>, in saying: 
``I require you to justify the legality of my detention''.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	This is a 300 year step back in the history of criminal law. Under 
no circumstances can we support provisions creating sentences for 
individuals who have been acquitted.
<P>
	However, we can quite happily support more stringent, more 
appropriate measures for those found guilty who are at risk of 
reoffending. That is one thing, and Bill C-55 deals with that 
problem, but it is another thing to sentence, in a roundabout way, 
those who have already been acquitted. This is not a concept that 
belongs in our criminal law.
<P>
	I taught criminal law for twenty some years and at the end of 
each session in various groups I invariably put the following 
question, or something along these lines: ``What should be the 
sentence for someone who has just been acquitted for the third time 
of murder in the first degree?'' I underlined the words ``murder in 
the first degree''. Invariably, two thirds of the class would tell me: 
life imprisonment. In the next class, I always got a kick out of 
telling them that we were lucky to live in a country where there 
were no sentences for people who had been acquitted.
<P>
	If I go back to teaching law, I will have to revise my thinking. I 
will have to tell my students: now, because of Bill C-55, a person 
acquitted in our country can be sentenced. There is something 
fundamentally wrong with this.
<P>
	Canadians know the rules of criminal law. We are all familiar 
with the concept of presumption of innocence. We all know that the 
crown is bound to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I think 
people are most familiar with this aspect of the law because it is so 
often applied by the average person. The jury rule, which 
essentially goes back to 1215 and the Magna Carta, is a concept 
that has forged our legal thinking, even that of the average citizen.
<P>
	When we talk to constituents in our ridings, they are often more 
familiar with the rules of criminal law than civil law. These are not 
complicated rules. They are simple rules based on logic and 
common sense. In this case, the government is no longer using 
common sense, and when concepts get confused, citizens get 
confused as well.
<P>

<B><A NAME="5043"> 5043 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope, and the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill River 
might discuss this with his minister, that the idea of giving a 
sentence to a person who has been found not guilty will be dropped 
when the bill is considered in committee.
<P>
	It is not our intention to vote against the bill at the second 
reading stage. We want this bill to be studied in committee. 
However, we do not want a replay of what happened in the case of 
Bill C-45 last June, when the government wanted Parliament to 
pass all stages of the bill in a matter of days. There should be a 
thorough study of the bill.
<P>
	And should the government ever decide to maintain the 
provisions in section 810.2-a government that is so fond of 
making references to the Supreme Court-I think that before 
issuing an order in council for the coming into force of this bill, the 
bill should be referred to the Supreme Court for an opinion on the 
constitutionality of section 810.2 and following, in the light of our 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and, more specifically, 
sections 11(d) and 11(<I>h</I>) of the Charter.
<P>
	I will read these two sections. We read the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>11. Any person charged with an offence has the right: </BLOCKQUOTE>
(<I>d</I>) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public 
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>h</I>) if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found 
guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This principle is clear in the Charter. It is wrong to say that the 
law is contrary to the Charter. If it is, it is because the Charter 
recognizes certain fundamental values with which Canadians 
identify. These fundamental values have been evolved for 
centuries. The book is red, but when Mr. Trudeau had the Charter 
adopted in 1982, it did not drop out of the clear blue sky. It is a 
codification of what has been built up over the centuries in the 
United Kingdom, here and in other countries with a system based 
on British criminal law and where there were also comparable civil 
liberties. Before moving away from that, or running the risk of 
doing so, a detailed examination needs to be carried out.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I believe that the government is taking considerable risk, perhaps 
unawares. If it has not seen that risk, probably the questions we are 
raising today will prompt it to take a second look, or, to use the 
oft-repeated expression, to go back to the drawing board. No one 
will hold it against the government if it has to improve its own bill 
when it comes to the committee stage, after redoing its homework.
<P>
	If the government is aware, and is doing this knowingly, one may 
well wonder what its purpose is. Does it really want to change the 
Criminal Code in order to improve the application and 
administration of justice, or does it want to make a political 
statement? Is it courting a certain segment of the electorate who 
would be delighted to see the innocent detained?
<P>
	The other day I heard the hon. member for Crowfoot defending 
some positions similar to mine. In appearing before a 
parliamentary committee discussing a bill, he said that it is one 
thing to punish a person who has been found guilty, but it is quite 
another thing to take away the freedom or fundamental rights of a 
person who is presumed innocent, or worse yet who has been found 
innocent of the crime of which he was accused. This is a serious 
reservation.
<P>
	If the same bill were to come back to us at third reading with no 
guarantee of the rights of those who have been acquitted, 
potentially anyone of us in this House, you, me, anyone, could be 
the target of section 810.2, where there is a return to guilt by 
association, guilt by suspicion, like there was under the Mussolini 
regime in the 1930s. Then anyone could be found guilty on 
legitimate suspicion.
<P>
	In Canada, we operate on the principle that proof must be 
established beyond a reasonable doubt. Other jurisdictions in other 
countries say that there must be sufficiently convincing proof. Italy 
in the 30's established the criterion of legitimate suspicion. Why? 
Among other things, in order to fight organized crime. This did not 
work, because it constantly lowered the degree of evidence a judge 
needed to find someone guilty.
<P>
	What is legitimate suspicion? This can expand to crimes that 
may be committed, thought crimes, any kind of crime. It is a 
criterion which does not go into sufficient depth. With section 
810.2, the government is going back to the Mussolini laws of 1930, 
which allowed people to be found guilty based on legitimate 
suspicion.
<P>
	On the one hand, using the criterion of proof beyond reasonable 
doubt, someone is acquitted. On the other hand, using the criterion 
of legitimate suspicion, someone is acquitted, but subject to certain 
measures, to supervision for a given number of years. There is 
something wrong with this.
<P>
	I believe that, the further this bill moves along in the House and 
in committee, the more it will be realized that these clauses are 
privative and need to be taken out of the bill. On these grounds, the 
official opposition will support second reading of this bill, but will 
take steps to see that section 810.2 and all those clauses which, to 
all intents and purposes, are intended to sentence an acquitted 
person, are deleted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
this bill quite substantial in content. It  takes a considerable amount 
of time to grasp everything that is recorded here and what impact it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5044"> 5044 </A></B>
<P>
will have on Canadians, on criminal justice and certainly policing 
and the courts.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I had an opportunity to go through a good portion of the bill in 
detail. I tried to cross reference it with the Criminal Code. It was 
not an easy task because the bill touches on so many areas, not only 
of the Criminal Code but of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act and other statutes.
<P>
	In my preamble relating to criminal justice matters I will relate 
some of the concerns that Canadians, including those in my caucus, 
have expressed to me, and then I will get into the bill.
<P>
	Let me reflect on what the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister has stated. He has trumpeted this legislation by the justice 
minister as evidence of the government's commitment to get tough 
on criminals. He even said that he would not apologize for that 
statement if anyone accused him or his government of getting 
tough. But I will question it.
<P>
	Although the parliamentary secretary is prone to that kind of 
rhetoric, he really has not looked closely at his statements nor at the 
bill. If he looked at the bill, he would not say such nonsensical 
things. It is not a tough bill, as this debate will clearly show. 
Reformers will certainly examine this claim in the debate that 
follows. I trust the parliamentary secretary and the justice minister 
will listen intently.
<P>
	In the end, Canadians will judge whether this bill properly 
addresses their well founded concern over rising violent crime, the 
unchecked activities of sexual predators and the proliferation of 
pedophiles within our communities.
<P>
	Before my colleagues and I address the technical aspects of the 
bill, let me spell out what Canadians are calling for in terms of 
protecting their communities, their families and their sense of 
personal security.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to feel that they and their families are safe in 
their homes, at work, at school, on the street and in their 
communities. They want to live in a country where their children 
can play in parks, go to school and grow up without fear. They want 
a justice system that does more to protect law-abiding citizens than 
it does for criminals. Canadians want a country where they can 
look to the future instead of over their shoulders.
<P>
	How can this be done? I know the justice minister will say that 
Bill C-55 is the solution. He will consider this bill to be his trump 
card going into the next election. However, Reformers will let 
Canadians judge how convincing are the arguments of the justice 
minister and the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Canadians tell Reformers at town hall forums, community 
meetings, victims' memorials and rallies, coffee shops, truck stops 
and outside bank machines that the justice system has failed them. I 
do not know where the parliamentary secretary to the justice 
minister has been but obviously he has not been talking to people in 
front of a bank machine to listen to what the average citizen has to 
say.
<P>
	Reformers never feel awkward about looking Canadians in the 
eye. In fact, we look them straight in the eye and we listen to what 
they have to say. They tell us to enact a victims' bill of rights that 
puts the rights of law-abiding citizens ahead of criminals' rights. 
That is probably the most contentious issue that exists today when 
it comes to the penal system. Canadians want to see some 
punishment in it and there is none. Of course the government side 
is not listening to that at all.
<P>
	Canadians say the justice system should be reformed to provide 
safer communities, safer streets and safer homes. They say, hold a 
binding national referendum on the return of the death penalty for 
first degree murderers. Canadians believe they should have the 
final determination, not ivory tower, soft on crime Liberal lawyers, 
in choosing a fair and just punishment for monsters such as 
Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Well over 76 per cent of Canadians seek to have the death 
penalty reinstated. However the Minister of Justice, the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister, the Solicitor General, and 
those sitting in that front row will not consider reinstating the death 
penalty or even asking Canadians what they would like the 
government to do.
<P>
	They say that Canadians want the Liberals' $400 million gun 
registry replaced with meaningful laws to fight the criminal use of 
firearms. Just to touch on that one point, the amount of money that 
is being spent on this registration system is indecent and insane. 
And it is not protecting Canadians one iota.
<P>
	Canadians want meaningful reform to the parole system and at 
the very minimum they want parole abolished for first degree 
murderers. Clearly the debate in the House over Bill C-45 brought 
that message home loud and clear. I know for a fact that Canadians 
have been pointedly telling those in that front row over there on the 
other side that section 745 should be stricken from the record, 
scrapped and repealed.
<P>
	Canadians also want the Young Offenders Act repealed, or at 
least replaced with measures that would hold young criminals 
accountable for their actions. This is a very common sense request 
on the part of Canadians which has now become a demand that the 
government do that, but again deaf ears on that side.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5045"> 5045 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the things Canadians are saying. This will be the 
criteria by which Canadians judge the justice minister's claim that 
Bill C-55 will get tough on violent criminals or high risk 
offenders.
<P>
	Canadians will also judge the strengths and weaknesses of this 
legislation in terms of how it proposes to change the justice system 
with a view to getting tough on crime. Those are the parliamentary 
secretary's specific words. The parliamentary secretary says they 
are getting tough on crime. Let us look closely at the bill and see 
how tough, if at all.
<P>
	Canadians tell Reformers that they want to see very specific and 
very broad changes to the criminal justice system. They tell us that 
they want some of the following measures introduced into the 
justice legislation. The guiding question should be: How far does 
Bill C-55 go toward changing the criminal justice system? Will Bill 
C-55 for example implement truth in sentencing, meaning that the 
sentence given will be the sentence served by all violent offenders?
<P>
	I listened to the parliamentary secretary talk about sexual 
assault. Obviously the parliamentary secretary has not been in a 
courtroom for some time or he would realize that judges are 
handing down two and three-year sentences to rapists, not the 14 
years as outlined in the Criminal Code as the maximum sentence. 
That is reality.
<P>
	Will Bill C-55 for example implement two strikes laws, meaning 
that violent offenders who commit on two separate occasions an 
offence causing serious personal injury will be sentenced to an 
automatic indeterminate life sentence? Will the bill do that? No.
<P>
	Will parole be limited, earned and tightly monitored under the 
proposals put forward in Bill C-55? Can a dangerous offender 
application be made at any time during a criminal's sentence, not 
just at the beginning of court proceedings? Will section 745 of the 
Criminal Code be repealed, scrapped and abolished, not simply 
tinkered with, to ensure that no murderer receives early parole?
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Those will be the questions and criteria by which Canadians will 
judge this legislation. On behalf of Canadians, Reformers will 
certainly do their part to bring the government to task on these very 
important concerns, especially with respect to Bill C-55.
<P>
	Let us examine the specifics of the bill. Essentially, Bill C-55 is 
made up of three components: a new and expanded dangerous 
offender provision; a new long term offender provision; and a new 
judicial restraint clause. Also of concern is clause 15 which grants 
special rights in respect of aboriginal convicted offenders.
<P>
	Let us look at the dangerous offender provision. The new 
dangerous offender provision in Bill C-55 recognizes that the 
current process by which certain criminals are assigned dangerous 
offender status and are therefore required to serve an indefinite 
penitentiary sentence is not sufficiently strong enough to protect 
Canadian communities against violent criminals.
<P>
	Reformers applaud the new provisions which expand the criteria 
for designating violent criminals as dangerous offenders. That is 
one positive aspect of the bill. However, the proposed changes for 
designating certain criminals as dangerous offenders do not go far 
enough.
<P>
	Section 753(1), (2), (3) and (4) in Bill C-55 would allow the 
crown up to six months after conviction to bring about a dangerous 
offender application. At present the current rules afford the crown 
only a narrow and limited window at the time of conviction to bring 
about a dangerous offender application. Even under the proposed 
changes the provision would apply only if the crown gives notice at 
the time of conviction of the possibility of a delayed dangerous 
offender application and where relevant, information emerges to 
support the application.
<P>
	The Reform Party will be proposing several amendments in 
committee to this part of the bill. In the past a dangerous offender 
application had to be made at the time of sentencing. This bill 
proposes a slight extension to that window.
<P>
	There has been a problem with releasing high risk offenders into 
the community. They will reoffend. The authorities have stated this 
time and time again. There are no provisions in the bill which 
address this point. The fumbling way the justice minister has 
attempted to address this has been to impose a judicial restraint 
order after the fact. In other words, after the offender has served his 
time and he most likely is not under any parole supervision, the 
justice minister will go to the attorney general of the province to 
apply for a judicial restraint order. I will get into that point in more 
detail later.
<P>
	I want to reflect on what Reformers will do as far as the proposed 
amendments are concerned.
<P>
	We will propose that Bill C-55 allow for dangerous offender 
findings to be made at any time after sentencing. To be clear, the 
crown should be given the right to seek dangerous offender status 
for persons convicted of crimes causing serious personal injury at 
any time during the offender's penitentiary sentence. One of our 
members submitted Bill C-254 which addresses the issue in detail, 
but unfortunately members on the other side of the House voted it 
down.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We also propose that Bill C-55 be amended for greater certainty 
to require the courts to automatically place a dangerous offender 
finding upon any person who commits on two or more separate 
occasions an offence constituting a serious personal injury offence. 
Under the present system the crown may or may not apply for a 
dangerous offender finding after any number of offences. Reform's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5046"> 5046 </A></B>
<P>
proposal would require the courts to automatically effect a 
dangerous offender finding after the second offence.
<P>
	Another thing disturbed me about the bill as I was going through 
it this morning. One can make the application for dangerous 
offender. That is a given; there is no question that this application 
can be made but that is not the end of it. The offender's agent, the 
lawyer, can then appeal that dangerous offender statement by the 
court. So it does not end there. It does not matter if the person is a 
dangerous offender or a long term offender, the lawyer can again 
bring that person before a court of appeal and the whole process 
starts all over again. I find that to be questionable.
<P>
	What are we creating here, another bill of so-called Liberal 
justice? We are saying it should be automatic. Once that offender 
has committed a second offence, he is gone away for an 
indeterminate sentence and there is no opportunity to appeal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Then there would be less work for lawyers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> My colleague points out that it might put a few 
lawyers out of work.
<P>
	That in itself is not the most disturbing part. I looked even 
further and it reflects on the whole area of appeal. Another very 
interesting part of the bill deals with section 760 and reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where a court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender or a long term 
offender, the court shall order that a copy of all reports and testimony given by 
psychiatrists, psychologists, criminologists and other experts and any observations 
of the court with respect to the reasons for the finding, together with a transcript of 
the trial of the offender, be forwarded to the Correctional Service of Canada for 
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In other words, through this hearing and through the appeal, it 
seems that everyone in the justice industry will be involved and it 
will go on and on and on.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary talked about dealing with the 
legislation in a very open fashion when it is fraught with all kinds 
of hidden agendas and this is one of them. There will be endless 
hearings, endless court cases, endless record keeping, endless 
filing. It goes on and on to further perpetuate the problems our 
justice system is already in. It will be bogged down with more and 
more administration. It will be a bureaucratic nightmare.
<P>
	There can be no question that pedophiles and sexual predators 
are dangerous offenders. Therefore, we propose that Bill C-55 take 
into account pedophiles and sexual predators, especially to expand 
the list of Criminal Code offences upon which a dangerous offender 
application may be brought about.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Specifically, we suggest that the following provisions be added 
to the dangerous offender designation: an offence under any of the 
following provisions of the Criminal Code, section 151, sexual 
interference; section 152, invitation to sexual touching; section 
153, sexual exploitation; subsection 160(3), bestiality in the 
presence of or inciting a child to commit bestiality; 170, parent or 
guardian procuring sexual activity; 171, householder permitting 
sexual activity by child; section 172, corrupting children; section 
212(2), living off the avails of prostitution by a child; section 
212(4), obtaining sexual services of a child.
<P>
	Under part (b), an offence under any of the following provisions 
of the Criminal Code involving a person under the age of 18: 
section 155, incest; 159, anal intercourse; 161(1) and (2), bestiality 
and compelling bestiality; section 271, sexual assault; section 272, 
sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing 
bodily harm.
<P>
	Under part (c), an offence involving a person under the age of 18 
years under any of the following provisions of the Criminal Code, 
Chapter C-34 of the <I>Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970</I> as they read 
immediately before January 4, 1983: 144, rape; section 145, 
attempt to commit rape; section 149, indecent assault on a female; 
section 156, indecent assault on a male.
<P>
	Those sections reflect on our children, on our families and are 
not included in the present bill put forward by the justice minister. 
It is our suggestion that they will come forward in the form of a 
motion that may be included.
<P>
	In point three, under the dangerous offender provision, Bill C-55 
proposes to change section 761, which would review indeterminate 
sentences after seven years of custody rather than the previous 
three years.
<P>
	This is an improvement on the previous review process but it is 
not tough enough. Therefore Reform proposes that section 761 be 
amended to allow review of indeterminate sentences after 15 years 
of custody rather than the existing provision of three years or the 
proposed seven years as advanced in Bill C-55.
<P>
	Let us talk about the long term offender provision. Bill C-55 
would amend the Criminal Code to proposed section 753.1(1) 
which would permit a court to find a person to be a new category of 
offender, a long term offender, if it can be determined among other 
criteria that there is a substantial risk that the offender will 
reoffend.
<P>
	Under section 753.1(2), it is further required that the court shall 
be satisfied that there is a substantial risk if the offender is 
convicted of an offence under ones that have been previously 
related to sections 151, 152 and 153, subsection 173(2), sections 
271, 272 and 273.
<P>
	Reform believes that this list of Criminal Code provisions does 
not again go far enough for the stated purpose of assigning long 
term offender status to certain criminals.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5047"> 5047 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Therefore for greater certainty and to include a broader range of 
offences committed by sexual predators and pedophiles, we 
propose that Bill C-55 be amended to include under proposed 
section 753.1(2), part (a), an offence under any of the following 
provisions of the Criminal Code: subsection 160(3), bestiality in 
the presence of or inciting a child to commit bestiality; section 170, 
parent or guardian procuring sexual activity; section 171, 
householder permitting sexual activity by a child; section 172, 
corrupting children; section 212(2), living off the avails of 
prostitution by a child; section 212(4), obtaining sexual services of 
a child.
<P>
	Part (b), an offence under any of the following provisions of the 
Criminal Code involving a person under the age of 18 years: 
section 155, incest; section 159, anal intercourse; sections 160(1) 
and (2), bestiality and compelling bestiality.
<P>
	Part (c), an offence involving a person under the age of 18 years 
under any of the following provisions of the Criminal Code, 
Chapter C-34, <I>Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970</I> as they read 
immediately before January 4, 1983: section 144, rape; section 
145, attempt to commit rape; section 149, indecent assault on a 
female; section 156, indecent assault on a male.
<P>
	Those are the long term offender provisions that the Reform 
Party will certainly be entering in the form of amendment.
<P>
	The final point is that of judicial restraint provisions. Bill C-55 
proposes that section 810.2 be added to the Criminal Code, thereby 
permitting the attorney general to lay an information against 
anyone the attorney general believes will commit a serious 
personal injury offence. The individual then appears before a 
provincial court judge. If the judge is satisfied of the concern, an 
order to enter into recognizance with reasonable conditions for up 
to one year may be made. If the individual fails or refuses to enter 
into recognizance the judge may commit the defendant to a prison 
term not exceeding 12 months. That is substantial considering there 
are no charges, no convictions and really nothing more than a mere 
suspicion.
<P>
	The judge may also prohibit the possession of firearms or 
ammunition and order the surrender of firearms acquisition 
certificates. Conditions can include reporting to the correction 
authority of a province, police authority or complying with a 
program of electronic monitoring if available.
<P>
	This provision may be made even though the individuals may 
have been acquitted of any charge or never even charged with a 
criminal offence and is probably the most obnoxious part of this 
bill. It is a violation of civil liberties.
<P>
	Reform believes that this clause constitutes a broad 
indiscriminate infringement of personal liberty which  unduly 
violates the civil rights of an individual. The judicial remedies 
proposed in clause 9 of Bill C-55 should only be contemplated in 
matters where individuals have been convicted of offences under 
the Criminal Code of Canada and according to due process of law.
<P>
	Therefore in our list of amendments that will be forthcoming at 
another time Reform proposes that clause 9 be struck in its totality 
from Bill C-55.
<P>
	I am going to again briefly reflect on something else that comes 
to mind on this bill, another point that makes this legislation 
somewhat weaker than what the minister or the parliamentary 
secretary has just indicated.
<P>
	I was going through the bill on section 753.3 where an accused 
has been placed on long term supervision and has been released 
into the community where monitoring has been required of the 
individual. It is noted that if that offender steps outside the 
province, the conditions that he is to meet no longer apply. I 
suggest there is going to be quite a movement of long term 
offenders about this country as they hop from one province to 
another. Just think of the implications that will have on our police 
departments trying to keep track of these wandering long term 
offenders.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	If the long term offender commits another offence in that 
province it is not an automatic thing that he be suspended or placed 
back into incarceration. Rather, the police agency is required to do 
the following: ``Where the accused is found, is arrested or is in 
custody, but if the place where the accused is found, is arrested or 
in is custody is outside the province in which the offence is alleged 
to have been committed, no proceedings in respect of that offence 
shall be instituted in that place without the consent of the attorney 
general of that province''.
<P>
	In other words what do we have? We have another glitch in the 
so-called tough legislation presented by the Minister of Justice. As 
we dig more and more into this bill it is becoming evident that it is 
far from getting tough on crime and it is not going to be this trump 
card that the minister thinks he will be walking into the election 
with.
<P>
	I want to address one point before concluding, clause 15. Clause 
15 deals with the provisions of the aboriginal community. It states 
that if the long term offender expresses the interest in being 
supervised in an aboriginal community, that community must 
receive notice of the supervision order and have the opportunity to 
propose a plan for release and integration into the community.
<P>
	This point does not apply to any community in the country 
except an aboriginal community. This would again appear to be an 
example of the Liberal government's decision to treat some 
Canadians differently and bring about inequality. Aboriginal 
communities will have the right to notice of release of a  high risk 
offender into their community and the right to become involved in 
planning for that release. Other Canadian communities do not 
receive this notice or this opportunity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5048"> 5048 </A></B>
<P>
	We will propose that clause 15 be amended so that ``aboriginal 
community'' reads ``local community'' so that it will be applicable 
to every community in this country, not just those as indicated by 
the Liberal justice minister's form of justice. That concludes my 
statement on Bill C-55.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for 
Brampton.
<P>
	I have a number of thoughts to express to the House today, 
having consulted widely with my constituents of 
London-Middlesex on this bill and having received considerable 
input from them.
<P>
	The hon. member who just spoke, my colleague opposite from 
the Reform Party, in his last point addressed the matter of 
application of this bill to the aboriginal community. Frankly, I get a 
little tired of hearing from the Reform Party that unless we treat 
each and every Canadian in the exactly the same way on exactly 
every piece of legislation, somehow we are taking a wrong 
approach or that we are being unfair. That simply perpetuates a 
myth that ought to be debunked right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Do you have a problem with equality?
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> I believe the member for 
Wild Rose, in interjecting just now, asked if I have a problem with 
equality. No, I do not have a problem with equality. However, not 
every single Canadian has to be treated in exactly the same way in 
every single aspect of our society in order to respect equality. As a 
matter of fact, I suggest that it is just the opposite. That kind of an 
attitude fails to recognize that there exists in this great land, from 
coast to coast to coast, a number of differences among Canadians.
<P>
	I would ask my colleagues from the Reform Party to respect my 
opportunity to speak to the House without heckling me as I 
certainly did with them when they were speaking, although I 
disagreed with some of their points of view. I would certainly 
welcome their questions within the spirit of the rules.
<P>
	It is obvious that our aboriginal peoples, respecting their 
traditions and what reality has shown us is more effective in 
dealing with offenders from the aboriginal community, that there is 
nothing wrong with taking a look at how this bill can be most 
effectively applied to aboriginal offenders. I would be disappointed 
in the Minister of Justice and in this bill if it did not hold out that 
possibility. That was the first point I want to make.
<P>
	I am sure all of us, as members of Parliament, whatever part of 
the House we sit in, are well aware of the public perception that the 
rate of violent crimes has increased. I hear that from time to time 
from some of my constituents. However, I also hear from police 
officers, chiefs of police and other experts in the law enforcement 
field that fortunately the reality is that we do not have this massive 
increase in violent crime. We have some alarming trends that need 
to be dealt with and the purpose of Bill C-55 is to do just that. It is 
to address the reality of high risk offenders and to deal with those 
people effectively.
<P>
	However, as members of Parliament, it is very important that we 
not subscribe to, let alone fuel, the perception that Canada is seeing 
a massive increase in violent crime because it is simply not the 
case. Anybody, whether he be an elected member of the House of 
Commons or a non-elected Canadian citizen, who fuels that myth 
and buys into it is doing a disservice to our society. Statistics and 
facts do not bear it out.
<P>
	In my view, we need to ask where the dangerous trends are in our 
society vis-à-vis violent crime and address those. I believe Bill 
C-55 will do that very effectively.
<P>
	First, as the speech from the throne made the commitment to the 
Canadian people, there has been widespread, public consultation 
on this bill. As one member of Parliament, I believe that the vast 
majority of Canadians agree with this bill and will support it 
becoming legislation.
<P>
	Most experts, whether they be in law enforcement or other 
aspects of the criminal justice system, support this move by the 
government. I quote Mr. Scott Newark, executive officer of the 
Canadian Police Association, in speaking to this bill. He said: ``The 
proposed high risk offenders legislation is the single most 
important improvement in Canadian public safety legislation in the 
last 20 years''. That does not come from me as a Liberal member of 
Parliament. I am quoting the executive officer of the Canadian 
Police Association.
<P>
	On matters of crime and justice, whether it was Bill C-68, the 
gun legislation issue was so emotional, or whether it is this bill, I 
do not purport to be an expert in law enforcement or in the justice 
system. I am not a lawyer as most Canadians are not lawyers.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I have learned through 16 years of elected office at the municipal 
and now federal level that we ought very carefully to seek out 
expert opinion before casting a vote on important legislation. It is 
very important to me to hear from the law enforcement community 
on issues such as gun control and Bill C-55. I put great stock in the 
comments of the executive officer of the Canadian Police 
Association.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5049"> 5049 </A></B>
<P>
	There was widespread public input on the bill. There is very 
general and widespread support for Bill C-55. Several initiatives 
are set out in the bill, three of which are most important.
<P>
	It creates a new long term offender designation that targets sex 
offenders and adds a period of long term supervision of up to 10 
years following release from prison. That is a very valid concern of 
the people who have contacted me as a member of Parliament. 
Unfortunately, repeat violent offenders will pose a risk to public 
safety now and in the years to come. Some of them will pose a risk 
for the remainder of their lives. This legislation seeks to deal 
specifically with the threat to public safety.
<P>
	The second important initiative is the strengthening of the 
dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The third initiative is the new judicial restraint provision to 
permit controls, including electronic monitoring, to be applied to 
individuals who pose a high risk of committing a serious personal 
injury offence.
<P>
	Public perception matches the reality of the statistics. Although 
there has not been a massive increase in violent crime in Canada, a 
number of individuals who are repeat violent offenders, pose a 
serious threat to public safety. The initiatives to which I have just 
referred very effectively deal with those people.
<P>
	Concomitant with that, and very important in my mind, is the 
fact that the government also is taking an initiative to deal with low 
risk, non-violent offenders in other ways besides incarceration. The 
answer is not simply to build more jails. If that were true the safest 
society in the world would be the United States of America. It 
incarcerates an incredible percentage of its population. Statistics 
tell us that on a per capita basis the most dangerous society in the 
world in which to live-the society in which a person has the 
greatest odds of being assaulted, robbed, sexually assaulted or 
murdered-is the United States of America. The building of more 
jails in the U.S.A. has not resulted in a safer society. As a matter of 
fact, it has not dealt with the problem effectively at all.
<P>
	I am very pleased to be a member of a government which is 
going to proceed, through this and other pieces of legislation, to 
deal more effectively with repeat violent offenders, including 
sexual offenders. However, at the same time a more enlightened, 
effective and efficient approach has to be taken in dealing with 
those offenders who are low risk, non-violent offenders. Both 
initiatives have to be seen as complementary.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the public will see more effective 
measures to deal with high risk offenders. What do I mean exactly 
by a high risk offender? It is someone who has been convicted of a 
serious violent crime and who has been found to have a strong 
likelihood of reoffending, but who cannot be shown to meet the  
narrow definition of the dangerous offender which would result in 
indefinite incarceration.
<P>
	The bill increases the options of the government in dealing with 
violent offenders. Suffice it to say that most of the constituents who 
have contacted me regard this bill as good legislation. They support 
it. That includes lay people and law enforcement officers in my 
community. They support it as a necessary improvement in dealing 
with serious violent offenders, and I am pleased to support the 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be brief so my colleague can get in his question as well.
<P>
	I first want to comment on the equality statement that was made 
by the hon. member in his speech. This bill outlines that the law it 
is presenting is prepared to go into community <I>a</I> and prepare it for 
the release of a violent offender.
<P>
	Why would the hon. member not be willing to see community <I>b</I> 
or community <I>c</I> receive the same kind of preparedness? Why only 
one community? It is a good idea so why not do it all the way 
through the system? Or are we talking about discrimination here? I 
do not understand where the member is coming from when he says 
that community <I>a</I> should get this but the others should not.
<P>
	Second, has the member checked lately the number of 
unreported violent crimes? When experts talk about the number of 
violent crimes going down, it is the number of violent crimes being 
reported that is going down.
<P>
	When we ask individuals who have had offences committed 
against them why they did not report them, they say that they have 
seen from the experiences of others who have gone through the 
same things that due to this soft Liberal approach on crime, the 
criminals and their rights are up front and the victims and their 
rights are not considered. The victim suffers more in some cases by 
reporting a crime than by not reporting it. The victim would rather 
not go through further suffering.
<P>
	Is the member aware that that actually exists in this country, or is 
he living in some dreamland where he thinks that does not happen?
<P>
	I have one comment to make on the bill as a whole. I hope when 
the justice minister goes home at night he does not travel the way 
he makes legislation, because if he does he would never get home. 
He would only get half way. I wish the Liberals would go all the 
way with some of their legislation and cover all the aspects and quit 
leaving big holes in these bills.
<P>
	Of course, most of the legislation I have seen in the past has been 
built by lawyers for lawyers, and benefits lawyers. We are quite 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5050"> 5050 </A></B>
<P>
concerned about the amount of  court time that will be involved in 
implementing this entire package.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hardly 
know where to begin. My colleague from Wild Rose has raised 
several points.
<P>
	Let me begin with the hon. member's assertion that this is 
legislation built by lawyers for lawyers. Perhaps he was not in the 
Chamber when I quoted the statement of Mr. Newark, executive 
officer the Canadian Police Association: ``This proposed high risk 
offenders legislation is the single most important improvement in 
Canadian public safety legislation in the last 20 years''. Mr. 
Newark is not a lawyer. He is a law enforcement officer and I take 
his comments very advisedly. It speaks very clearly to the fact that 
experts in the field besides lawyers view this legislation as a very 
important improvement.
<P>
	As to my comments about the application of Bill C-55 to the 
aboriginal community, with all due respect to my colleague, I 
certainly did not say that one community should get this but others 
should not. He attributed those comments to me but I certainly did 
not say that.
<P>
	I was reacting to his colleague who spoke just before me. He said 
that he saw no way this bill should be applied any differently to the 
aboriginal community than to the rest of Canadian society. I repeat, 
in my opinion that is a very short sighted view of Canadian society. 
The reality of the aboriginal community in Canada is that different 
techniques are more effective within that community. But because 
we can apply a bill in a different way with one community does not 
mean than we are favouring one community over another.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	If that were the case, as a parent with three children, two boys 
and one girl, I would have to treat them exactly the same in every 
aspect of their lives. That is just not common sense in a family 
situation or in the justice system. That is the point I was trying to 
make.
<P>
	With reference to how this may apply in other communities, I 
would only say to my hon. friend opposite that we live a dynamic 
society. The bill is an improvement. That is not to say it is perfect 
or that over time it cannot be improved. Perhaps there will be 
opportunities to apply it differently in various communities as the 
cases may warrant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope we can interpret 
the hon. member's statement as saying that there may be an 
amendment to this bill to make it equally applicable to all sectors 
of society.
<P>
	My specific question deals with the hon. member's reference to 
statistics. I do not know how much he knows about the subject. I 
know a considerable amount because it is part of my background. It 
is very easy to pull a short  section out of a statistical trend and say 
look, it is rising, it is dropping. If we are going to study a trend we 
have to study it over a reasonable period of time. I will grant that 
over the last couple of years there has been a very minor drop in the 
rate of violent crime in the country. But if we look at the statistics 
from about 1962 onward we can see many positive and negative 
blips. There is no such thing as a flat statistic trend.
<P>
	Then the hard fact of the matter is that the rate of violent crime in 
Canada since 1962 has increased by almost 400 per cent. I suspect 
the hon. member knows that. I wish that when he uses statistics he 
would use them a little more broadly and generously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
given to long statistical arguments. I would invite my colleague to 
review my comments. I did not cite specific statistics. I did speak 
to the misperception which has been statistically proven as a 
misperception by experts in the field, both in the justice and law 
enforcement system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> What about Statistics Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
asked me a question and now he does not seem to want the answer.
<P>
	The fact is that statistics prove that the misperception that we are 
on some rampant, runaway course of increase in violent crime in 
Canada today is simply not the case and it does none of us credit to 
fuel that misperception.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, justice 
policies often deal with issues which are the focus of great concern 
among Canadians. It is an area of public policy that comes under 
scrutiny daily in homes across the country as Canadians read their 
newspapers and watch the news. Unfortunately, it is also a source 
of a great deal of frustration.
<P>
	The failure of successive governments to effectively combat 
high risk offenders has left Canadians feeling wary and cynical. 
Canadians are well aware of the types of crimes that occur and 
reoccur in their communities. They are well aware of the 
challenges we as parliamentarians face. That is why it is difficult 
for me as a member of Parliament and a democrat to act on the 
conventional wisdom prevalent among so-called experts. They 
claim the concern among Canadians over crime issues is 
overstated. They would have us spend our energies telling our 
constituents that they have no reason to worry about crime in this 
country.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	I speak to my constituents every day and every day they tell me 
they are frustrated and afraid because of the level of violent crime 
in Canada. I am pleased to speak to this proposed legislation which 
addresses many of the concerns expressed by my constituents.
<P>
	This legislation addresses very legitimate fears among 
Canadians over the ability of the justice system to deal  with repeat 
sex offenders and specifically high risk offenders. It introduces 
tough 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5051"> 5051 </A></B>
<P>
but effective controls to tip the balance in the fight against crime in 
our favour.
<P>
	A case in point is the new long term offender designation. This 
designation was created to respond to the threat posed by sex 
offenders who do not quite qualify as dangerous offenders but still 
pose a risk to society. Bill C-55 proposes to add a period of 
supervision of up to 10 years following release from prison. This 
designation applies to a wide range of serious sexual offences from 
sexual touching to aggravated sexual assault.
<P>
	The long term offender designation could also be applied to a 
person who committed another offence that had a sexual 
component, for example, somebody who committed a break and 
enter with a clear intention of sexually assaulting the occupants.
<P>
	Canadians have consistently expressed frustration with the 
release from prison of sex offenders who are likely to reoffend. The 
dangerous offender designation responds to this concern in only the 
most extreme cases, leaving a significant gap in the high risk 
offender sentencing regime. The creation of the long term offender 
designation fills this gap.
<P>
	A long term offender finding can be made only where the court is 
satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility of eventually 
controlling the risk imposed by the individual to the community. 
This allows a more structured kind of sentence for this type of 
offender, allowing the courts to pass tailor made effective 
sentences within a broad framework. This approach to justice 
policy is characteristic of the manner in which this government and 
this minister have responded to the challenges of this very 
important portfolio.
<P>
	Efforts to streamline the sentencing process are evident in the 
proposed amendments to the dangerous offender provisions of the 
Criminal Code. Currently judges have the discretion to establish 
fixed sentences for individuals who are designated dangerous 
offenders. This is problematic.
<P>
	The federal-provincial-territorial task force on high risk violent 
offenders correctly reported last year that it makes no sense to go 
through the dangerous offender procedure only to obtain a fixed 
sentence comparable to what might have been obtained without 
this lengthy exercise.
<P>
	Under Bill C-55 when a dangerous offender application is 
successful the offender will automatically be sentenced to a period 
of indefinite incarceration. This measure is a recognition that 
dangerous offenders are just that and that the onus rests with them 
to demonstrate that they should be released from prison.
<P>
	Other measures in the proposed legislation underline this 
message. The initial parole review of a dangerous offender would 
be moved to the seventh year from the  third of incarceration and 
the number of psychiatrists required to testify has been reduced 
from two to one.
<P>
	The introduction of a mechanism to allow a dangerous offender 
application up to six months after conviction rather than at the time 
of sentencing will allow the crown to act on information which may 
be brought to its attention following the conviction of an offender.
<P>
	A third aspect of this legislation is the new judicial restraint 
provision which permits controls, including electronic monitoring 
of high risk offenders. This provision is much needed and has great 
potential for monitoring and controlling the movement of 
individuals who pose a risk of committing a serious personal injury 
offence. It should be noted that the exercise of this option does not 
depend on the individual's having committed a criminal offence. It 
is a preventive measure which will equip police with the means to 
monitor the conduct of offenders who pose a risk to society.
<P>
	I might suggest that one feature of this legislation be singled out 
for intense study in committee, the long term offender designation. 
This is a very innovative and desirable aspect of the proposed 
legislation which deserves special attention. The committee should 
ensure that judges have a great deal of flexibility in the substance 
of its application. I have a specific use in mind.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Judges should have the ability to prescribe the application of 
new technologies for use in the monitoring of high risk offenders. 
Electronic monitoring has a multiplicity of uses in the fight against 
crime.
<P>
	Judges should be vested with the ability to put this technology to 
use in monitoring high risk offenders. The committee should make 
every effort to ensure that the necessary legislation is in place to 
allow the application of new and emerging technologies to monitor 
long term offenders.
<P>
	This legislation represents a well thought out, effective approach 
to dealing with justice issues which are paramount in the minds of 
Canadians. Some politicians have made a career of demanding 
monolithic, inflexible blanket legislation which imposes hefty 
minimum sentences. They will no doubt argue, as they always do, 
that this legislation does not go far enough in the war against crime. 
To them and their supporters, I offer the following observations.
<P>
	It is true that we can draft any bill conceivable as long as it is 
within the jurisdiction of the federal government. However, if it 
will not work in the real world, the world that exists beyond these 
four walls, we are just wasting our time and betraying the trust of 
the people who put us here.
<P>
	Let us not take the easy way out. Let us take the time to draft 
effective legislation that works. I would like to remind all hon. 
members that drafting justice policy is  always a very difficult task. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5052"> 5052 </A></B>
<P>
We must balance the rights of the accused with the rights of the 
victims and the entitlement of society to an effective, fair justice 
system.
<P>
	We must not fall into the trap of introducing laws that are 
inflexible and therefore incompatible with the task of achieving 
individual acts of justice within a broad public policy framework.
<P>
	In the end, the true measure of an effective justice policy is the 
sum of the individual acts of the justice it achieves. We must strive 
to have effective laws. Bill C-55 achieves the balance required of 
good justice policy. I would encourage hon. members to give it 
their support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member intently as she made her presentation on 
Bill C-55. In her opinion this legislation was tough, it was going to 
really answer the concerns of a lot of Canadians.
<P>
	I have one major concern that Canadians have regarding sexual 
offenders, particularly pedophiles. The concern is that a pedophile, 
a sexual offender, is sentenced to a definite term. Because that 
person refused treatment, refused to follow through on the criteria 
set before them as far as rehabilitation in the Liberal sense, because 
the law is the law when the warrant expiry comes up, the offender 
is released into the community in spite of statements by 
psychiatrists, psychologists, those who in the know, prison 
officials, that clearly point to the fact that this individual is high 
risk, that this individual will reoffend.
<P>
	I do not see any provision in this bill that deals with the concern 
that Canadians have here. The minister had placed that point 
forward that the minister will allow a window of six months for a 
dangerous offender application to be made, thus determining an 
indeterminate sentence for that offender.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on that provision because 
there is a lack of teeth, if you will, still in Bill C-55 dealing with the 
sexual predators of this world.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If the hon. member for Brampton would care to 
answer now, I will permit a very brief answer. If not, the hon. 
member might want to answer right after the question period.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beaumier:</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the Reform Party view 
everything in black and white. There is no acknowledgement on 
their part that there are differences in sex offences. There has to be 
a provision for individual sentencing and determinations to occur.
<P>
	The member for Wild Rose said earlier that there are so many 
crimes that are not being reported. At the same time, they are 
saying that violence is increasing. We dealt with this a year ago.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You still have another minute and a half, but it 
being 2 p.m. I will proceed to statements by members.

	Like Daniel Martin, the municipality's founder who, around

aldermen, three alderwomen and the mayor, a position also held by 
a woman, namely Arlette Champagne-Lessard.

	Once again, Martinville has distinguished itself. Smaller than 
Montreal, maybe, not as well known as Quebec City, granted, but 
in the hearts of the people of the Eastern Townships and anyone

	It took five years before either a Tory or a Liberal Minister of

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXEVASION">TAX EVASION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, in a ministerial statement, the Minister of 
Finance implied that he was closing the tax loophole whereby a 
Canadian family trust was able to transfer $2.2 billion out of 
Canada tax free. The fact remains that the particular tax loophole is 
still there.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance confirm that the $2.2 billion 
transfer that took place in 1991 would still be possible today, 
despite the announcement made by the minister yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
no. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is mistaken. There 
was a loophole in the legislation, and yesterday, with my 
announcement, it was plugged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could the Minister of Finance confirm that the action he 
took yesterday regarding this problem of tax evasion did not plug 
the loophole, did not prevent money from being taken out of the 
country, but, on the contrary, only made things easier than in 1991, 
because now, with what the Minister of Finance has done, trusts 
will no longer have to pull a December 23 and obtain special 
authorization in order to be allowed the huge privilege of taking 
money out of Canada tax free?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, this has nothing to do with trusts. I was very clear in the 
1995 budget; we have eliminated all tax advantages for family 
trusts. The question is how to treat capital gains when someone, 
whether a trust, an individual or a corporation, wishes to leave the 
country.
<P>
	This was precisely the problem dealt with yesterday. In the past, 
it was not necessary, in certain cases, on leaving the country, to pay 
tax on gains that had accrued. As I said in yesterday's 
announcement, emigrants are now required to pay tax on capital 
gains or give us a security in order to ensure that Canada will 
receive its fair share.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am aware that this is a problem involving trusts and 
other financial vehicles as well, but the minister cannot say that he 
has removed all advantages for trusts in his last budget. This is 
effective 1999, so between now and then, they have the same 
advantages they had before. I take pleasure in correcting the 
minister on this point.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance says that an emigrant will give 
securities, he is relying on the signature of a notice of waiver, 
because sufficient security, under the Income Tax Act, usually 
takes the form of a notice of waiver. That is the basis on which he 
says that the taxes will eventually be paid to Canada.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the notice of waiver on which he is 
pinning his hopes of recovering the taxes due Revenue Canada at 
some future date has no legal value, but merely a moral one, as the 
deputy minister of Revenue Canada, Pierre Gravelle, yesterday told 
the public accounts committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the Leader of the Opposition is mistaken. If there is the 
slightest risk the Canadian government will not be paid its fair 
share of taxes, we will require a lot more than a notice of waiver. 
We will require a bond, a debenture, a valid security for ensuring 
that the taxes will be paid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the usual practice at this time, when assets are being 
transferred and we want to make sure that the trustee does not 
evade taxes, is that a notice of quit claim is required. That is the 
only guarantee we require at present, and it has no value in 
international law and tax conventions. That is the reality.
<P>
	Yesterday, contrary to what he has claimed, the Minister of 
Finance did not close up the tax loophole for family trusts. On the 
contrary, he announced that the interpretation of December 23, 
1991, which allowed the tax-free transfer to the United States of a 
two billion dollar trust will, in future, be government policy for all 
of the assets of millionaires and billionaires.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that, by extending the concept of 
taxable Canadian assets to Canadian residents, as he did yesterday 
in his ministerial statement, he has given his blessing to the scandal 
of 1991, which now becomes the basis of his taxation policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Bloc is having a little trouble getting the point. As I have just 
said, and as I said clearly in my  speech of yesterday, the security 
we intend to require will be far more than a quit claim, if there is 
any risk whatsoever of the individual's not paying his fair share of 
Canadian taxes. It is very clear, and I said so in my speech, that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5057"> 5057 </A></B>
<P>
could take the form of a debenture, a bond, but we will insist upon 
the security if necessary.
<P>
	Second, there was a loophole in the legislation in 1991. The 
legislation was applied as it stood, but there was a loophole.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	That loophole was blocked yesterday. We have closed up a great 
many loopholes, and will continue to do so, because it is our 
objective to have Canadians pay their fair share of the taxes owing 
to the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see the minister is in a co-operative mood today. If I 
have understood correctly-and we will see in the bill that will be 
introduced-he intends to require firm monetary commitments, 
real binding commitments. That is what we have been asking him 
to do since the beginning, so we are pleased today that he has just 
now given us at least part of an answer.
<P>
	Since he is in a co-operative mood, could he respond to other 
requests from the official opposition concerning the case of interest 
to us here? First of all, contrary to what he said yesterday in his 
ministerial statement, can he limit the use of the TCAs, taxable 
Canadian assets, solely to non-residents? Second- something he 
has not wanted to do from the start-could he demand that there be 
a complete investigation of the 1991 case, which is still somewhat 
unclear, and which is still an outrageous scandal for Canadian 
taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no scandal, The auditor general himself has said that there 
was no scandal of any kind, that the integrity of the public servants 
concerned was not in question.
<P>
	The auditor general himself, whom the hon. member has quoted 
on numerous occasions, has said that there was no scandal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is quite important that we understand what has happened here. 
There was a law in place in 1991, of which certain taxpayers took 
advantage. The government decided there was a loophole in the law 
which should be closed.
<P>
	We gave the matter to a parliamentary committee which made a 
series of recommendations. Within a month of those 
recommendations we stood up in this House of Commons and 
closed that loophole.
<P>
	Let us understand what the opposition is asking. Because it 
refuses to deal with the substance of the issue, it wants to make a 
lot of unsubstantiated charges. Also, opposition members are 
asking us to act retroactively.
<P>
	They are asking us to say to the world that Canada's laws do not 
stand, that we cannot count on them. They would destroy the 
economy of this country, and we will not do it.

	The minister has committed so many mistakes, from 
interference in the Somalia inquiry to personal contracts for 
political friends, bungling the downsizing of the forces, bungling 
the base closures, from budget overruns to mismanagement of

leave a lame duck minister in charge of the Canadian military?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

made yesterday by the Prime Minister that what we are seeing here 
is the politicizing of the entire hearing process dealing with our 
deployment to Somalia.
<P>
	This government has tried to do the right thing. We proposed an 
inquiry. We created the inquiry. We want the inquiry to do its job. 
We will hold to that line.
<P>
	Obviously the leader of the Reform Party does not like those 
answers, but he is going to get those answers until the inquiry 
reports.
<P>
	He says there is one thing that cannot be avoided and that there is 
a problem. I would say that we could use the same language about 
him and his party. There is one thing his party cannot avoid. The 
fact is there is a problem with leadership; it is a problem with his

the same old thing, let the inquiry do its work. We agree.
<P>
	Canadians also want the Prime Minister to do some work. The 
Prime Minister says do not interfere with the inquiry. The minister 
says the same thing. At the same time, this minister repeatedly 
protects and endorses General Boyle, one of the key figures being 
investigated by that inquiry. The government cannot have it both 
ways.

<P>
	If the government is serious about letting the inquiry do its 
work, why does it not instruct the Minister of National Defence 
to withdraw his protection and endorsation of General Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
public is finding it quite odd that the Reform Party, day in and day 
out, is going at this issue. It is, in effect, undermining the integrity 
of the inquiry process.
<P>
	Canadians want constructive suggestions about the economy, 
about national unity, about pension reform, about agriculture, 
about a host of other issues that affect them in their daily lives.
<P>
	What do we have here? We have a party that ostensibly 
supported the inquiry process but has done everything, by its 
behaviour in the House of Commons, to undermine it. That is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this answer from a minister who attempted to influence 
who sat on the inquiry, who tolerates document tampering before 
the inquiry and who himself makes statements of endorsation about 
General Boyle even before he gets off the stand at the inquiry. Who 
is interfering with the inquiry?
<P>
	We hear that the government is looking for an election slogan. 
We have one from a letter from a retired soldier: ``Canadians 
deserve better''. Our soldiers have been saddled with a lame duck 
minister and chief of defence staff.
<P>
	How long is it going to take the government to acknowledge that 
Canadians deserve better leadership at the top of the Canadian 
military?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really have 
tried to avoid politics as much as possible in this whole matter.
<P>
	Canadians want to find the truth regarding what happened with 
our deployment to Somalia. They want the commission to do its 
work.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party talks about Canadians deserving 
better from the government. Canadians deserve better from the 
opposition. They deserve an opposition that asks constructive, 
intelligent questions that contribute to the national policy debate, 
not to come here every day and try to make partisan political 
interjections on the facts not only of the inquiry but of the Canadian 
military itself.

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for mentioning that federal 
support to Quebec's aerospace industry has been very significant.
<P>
	Indeed, it is the Government of Canada that established 
technology centres in the Montreal region. It is also the

industry in Montreal. And now, we are committed to continue 
supporting Montreal's technology sector.
<P>

while this information is lacking in the French version-

situation, he would know that it is those sectors relying on the 
political framework, and the industry sectors supported by the 
government of Canada that do well, namely the pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology, telecommunication and aerospace industries.

	By contrast, the sectors that depend on the government of 
Quebec are doing very badly.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians know it is this Liberal government that has 
destroyed the morale of the Canadian Armed Forces. It is this lame 
duck minister and this government that are playing politics at the 
expense of armed forces personnel.
<P>
	Despite what the Liberals think, most military personnel who 
served in Somalia served with distinction and should be recognized 
for their often stellar performance.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the defence minister continue to support 
General Boyle but refuse to support the rank and file in the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Will the defence minister move his support from General Boyle 
to our Somalia veterans and strike and issue a Somalia medal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
question that the majority of work that was done in Somalia by our 
forces was exceptionally good. However, a serious problem has 
been identified and it is being dealt with by the commission.
<P>
	This government feels it would be inappropriate to issue such a 
medal at this time. Those people who will be deserving of a medal 
will get their medal in due course. However, I think we owe it to the 
commission and to a sense of fair play and justice to allow the 
commission to do its work before we proceed on any other matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government's failure to issue a Somalia medal 
shows its complete disregard for morale in the Canadian Armed 
Forces
<P>
	The Prime Minister is rewarding his bad apples, General Boyle 
and the defence minister, when they do not deserve it. Through his 
lack of leadership, the Prime Minister has caused morale in the 
forces to suffer.
<P>
	When will the government shift its obsessive and misguided 
support for the defence minister and General Boyle to recognize 
armed forces personnel who served in Somalia on Canada's behalf?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
Prime Minister and I have dealt with most of these points in recent 
days.
<P>
	The hon. member is often talking about the morale in the armed 
forces. There is no question that when people see television or 
newspaper reports of the inflammatory rhetoric that comes from 
the opposition day in and day out, that obviously affects morale.
<P>
	This is a difficult time for the armed forces. It is time for 
everyone to pull together and allow justice to take its course. I 
remind the hon. member, although he should know, a former 
member of the Canadian Armed Forces, that morale does not come 
only from leadership. Morale comes from a sense of worth, a sense 
of mission and a sense of duty to the country.
<P>
	I have every confidence in the men and women of the armed 
forces, despite the problems we are facing, that they feel they are 
getting that sense of worth, that they have a sense of mission and 
that they are serving with distinction despite all these problems.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
report on official languages in the public service, tabled this 
morning by the President of the Treasury Board, once again 
confirms that the federal government applies a double standard in 
its official languages policy.
<P>
	My question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. 
In Quebec, 54 per cent of the positions in the federal public service 
are bilingual, to serve an anglophone minority that represents 10 
per cent of the population. Why are francophones in Ontario and 
New Brunswick not entitled to the same quality of service in their 
language?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
think the opposition member missed the main point of the report. 
The main point is that the position of official languages in Canada 
is improving steadily, and the report indicates that progress is 
continuing in nearly all areas, including service to the public, 
language of work and equitable representation of francophones and 
anglophones in the Public Service.
<P>
	In Quebec, the proportion of anglophones and allophones is 
nearly 20 per cent, and consequently we have a proportionate 
number of bilingual public servants which reflects the needs of the 
province.
<P>
	In the other provinces, the percentages are much lower, and 
consequently the number of bilingual public servants is lower but 
adequate to existing needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government will not give francophones in the rest of Canada the 
same services as anglophones in Quebec. How can the President of 
the Treasury Board be a party to such discrimination, being a 
francophone himself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr.  Speaker, it is 
not true there is discrimination against francophones. About 63,000 
positions in the Public Service have been designated bilingual. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5060"> 5060 </A></B>
<P>
total percentage of francophone public servants in the Public 
Service is 27 per cent, while the proportion of francophones in the 
general population is 24.9 per cent. So there is no discrimination as 
far as numbers are concerned.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that if there is a problem, it is due to 
the fact that in Quebec, the proportion of anglophone public 
servants is only 5 per cent, while anglophones represent 13 per cent 
of the population. We will make every effort to correct this 
imbalance as we have done in the case of francophone communities 
outside Quebec.

quickly the heritage minister forgets her GST promises.
<P>
	Over the last six months the Minister of Canadian Heritage has 
announced spending of $20 million on Liberal propaganda, $23 
million on flags, $16 million on Radio Canada, and $100 million 
on a TV production fund. Not one penny of the money appears in 
the minister's detailed budget but it does add up to a grand total of 
$159 million.

	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage defend $140 million 
GST on books while spending $159 million in unbudgeted, 
borrowed money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I happy that the member

received a number of requests from across the country for flags. In

material which is written. I would ask you not to use the paper to 
wave it around or to use it as a prop. I would appreciate you doing 
that. I will return to the hon. Deputy Prime Minister for a brief 
response.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are further faxes from the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Faxes, Mr. Speaker, from a number of members of 
the Reform Party who obviously believe that the flag program is a 
popular and useful program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
quite understand the minister's point.
<P>
	Is she saying that Reform members should not be acting on 
behalf of their constituents when they come into their offices? She 
is simply trying to deflect the fact that when she was told that her 
Liberal propaganda office was going to cost $20 million, she said: 
``Oh, that's only a cup of coffee for every Canadian''. That is a 
typical Liberal answer.
<P>
	How can the minister justify this spending, wrapping herself in 
the flag and doing all of these things while at the same time leaving 
the tax, the GST, on books?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the third 
party obviously has a very strong affiliation with the flag program 
as well because in his constituency over 1,000 people have called 
the government concerning this most popular program ever.
<P>
	Over the last seven months the government has received over 
three million calls. Those same individuals in the Reform Party 
who stand day after day in the House of Commons complaining 
about the flag program have no shame in demanding that they 
receive flags for their constituents. Unfortunately for the Reform

<P>
	The embezzlement scandal at Valcartier continues to cause a stir. 
The lead witness in the inquiry into this matter contends that Public 
Works and Government Services Canada simply ignored schemes 
to bypass the tendering process. Clearly, the military police 
investigation was not very thorough. While this has been a 
widespread practice for at least 15 years, only 4 charges have been 
laid.
<P>

inquiry into this other scandal?

that, if certain things are not as they should be, the authorities are 
prepared to investigate as required.
<P>
	As far as the news report he mentioned is concerned, I have 
asked my officials to fill me in on what happened. I am told that a 
contract that could be extended for more than one year was 
awarded. During the first year of the contract, additional work was 
requested and performed. Later, the department asked for an 
explanation for this work and an explanation was provided. The 
work had to be paid for since it had been done; there was no choice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> This does not sound 
very reassuring, Mr. Speaker. Taxpayers have the right to know 
how their money is used.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Defence. Does the minister 
not realize that, by not calling an independent inquiry into this 
matter, he is lacking transparency and indirectly condoning a 
fraudulent scheme which, I remind him, is said to be widespread in 
several other bases, costing taxpayers in Quebec and Canada a 
fortune?

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
spending priorities say a lot about a government. This summer 
while hospitals were closing, while universities were cutting back 
on classes, while seniors prepared themselves for the benefits 
clawback, while the GST was being levied on the books and while 
the debt climbed up toward $600 billion, our heritage minister dug 
deep into taxpayers' pockets and found another $23 million for 
flags.
<P>

would prefer cutting in health, education and other priority areas 
while spending moneys on a flag program?

send the flags out to his constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> What a joke.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> The fact is flags certainly will not save a country,

flags are symbolic and this $23 million giveaway is symbolic too. 
It symbolizes a failed national unity strategy. It symbolizes the

<P>
	The relentless fight against inflation has been the Bank of 
Canada's policy since 1988, and this goal set by the former 
governor expires at the end of 1998. So talks on the monetary 
policy to be adopted for the next decade are now being held.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Finance specify his government's position 
with regard to the inflation fighting strategy soon to be adopted by 
the Bank of Canada for the years 1998 to 2008?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we will certainly have talks with the Bank of Canada when the time 
comes. It would be premature at this stage to comment. I would, 
however, like to make a slight correction: the 1 to 3 per cent goal 
valid until 1998 was set by myself and the current Governor of the 
Bank of Canada when we came to office in 1993-94.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today's 
interest rates are low but the question is: Will they stay low? Now 
that we know the disastrous impact a zero inflation monetary 
policy can have on employment, will the Minister of Finance see to 
it that the Bank of Canada does not unduly restrict the money 
supply as soon as inflation raises its head?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question because he raises a very 
important point. I can tell him that the 1 to 3 per cent range set by 
the government and the Bank of Canada remains our goal at this 
time.
<P>
	Canada paid dearly, perhaps too dearly, in the fight against 
inflation in the early 1990s. Now that our inflation rate is very low, 
it is an asset we want to keep.  Having said that, I think the range 
set jointly by the Bank of Canada and the government is 
appropriate for now.

Minister promised seniors that the OAS and GIS payments which 
they receive would not be reduced. However, budget documents 
show that some seniors will pay at least $1,200 more per year in 
taxes.
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised that senior benefits would not be 
reduced. Budget documents show that the removal of age and 
pension tax credits will in fact reduce seniors' income.
<P>
	Who should Canadian seniors believe: the Prime Minister or the 
budget documents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the time the new seniors' benefit was set out it was made very clear 
that current seniors would be protected, that the new benefit plan 
would come into effect only in the year 2000 and at that point 
seniors would have the ability to choose which of the two plans was 
best for them.
<P>
	There may well be changes in the tax act that are going to affect 
all Canadians. Those changes will occur. However, let us be very 
clear. The Prime Minister said that current seniors would be 
protected and current seniors have been protected.
<P>
	It is very important that we listen to what the Prime Minister said 
because opposite him is the Reform Party which has made it very 
clear that it would eviscerate the Canada pension plan, the OAS and 
the GIS. That is why what the Prime Minister said is so important.

	I know Canadian seniors have a bit of a worry with the present

clawback provisions of the seniors benefit affect low income 
seniors the most and by far the hardest. Income of up to $16,000 is 
clawed back at a rate of 50 per cent, but income between $16,000 
and $25,000 is not clawed back at all. It makes absolutely no sense

	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The Prime Minister promised protection; the

books, revise that portion of the provisions of the clawback and 
make if fair to seniors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
it be very clear that what we have done is ensure that low income 
and middle income seniors will be protected. It is true that at the 
upper end certain seniors may receive less. That has been done in 
order to make the program sustainable and to make sure that low 
income seniors are taken care of.
<P>
	However, I think a far more significant thing has been said here 
today in this House. A member of the third party has finally 
admitted that which all Canadians know: whether it is health 
policy, pension policy, or another way in which they approach 
society, theirs is a party of extremists. It is a party that refuses to 
take the middle course. It is a party that says extremism is a virtue.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to know what the government has on the 
agenda for the coming week.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today and tomorrow we will deal with Bill C-55 and 
hopefully be done with it. If this is the case, we will resume the 
debate on Bill C-58, which concerns marine transportation, before 
moving on to Bill C-29.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On Monday we will be calling Bill C-26, the oceans bill. After 
that, we would like to do report stage and third reading of Bill 
C-54, the extraterritorial measures bill, and second reading of the 
Canada-Israel trade agreement bill that was introduced this 
morning.
<P>
	We would then like to get Bill C-60, the food inspection bill into 
committee. In this regard, I would like to give notice to the House 
that it is the intention of the  Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5064"> 5064 </A></B>
<P>
to propose that Bill C-60 be referred to committee before second 
reading.
<P>
	We would then turn to the Indian and northern affairs bills, Bill 
C-6 and Bill C-50, followed by Bill C-49 regarding administrative 
tribunals, and Bill C-47 respecting reproductive technologies.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-55, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (high risk offenders), the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Records 
Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Department of the 
Solicitor General Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like to know if the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm intends to speak for 20 minutes, or if he will 
split his time with a colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to speak for 20 minutes.
<P>
	There is no doubt that, with the introduction of Bill C-55, the 
Minister of Justice fulfils a popular wish. Western Canada, among 
other regions, must be pleased to see measures which, at first 
glance, are aimed at strengthening and tightening the supervision 
of high risk offenders and at keeping them in prison for a longer 
period.
<P>
	However, we should not rejoice too quickly, since this is a bill 
motivated by purely partisan considerations and the fact that the 
next election is not far away.
<P>
	In order to assess Bill C-55, one must see where it comes from, 
know what is currently being done in this area, and try to figure out 
the purpose of the proposed amendments. You will realize that Bill 
C-55 is hardly the result of lengthy research by the federal Minister 
of Justice and that it did not originate with him, since it is a topic 
that has been discussed for a long time and one on which even the 
Conservatives had done some very thorough research.
<P>
	In fact, between 1988 and 1993, if I may digress to provide a 
better understanding of the purpose of these amendments, many 
studies were carried out and many people looked into this problem. 
There were provincial commissions of inquiry on the Stephenson 
case, the Pepino federal commission of inquiry, and reports by the 
Standing Committee on Justice on serious and bodily harm in 
February 1993 and on the Fulston and Crews case in April 1993.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	All this combined with increasing public pressure led members 
of the Conservative caucus in 1988-93, faced  with the Reform 
threat, to convince the Conservative government that it should 
propose a series of measures, which it did in the form of a white 
paper on the subject of dangerous offenders.
<P>
	On May 25, 1993, the then solicitor general Doug Lewis tabled 
two draft bills, which covered five main components, most of 
which we see again today in Bill C-55. The first component is 
post-sentence detention, which could be ordered by a court and the 
purpose of which was to incarcerate indefinitely inmates who were 
found to be far too dangerous to be released on expiry of their 
sentence.
<P>
	The second point indicated in this draft bill was long-term 
supervision for a maximum of 10 years, to be imposed by the 
courts at the time of sentencing. The third point was no parole for 
offenders serving a sentence for sexual assaults against children 
and automatically considered as having caused serious harm to the 
victim.
<P>
	The fourth point was a change in the calculation of consecutive 
sentences for any new convictions during a parole period that 
would result in an extending the time of detention. The last point 
concerned various amendments to the Parole Act, including a 
disciplinary committee for members of the National Parole Board. 
This happened between 1988 and 1993, as you can see. After a 
series of studies, in 1993 a number of components were defined 
and the bill was introduced with these five components.
<P>
	One would have thought that, if amendments in this area were so 
badly needed, the Minister of Justice would have amended the 
Criminal Code immediately after his election, since the research 
had been done. He did not. Since this was a popular issue with the 
public, the government preferred to wait a little longer to be able to 
use this issue closer to an election, and use it for campaign 
purposes.
<P>
	According to the same study, in 1993, the then minister set up a 
federal-provincial-territorial task force to consider the problem of 
high risk violent offenders. In 1994, the new Liberal government 
tabled Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act, but all this was still subject to the task force's soon to 
be released report on high risk offenders.
<P>
	In January 1995, the federal-provincial-territorial task force on 
high risk violent offenders set up by the Conservatives and 
maintained by the Liberals released its report outlining a strategy 
for managing high risk offenders. The report contained a series of 
recommendations. Among other things, the task force 
recommended that dangerous offender provisions and civil 
incarceration procedures be used more often in the case of 
dangerous offenders suffering from mental illness who had almost 
completed their sentences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5065"> 5065 </A></B>
<P>
	It also proposed a procedure for criminals to be declared 
long-term offenders so they could be subject to  supervision after 
their release. As you can see, the conclusions in this report bear a 
great deal of resemblance to the bill tabled by the then solicitor, Mr. 
Lewis, in 1993. The wheel had already been invented back in 1993.
<P>
	In March 1996, a Reform member tried to revive former minister 
Lewis' bill during private members' business. In May 1996, a bill 
on the government business research project was tabled. This is 
another study in the area, this time on dangerous offenders.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	This study, which focused on 64 dangerous offenders and 34 
high-risk violent offenders, was designed to help solicitors 
determine which cases met the criteria for being declared 
dangerous offender. The report contained 11 recommendations.
<P>
	There were many studies, as you can see. We have been looking 
into this problem for years. We had a series of tools at our disposal 
to act quickly in an emergency, if there was a need to amend the 
legislation, but these were not used until the very last minute.
<P>
	What is the present situation? Is there a vacuum, a void in the 
legislation? We have seen all the publicity around Bill C-55, the 
reassurance the minister wanted to give the people of Quebec and 
Canada through this legislation, as if that was the problem and he 
had just found a magic solution.
<P>
	But the subject of dangerous offenders is already covered by the 
existing legislation, part XXIV of the Criminal Code, sections 752 
through 761. More and more individuals are being declared 
dangerous offenders. Statistics show that, in March 1995, 145 
inmates had been declared dangerous offenders. Of these, 51 per 
cent were in a maximum security institution, 43 per cent in a 
medium security institution and the rest, or 4.5 per cent, in a 
psychiatric institution.
<P>
	Dangerous criminals are not out on the street. We already have in 
the Criminal Code all that we need to jail those who need to be and 
to identify dangerous offenders as such. The problem rests with 
enforcement.
<P>
	Does the justice minister's Bill C-55 do more? Is the Minister of 
Justice ensuring that the citizens of this country and their families 
will be afforded better protection? Perhaps we should take a look at 
what exactly this bill provides for.
<P>
	The bill aims to make it easier for the courts to attach the 
``dangerous offender'' label to violent offenders who are likely to 
offend again. In short, it covers four points, which are strangely 
similar to the four I mentioned earlier in reference to the bill 
former solicitor general Lewis had introduced. As I said, the Lewis 
bill was introduced in 1993. We waited three years for essentially 
the same results.
<P>
	First, a special court hearing to have an accused designated a 
dangerous offender; there is nothing particular about this. Second, 
the Crown will have until six months after the conviction to make a 
dangerous offender application; this may be a new element that was 
not in the Lewis bill. It is easy to understand the reason for this 
six-month period, given that useful additional evidence is 
sometimes obtained later by the crown.
<P>
	Third, the number of psychiatrists who have to testify at a 
hearing goes up from one to two. Fourth, the initial review of an 
application for parole by a dangerous offender increases from three 
to seven years.
<P>
	The bill also creates a new category of offender, who will be 
subject to long-term supervision, for up to ten years. This new 
category will include offenders convicted of sexual assault, sexual 
interference, invitation to sexual touching, sexual exploitation, 
exposure, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, 
or breaking and entering to sexually assault an occupant.
<P>
	So far, we cannot really be opposed to this bill and its proposed 
changes.
<P>
	Legal constraint could also be used in the case of an accused 
found not guilty by the court, but likely to commit a serious 
personal injury offence, as defined under section 752 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Such constraint could include the use of electronic monitoring 
when such a program exists in a province. We are totally opposed 
to this approach, which goes against a number of judicial 
precedents and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is 
a very serious violation of recognized legal principles, and I will 
get back to this later on in my speech.
<P>
	Finally, in the case of the fourth point concerning low-risk 
offenders, there is no problem with an increased use of risk 
assessments by lawyers, judges and prosecutors so that sentences 
can be served in the community; there is no problem with more 
frequent use of day parole; nor is there a problem with correctional 
services using particular techniques on a more frequent basis to 
reduce repeat offences; and, finally, there is no problem with 
encouraging the use by natives of sentencing circles either.
<P>
	So there you have Bill C-55 tabled by the minister in this House. 
It is well-intentioned but, in my humble opinion, the minister has 
merely given an official legal structure to what is current practice. 
What he is seeking to achieve through amendments is already 
being done by judges and the legal world as a whole through their 
discretionary powers.
<P>
	In cases where judges realize that the person before them is a 
dangerous offender, they make sure that he cannot regain his 
freedom as easily as that. In fact, the courts are already handing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5066"> 5066 </A></B>
<P>
down indefinite sentences to offenders identified as dangerous. 
According to the statistics consulted, there are a good dozen a year.
<P>
	In addition, even under the present legislation, none of the 
offenders identified as dangerous by the courts have been granted 
parole on their first application after three years, so it goes to seven 
years and the result is the same.
<P>
	Why is the public being treated to all this song and dance? In the 
end, it is to persuade the public that Bill C-55 now before us will be 
the answer to almost all the problems with dangerous offenders. I 
would say to you that it is because it is a good move, election wise, 
because it goes over well, particularly out west.
<P>
	Although the minister could have taken action much earlier, he 
was waiting for the right moment. He was waiting for a good date 
in the party's electoral calendar. By responding to the Reform 
Party's campaign, the minister is minimizing his party's losses.
<P>
	Furthermore, I wonder to what extent Ottawa consulted. We 
were told that it carried out a series of consultations. I heard the 
minister himself say so. Section 810.2, subsections 1 to 10, 
allowing a judge to order preventive monitoring for an accused 
found not guilty, was never part of these consultations. I checked 
with my colleagues in Quebec, and we realize that this point was 
never submitted for discussion. They were very surprised to see 
this matter of electronic monitoring in the bill.
<P>
	When you talk about electronic monitoring, you are also talking 
about additional costs. That, too, was not discussed. We do not 
know who will cover these costs, it was not discussed. Generally 
speaking, the criticism we have of this bill concerns the costs. In 
1993, the cost was evaluated at $150 million by the former solicitor 
general of Canada, Mr. Lewis. Today, it could go as high as $250 
million with electronic monitoring. We have no commitment from 
the minister as to who will pay.
<P>
	There is no evidence that electronic bracelets are a reliable way 
to monitor dangerous offenders. Some reports from the United 
States indicate that a person who is fitted with a bracelet must 
remain within a certain radius of his telephone, because the waves 
are transmitted via the telephone. If the person is one floor down, 
he disappears from the screen, and we no longer know where he is.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, an electronic bracelet will not keep a dangerous 
offender from repeating an offence or an assault. A bracelet will 
only help the police to find out where the individual was on a given 
date at a given time. As far as crime prevention is concerned, the 
system is worthless.
<P>
	This is one point where we are very critical of the bill. That the 
government did not act sooner is another point, as I said earlier, and 
above all-and I think this is a good question-how does the 
Correctional Service of Canada  intend to make this new system 
work, a system that will involve increased supervision, when today, 
that same correctional service is unable to prevent the sale of drugs 
in so-called maximum security prisons?
<P>
	I had an opportunity to question the commissioner in committee, 
and he admitted quite frankly that drugs were a problem in our 
prisons, but they were incapable of monitoring all that. They are 
incapable of monitoring the circulation of drugs in prisons, and 
they want to supervise dangerous or so-called dangerous offenders 
using electronic bracelets. It does not make sense, considering the 
cost involved.
<P>
	Another point is that Bill C-55 contains no preventive measures. 
It has an extremely serious weakness. Nor does the bill reflect the 
reality of 1996, because when we look at the statistics, we realize 
that the number of violent crimes has decreased by 13 per cent 
since 1991. We also realize, on the basis of the same statistics, that 
cases of sexual assault have dropped 21 per cent since 1994.
<P>
	So things are not all that bad. I agree that the ideal situation is 
paradise. I agree that we see full page headlines in the newspapers, 
but if I told you that newspaper headlines are inversely 
proportionate to reality, what would you say? You would say I was 
right. Indeed. But big headlines sell newspapers. And the Reform 
Party takes advantage of those headlines. Every day we see Reform 
Party members using the newspaper headlines to try and make 
political capital. But reality is different.
<P>
	We must keep working on prevention as they are doing in 
Quebec and in more and more Canadian provinces as well. But Bill 
C-55 is a band-aid solution being used to cope with a problem that 
is far more serious than that.
<P>
	There is also another point, another important criticism, which is 
that the bill does not contain any clauses related to extending prison 
terms or creating a monitoring system for an inmate who turned out 
to be far more dangerous when his release was imminent than when 
he was sentenced. It is not possible to know that someone 
sentenced for 10 or 15 years will not be more dangerous when he 
comes out than when he went in. We have absolutely nothing about 
this in Bill C-55.
<P>
	Finally, what I feel is the major point is the problem relating to 
an acknowledged principle, the presumption of innocence, since 
section 810.2 would allow a judge, as I have just said, to bring 
down a not guilty verdict while imposing supervision, which casts 
doubt on the validity of his verdict.
<P>
	I believe very sincerely that, when a society starts to suspend 
such basic rights as the presumption of innocence on a 
case-by-case basis, it is treading close to the line of intolerance and 
is at risk of falling over that line into unjustified excesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5067"> 5067 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian society and Quebec society merely mirror the people 
who constitute them. Society, therefore, bears a share of the 
responsibility, and this bill I have before me, Bill C-55, does not 
reflect this sharing of responsibility.
<P>
	It is imperative, and absolutely necessary, for the government 
and Parliament as a whole, to ensure the protection of our children, 
the ensure the protection of our families, as well, of course, as to 
ensure the protection of society.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	As a party and as responsible individuals we intend to fight for 
these important principles. However, I would have liked to see in 
this bill a comprehensive prevention policy that would really try to 
achieve the objective the minister had in mind. I will have to wait 
for another bill, because I can find nothing in Bill C-55 that gives 
me reason to believe the safety of the public, of our children and of 
society in general will be improved. I see absolutely nothing in this 
bill that would achieve this.
<P>
	That being said, the Bloc Quebecois as the official opposition 
can hardly object to the principle of a bill whose purpose is to 
protect the public against violent or dangerous offenders, and 
deficient though the bill may be, there is a principle to which we 
cannot object.
<P>
	However, I think the minister should be very careful when he 
says that this kind of bill will solve practically all our problems. I 
think he is raising expectations among the public, which clearly 
will not be met by Bill C-55.
<P>
	I therefore urge the minister to pay attention to what I just said, 
to review that part of the bill which concerns the electronic bracelet 
and electronic monitoring, and remove the part which I think might 
be challenged by the courts and which would otherwise cost the 
governments of Canada and Quebec and all taxpayers who would 
challenge this part of the legislation a fortune in legal fees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Annapolis 
Valley-Hants.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise today in support of Bill C-55, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code for high risk offenders, the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Records 
Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Department of the 
Solicitor General Act. I was pleased to hear that members of the 
Bloc Quebecois will be supporting the bill.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate both the Minister of Justice and 
Attorney General of Canada and the Solicitor General of Canada 
for introducing this bill as early as they have.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Canadians are very concerned about 
personal safety, as well as the safety of their  families. Indeed, this 
bill has already been endorsed by a number of communities and 
individuals across the country.
<P>
	Bill C-55 represents one of the most significant initiatives in 
relation to the criminal justice system in Canada. In keeping with 
the Liberal election platform, our government is committed to 
public safety in this country. This promise was reiterated in the 
throne speech of February 27, 1996, when the government stated: 
``The non-violent character of our country, safe homes, safe streets, 
is also an essential element of security for Canadians''. The bill 
fulfils that commitment by taking the necessary steps to ensure the 
safety of our streets.
<P>
	The main components of Bill C-55 are threefold. There is a new 
category created, the long term offender category. This category 
targets sex offenders and provides for supervision of their 
movement up to ten years after they have completed their parole 
and prison sentences. Convictions made in this category can 
include sexual assault, sexual touching, sexual exploitation, 
indecent exposure, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault 
with a weapon or causing bodily harm.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The second main component of this bill deals with dangerous 
offenders. The dangerous offender procedure focuses on cases 
where there is a very high level of brutality. Under the proposed 
changes a judge will no longer have the discretion and will be 
required to impose an indefinite sentence.
<P>
	The crown under current laws may bring an application to 
declare someone a dangerous offender in the period between 
conviction and sentencing. However, the amendment to this bill 
will allow the crown to bring in a dangerous offender application 
up to six months after conviction.
<P>
	The third main category of Bill C-55 allows a new judicial 
restraint provision to be added to the Criminal Code. This will 
permit pre-emptive controls including electronic monitoring to be 
applied to individuals. If there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that an individual has a high risk of committing a serious personal 
injury offence, the judge can impose conditions on that individual.
<P>
	In conjunction with these initiatives Bill C-55 discusses 
alternatives for incarceration of low risk, non-violent offenders. 
The federal inmate population has increased 22 per cent in the last 
five years. Canada's incarceration rate is 130 per 100,000 
population. This statistic is far ahead of countries such as Britain, 
which has 92; France, 86; Germany, 81. However, it is also far 
behind our neighbouring country, the United States, where the rate 
is 529: in Russia it is 558. Imagine, out of 100,000 population over 
500 are sitting in prison.
<P>
	This is what Reform Party members want this country to lead to. 
They should be ashamed of themselves. They  should go back to 
their constituents and ask do they want what is in the United States. 
Do they want what is in Russia? Or do they want the Canadian way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5068"> 5068 </A></B>
<P>
of doing things? I think their constituents will tell them they will 
have the Canadian way of justice in this country.
<P>
	Low risk, non-violent offenders are those who have not 
committed a crime involving personal violence and whose risk of 
reoffending is low. This government's first priority is the safety of 
Canadians. Not all offenders need to be imprisoned to achieve this 
goal of public safety. Promoting measures such as sentencing 
reforms and community diversion programs as alternatives for 
imprisonment for first time non-violent offenders at a low risk of 
reoffending distinguishes between the low risk and the high risk 
offenders.
<P>
	This balanced approach by this government came about through 
consultations with provincial and territorial governments, the 
National Crime Prevention Council, voluntary organizations and 
community groups such as Parkdale Focus Community Watch in 
my riding which met with the minister, and the minister listened to 
their concerns and those concerns are addressed in this legislation.
<P>
	In addition, much input was received from individual 
constituents. This was instrumental in bringing forward this 
legislation.
<P>
	The measures announced last week are in response to 
communities such as Parkdale-High Park where citizens have 
lived in fear because of a high risk offender being housed in a local 
correctional facility.
<P>
	Indeed community safety is a high priority in my riding, as in all 
of our ridings. This was especially evident when a pedophile was 
placed at a correctional centre in the west end of Toronto. Bobby 
Oatway, a third time federal offender, served 10 years for sexual 
assaults including rape, indecent assault, buggery and bestiality, 
and was brought into my riding from British Columbia with no 
prior consultation with the citizen advisory committee which we 
have set up. In fact, there was no knowledge of his relocation from 
B.C. to my riding until after his placement.
<P>
	Mr. Oatway refused treatment while in prison, was considered 
too dangerous to be returned to his home community in British 
Columbia, and yet was found to be safe enough to be plunked into 
our community in the west end of Toronto. If a pedophile is too 
dangerous in one community, the solution is not to transfer him 
into another community.
<P>
	Reform asks why do we not do something about it. We are doing 
something about it. That is why we are bringing in Bill C-55. I hope 
we can get speedy passage with the support of the Reform Party.
<P>
	My constituents were enraged when this individual who had 
committed atrocious crimes against children was placed in a 
minimum security facility that is close to five  elementary schools, 
a shelter for battered women and several child care centres. Any 
parent in this circumstance would be concerned about their 
children's safety and the potential denial of their children's basic 
right to life. This bill goes a long way toward protecting the basic 
right of children, the right to life.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	On arrival to Toronto on statutory release, Oatway resided at 
Keele Community Correctional Centre. He participated in 
assessments with our district psychologist as well as with the 
admitting psychiatrist with the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry. He 
was under 24 hour supervision within the Keele Community 
Corrections Centre. All access to the community had to be under 
escort.
<P>
	The residents living near the centre, community organizations 
and local politicians mounted such a strong and effective 
opposition that Mr. Oatway himself requested to be returned to 
prison in British Columbia.
<P>
	Under Bill C-55, the Oatways will not be a threat to communities 
either in B.C. or in Parkdale-High Park. The principle concern 
that remains within my constituency is why was Bobby Oatway not 
declared a dangerous offender. The application for dangerous 
offender must be submitted by the crown upon conviction. This did 
not occur in this case and the Correctional Service Canada does not 
have the legislative powers to impose such a designation.
<P>
	Under the proposed changes the government will now have up to 
six months after conviction to bring in a dangerous offender. Under 
the proposal a convicted person found to be a long term offender 
would be subject to a prison sentence suited to the offence with an 
additional period of supervision for up to 10 years.
<P>
	In April I attended a public meeting at Indian Road Crescent 
Public School where I received almost 1,000 signatures concerning 
Bobby Oatway. The petition was forwarded to the Minister of 
Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada and I am pleased that 
the Liberal government has listened to our communities right 
across this country by acting appropriately to seek improvements 
to dangerous offenders legislation and to ensure public safety.
<P>
	It is my strong belief that these government amendments will 
extend controls over persons convicted of sex crimes and other 
violent offences and will give us the measure to monitor their 
activities. In the event that they recommit, these amendments will 
put them where they belong, in jail.
<P>
	Through this legislation there can be an effective combining of 
policing, prosecution, sentencing, custody, supervision and 
rehabilitation strategies that will control high risk groups within 
our society and keep our streets and neighbourhoods safe for our 
children and the general public.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief since I know some of my colleagues would 
like to ask questions of the hon. member. I was very interested 
to listen to his remarks, especially the case of Bobby Oatway, 
which I am fairly familiar with.
<P>
	I would like him to explain as succinctly as possible exactly how 
Bill C-55 will prevent Mr. Oatway from being released? How is it 
going to get him classified as the dangerous offender that he 
certainly is? I agree with the member's sentiments about Mr. 
Oatway, as would all members in this place.
<P>
	My understanding of Bill C-55 is that they will be able to apply 
to have people like him classified as dangerous offenders and kept 
in prison for an indeterminate amount of time, if application is 
made six months after conviction. But it has been quite a long time. 
As the member said, Mr. Oatway has already served 10 years. It is 
not six months after conviction so how will Bill C-55 keep Mr. 
Oatway in jail where he should be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question 
and I am pleased that he knows the case. It affected communities in 
British Columbia as well as in Ontario.
<P>
	Bobby Oatway was released because we did not have Bill C-55. 
This is why we are bringing in this legislation, so that the judge 
after sentence has six months to declare him a dangerous offender.
<P>
	There is a very small population of Canadian criminals that fits 
into the category of dangerous offender. Before there was no such 
thing. We are trying to identify the very serious offenders who 
should not be allowed into communities. That is what this 
legislation will do. He can actually be in prison indefinitely. If the 
hon. member would study this bill, he would see that and would 
convince his party to support it and give it speedy passage.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to the comments of the hon. member. I can really 
identify with what he is saying when it comes to the scenario he 
outlined regarding Mr. Bobby Oatway, a serious sexual offender. I 
too had a similar circumstance in my own riding. The unfortunate 
part is that I do not see Bill C-55 answering the hon. member's 
concern nor the concerns of other members who have similar 
situations in their ridings.
<P>
	A serious sexual offender, unless he is declared a dangerous 
offender at the time of sentencing, cannot be declared one after that 
six month period time. Therein lies the problem. There are serious 
sexual offenders being released into the community after serving 
their sentence and all authorities have indicated that they are a high 
risk.
<P>
	I would suggest that the hon. member look at that legislation the 
Minister of Justice is putting forward and seek to have him address 
that particular point because this bill does not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, again we should make it very clear to the 
public that the Oatways and Olsons were out endangering 
communities because we did not have this kind of legislation.
<P>
	Now, after a judge makes a conviction, the judge still has six 
months in which to identify him as a dangerous offender, if the 
information that is collected points this out. Members of the 
Reform Party are living in the past. They are quoting cases of 
criminals who have been out endangering our communities. These 
criminals were doing that because we did not have this legislation.
<P>
	This legislation does allow us to identify the Olsons and the 
Oatways as high risk offenders and they can be imprisoned 
indefinitely if need be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and speak in support of Bill 
C-55.
<P>
	Since our government took office in 1993, improving public 
safety has been a major priority and we have passed a series of 
important legislative initiatives in this regard.
<P>
	This bill is an important step in our efforts to keep our streets and 
our homes safe from violence. Members will recall in the 1996 
speech from the throne our government pledged to ``focus 
resources on high risk offenders while developing innovative 
alternatives for low risk offenders''. This legislation will ensure 
that we will meet this commitment.
<P>
	Let us look for example at the provisions in this bill dealing with 
high risk offenders. The bill includes a new long term offender 
designation that targets sex offenders and adds a period of long 
term supervision of up to 10 years following the release from 
prison. This designation will apply to people such as sex offenders 
who are less violent and brutal than dangerous offenders but are 
found to pose a considerable risk in reoffending.
<P>
	Now undoubtedly members from the third party will say: ``Why 
not keep these people in jail, lock them up and throw the key 
away''. That seems to be their one and only solution on the issue of 
crime and justice they put forward.
<P>
	The reality is that eventually prison sentences will come to an 
end. For a person who falls under this category, no matter how long 
they serve, they will some day be released. A long term offender 
designation will however ensure that offenders are closely 
monitored beyond the completion of their sentence. Rather than 
locking people up and throwing away the key, our government is 
working to find responsible, workable solutions to serious public 
safety issues.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5070"> 5070 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	I believe the best hope for rehabilitation is to gradually 
reintegrate an offender back into the community. By imposing on 
the offender an additional period of supervision in the community 
after the end of his regular sentence, we are giving the offender an 
opportunity to reintegrate into society. In doing so, we are not 
putting public safety at risk.
<P>
	The second component of the bill includes strengthening the 
dangerous offender provision in the Criminal Code. Again, we 
have listened to Canadians who have expressed concerns about 
public safety and we have responded in a forceful yet reasonable 
manner.
<P>
	Under the new provisions, anyone who is classified as a 
dangerous offender will be kept in prison indefinitely. The judge 
will no longer have the discretion to sentence a dangerous offender 
to a fixed term. As well, presently the dangerous offender 
application must be made at trial. Under Bill C-55, the crown will 
now be able to bring an application forward within six months after 
conviction.
<P>
	While members of the third party grandstand day after day 
posing as defenders of the public's safety, our government is 
working to ensure that such measures are put in place, measures 
that will genuinely improve public safety in our communities.
<P>
	The legislation also includes a new judicial restraint provision. 
This provision will permit controls, including electronic 
monitoring, to individuals who pose a high risk of committing a 
serious personal injury offence. Under these provisions, a judge 
will have the power to impose general conditions such as keeping 
the peace, specific conditions appropriate to the kind of threats 
posed by the individual such as staying away from places where 
children congregate.
<P>
	As one of the conditions for example, a judge could order that 
the program of electronic monitoring be applied in provinces where 
this option is available. A breach of conditions would constitute a 
separate criminal offence which could lead to a jail sentence.
<P>
	The tough new measures we are bringing forward in the bill will 
address many of the concerns we as members of Parliament hear 
from our constituents. Over the summer months I held a series of 
town hall meetings in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants. At 
these meetings the issue of crime and public safety was brought 
forward on numerous occasions. People are concerned. They want 
to know that they can walk safely through their communities. They 
want to know that the violent and sexual offenders will not be free 
to walk the streets because our justice system has been too lenient 
on them. They want to know that the punishment will fit the crime.
<P>
	I would like to read a brief quote from a letter from one of my 
constituents on this issue. The constituent writes: ``I do not want to 
see a big brother society, but I feel strongly that peaceful citizens 
have a right to safety on the highway and in their homes''. I could 
not agree more. I believe that the tough new measures included in 
the bill will address the concerns that we members of Parliament 
are hearing.
<P>
	Another important component of Bill C-55 is our approach to 
low risk non-violent offenders. I am referring to those offenders 
who have not committed a crime involving personal violence and 
whose risk of reoffending is assessed to be low. Unlike members of 
the third party, our government recognizes that not all offenders 
need to be imprisoned in order to improve public safety.
<P>
	The experience of American states which have used such an 
approach should be a lesson to us that incarceration of all 
non-violent offenders does not necessarily lead to lower levels of 
crime. Our government recognizes that low risk non-violent 
offenders can be best dealt with by serving their sentences in the 
community with appropriate control and supervision. I strongly 
believe that in such instances our community is best served by 
promoting rehabilitation and community responsibility rather than 
just simply locking people up in jails.
<P>
	Crime is certainly not a simple issue. Our government's 
approach avoids the kind of simplistic solutions we keep hearing 
from the third party. Flogging petty criminals and throwing more 
and more non-violent offenders in prison for long periods of time is 
not the answer.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Instead, we are taking serious measures to clamp down on 
violent, sexual or dangerous offenders in our society. At the same 
time we are promoting community oriented rehabilitation and 
treatment of non-violent offenders who are not considered a threat 
to our communities. This is the type of balanced and reasonable 
approach that will truly make a difference on issues of public safety 
and crime prevention. That is why I support Bill C-55.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member referred to the members of the third party, the Reform 
Party or whatever, as having an attitude on crime of lock them up 
and throw away the key.
<P>
	I would like to know which member said that. I would like the 
member to refer specifically to whose opinion that is and who said 
that. I do not like a general comment that all Reformers are this or 
all Reformers are that. Not all Liberals are incompetent, just 
95.5-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The member also said that the punishment should 
meet the crime. In saying that, does he believe that the penalty for 
premeditated first degree murder is a review after 15 years? After 
someone receives a lifetime sentence subject to parole, subject to a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5071"> 5071 </A></B>
<P>
review after 25 years, another relaxation for a first degree 
murderer, a killer who premeditated gets a review after 15 years.
<P>
	This is the kind of legislation the Liberal government has 
brought in and all the Liberals voted for. All the Liberals support 
the view that the punishment should meet the crime. Is that what he 
believes is an example of the punishment meeting the crime?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member asked about the 
throwing away of the key.
<P>
	I do not ever hear Reform Party members talking about 
rehabilitation and treatment. Instead I hear them say, as I perceive 
it and hear them day after day in this House, that they would prefer 
that people who commit crimes should be in jail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> You have not listened 
to my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> You say it all the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Who said it? It must be in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> I am sure it is there.
<P>
	About the review after 15 years, I spent 30 years in psychiatry 
and mental health. I have always believed there is the possibility 
that people can change. If that possibility is there, then we can look 
at a review of a criminal after 15 years. If that person has not 
appeared to have any change of heart, has not appeared to have any 
treatment programs who has not looked like he can change, then we 
keep him in jail.
<P>
	However, do we have to keep everybody in jail who has a 
sentence of 25 years and the opportunity for parole? We as a 
Liberal government believe that at times criminals can change. 
Their behaviour can change and they can come back into society to 
contribute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I note the member did not answer the question of my hon. 
colleague from Calgary. I also note the member revealed that his 
background is in psychiatry and mental health. That points out the 
real problem we have here. In his remarks he said that he believes 
everybody can be rehabilitated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> I never said that, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Check <I>Hansard</I> and 
see what you said, because that is what you said. Mr. Speaker, that 
is what the hon. member said.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	I want him to very clearly state, because Reformers believe and 
the majority of Canadians believe, that there are some inherently 
evil people out there who cannot be rehabilitated. We talk about 
rehabilitation, but we believe that some people cannot be 
rehabilitated. They have to be kept confined, away from society 
and away from the opportunity to reoffend. I wonder if the hon. 
member would agree with that or not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate that I did not say 
that everybody can be rehabilitated. I said some can be 
rehabilitated with treatment programs. I still believe some people 
need to be kept in jail because they are going to be violent 
criminals for the rest of their lives. I believe that is true as well.
<P>
	Reformers do not agree that they say this. They say in very 
subtle ways that with these people they would throw the key away. 
I do not believe that is the case.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Will the hon. member for Prince George-Peace 
River be speaking for the 20 minutes or splitting his time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be speaking for the 20 minutes or close to it.
<P>
	Perhaps before I get into the text of my speech I would like to 
rebut what the hon. member from across the way just said in his 
closing remarks. I do not know of any Reform member that is 
subtle about anything. Take that as it is.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-55 which finally 
attempts to respond to the concerns that Canadians have regarding 
high risk offenders in our society. Too many convicted offenders 
injure or kill after their release and we have become weary of a 
justice system that caters to the rights of high risk offenders. 
Unfortunately this legislation does not go nearly far enough to 
ensure Canadian communities enjoy safety and protection from 
violent criminals.
<P>
	While I find it encouraging that the government may actually 
recognize that the justice system currently fails to adequately deal 
with dangerous offenders, I am disappointed in the shallow nature 
of Bill C-55.
<P>
	As I have stated in this House during debate on Bill C-53, which 
makes the ludicrous proposal to expand temporary absences for 
convicted criminals, and during the debate on Bill C-41, which 
proposes a strong-arm invasive approach to enforcing child support 
payments, there is a recurring theme in government legislation that 
is being brought before members for consideration. That theme is 
an election theme. Evidence of it can be found in the recent series 
of government bills that attempt a quick fix on hot issues.
<P>
	Despite their ignorance of the fundamental problems plaguing 
child custody laws and many aspects of the justice system, the 
Liberals are ramming through legislation, any legislation, so they 
can tell voters during the next election that they did something to 
make changes that Canadians have been demanding.
<P>
	We know that the Liberals have been content throughout the past 
three years to do very little in the way of substantial legislation, but 
with an election looming in their future they are scurrying to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5072"> 5072 </A></B>
<P>
appease voters in the areas that they have previously neglected.  
This includes the sorry state of our justice system. Canadians have 
been horrified with consequences resulting from the lenient 
treatment of dangerous, violent and repeat offenders. There have 
been demands for tougher sentencing, supervision and more legal 
options for the crown should it wish to seek dangerous offender 
status for someone convicted of crimes causing serious personal 
injury.
<P>
	With one eye on the election, the Liberals have come up with 
Bill C-55, and like many Canadians, I am happy to see the 
government get tougher to any degree with these violent criminals. 
The bill does not include the fundamental changes required to 
effectively protect our communities from these individuals. To use 
an analogy, the proposed legislation may heal some superficial 
wounds but does little to stop the internal bleeding. With their usual 
kid glove approach to convicted criminals, the Liberals have barely 
scratched the surface. With a number of amendments this bill could 
actually make our streets safer.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to discuss a few of the possible amendments. 
Reform has proposed that the bill be amended to allow the crown 
the right to seek dangerous offender status at any time during an 
offender's jail sentence. Bill C-55 suggests that the crown must 
give notice at the time of conviction that it may seek dangerous 
offender status for the convict. The crown will have six months 
after the conviction to apply for that status.
<P>
	I do not see why there should be any limitation in seeking 
dangerous offender status for those who have caused serious 
personal injury to their victims. Who are we trying to protect: the 
victims or the violent offenders?
<P>
	An hon. member opposite tried to clarify this point. I still believe 
that the hon. member was wrong in his assessment of Bill C-55. He 
used the example of a violent pedophile who is currently in jail. 
However, this bill will not prevent that individual from getting out 
of jail.
<P>
	Reform has proposed an amendment to the bill which would 
require courts to automatically place dangerous offender status on 
anyone who commits a serious personal injury offence on two or 
more more separate occasions. Such criminals would be 
imprisoned for an indeterminate period of time.
<P>
	Another glaring omission in Bill C-55 is the failure to specify the 
inclusion of pedophiles and sexual predators as dangerousoffenders. It has to be solidly and definitively stated in legislation 
that these despicable criminals, such as Paul Bernardo, are 
dangerous and a high risk to the safety of our children and to the 
safety of the entire country.
<P>
	Bill C-55 also makes an attempt to remedy section 761 of the 
Criminal Code which allows for the review of indeterminate 
sentences for dangerous offenders after just three years. The 
proposed legislation would increase the period to seven years. I 
must admit that this is an uncharacteristically rational approach by 
the Liberals, but, again, it does not go far enough. Given the nature 
of these offences and in the interest of punishment that fits the 
crime and the protection of society, Reform has proposed that these 
sentences be reviewed after 15 years of indeterminate 
imprisonment.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it seems as though the government emphasizes 
taking a softer approach with convicted criminals than it does with 
the rest of society. In the Liberal version of justice the rights of the 
criminal are given careful attention, while the rights of society are 
irrelevant.
<P>
	We only have to look at the injustice that millions of innocent, 
law-abiding citizens in the country face because gun control 
legislation, rammed through by the government, severely impairs 
their personal freedom. The Liberals encourage minimal 
incarceration for criminals, but because of Bill C-68, their gun 
control bill, a law-abiding citizen can face up to 10 years in jail for 
failing to register a firearm. Section 104 of this draconian bill also 
allows an inspector to obtain a warrant to search an individual's 
home for a firearm, even if there is no evidence that a crime has 
been committed or is about to be committed. Section 104 of Bill 
C-68 has no place in the Canadian justice system.
<P>
	Rejecting an individual's right to protect themselves, their home, 
their family and their property is a frightening prospect. Were the 
civil liberties and rights of legitimate gun owners ever considered? 
Were civil rights considered in the drafting of this bill?
<P>
	Bill C-55 includes a judicial restraint provision to impose 
restraints on individuals which an attorney general suspects may 
commit a serious personal injury offence. This might involve the 
suspected individual being ordered to report to correctional 
officials or police on a regular basis, or participating in an 
electronic monitoring program. Note that I used the words 
``suspected'' and ``may''. That means that a person acquitted by a 
court of law for any charge or a person who has never been charged 
with a criminal offence could be forced to undergo monitoring.
<P>
	There is a great deal of similarity between this provision and 
section 104 of the gun control legislation in that both impose a 
restriction on citizens who have not been charged or convicted. We 
know the Liberals are reluctant to take such invasive measures 
against convicted criminals for fear of infringing on their rights. 
However, when an innocent person's rights may be violated, the 
Liberal concern for the protection of personal freedoms and 
personal liberty is curiously absent.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5073"> 5073 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Is this the kind of treatment we should expect in a free and 
democratic society? Is it worth risking an individual's civil rights 
for technology that is not guaranteed to protect Canadians? 
Electronic monitoring systems are expensive and impractical in 
crowded cities where buildings occasionally block out signals.
<P>
	This clause constitutes a broad, indiscriminate infringement of 
personal liberty which violates the civil rights of individuals and 
should be entirely struck from Bill C-55.
<P>
	It is puzzling that the idea of electronically monitoring 
unconvicted and uncharged individuals was introduced by the same 
justice minister who has steadfastly refused to repeal section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. Dangerous killers, such as Clifford Olson, have 
the minister to thank for preserving a law that gives them the right 
to have their sentences reviewed after just 15 years. This tells 
Canadians that the Liberals are not making the protection of society 
a priority.
<P>
	On the other hand, the same minister attempts to justify the 
infringement of civil rights of innocent Canadians by claiming that 
the protection of society is paramount. This contradictory 
legislation is another result of the piecemeal, quick fix Liberal 
election strategy. It has been reported that even senior officials in 
the justice department and close friends of the minister tried to 
persuade him to drop this clause. Reformers think the minister 
should have listened to them.
<P>
	The identified problem that the minister was attempting to 
address was the ineffectiveness of some restraining orders, but how 
will this clause be used in practice? What safeguards will be in 
place to prevent future abuse? Admittedly, there is a problem with 
restraining orders. The most vulnerable members of our society are 
the ones most at risk from what has become known as stalkers. 
There are a number of well documented cases where restraining 
orders have proved to be completely ineffective.
<P>
	I believe the minister was attempting to solve the problem of 
improving the effectiveness of restraining orders by imposing 
electronic monitoring as a means to track these individuals. I 
support the need for something like this. We also must be cognizant 
of the possible abuse of this clause if it is not itself carefully 
monitored.
<P>
	Another amendment I would like to discuss which will improve 
the effectiveness of this bill is the elimination of clause 15. It is the 
opinion of the Reform Party that all Canadians should be treated 
equally. This means that no individual or group should be given 
special status. The Liberals are rather fond of conferring special 
status on certain groups and this only results in inequality.
<P>
	Under clause 15 aboriginal communities will have the right to 
receive notice of the release of a high risk offender into their 
community and the right to become involved in planning for that 
release. They are given this special privilege while other Canadian 
communities do not receive such notice or opportunity.
<P>
	There is no logical or justifiable reason to provide these 
privileges to one community and not to another. Canadians from all 
communities have been requesting notification procedures for the 
release of high risk offenders. Why not enact legislation to 
implement these measures for all communities? This clause 
exemplifies piecemeal legislation that seeks to appease certain 
groups on selected hot button issues and it should either be 
scrapped or expanded to include notification to all communities.
<P>
	I reiterate that Bill C-55 has some potential to make a difference. 
However, it comes up short in keeping our streets safe from violent 
criminals. I ask myself and many Canadians are asking themselves 
this question: What is stopping the Liberals from developing 
justice policies that keep these offenders in jail?
<P>
	One issue that might answer this query is the severe over 
crowding and financial burden of the prison system. The Liberals 
are attempting to reduce corrections costs by letting criminals go 
free and therefore making more space available. They are 
instituting lenient parole legislation and letting violent, dangerous 
criminals out of jail. I emphasize this. There is absolutely no 
justification for allowing these high risk individuals to roam our 
streets. Second, it is irresponsible to encourage early release or 
expanded temporary absences for what the Liberals call lesser 
criminals, as we saw in Bill C-53.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	What will really reduce the number of these types of criminals 
sitting in jails at taxpayers expense is deterrence. While the 
government strategy has been to rehabilitate these convicts, we 
have watched the prison population grow by 22 per cent in the last 
five years. This is despite the fact that the number of convicts out 
on probation rose by 40 per cent between 1990 and 1994, and 80 
per cent of the 154,000 convicts in the correctional system were out 
on some form of community supervision in 1994.
<P>
	The solution to overcrowding and financial problems in the 
prison system is deterrence. Hard jail time for those convicted of 
the so-called lesser offences will deter them from committing more 
crimes and deter those who might commit similar crimes.
<P>
	Mandatory work, something I mentioned earlier, some outside 
during winter under conditions that taxpaying, working Canadians 
face every day, will do more to dissuade these individuals from a 
life of crime than the longest leisurely stay at a cottage style prison. 
Then there will be plenty of space and resources available for 
dangerous, violent, high risk offenders who deserve to rot in jail for 
raping, mutilating and killing their victims.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the member for 
Calgary Centre who asked us to name one person in this party who 
subscribes to the philosophy of lock them up for life, I would like 
to quote for his benefit <I>Hansard</I>, September 17, page 4316, the 
Reform member for Calgary Northeast:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We say that for every criminal who is convicted of a violent crime for a second 
time, he or she should be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for 
early release or parole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To me that means locking them up and throwing away the key. I 
hope I have answered the question for the hon. member.
<P>
	The member who just spoke raised the question of why we are 
allowing the crown six months to apply for dangerous offender 
category? It is very simple. During that six months new evidence 
could arise that would be beneficial to the crown. I refer to recent 
cases such as the Bernardo case where there was evidence after the 
fact that tapes were available.
<P>
	He also referred to the clause on stalking and he agrees that we 
should take measures to allow correctional services a mechanism 
to prevent stalking. I know statistics can be played with and some 
members are very good at that. But when we look at the statistics 
over 50 per cent of offenders are known to the victims. It is usually 
the husband or the spouse, a direct member, when sexual abuse and 
violence occurs. As a result there is no mechanism.
<P>
	We have heard of a case from the Montreal area where a woman 
had been stalked by her husband for over a year and the police were 
helpless, until finally she was murdered. Then the police had the 
law to intervene.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he believes we should remove this 
provision from the law. What procedure would he propose that 
would allow the police jurisdiction to intervene without necessarily 
infringing on the rights of people? If the member took the time to 
look at the bill he would know that before a restraining order can 
obtained, one must apply to a judge. It is not automatic. The judge 
would review the case and if the judge feels that there is sufficient 
grounds to justify the restraining order then it is very inexpensive 
way for us to monitor the movement of that person. With a bracelet 
for example, we would know at any time where the individual is. I 
ask the hon. member how he proposes to prevent fear in the women 
who are stalked night after night.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his many comments and questions. I will try to 
address them in the same order he made them.
<P>
	The member's first comment was about some Reform members. 
He cited one who said that after a conviction for a second violent 
offence those people should be locked up forever. I guess the 
obvious question to pose back to the hon. member is how many 
times does someone have to commit a violent, horrendous, 
despicable crime on innocent members of society before the 
Liberals would lock them up and quit letting them out.
<P>
	We say that if someone commits a crime twice it should be 
enough. Do the Liberals want them to do it five or six times and 
have more victims before they finally lock them up?
<P>
	The second point made by the hon. member was an explanation 
for the provision of the six-month window to have the prosecution 
apply to the courts to have a convicted felon declared a dangerous 
offender. I understand the reason for the window, but what I 
suggested in my speech is that it should be wide open. We should 
be able to retroactively apply it to people who are already in jail to 
keep them there.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There are charter rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> The member is 
indicating there are charter rules which prevent that. Then I am 
suggesting that we have to change the charter. We have to do 
something. We cannot simply sit here, as the Liberals do, and throw 
up our hands and say we cannot do it. That is simply not good 
enough.
<P>
	Earlier when one of the member's colleagues was talking, he 
specifically mentioned a horrendous case, the case of Bobby 
Oatway, and said that Bill C-55 would solve this problem. The 
reality is that Bill C-55 does not solve the problem of existing 
dangerous pedophiles like Oatway who are currently in the prison 
system. It will do nothing to prevent them from getting out of jail, 
which is the point we are trying to make.
<P>
	The last point that was made by the hon. member was what was 
my suggestion, if we drop this clause, to prevent stalking. I think he 
made a very good point. What I was bringing to his attention was 
that with this legislation I am concerned about possible abuse. I 
recognize, as I did in my speech, that there is a need to address this 
issue. My concern is not that it will be used where it is justified to 
help innocent victims who are in fear of their lives but that it will 
possibly be abused by the authorities, one way or another, to 
infringe on the rights of people who should not have to undergo 
electronic monitoring.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before resuming debate, it is my duty, 
pursuant to our standing orders, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
employment; the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadowlake, 
agriculture.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to talk about Bill C-55. It deals 
with an issue of great importance to my constituents, the whole 
issue of public safety and protecting Canadians from violent 
offenders.
<P>
	While the proposals in this bill introduce tough new measures to 
deal with high risk offenders in our society, they also introduce a 
number of initiatives to deal with non-violent offenders who are at 
low risk at reoffending.
<P>
	The proposed sentencing and corrections reforms incorporated 
in the bill build on current criminal and correction laws. They 
extend controls over those people convicted of sex crimes and 
other violent offences and aim to reduce the risk of repeat 
offenders.
<P>
	One of the most significant parts of these proposals is the 
establishment of a new sentencing category. This category is to be 
called long term offender and I believe this is an important new 
designation that will work well for the better protection of society 
as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Most people are familiar with the dangerous offender provisions 
in the Criminal Code because this designation has proven to be a 
useful mechanism for sentencing serious offenders who pose a high 
risk of committing further violent offences.
<P>
	This long term offender designation would be equally effective. 
Long term offenders would be subject to an application procedure 
similar to that of a dangerous offender. The procedure would apply 
to people convicted of sexual assault and other sexual offences.
<P>
	Under the proposal the convicted person found at a special 
hearing to be a long term offender would be subject to an 
appropriate sentence and an additional supervision period of up to 
10 years.
<P>
	Every long term offender would also be subject to standard 
conditions such as keeping the peace and not being allowed to 
possess firearms. Further specialized conditions can also be added 
to ensure close supervision of the offender such as regular 
reporting to an assigned supervisor and mandatory participation in 
counselling, electronic monitoring and other rehabilitation 
programs.
<P>
	I support this initiative and I support the government in its 
attempt to make our homes and streets safer for all Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-55 goes even further. Not only is the category of long term 
offender being created, the dangerous offender provisions are also 
being strengthened.
<P>
	Because under the current law a judge has the discretion to 
sentence a dangerous offender to a fixed term, under these new 
proposed changes a judge will no longer have the discretion and 
will be required to impose an indefinite sentence, thus better 
protecting members of our society from these dangerous and repeat 
offenders and keeping them behind bars.
<P>
	In addition, the crown will now have up to six months after 
conviction to bring in a dangerous offender application. Currently 
the application must be made at trial. Sometimes new information 
surfaces after the completion of a trial and this new information 
may be critical to the service of justice and to the protection of 
society from dangerous offenders. I definitely support this 
proposed change as well.
<P>
	The reforms to Bill C-55 are simply the latest initiatives in a 
long series of federal justice initiatives designed to better protect 
Canadians.
<P>
	Members of the third party stand in this House day after day and 
suggest that the government is not fulfilling its obligation to 
protect Canadian society against criminals, against violence. That 
is absolutely wrong. The Minister of Justice has produced strong 
legislation in this House time and time again that protects 
Canadians. The really strange thing about this is every time he 
proposes increased sentences, every time he proposes better 
protection of Canadians, the third party votes against it.
<P>
	When we proposed and passed legislation that would have 
increased sentences for young offenders who commit violent 
crimes, the government supported it. It was government 
legislation. Look at the Reform Party. A vast majority of its 
members voted against young offenders who commit violent 
offences from having longer sentences. Check <I>Hansard</I>. The 
majority of them voted against it.
<P>
	For my colleagues opposite, I will list some things. This one they 
will find difficult to deal with. We have created a national crime 
prevention council because part of dealing with criminals, part of 
dealing with justice in society is to work toward dealing with some 
of the underlying causes.
<P>
	The third party might have some difficulties with that concept 
but we have dealt with it. We instituted a flagging system for use by 
Canadian police to identify high risk offenders.
<P>
	We established a new mandatory five year sentence for those 
convicted of using violence to force children into prostitution. I 
guess that is being soft on criminals. We classify as first degree any 
murder committed while stalking. I guess that is being soft on 
criminals, according to the third party.
<P>
	We have increased sentences for those convicted of stalking and 
we have specifically dealt with the issue of eliminating the drunken 
defence and giving the police the tools and means to issue warrants 
so that they can get DNA samples. I guess, according to the third 
party, that indeed is mollycoddling to criminals. It is not.

<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	We talked about violence in society. It was the government that 
introduced legislation that increased the minimum sentence for 
using a firearm in the commission of a criminal offence by 400 per 
cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is a crock.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> It classified the smuggling of firearms as an 
enterprise crime that carries up to a 10-year sentence.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you can hear all the noise in the Chamber because 
they hate being told that the government is dealing with the justice 
issues. They simply ignore them and every time they vote against 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Why do the victims' groups not go away?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> They vote against increased sentences. They vote 
against our efforts to help control violence in Canadian society. 
They try to have it both ways. They say they want increased 
criminal control, but when they have the opportunity to vote for it 
in the House what do they do? They vote against it. It is very 
difficult to understand the logic of that type of system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Dispense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Absolutely. Bill C-55 is legislation. It works 
toward controlling violent criminals in society. It provides a 
number of tools to the courts. It provides tools to crown attorneys. 
It provides tools to enforcement agencies to better protect 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government is committed to a safer society, to ensuring that 
criminals are apprehended, to ensuring that criminals once 
apprehended who pose an ongoing risk to Canadians find 
themselves behind bars and that the tools are provided to monitor 
these individuals if and when they are returned to society.
<P>
	This legislation deals with the issue of criminals. It deals with 
protection of Canadians. It deals with making our streets safer. It 
deals with making communities safer. It is good legislation. It 
achieves those important objectives.
<P>
	Not only do I support that bill, but I believe in all good 
conscience every member of this House, including those opposite, 
should be supporting this bill because it does what we all want 
done. We all want a safer and more secure society and this bill 
achieves those important objectives. I will be pleased to support 
this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate you recognizing me when so many of my 
colleagues also want to ask questions of this hon. member.
<P>
	I would like to state at the outset that this legislation, like every 
other piece of justice legislation that has been brought to the House 
by this Liberal government was designed by lawyers, drafted by 
lawyers, passed by lawyers for the benefit of lawyers.
<P>
	When members opposite say that the Liberals are getting tough 
on crime it is an absolute joke. Everybody in this country knows 
that. Earlier the hon. member for London-Middlesex quoted Mr. 
Newark of the Canadian Police Association. The Liberals are 
bringing in Bill C-55 because the Canadian Police Association 
wants it and it going to do so much. Yet I find these same Liberals 
strangely silent when the same Canadian Police Association calls 
for the repeal of section 745. What a shock. It is also calling for a 
referendum on the return of capital punishment.
<P>
	I would like to know from this hon. member who says that he 
wants to get tough on crime and that this government is getting 
tough on crime, how he voted on section 745. Would he support the 
repeal of section 745 as Canadians from coast to coast are calling 
for? Would he support a referendum to see the return of the death 
penalty for first degree, cold-blooded, premeditated murder?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Never.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> After those comments, Mr. Speaker, I am glad I 
am not a lawyer. My goodness, they might get some mail from the 
law society tomorrow.
<P>
	Let us talk about section 745 because I know the member has 
been up a number of times. I want to make sure the Canadian 
people understand exactly what the third party voted against. 
Section 745 has been in the Criminal Code for quite a while. The 
government changed it. Reformers voted against a bill that would 
stop somebody who was a multiple murderer from having 
eligibility of parole. They voted against that. If their vote had 
carried the day, it would mean that people who were multiple 
murderers would have eligibility for parole after 15 years. They 
voted against that change.
<P>
	What else did they vote against when they voted against section 
745? Under the old regime only two-thirds agreement was needed 
of the jury of the individual's peers from the community from 
which the crime had occurred to set the individual free. This bill 
made sure the jury had to be unanimous. Reformers voted against 
that. Since they voted against it obviously they thought it only 
necessary to have two-thirds of the jury in agreement.
<P>
	There was a third component to the revisions of section 745. 
Judges would have the ability to disregard an application for parole 
that was considered to be frivolous so the victims in those types of 
cases would not be subject to the actual hearings. Reform Party 
members voted against that too.
<P>
	It is unbelievable. They are here trying to suggest that they have 
the complete corner on the issue of wanting to control violence, 
wanting to strengthen the criminal justice system, but every time it 
comes to a choice, every time it comes to a vote where they have an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5077"> 5077 </A></B>
<P>
opportunity to see those types of laws strengthened, what do they 
do? They vote against it. It is unbelievable. They vote against 
justice bills over and over again.
<P>
	It is this Liberal government that has pursued a policy of 
controlling violence in Canadian society. If the legislation put 
forward in the 35th Parliament is checked, one initiative after 
another works to strengthen the criminal justice system. It works at 
keeping criminals behind bars. It works at keeping society safer, 
communities safer and streets safer.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I inform all members that there is an 
indication that the hon. member for York North is sharing his time. 
Therefore he has 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
``The proposed high risk offenders' legislation is the single most 
important improvement in Canadian public safety legislation in the 
last 20 years''. So said Scott Newark, executive officer of the 
Canadian Police Association. I could not agree more. The 
government has announced new measures to deal with high risk 
offenders.
<P>
	The following three initiatives will toughen the sentencing and 
correctional regime for those who pose a high risk of committing 
another violent crime: a new long term offender designation that 
targets sex offenders and adds a period of long term supervision of 
up to 10 years following release from prison, strengthened and 
streamlined dangerous offenders provisions in the Criminal Code, 
and a new judicial restraint provision to permit controls, including 
electronic monitoring, to be applied to individuals who pose a high 
risk of committing a serious personal injury offence.
<P>
	In the 1996 speech from the throne the government pledged to 
focus resources on high risk offenders while developing innovative 
alternatives to incarceration for low risk offenders.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Once again we have kept our promise and fulfilled our 
commitment to the Canadian public. After all, they deserve no less. 
Canadians are honest, hard-working people. They give much to 
their communities and expect very little in return. What they did 
ask for during the 1993 election campaign was safer homes and 
safer streets. That is what they are getting.
<P>
	Canada's crime rate fell again in 1995, its fourth straight drop 
following 30 years of almost constant increase. Violent crime is 
down for the third year in a row. The homicide rate reached its 
lowest level since 1969.
<P>
	The York region, which includes my riding of York North, has 
one of the lowest crime rates in the country. This is good, this is 
progress, but this is not good enough.
<P>
	Criminals still commit offences and victims still suffer. That is 
why we have introduced Bill C-55. Under the proposed changes a 
new sentencing category, to be called long term offenders, will be 
added to the Criminal Code. It will target sex offenders who are 
less violent and brutal than those designated as dangerous 
offenders but are found to pose a considerable risk of reoffending.
<P>
	The procedure will be similar to the existing dangerous offender 
application. On conviction the crown can ask for a thorough 
assessment of the offender's criminality and the risk he or she 
presents.
<P>
	On the basis of the assessment report, the crown can then bring a 
dangerous offender or a long term offender application. With a long 
term offender application, a special hearing is convened and 
evidence is heard, including the assessment report.
<P>
	If a long term offender finding is made, the judge will impose a 
prison sentence suited for the offence and add a period of long term 
supervision of up to 10 years to start when the incarceration period, 
including any parole, expires. Every long term offender will be 
subject to standard conditions, such as keeping the peace and not 
being allowed to possess firearms.
<P>
	Further, specialized conditions can be added to ensure close 
supervision of the offender, such as regular reporting to the 
assigned supervisor and mandatory participation in counselling, 
electronic monitoring and other rehabilitation programs.
<P>
	The long term offender designation, by imposing on the offender 
an additional period of supervision in the community after the end 
of the regular sentence, gives the offender a real opportunity to 
reintegrate without putting the community at risk.
<P>
	Public safety is improved because Correctional Service of 
Canada and the parole board can set stringent conditions on the 
offender, monitor the offender closely and pull the offender back if 
there is a breach. An offender who breaches these conditions can be 
persecuted and reincarcerated.
<P>
	Next we looked at the dangerous offender category. This 
classification has proved to be a useful tool in increasing public 
safety. Dangerous offender applications have been used 
successfully in approximately 150 cases and we are building on 
this success. Anyone who is classified as a dangerous offender will 
be kept in prison indefinitely. A judge will no longer have the 
discretion to sentence a dangerous offender to a fixed term.
<P>
	Currently a dangerous offender application must be made at 
trial. Under Bill C-55 the crown will have a window of six months 
after conviction to bring a dangerous offender application based on 
newly received  information. The process has been streamlined. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5078"> 5078 </A></B>
<P>
The number of psychiatrists required to testify at a hearing has 
been reduced from two to one.
<P>
	Third, a new judicial restraint provision will be added to the 
Criminal Code. This procedure will focus on persons who pose a 
risk of committing a serious personal injury offence. It can be 
applied to people who are not under sentence as well as those who 
have completed their sentences. The crown attorney will be 
empowered to bring an application where there are reasonable 
grounds to fear that an individual will commit a serious personal 
injury offence. These grounds will be examined at a hearing before 
a judge. The judge will have the power to impose general 
conditions, such as keeping the peace, and specific conditions 
appropriate to the kind of threat posed by the individuals, such as 
staying away from schools and playgrounds or certain 
neighbourhoods.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	As one of the conditions, the judge could order that a program of 
electronic monitoring be applied if such a program were available 
in the province. The judicial restraint would last up to one year and 
could be renewed.
<P>
	A breach of conditions would constitute a separate criminal 
offence which could result in a jail sentence. This is an important 
step forward for the victims of domestic abuse. The reality is that 
we live in a country where women are six times more likely to be 
killed by a spouse than by a stranger. In fact, spousal homicides 
continue to account for one out of every six solved homicides. Of 
those women who were registered married and who were killed by 
their spouse, almost one in four were separated at the time of the 
incident.
<P>
	Community safety has always been a priority for this 
government. The high risk offender package is a big step forward. 
Bill C-55 provides the tools necessary for the justice system to do 
its job. Law enforcement officers are empowered to protect their 
community. The chair of the law amendments committee of the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police said: ``It will help law 
enforcement officials, especially at the local level, to deal better 
with the people who pose the greatest danger to community 
safety''. It gives judges more options when deciding which course 
of action would be best, both for society and for the offender, when 
handing down sentences.
<P>
	In bringing forward these measures to control high risk 
offenders, we are strengthening our society and building a safer 
future for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member support the present bill. I suppose that for 
him to criticize the bill in any fashion would be difficult, given that 
he is from the Liberal side of the House.
<P>
	I am concerned about this legislation in that when a dangerous 
offender application is made, it points out that the application must 
definitely be put forward prior to the imposition of sentence. 
Therefore there is a window of six months to supply the necessary 
information to support that application. That is not a very long 
period, given that maybe an offender, a pedophile for example, 
could be sentenced to a 10 year stint and there would be no 
opportunity after to make application for dangerous offender.
<P>
	In fact, in the legislation a pedophile or a sexual predator is not 
listed in the area of dangerous offender. I think people seek to have 
those individuals classified as dangerous offenders. In my opinion 
that is one very major flaw in this legislation.
<P>
	The second point that troubles me about Bill C-55 is that once 
the application is made and there is a conviction for a dangerous 
offender, the whole process again can be appealed. So now they can 
go through a course of appeals. I find that difficult to understand 
when members across talk about getting tough on crime and there 
is a recourse for appeal and this very narrow window in which to 
make application for dangerous offender designation and so on.
<P>
	What is wrong with including pedophiles and sexual predators, 
which the bill does not address, in that list of Criminal Code 
offences and automatically seeking the courts to place a dangerous 
offender finding on anyone who commits on two or more separate 
occasions an offence constituting a serious personal injury offence?
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. If he were to look at the bill as an entire package he would 
find that it is certainly an improvement to the existing laws.
<P>
	I reject one major point that he made. We have a civilized society 
with a justice system that is fair and just to all individuals, yet 
somehow he rejects the whole concept of an appeal procedure. The 
hon. member should understand that as fair as our system is, 
everyone should have the right to appeal if a wrong decision was 
made in a lower court.
<P>
	This speaks to the notion and the type of logic that the Reform 
Party has toward social justice and the whole justice system. The 
only answer Reformers have is to throw criminals in jail, lock the 
door and leave them there.
<P>
	The reality is that even when it comes to the issue of getting 
tough on crime, as my eloquent colleague from Parry 
Sound-Muskoka stated, they have voted against any piece of 
legislation presented by the Liberal government to get tough on 
crime.
<P>
	However, I want to stick to some of the facts because facts are 
things that escape the Reform Party on most issues. Look at the 
major components of Bill C-55, the new long term offender 
designation that targets sex offenders and adds a period of long 
term supervision of  up to 10 years following their release from 
prison. We have strengthened and streamlined dangerous offender 
provisions in the Criminal Code and we have a new judicial 
restraint provision to permit controls which include electronic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5079"> 5079 </A></B>
<P>
monitoring. Members can rest assured that Canadians from coast to 
coast will applaud this initiative.
<P>
	Let us be honest in this Chamber. I am sure Reformers are all 
honourable members; at least they are addressed as such. The 
crime rate is declining and we are bringing safer homes and safer 
streets to the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time 
with the member for North Island-Powell River.
<P>
	Before I enter into my semi-prepared remarks, I will comment 
on something the member said about the declining crime rate. I 
think we have heard this convenient juggling of statistics about 
eight times in the House today.
<P>
	Yes, there has been a temporary blip in the last couple of years in 
the rate of violent crime, a slight decrease. But if we do statistical 
analyses-if members do not believe me, talk to people at 
Statistics Canada-we do not go on blips. We take the long term 
timeline. In this case we can take it over the period beginning with 
1962.
<P>
	There has been a steady progressive increase in the rate of 
violent crime. During this period there have been years when the 
crime rate has dropped precipitously. There have been years when 
it has risen precipitously. But if we look at the trend, there has been 
an increase of almost 400 per cent since 1962. That is the gospel 
according to StatsCan and we all know that the Liberal government 
never argues with anything StatsCan says.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	This bill, as with so many other major pieces of legislation 
brought forth by the Liberal government, is like the bishop's egg, it 
is good in parts. However, it always has the problem of making it 
this grand melange of the good and the bad which makes it almost 
impossible for any normal human being to either support or oppose 
it. This is strategy. Fine.
<P>
	The thing I could support and which I do not find offensive in the 
bill is that the crown will no longer have to apply immediately for 
dangerous offender classification when a prisoner is sentenced. It 
will have as much as a six month window of opportunity in which 
to do it. I do not object to that at all, but I wish the government had 
gone the whole nine yards and allowed the crown to make 
dangerous offender applications through the entire length of the 
sentence.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You cannot because of the charter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> It is easy for the hon. member to say we cannot. 
If we do not have that then any prisoner who  refuses to co-operate 
in any sort of counselling or rehabilitative program cannot be 
nailed. He will still get out in the usual period of time.
<P>
	The minimum sentence for dangerous offenders will now be 
increased from three to seven years. I approve of that but in the 
end, dangerous offenders will continue to be turned loose on 
society, and that is wrong. The 10 year supervision, as I understand 
the act, is not aimed at dangerous offenders. It is aimed at what is 
referred to by the member as long term offenders such as 
pedophiles, people who are not considered potentially very brutal, 
sadistic and extremely undesirable folks.
<P>
	Unfortunately, while this act will religiously protect the rights of 
the convicted, the justice minister has no compunction in the same 
bill in threatening the rights of people who have never been 
convicted of anything or even charged with a crime. Under his 
judicial restraint section, a person deemed likely to commit a 
serious crime can be required to accept supervision, including the 
wearing of an electronic bracelet, for up to one year without being 
convicted of anything or even formally charged. All it would take 
to set the process in motion would be for a crown attorney to 
believe that a person might injure someone. So much for the hard 
won principle that one is innocent until proven guilty.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A judge has to approve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> The hon. member says he would have to appear 
before a judge. That is quite correct. Who makes the decision of 
whether one appears before a judge? The crown attorney. No 
charges need be laid.
<P>
	The government's approach to justice is developing a very 
frightening pattern. Vicious convicted criminals are assured of due 
process and every possible consideration of their rights but 
ordinary citizens had better beware because it will be possible 
under this legislation to impose criminal sanctions on the basis of 
rumour, misinformation or malice. If someone is having boundary 
troubles with a neighbour and has had heated words with that 
individual, watch out, they could end up with an electronic bracelet 
around the ankle if the fellow is well enough connected.
<P>
	If someone is involved in a dispute with a vindictive or vengeful 
ex-spouse, watch out, he or she could end up with an electronic 
bracelet around the ankle. As a matter of fact, anybody could.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	All of this is not really surprising when we consider the past 
Liberal record toward civil liberties. It was a Liberal government 
that incarcerated Japanese Canadians during the war without any 
formal legal proceedings. It was a Liberal government that 
invented the War Measures Act and used it in peacetime. It was a 
Liberal government that brought in Bill C-68 which, if it is ever 
enforced exactly as it is written, would require penalties for even 
the mere possession of an unregistered firearm which could be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5080"> 5080 </A></B>
<P>
stiffer than penalties people are receiving right now for assault, 
arson or drunk driving causing death.
<P>
	It is absurd, but that is the Liberal concept of justice: treat 
vicious, depraved monsters with a lot of TLC but come down like a 
ton of bricks on ordinary citizens who for one reason or another just 
do not fit in or who do not conform. This is the Liberal social 
engineering tactic. It is a kick them in the head philosophy we have 
lived with for the better part of a half century. This is just a logical 
continuation of what we have been about.
<P>
	I hope there are people opposite-they are not sitting there right 
now-who care about civil liberties so that when the amendments 
which we will be proposing to this bill come before the committee, 
the section on judicial restraint will be stricken from the proposed 
legislation. It is a brutal and indiscriminate infringement on 
personal liberty that unduly violates the civil rights of everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to explain to the 
member again because he does not seem to understand. Sometimes 
I wonder if it is a lack of taking the time to read or if it is a lack of 
taking the time to understand. I will tell him how judicial restraint 
will work for the third time this afternoon.
<P>
	I remind him that the crown attorney will be empowered to bring 
an application where there are reasonable grounds to fear that an 
individual will commit a serious personal injury offence. These 
grounds will be heard at official hearings by a judge. The 
application will be made and the judge will hear it. He will analyse 
all the information he has at his disposal and will make the 
decision.
<P>
	I will ask the member again. If he wants that part of the bill 
stricken out, would he tell the House how he proposes to prevent 
innocent women from being stalked by their husbands or their 
lovers? Do we have to wait until they are victimized before the 
police can act, as is the current case?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that wearing an electronic 
bracelet will protect anyone who is truly in danger. I have never 
heard such an absurdity in my life.
<P>
	There are provisions in the Criminal Code and someone can be 
prosecuted for stalking, for uttering threats. These should be 
rigorously enforced and with due process. That is the key phrase. 
That is something Liberals should learn. They should write it on 
their blackboards: due process. We have 200 years of tradition in 
this country.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take two minutes to bring 
the member up to speed on this new technology.
<P>
	It is called GPS. GPS stands for geographical positioning 
system. It is based on the positions of  satellites. Through 
technology we can within 15 feet determine where the inmate is at 
any location on Earth. With the technology we can also determine 
if that person, who happens to have a special profile whether it be a 
person out on parole or whatever, is near a school but should not be. 
We can determine whether the person is near a spouse but should 
not be. The technology is there. It is a very convenient way of using 
today's technology economically without further burdening the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	I do not understand what is so difficult about understanding that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, having used the GPS myself in my 
line of work, I did not really need that explanation as to how it 
functions.
<P>
	The point is, if we can tell where someone is who is wearing the 
bracelet, that will not help anyone if the police take three-quarters 
of an hour to get there. If someone is really dedicated to harming a 
person, it will not stop them.
<P>
	There are many places in my riding where the potential victim 
might have to wait for two hours for police assistance. The hon. 
member is wearing his urban blinders. He does not realize that the 
whole country is not Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before us today is Bill C-55. The purpose of the bill is to 
address those offenders who present a high risk of violently 
reoffending. As well, we have a new designation of long term 
offender with a provision of supervision for up to 10 years in the 
community. That is in addition to the sentence for the offence.
<P>
	At the outset let me say that the Reform Party will not stand in 
the way of Bill C-55.
<P>
	The bill is composed of three components: a new and expanded 
dangerous offender provision; a new long term offender provision; 
and a new judicial restraint clause.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports adding a new definition to the 
Criminal Code which will deem any person who on two or more 
separate occasions commits an offence causing serious personal 
injury to be a dangerous offender and subject to an indeterminate 
period of imprisonment.
<P>
	The new dangerous offender provision in Bill C-55 recognizes 
that the current process by which certain criminals are assigned 
dangerous offender status and therefore required to serve an 
indefinite penitentiary sentence is not sufficiently strong to protect 
Canadian communities against violent criminals. Therefore, 
Reformers applaud those new provisions in Bill C-55 which 
expand the criteria for designating violent criminals as dangerous 
offenders.
<P>
	Who in the House could find fault in designating a person as a 
dangerous offender who has been sentenced for armed robbery, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5081"> 5081 </A></B>
<P>
unlawful confinement and shooting at a police officer and who, 
during a jail sentence, commits a further 40 offences including a 
stabbing?
<P>
	Sadly, this was not the case when career criminal Paul Butler 
was granted day parole in September 1993 in Prince George and 
then went on to murder Dennis Fichtenberg, the son of a constituent 
of mine, Marjean Fichtenberg. Despite Mr. Butler's criminal record 
and an arrest weeks before the murder was committed, the parole 
board agreed that Mr. Butler posed no risk to society and was not 
dangerous. Tell that to Marjean Fichtenberg and her family who 
suffer their loss and whose only satisfaction has been some 
recommendations made by a coroner's request initiated last year by 
the attorney general for B.C.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The government had an opportunity in this new dangerous 
offender provision as contained in Bill C-55 to let the Marjean 
Fichtenbergs of this world know that she and her family, the 
victims, have rights too. However as usual, the proposed changes 
for designating certain criminals as dangerous offenders once again 
do not go far enough.
<P>
	Specifically the proposed changes in Bill C-55 would allow the 
crown up to six months after conviction to bring about a dangerous 
offender application. Even under the proposed changes this 
provision would apply only if the crown gives notice at the time of 
conviction of the possibility of a delayed dangerous offender 
application and where relevant information also emerges to support 
the application.
<P>
	What Reformers want, what the Marjean Fichtenbergs want, and 
what all level headed Canadians want is for dangerous offender 
findings to be made at any time after sentencing. To be precise, the 
crown should be given the right to seek dangerous offender status 
for persons convicted of crimes causing serious personal injury at 
any time during that offender's penitentiary sentence. Would 40 
offences while in a correctional institution including a stabbing be 
good enough for the Minister of Justice?
<P>
	Reformers also propose that Bill C-55 require the courts to 
automatically place a dangerous offender finding upon any person 
who commits on two or more separate occasions an offence 
constituting a serious personal injury offence. This proposal would 
also include that the dangerous offender be subject to an 
indeterminate period of imprisonment.
<P>
	If we are going to begin to address the agony, loss and frustration 
of the type Marjean Fichtenberg and her family feel, our 
amendments are essential. We propose a further essential change to 
Bill C-55 and that is to expand the list of Criminal Code offences 
upon which a dangerous offender application may be brought about 
to include pedophiles and sexual predators.
<P>
	A basic tenet of Reform policy is for violent offenders to serve 
their full sentence. Once released, some violent offenders and all 
<P>
repeat offenders should be under parole supervision, and I do not 
mean unsupervised parole which was applied to Paul Butler and 
under which he committed murder.
<P>
	My colleagues have spoken to the long term offender provision. 
It is incumbent that we broaden the range of offences committed to 
include sexual predators or pedophiles so that they cannot only be 
designated long term but can also be designated as dangerous 
offenders, because many of them are.
<P>
	The judicial restraint provision proposed in clause 9 of the bill 
contributes a broad indiscriminate infringement of personal liberty 
which unduly violates the civil rights of individuals. The judicial 
remedies proposed in this clause should only be contemplated in 
matters where individuals have been convicted of offences under 
the Criminal Code and according to due process of law. We propose 
striking this clause in its totality.
<P>
	On the one hand we do not go far enough in the dangerous 
offender clauses by excluding sexual predators or pedophiles. On 
the other hand we have the potential of allowing the attorney 
general to lay information against anyone he believes will commit 
a future offence, even though the individual may have been 
acquitted of any charge or never even charged with a criminal 
offence.
<P>
	I will now turn to clause 15 of Bill C-55 concerning long term 
offenders, specifically the provision regarding aboriginal 
communities. Clause 15 allows that for long term offenders who 
express an interest in being supervised in an aboriginal community, 
the aboriginal community must first receive notice of the 
supervision and have the opportunity to propose a plan for the 
release and integration into the community.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	In other words, aboriginal communities have the right to become 
involved in planning for the release of a high risk offender into 
their community and the right to become involved in the planning 
for that release. Other Canadians do not share this proposed right 
and consequently receive no such notice. We think they should. 
Why is the government doing the right thing for aboriginal 
communities and not for other Canadian communities?
<P>
	The government should be uniting Canadians with a standard of 
behaviour. Canadian citizens everywhere deserve the same notice 
and planning provisions as those proposed for the aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	Besides all that, the minister of defence should resign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has 
suggested that an application for dangerous offender designation 
could be made at any time during the period the individual is 
incarcerated. He used the example of an individual who committed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5082"> 5082 </A></B>
<P>
40 offences during the period of his incarceration and one of those 
being a stabbing.
<P>
	My concern is that in our rules of law we can only really be tried 
for an offence once. The fact that you are incarcerated does not 
mean that you have carte blanche to commit crimes willy-nilly and 
go unprosecuted. Surely these 40 offences, especially the stabbing, 
are of themselves offences deserving of charges being laid, being 
brought to trial and sentencing again. Would that not be an 
appropriate time then to bring this dangerous offender application?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an option but of course that 
adds complexity to the arrangement. One of the concerns that I 
have about a lot of the legislation is the way the parole boards 
operate, the way the courts operate and so on. We have so much 
complexity now into the system that there are too many avenues of 
things falling between chairs.
<P>
	If you look at the Paul Butler case I was describing, I have only 
described the tip of the iceberg. What we had here was an 
incredible set of complex circumstances. When you talk to 
someone like Marjean Fichtenberg who has lived and breathed this 
case since the murder of her son, you hear descriptions of all of the 
rules, the guidelines, the terms of reference, the different bodies 
involved in terms of applying or trying to interpret policy, all the 
various ways things cannot happen that are supposed to happen. 
The more straightforward the legislation is, the less likely that is 
going to happen.
<P>
	If it involves having to go back to court, the likelihood is that the 
authorities will not pursue it in many cases because there is once 
again an opportunity for too many things to happen. I think that is 
one way to respond to the question.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, watching a repeat 
child molester walk out of a prison, unrepentant and unreformed, 
understandably drives people crazy with anger and betrayal.
<P>
	Many Canadians want the justice system to do more with chronic 
pedophiles and rapists than simply wait for them to strike again. I 
agree.
<P>
	My colleagues, the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General 
of Canada, have responded to this genuine concern and recently 
announced new measures to deal with high risk offenders. Bill 
C-55 will toughen the sentencing and correction regime for those 
who pose a high risk of committing another crime. This is good 
legislation. This is responsive legislation.
<P>
	These tough new restrictions on high risk, violent offenders will 
make Canadian homes and streets safer. The measures fulfil 
commitments made the red book as  well as in the speech from the 
throne. The 1996 speech from the throne pledged that the 
government will focus resources on high risk offenders while 
developing innovative alternatives to incarceration for low risk 
offenders.
<P>
	The following initiatives will strengthen the sentencing and 
correctional regime for those who present a high risk of violent 
reoffending, particularly sex offenders: a new long term offender 
designation that targets sex offenders and adds a period of 
supervision of up to 10 years following release from prison; 
strengthening the dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal 
Code and a new judicial restraint provision to permit controls, 
including electronic monitoring to be applied to individuals who 
pose a high risk of committing a serious personal injury offence.
<P>
	Bill C-55 positively amends the Criminal Code and these 
changes have been welcomed by the Canadian Police Association 
and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, a very sound 
endorsement.
<P>
	The government is also committed to developing alternatives to 
incarceration for low risk offenders. This set of initiatives includes 
amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to 
allow for earlier parole for offenders convicted of crimes which did 
not involve violence to support rehabilitation and return to the 
community.
<P>
	Let us review some of these provisions in more detail, first the 
long term offender provisions. Under the proposed changes a new 
sentencing category to be called long term offender will be added 
to the Criminal Code. Long term offenders will be those convicted 
of sexual assault, sexual touching, sexual exploitation, indecent 
exposure, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault with a 
weapon or causing bodily harm.
<P>
	This is a useful designation and is not necessarily the same 
designation as dangerous offender which is applied to those who 
have been convicted of repeatedly committing crimes of violence. 
It will target sex offenders who may be less violent and brutal than 
those designated dangerous offenders but are found to pose a 
considerable risk of reoffending.
<P>
	The category will also include those offenders convicted of 
another crime such a break and enter with clear intent to commit 
sexual assault.
<P>
	To better protect the community, offenders in this category will 
be subject to an additional period of supervision for up to 10 years 
after they have completed their parole and prison sentences.
<P>
	This designation could be applied to first time offenders with 
psychological histories or other factors that indicate a possibility 
that they will likely repeat their crime; again, such as a pedophile 
convicted of assaulting a child. The long arm of the law will not 
miss such perpetrators.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5083"> 5083 </A></B>
<P>
	The long term offender process will be similar to the existing 
dangerous offender application. Upon conviction the crown can 
ask for a thorough assessment of the offender's criminality and 
the risk he or she presents. On the basis of the assessment report 
the crown can then bring a dangerous offender or long term 
offender application.
<P>
	If a long term offender finding is made, the judge will impose a 
prison sentence that suits the offence and add a period of long term 
supervision of up to 10 years to start when the incarceration period, 
including any parole, expires.
<P>
	An effective program for rehabilitation is to gradually integrate 
offenders back into the community under controlled conditions. 
The long term offender designation by imposing on the offender an 
additional period of supervision in the community after the end of 
the regular sentence gives the offender a real opportunity to 
reintegrate without putting the community at risk, and that is very 
important.
<P>
	Public safety is improved because Correctional Service Canada 
and the parole board can set stringent conditions on the offender, 
monitor the offender closely and pull the offender back in for any 
breach. An offender who breaches these conditions can be 
prosecuted and reincarcerated.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	These safeguards address the fear that potentially dangerous 
criminals do the crime, finish their time and then are free to 
disappear back into the community without any monitoring.
<P>
	I will also address the issue of dangerous offenders. The 
dangerous offender category will be improved by keeping such an 
individual in prison indefinitely. A judge will no longer have the 
discretion to sentence a dangerous offender to a fixed term. It will 
be an indeterminate term.
<P>
	Currently a dangerous offender application must be made at 
trial. The crown will now have a window of six months after 
conviction to bring a dangerous offender application based on 
newly received information that may not have arisen at trial.
<P>
	The process has also been streamlined. The number of 
psychiatrists required to testify at a hearing has been reduced from 
two to one. These are very positive and effective developments.
<P>
	I would like to briefly touch on judicial restraint orders. The 
judicial restraint provision will be added to the Criminal Code and 
is another measure for the protection of the public. This procedure 
will focus on people who pose a risk of committing a serious 
personal injury offence. It can be applied to people who are not 
under a sentence as well as those who have completed their 
sentences.
<P>
	Under this provision the attorney general would apply for a 
special hearing before a provincial court judge where there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that an individual is at high risk of 
committing a serious personal injury offence.
<P>
	A judge will be able to impose general conditions such as 
keeping the peace and specific conditions appropriate to the kind of 
threat that could be posed by the individual. Two examples are 
staying away from places where children might congregate and 
staying away from an estranged spouse. As one of the conditions, 
the judge could order electronic monitoring in provinces where 
such programs exist. The judicial restraint would last for up to one 
year and could be renewed. A breach of conditions would 
constitute a separate criminal offence which could result in a jail 
sentence.
<P>
	The judicial restraining order has been a topic of much 
conversation on the basis of its constitutionality, especially when it 
involves individuals who have no criminal record or charges 
pending. I well understand that this is an option to deal with 
stalkers and others who are difficult to convict.
<P>
	As a member on the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs, I look forward to examining this provision further. On one 
hand, it may be no different than court orders now being granted 
that restrict known sex offenders from hanging around schools and 
playgrounds. These orders are granted rarely and officials must 
prove the person constitutes a serious threat. While I have my 
concerns about this section I reserve judgment on this provision 
until further study is completed.
<P>
	The low risk non-violent offender is also addressed. In tandem 
with these tough new controls on high risk violent offenders, the 
Liberal government has introduced initiatives to deal with low risk 
non-violent offenders.
<P>
	The first priority of the government's justice agenda is the safety 
of Canadians. The Liberal approach balances tougher penalties and 
restrictions with necessary community based efforts at 
rehabilitation and prevention. In co-operation with other levels of 
government, the federal government will promote measures which 
include sentencing reforms and community diversion programs as 
alternatives for imprisonment of first time non-violent offenders at 
a low risk of reoffending.
<P>
	The route this government has taken is to get tough on repeat 
violent offenders while finding alternative sentencing for low risk 
offenders. There is no doubt this is a move in the right direction.
<P>
	The Liberal government's safe home, safe streets agenda draws a 
clear distinction between low risk and high risk offenders. This 
balanced approach will help to ensure an effective criminal justice 
system with the penalties appropriate to the gravity of the crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member's reflections on Bill  C-55. He has certain 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5084"> 5084 </A></B>
<P>
reservations about the portion of the bill which deals with judicial 
restraint. The Reform Party also has reservations about that point.
<P>
	I need a good clear explanation from the member, given that I 
was a police officer for 22 years prior to this past election, how 
electronic monitoring would apply to stalkers. I have had to 
personally answer a number of complaints in that regard as a police 
officer, and time is quite factor.
<P>
	I would like to know how it would be applied and how it would 
be able to save a victim like an individual in my riding, Kelly 
Howe. Recently a trial was completed where an individual was 
convicted of the first degree murder of Kelly Howe. How would it 
save a person like Kelly Howe who was killed by her ex-boyfriend?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not familiar with the 
circumstances of Kelly Howe's death, but as was indicated earlier, 
the electronic monitoring which is called the GPS system can 
pinpoint an individual within yards of his or her position.
<P>
	One of the Reform members was concerned about this having 
application in rural areas. I believe it would be easier to pinpoint 
someone in a rural area. If an offender is living in a major centre 
like Calgary, where the member comes from, and it is found 
through the system that he is now 30 miles away where his 
estranged spouse lives, we know darn well that he is not in a place 
where he should be. It is certainly easier to pinpoint him than it 
would be perhaps within a block or two of the city.
<P>
	How would it work? The wisdom and benefit of the technology 
today can do these things. That is where I am coming from in 
answering the member's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for his concern on this issue.
<P>
	I have in the gallery today a member of the OPP who comes from 
my riding, Mr. Alex Williamson. I wonder if the hon. member 
would be confident in telling Mr. Williamson, who is a long term 
member of the OPP, given the opposition says this motion is weak 
and ineffective, that we are making a strong case against dangerous 
offenders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's question. 
To be honest, I thought he was getting up to speak on another 
matter. Could he just quickly rephrase that question?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Time has expired. I cannot let the 
member ask the question again even though he has a friend in the 
gallery.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RADIOACTIVEWASTEIMPORTATIONACT">RADIOACTIVE WASTE IMPORTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-236, an act to prevent the importation of radioactive waste into 
Canada, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as always, it is a special privilege to stand 
in the House and talk about a subject that I have taken some time to 
develop, study and put forward and to see if perhaps I can get the 
concurrence of the House on this concept that I have developed.
<P>
	Bill C-236 is called an act to prevent the importation of 
radioactive waste. As members know, there are over 400 
commercial nuclear reactors worldwide and an untold number of 
small research reactors at universities, on ships, submarines and 
what have you, which all generate a certain amount of radioactive 
waste. That waste needs to be dealt with.
<P>
	Over the years these reactors have generated and will continue to 
generate enormous amounts of toxic nuclear waste that will have 
some toxicity depending on when one would be in contact with it, 
but it will last for thousands of years.
<P>
	Canadians in general do not want radioactive waste in their 
backyards. I realize there has always been the nimby syndrome 
where people do not want any kind of garbage in their backyards. 
In this case, people in Canada have a very strong feeling that we 
will look after our own radioactive waste but they do not want to 
import radioactive wastes from other countries for disposal here.
<P>
	As an example, it took eight years and over $20 million for the 
siting task force struck by the former Minister of Natural 
Resources to even find a place for our low level radioactive waste 
alone, not including the high level radioactive waste for which it 
has yet to find a spot. I will say right up front in deference to my 
learned colleague behind me that a lot of this is because of 
ignorance. People have so much fear of radioactive waste, even low 
radioactive waste that is relatively harmless, they are afraid to have 
it in their neighbourhood.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	That is why, in the entire country, only the town of Deep River 
finally said yes in September 1995 to accepting low level 
radioactive waste. In all of Ontario, only two communities even 
considered the question.
<P>
	There is widespread opposition to handling or storage or 
anything regarding radioactive waste, some of it because of 
ignorance. The truth is that we will not be able to find communities 
that will be willing to handle this waste. That is the truth. People in 
Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5085"> 5085 </A></B>
<P>
do not want it. They feel they should not have to have it in their 
back yards. It will have to be dealt with, but there is this problem.
<P>
	At the start, I should also mention that just because people do not 
want to handle it, do not want to talk about the subject, the truth is 
we need to discuss what is going to happen and how we will handle 
radioactive waste in Canada.
<P>
	It is like an intergenerational transfer of wealth or 
intergenerational transfer of responsibility to say: ``We are going to 
generate this waste from our nuclear production facilities and we 
will leave it to some other generation to look after''. The truth is we 
have to say in our generation and for generations, that we are 
benefiting from nuclear power, that we are benefiting from nuclear 
research and that we will look after the waste too. We will look 
after it in the generation that got the benefits.
<P>
	We do not want to dump this multibillion dollar problem on 
future generations. When talking to young people, they say that too 
much has been dumped on their plate already. The least we can do 
is look after our own garbage.
<P>
	It is an absolute truism that the importation of nuclear waste 
from other countries for disposal in Canada is not acceptable to 
Canadians. As I will explain, there are some very good reasons that 
I ask that this law be set in stone.
<P>
	From the outset, I want to make clear that this bill would not ban 
the importation of plutonium from the U.S. and Russian warheads. 
One of the proposals is to burn it in our Candu reactors. It is 
important to note that all the current proposals-there are several 
being tossed around-in the deactivation of the warheads call for 
the plutonium to be reworked and fabricated in the United States 
and then shipped to Canada to be burned as fuel.
<P>
	That is not waste. We can still do that. I think Canadians are 
willing to consider that option because they feel it is part of what 
we can do. If we can get rid of the number of nuclear weapons 
around the world, we certainly are prepared to do our part.
<P>
	We will burn that fuel. Candu reactors can handle it with 
modifications. I think Canadians will consider that option, 
depending on how many dollars are involved. Nothing in this bill 
would prohibit that. We can import fuel. Fuel is not waste. Fuel is a 
product that we can use. The measures in the bill would not ban the 
importation of plutonium to be burned. We can do our part for 
world peace and for nuclear disarmament, if it comes to that.
<P>
	There will be some retooling necessary at our plants in order to 
use this plutonium. One of the proposals calls for the Bruce reactor 
to burn it. While Canadians are willing to consider that, we want to 
see how many dollars are involved. It will be a very costly process 
to upgrade our reactors to handle that product. We need to see all  
the dollars and cents laid on the table before we agree to any of it. 
That is obvious and that is in the future.
<P>
	Let me address what this will mean to Canada, if we accept this 
plutonium. It looks like the amount they are talking about from 
Russia is about 50 tonnes over the next 25 years. That sounds like a 
small amount if we are thinking in terms of wheat, but in terms of 
plutonium it is a lot for Canada to handle. That is how much 
plutonium will be generated from the dismantling of approximately 
40,000 nuclear warheads. It is a huge proposal and if we could take 
part in it that would be useful.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	By way of comparison, at the moment we already have 22,145 
tonnes of high level waste in Canada stored at nuclear reactor sites. 
It includes 78 tonnes of plutonium. By the year 2025 there will be 
58,000 tonnes, which will include 206 tonnes of plutonium.
<P>
	Another 100 tonnes of plutonium from the U.S. and Russia 
would increase that portion of the plutonium waste by a third. It is a 
significant amount if we were to accept it. It is a significant factor 
in our handling of nuclear waste. The price which Canadians would 
have to pay would be in the handling of the waste. I believe we 
would be prepared to do that because we could burn it. Once it is 
ours it is our waste and we would have to deal with it as we would 
other by-products.
<P>
	This bill does not affect the possible plutonium deal. We can still 
do that. Canadians will want to debate the matter but we can still 
press ahead with it if Canadians so desire.
<P>
	Why do we need this bill? There may be people who will try to 
profit from burying high level radioactive waste. There are profit 
oriented groups which may want to import waste for money. In 
other words, dispose of it in Canada for a buck.
<P>
	America alone has an enormous amount of highly radioactive 
waste. There is enough to fill 86 football fields a metre deep. That 
may not be too astounding, however, under current proposals it 
would cost about $57 billion to dispose of it. It would be a huge 
expense to dispose of it.
<P>
	The total clean-up costs in the U.S. alone are projected to 
approach $230 billion. It is a huge project. The U.S. has 77,000 
tonnes of this waste to bury and more is being produced all the 
time. Initially, the Americans wanted to bury it in Nevada, but they 
found 32 fault lines running through the burial site. In fact in 1992 
there was an earthquake on the site. Now they do not know what it 
will do with the waste.
<P>
	It is not that I believe the Americans are our best friends, but 
they will be looking for another place to bury it. They will look 
north. That is what this bill is meant to address.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5086"> 5086 </A></B>
<P>
	There are 413 commercial reactors worldwide. There are 26 
countries with nuclear reactors. Pressure all over the world is 
growing to bury this waste.
<P>
	Canada has a lot of vacant land. The Canadian shield is an ideal 
location to bury nuclear waste. In fact, in 1981 the Geological 
Survey of Canada identified over 1,300 potential suitable locations 
for burying radioactive waste in Ontario alone. Many countries 
around the world are looking to Canada as a possible place to 
dispose of their waste.
<P>
	Why worry about it? Who would want to bury this waste 
anyway? Nobody wants this kind of stuff. It is too politically 
sensitive. It is too environmentally uncertain. All kinds of 
problems could arise, including the transportation of the waste.
<P>
	There is a proposal or two in the works. The Meadow Lake 
Tribal Council, which represents nine Indian communities in 
northern Saskatchewan, was reported in February of last year to be 
considering offering their land, which lies over the Canadian 
shield, to be used for disposal for a price. That is part of their 
20-year economic development plan. As a matter of fact, a major 
environmental assessment of the deep rock disposal concept is 
currently ongoing. If the Meadow Lake group or any other group or 
company met the standards of environmental assessment, what 
would prohibit them from demanding and receiving a licence to 
import waste? There is no law against it.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Now they might even be able to go to the courts to obtain it. 
Aboriginal self-governments in Canada in this example have much 
wider powers than ordinary groups or companies to take part in and 
direct environmental assessments.
<P>
	Just as an example, in my own area, in western British 
Columbia, if the Nisga'a agreement in principle passes, and it 
looks as if it will pass both by the NDP government and the Liberal 
government in power here, the Nisga'a government will have the 
power to take part in any environmental assessment on its land. I 
will read from the relevant section of that agreement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nisga'a Central Government may make laws in relation to the environmental 
assessment of projects which are on Nisga'a Lands-where a Nisga'a Central 
Government law and the law of another Party requires an environmental assessment 
of a project on Nisga'a Lands, the project will be assessed under the process 
prescribed by Nisga'a law-</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is unclear in the agreement in principle if the federal government 
could step in and overrule that. I am just using that as an example.
<P>
	Even handling the process of how environmental assessment 
takes place is a very powerful tool, as we know. The process of 
environmental assessment in essence will give us the result we are 
looking for. Some of my colleagues will be talking about that 
aspect in more detail. Again, we being the Canadian people in 
general, could lose this by default.
<P>
	The Nisga'a agreement in principle is considered to be a 
template for 60 other aboriginal self-government agreements in 
British Columbia. It is being used as a template for many groups 
across the country.
<P>
	There is also another group. That is the Whiteshell task force 
which was struck this spring to investigate alternative uses for 
AECL's Whiteshell Laboratory in Pinawa. They may have 
considered using the underground research laboratory site as a 
disposal area. I have been down in that deep dark hole a long way 
under the earth and they have some very interesting and exciting 
ideas for disposing of radioactive waste.
<P>
	If this site were used for Canadian waste, I think Canadians 
should consider that. It is something to consider and the debate will 
be entered into as to whether it should be used for Canadian waste. 
It is not Canadian waste that I am worried about. We should look 
after our own waste, our own problem. It is the international waste 
that I do not want to have trucked up to Pinawa or any other site and 
that is what this bill is meant to address.
<P>
	In June the motion came before the regional municipality in 
Manitoba to change AECL's lease to allow it to bury high level 
waste at the Pinawa site and it was turned down by one vote. In 
other words, we are one vote away from pushing this idea that 
perhaps we could accept waste from around the world for burial at 
that site.
<P>
	Over the past 15 years Atomic Energy of Canada has spent 
nearly half a billion dollars studying the concept of deep rocks 
disposal. The site at Pinawa has been specifically dedicated to that 
study. AECL, like every other government department, has become 
stressed because of the cutbacks and budgetary problems. Whether 
it is at the Chalk River research plant and the cyclotron there, at the 
Pinawa site or wherever, more and more it is looking for ways to 
make money and profit.
<P>
	I hope it proceeds and pushes this idea of disposal of Canadian 
waste in that method. I cannot see another method. I think it is a 
viable one. Again, that is for Canadian waste. It is a Canadian 
problem, made in Canada, disposed in Canada. Let us do what we 
have to do. But I do not want to have 413 other nuclear reactors 
around the world giving up and saying to ship it all to Canada. That 
is what this bill is meant to prevent.
<P>
	The temptation to go the disposal route increases in proportion to 
the closeness of our relationship with the United States. I 
mentioned this earlier. We are closer geographically to the U.S. 
than to any other country. We are also under their economic 
influence because of our special trade arrangements.
<P>
	I want to address the question raised by environmentalists who 
say that under chapter 9 of the NAFTA, Canada does not have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5087"> 5087 </A></B>
<P>
power to legislate the ban or to ban the importation of toxic 
substances. We do have the power, at least in theory, because it is 
hard to say how the Americans will argue with us, in that article 
904 of NAFTA states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each party may, in accordance with this agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any 
standard-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the 
protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, 
and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures 
include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another party-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
We do have the power, at least theoretically, to follow through on 
this bill. I want to read another clause from that same article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-each party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection 
of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish 
the levels of protection that it considers appropriate-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under NAFTA we can theoretically ban the importation of any 
kind of waste and we can establish any levels of protection we 
want. Of course the United States may choose to challenge our high 
environmental standards under NAFTA. They have a dispute 
resolution process where they can say our standards are too high, 
but I think it is going to be pretty hard to say that our standards are 
too high when we are dealing with one of the most toxic substances 
on the planet.
<P>
	There is a little bit of a wrinkle in the works in that cabinet has 
already decided to export PCBs southward across the border. That 
may establish a precedent the U.S. could use in our NAFTA 
challenge. If we are willing to export our highly toxic PCBs, why 
could the U.S. not export its own highly toxic nuclear waste to 
Canada? That argument may come up. It is not impossible that we 
will be challenged on this, but I think it is therefore doubly 
important for the House of Commons and the Canadian people to 
take a stand now before it becomes a critical issue.
<P>
	I think there will be a profit seeking group within Canada 
accompanied by a NAFTA challenge sometime in the future that 
will make a proposal that Canadian soil be used for these purposes.
<P>
	Currently Bill C-23, the nuclear safety and control act, is before 
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. It was introduced 
the week after I introduced my bill. Clause 26 of the bill allows the 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to ``possess, transfer, 
import, export, use or abandon a nuclear substance''. All the 
commission has to do is grant any group a licence to do any of 
those things. The commission should not have that discretionary 
power. I do not believe the people of Canada want to give that to 
the commission.
<P>
	The fact that Bill C-236 is votable is important. This will affect 
the passage of the nuclear safety and control act by highlighting 
this important aspect of this bill.  Perhaps if this House voted to 
send my bill to committee the principle in it could be incorporated 
into the nuclear safety and control act. The House would have 
spoken here and given its express opinion on this subject, having 
sent it to committee and instructed the committee to incorporate it.
<P>
	I appeal to the members of the natural resources committee to 
listen carefully to what I have had to say, and reconsider the clause 
in Bill C-23 that allows for the importation of radioactive waste 
into Canada.
<P>
	I have gone through the reasons but I will give a quick summary. 
It has negative implications for international trade. It has negative 
implications for aboriginal self-government. It has negative 
implications for the safety of future generations of Canadians. It 
may be our only golden chance to send a message to the United 
States and to profit seeking groups within Canada. It is an 
opportunity to affirm the desire of the people of Canada that 
importation of substances harmful to Canadians, such as 
radioactive waste, will not be allowed by this government and by 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to my colleague from the Reform Party. He 
presented a very strong argument, that I think may get many people 
thinking.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to Bill C-236, an act to prevent the 
importation of radioactive waste into Canada. In order to fully 
understand this bill, you need to know that the federal government 
divides radioactive waste into three broad administrative 
categories: high level waste, HLW; low level waste, LLW; and 
uranium tailings.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	HLW remains highly radioactive for at least 500 years and its 
handling requires appropriate measures to ensure the protection of 
human beings and, obviously, the environment.
<P>
	What my Reform Party colleague was saying earlier is true. 
People say this waste must be got rid of, somehow eliminated, but 
not in their back yard, of course. I can understand people's fear. I 
have seen children in my riding from East Bloc countries and, after 
so many years, probably because certain nuclear power plants 
lacked protective controls, these children are handicapped for the 
rest of their lives.
<P>
	We took in several in our riding, and we will host others this 
summer, and we can see that there can never be enough precautions 
to protect the environment, and especially the health of human 
beings.
<P>
	There are two kinds of LLW: historic waste and operational 
waste. The bulk of LLW consists of historic waste. Unfortunately, 
Canada does not have, at this time, any permanent storage facility 
for radioactive waste, either HLW or LLW.	
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5088"> 5088 </A></B>
<P>
	Since 1978, the Government of Canada has been trying to find 
a solution to the disposal of HLW through a research and 
development program, but I think that the people doing this 
research are taking an awfully long time to find safe and effective 
solutions.
<P>
	In May 1995, the Auditor General of Canada tabled an entire 
chapter on the management of radioactive waste by the federal 
government. He said that ``Natural Resources Canada should work 
toward establishing an agreement among the major stakeholders on 
their respective roles and responsibilities and the approaches and 
plans for implementing solutions''.
<P>
	The federal government has jurisdiction over and regulatory 
authority for nuclear energy, including radioactive waste. 
Yesterday, the natural resources committee heard from some very 
specialized people from Ontario Hydro, Hydro-Québec and New 
Brunswick Power. I asked them the following question: ``Is there 
some way, on the international level, of having some sort of 
regulation?'' As we are well aware, there are nuclear plants just 
about everywhere in the world, and Canada is proud of ours, but 
some countries that have built plants do not necessarily have the 
same environmental standards. A rather cavalier neglect of these 
plants sometimes ensues in certain countries, because 
environmental protection is not a concern.
<P>
	Questions would therefore have to be asked, and I would propose 
that this be the occasion for creating international regulations 
which would govern all countries.
<P>
	We also know that Ontario produces the most waste. As at 
December 31, 1992, the total number of spent fuel bundles was 
estimated at 900,000. One bundle is about the size of a fire log, and 
the 900,000 would fit into one and one-half Olympic-sized 
swimming pools.
<P>
	Approximately 87 per cent of this fuel came from Ontario 
Hydro, 6 per cent from NB Power, 4 per cent from Hydro-Quebec, 
and 3 per cent from Atomic Energy Canada Limited.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	By the year 2033, the volume of spent fuel would be the 
equivalent of 17 Olympic pools-full, or four million bundles. An 
enormous figure, and a potentially very scary one as well.
<P>
	Recently, Canada lifted its ban on shipping PCBs to the United 
States. The purpose of doing so was to have them destroyed in the 
U.S., not stored. Why then would Canada import radioactive waste 
for storage? If we woke up tomorrow to find metric tons of 
radioactive waste lined up at our borders ready for storage, there 
would be some questions asked. If this waste entered Quebec 
freely, there would be still more questions. We would not be 
thrilled in the least. I trust that we do not wish Canada and Quebec 
to become a giant dump site.
<P>
	This bill is a very worthwhile one, and I congratulate my 
colleague for introducing it, thus giving us the opportunity to ask 
ourselves some very serious questions. Shortly, we shall be making 
additions to the bill which will increase its value.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-236, an act to prevent the importation of radioactive waste into 
Canada. Although I shall not be supporting it, I am glad that the 
member for Fraser Valley East has introduced this bill. He has 
provided us with an opportunity to discuss a topic of great 
importance to the government, the sustainable development of 
nuclear energy within Canada's supply mix of energy resources.
<P>
	It is recognized that all energy sources present some advantages 
and some disadvantages. The mix adopted by governments 
necessarily takes into account the specific conditions in each 
country and the advantages and disadvantages for each energy 
source.
<P>
	Nuclear energy is seen as an environmentally sound energy 
option that does not contribute to any greenhouse or acid gas 
emissions. Many countries have recognized the significant 
advantages of nuclear energy for the production of electricity. 
Others are considering the use of such energy for the undertaking 
of future development activities.
<P>
	Members of the House will recall that the government has 
introduced Bill C-23, an act to replace the current Atomic Energy 
Control Act with more modern legislation entitled the nuclear 
safety and control act. This act will ensure the federal government 
continues to exercise fully its responsibilities for the control of 
nuclear energy in Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-23 received second reading by the House of Commons in 
June and is before a parliamentary committee for a review as we 
speak. Members of the House are well aware of the government's 
position on the entire matter of Canada's domestic and 
international approach to nuclear safety.
<P>
	Bill C-23 goes on in 127 clauses to define a comprehensive 
regime that is designed to regulate practically, thoroughly and 
strictly all aspects of nuclear activity in Canada. The Canadian 
nuclear industry is already one of the most strictly regulated in the 
world. As for the radioactive waste specifically, the Government of 
Canada takes the proper management of this material very 
seriously.
<P>
	On July 10 the Minister of Natural Resources announced the 
government's policy framework for radioactive waste which will 
guide Canada's approach for radioactive waste disposal into the 
next century. This framework, which reflects consultations with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5089"> 5089 </A></B>
<P>
waste  producers and owners, incorporates three principles that will 
ensure the sound and effective management of radioactive waste in 
Canada.
<P>
	The first principle is that the federal government will ensure that 
radioactive waste disposal is carried out in a safe, environmentally 
sound, comprehensive, cost effective and integrated manner.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The second principle is that the federal government has the 
responsibility to develop policy, to regulate and to oversee 
producers and owners, ensuring they comply with legal 
requirements and meet their funding and operational 
responsibilities in accordance with approved waste disposal plans.
<P>
	The third principle is that waste producers and owners are 
responsible in accordance with the principle of polluter pays for the 
funding, organization, management and operation of disposal and 
other facilities required for their wastes.
<P>
	These principles highlight the roles of the federal government 
and the waste producers and owners for the management of 
radioactive waste while recognizing that the management may be 
different for the three types of radioactive waste encountered in 
Canada, nuclear fuel waste, low level radioactive waste, and 
uranium mine tailings.
<P>
	Regardless of the type of radioactive waste, the primary concern 
of the government is to ensure that no undue risks are posed to 
workers, the public and the environment. Much work has been 
done to date to establish national directives regulating the 
management and transportation of waste, whether classified as 
hazardous or radioactive.
<P>
	Any proposed projected associated with the management of such 
waste, which has a component falling under federal responsibility, 
would be subject to all relevant legislation and regulations. Most 
prominently, even before the project could proceed, it would have 
to undergo a thorough environment assessment review process 
under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	Currently other legislative instruments include the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, 1992, with its regulations for the 
exportation and importation of hazardous waste; the Transportation 
of Dangerous Goods Act and Regulations, 1992; the 1946 Atomic 
Energy Control Act and its proposed replacement, the Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act, which is currently under review by 
Parliament.
<P>
	Internationally, considerable effort has been spent recently by 
countries to come to an agreement on the proper management of 
hazardous and radioactive waste, including the trans-boundary 
movement of this material, implying that the practice of importing 
and exporting  radioactive waste is not in itself detrimental if it is 
managed appropriately.
<P>
	Examples include the regulations for the safe transport of 
radioactive materials published by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency; the International Atomic Energy Agency code of practice 
on the trans-boundary movement of radioactive waste; the decision 
of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
concerning the trans-frontier movements of hazardous wastes and 
their disposal; the Basel convention on the control of 
trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal; 
the safety standards on radioactive waste now under development 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency; the international 
convention on the safety of radioactive waste management now 
under development by the same agency.
<P>
	Officials from the Department of Natural Resources and the 
Atomic Energy Control Board continue to participate actively in 
these international efforts. Canada has over the years acquired an 
enviable reputation. Canadian officials are often called on to 
mediate disputes during international discussions.
<P>
	For instance, Canada has been asked to chair several 
international working groups associated with the ongoing 
development of the international convention on the safety of 
radioactive waste management.
<P>
	I have in the last few minutes endeavoured to list initiatives to 
clearly show that this Parliament, this government, other 
governments and international organizations have already devoted 
a great deal of attention to the vital issues of the management of 
radioactive waste. The work by people with international as well as 
national experience is continuing.
<P>
	We can see that there is ample evidence of continuing, 
comprehensive, close attention by national and international 
organizations to the management of radioactive waste, including 
the importation and exportation of this material.
<P>
	Bill C-236, which purports to be necessary for the protection of 
the health and environment of Canadians, is essentially 
unnecessary given the extensive regulations already existing or 
under development in this area. It is important to understand that 
we do have existing regulations and other regulations are under 
consideration and under development.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I use my last few seconds to simply recommend to all members 
of the House on this side and on that side that they not support Bill 
C-236, an act to prevent the importation of radioactive waste into 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5090"> 5090 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate on this subject, probably more from my 
perspective as the natural resources critic for our party.
<P>
	This has has been an ongoing debate in this country for many 
years, going back to the creation of the first nuclear power plant in 
Canada when the question of what to do with the waste was asked. I 
found the reaction from the government side interesting. I really 
have to wonder about the wisdom of approving and licensing an 
energy source in Canada before dealing with the whole question of 
the disposal of radioactive wastes in Canada.
<P>
	Certainly energy from nuclear materials does not create the 
problems some of the other energy sources do but some of the other 
energy sources do not have the potential for the human disaster this 
energy source does. I think the disaster at Chernobyl brought home 
very quickly to people all around the world the potential disaster 
that the creation of powerful nuclear energy does have. The 
destruction in Ukraine and the rendering unproductive of a huge 
area of some of the most productive agricultural land in the world 
and the human suffering and disaster that it created and even the 
effects that it had around the globe should scare Canadians and 
everyone in the world when they start talking about this source of 
energy.
<P>
	This bill my colleague introduced does go a long way to meeting 
the fears of Canadians about the disposal of the world's nuclear 
waste in our own backyard and I think that is important. However, 
the question which also needs to be debated and needs to be 
continually debated is the continuing production of nuclear waste 
in Canada before we tackle this question of what we are doing with 
it. I believe that is a very important question we have to deal with.
<P>
	When we look at Canada and at the debate going on in every 
metropolitan area about what to do with landfill sites, what to do 
with the mountains of garbage produced every year and the great 
difficulty in even locating landfill sites, it certainly makes the 
possibility of finding an acceptable site for high level nuclear waste 
disposal pretty remote.
<P>
	In my province very close to my residence, we have had a 
similar debate going on for some years about a hazardous waste 
disposal site in the Swan Hills area of Alberta. It began with all the 
same promises that we heard from across the way about safety and 
the promise to not become a site for the disposal of anyone else's 
hazardous waste. Because of the monetary considerations, the 
money to be made or lost in the destruction of hazardous waste, 
quite quickly that plant has become a site for the importation of 
hazardous waste from all over Canada and proposals have been 
made for importing hazardous waste from the United States for 
disposal at this site.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Residents who live around that site, including me, have great 
concerns about the impact that would have on our air and water 
<P>
quality. We were never in favour of the importation of hazardous 
waste to that site and we remain opposed to it today, in spite of the 
fact that it is happening.
<P>
	The assurances that the Government of Canada will always 
dispose of nuclear waste in a safe and responsible manner do not 
give me a lot of comfort. I would like to know where the disposal 
site will be and what it will cost.
<P>
	There has been research done about the safety of burying the 
waste deep in the Canadian Shield. When the minister appeared 
before the committee she assured me that the cost of disposal has 
been built into the rate which the utilities charge for the energy. I 
wonder how that is possible when nobody has established what the 
cost will be.
<P>
	If we are going to talk anybody, be it First Nations people or 
anybody else, into burying the waste in their backyard, it will not 
be done cheaply. There will have to be a major incentive involved. I 
do not believe that anybody has determined what the cost will be.
<P>
	The natural resources committee is dealing with Bill C-23. It is 
very unfortunate that it does not deal with some of these issues.
<P>
	As my colleague pointed out, the body which regulates nuclear 
waste and nuclear production in the country allows companies to 
import and export and do virtually whatever they want with nuclear 
waste in Canada. Most Canadians would not accept that group's 
having that responsibility without some controls being placed on it 
by Parliament.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the government did not incorporate this bill 
into the provisions of that bill and take a stand for the protection of 
Canadians and the environment. There is a huge stockpile of this 
waste which is growing every day all over the world which will 
need to be disposed of.
<P>
	I support the bill. I would encourage other members of the 
standing committee to consider amendments which would 
incorporate this bill into Bill C-23. It would be a giant step in 
protecting Canadians and their environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a fortunate 
opportunity that I have to join the debate today. The hon. member 
for Fraser Valley East has brought up a subject which is of concern 
to all Canadians and indeed to the government.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. friend that the management of radioactive 
waste brings up policy matters of vital interest to thoughtful 
Canadians.
<P>
	This issue by its nature is an international one and of 
considerable importance. Governments must respect the wishes of 
other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5091"> 5091 </A></B>
<P>
national governments to decide whether they wish to provide 
management services for the waste originating in other countries. 
For example, many African countries, recognizing that they may 
lack the necessary legal, administrative or technical capabilities, 
have officially banned the importation of hazardous and 
radioactive waste. However, when an authority has been 
established that does indeed have the proper legal, administrative 
and technical capabilities it is a necessity to consider that position.
<P>
	There are significant volumes of various types of radioactive 
waste in Canada. They include low level radioactive waste, nuclear 
fuel waste and uranium mine tailings. Canada has acquired much 
experience in the safe management of these wastes. Included in the 
management are handling, treatment, transportation, storage and 
disposal. The element of transportation is particularly important 
when considering the importation or exportation of radioactive 
waste.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Developing expertise and safe transportation have always been 
important to Canada. In view of the large land mass of our country, 
they are extremely important. The expertise acquired by Canada 
over the years is recognized by many countries. In recognition of 
this, Canada plays an important role in the development of 
transportation regulations by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency.
<P>
	As mentioned previously, the government confirmed on July 10, 
1996 that it continues to take seriously the proper management of 
radioactive waste by establishing a radioactive waste policy 
framework. The elements of this framework consist of sets of 
principles governing the institutional and financial arrangements 
for disposal of radioactive waste by waste producers and owners.
<P>
	The principles would guide the implementation of radioactive 
waste disposal in Canada in a safe, comprehensive, cost effective 
and integrated manner. The federal policy role continues 
determining the broad financial institutional arrangements that 
would be acceptable as well as developing a cost effective 
integrated approach to radioactive waste management. In parallel, 
the federal regulatory role continues to ensure that management of 
radioactive waste is carried out in a safe and environmentally 
sound manner and that adequate financial guarantees are in place.
<P>
	In keeping with the government's environmental agenda, the 
policy framework adds to Canada's efforts and expertise in 
radioactive waste management. The bill that we consider today is a 
proposal of blanket legislation to prevent the importation of any 
and all radioactive waste into Canada.
<P>
	First of all, let me make it clear that there are no plans to import 
any nuclear fuel waste into Canada. In fact, eight years ago in 1988 
the Government of Canada  responded to the report of the standing 
committee on environment and forestry, ``High Level Radioactive 
Waste in Canada: The Eleventh Hour''. In its response the 
government indicated that it agreed with the committee's 
recommendation that a public review process be launched if the 
then department of energy, mines and resources should envisage 
the possibility of accepting nuclear waste from any country.
<P>
	It bears repeating that today such a review would be considered 
under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. At the same 
time, the minister of EMR indicated to the committee that it was 
not the government's policy to accept used nuclear fuel from other 
countries.
<P>
	The disposal concept of nuclear waste is currently undergoing a 
federal environmental assessment review. As I mentioned earlier, 
radioactive waste also includes low level radioactive waste. Many 
countries around the world routinely export and import low level 
radioactive waste resulting from certain uses, for example, the use 
of radionuclides for environmental, agricultural health purposes. 
For instance, hospitals in developing countries may wish to profit 
from considerable advances in the use of radionuclides for 
diagnostic and therapeutic uses in treatments.
<P>
	Use of this material necessarily produces a certain amount of 
low level radioactive waste. Exporting this waste to countries that 
can be responsibly managed and make material advantage for those 
countries is the only option. Developing countries may also wish to 
use radiation and radionuclides to produce the nuclear energy for 
development of methodologies that enhance environmental 
protection, agricultural production and public community health.
<P>
	To do so they may have to depend on the waste management 
services of developed countries. Those developed countries that 
agree to import low level radioactive waste do so for many reasons 
which include honouring international conventions and 
agreements, assisting in the development of responsible 
management of nuclear activities on a global scale, participating in 
global developments in environmental technology vital to the 
future of sustainable development of several nations around the 
world, and solving potential world environment and health 
problems in the area of radioactive waste management. Canada has 
not been one of these developed countries.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the bill proposed as a blanket to act to prevent the 
importation of any and all radioactive waste into Canada is not 
needed, desirable, appropriate or effective. Moreover, I believe the 
member for Fraser Valley East did not fully appreciate that this bill 
would not provide any added benefit to the health and environment 
of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5092"> 5092 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore I recommend to the members of the House that they 
cannot support Bill C-236, an act to prevent the importation of 
radioactive waste material into Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me start by 
saying that I am somewhat surprised to hear what members 
opposite have to say about from the Liberal government's position 
on the management of radioactive waste.
<P>
	According to the hon. member for Winnipeg-St. James, who 
brilliantly defended the government's position, and according to 
the hon. member who just spoke, there is no problem, the existing 
regulations are effective and future legislation will settle the whole 
issue of the importation of radioactive waste. However, there is 
also that surprising comment by the auditor general in his May 
1995 report, in which he said that Natural Resources Canada should 
concentrate on reaching an agreement with the major stakeholders 
on their respective roles and responsibilities and on approaches to 
and a plan for the implementation of solutions. He was referring to 
the management of radioactive waste.
<P>
	According to the auditor general, radioactive waste management 
is not entirely satisfactory in this country. So it is somewhat easier 
to understand why the hon. member for Fraser Valley-East 
presented his bill to prohibit the importation of radioactive waste 
into Canada.
<P>
	It is clear that, when there are no policies, no clear cut 
regulations and no legislation on the whole issue of radioactive 
waste management, it would be immoral for a country to allow its 
importation. For the same reasons as my colleague from 
Matapédia-Matane, I am inclined to approve the bill presented by 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley-East.
<P>
	However, when we consider the tenor of the bill, a number of 
questions arise. The hon. member who presented the bill mentioned 
that what we have here is the famous not in my backyard syndrome. 
However, the fact remains that waste is being produced, whether 
industrial or radioactive, in all countries. We see it in our own 
regions where we often have problems.
<P>
	If I look at my own riding of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
discussions have been going on for ten years in an effort to find a 
landfill site. For some reason, every community designated by the 
appropriate authorities to have a waste treatment site often 
manages by means of petitions and protests to ensure the site is not 
located in that community. Although today, things are starting to 
change.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, there comes a time when Canadian and Quebec 
citizens will have to realize that the industrial society in which we 
live has produced waste and that steps will have to be taken 
initially to prevent all this waste from damaging the environment 
and subsequently to treat the waste.
<P>
	If we look at the whole issue of radioactive waste, I think it is 
disturbing to see what is happening throughout the world, not just 
in Canada. I am quite willing to admit we have been negligent in 
Canada, but look at what has happened in Russia and the Ukraine. I 
probably know the situation a bit better because of my role as a 
parliamentarian. I had an opportunity to look at the situation and to 
visit the country and I realized there was a problem. There was a 
problem worldwide with radioactive waste management.
<P>
	I realize that I do not have much time left, but I want to say that 
like the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane, I certainly agree 
with the bill because in Canada we cannot afford to receive 
radioactive waste. We are not even able to handle what we have. 
Nonetheless, I think that Canada has a responsibility, as an 
advanced industrial society, to look for ways of helping other 
societies that are perhaps having a little more trouble right now, 
such as Russia, such as the Ukraine, to find ways of treating the 
nuclear waste produced, because it is a question of survival not 
only for Canada and for Quebec, but for all of humanity.
<P>
	So that is the appeal I wish to make. At some point, we must quit 
saying ``not in my back yard'', seek information, and take the 
necessary measures in terms of research and development so that 
we can find a solution to the situation we are now facing.
<P>
	My colleague said it, with what is now going on in Canada, 
looking at the waste produced in Ontario alone, and in thirty years, 
it will have increased fivefold, so if we do nothing, if we are 
content with temporary solutions, if we do not take the measures 
necessary and if we simply look for holes in which to bury the 
waste, I think that then we will not have found a solution.
<P>
	It is high time that Canadians and Quebecers realized that this is 
a problem that must be solved, and we are going to support the bill 
presented by the member for Fraser Valley East. This does not 
change the fact that much remains to be done in Canada and in 
Quebec in this regard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hour provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' business is now expired and the order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a while ago I asked the finance minister to explain to 
Canadians why the government had broken its promise to create 
jobs and how did he feel about the government telling Canadians 
that they will have to accept and get used to high employment? The 
government does not have any long term vision of how to deal with 
Canada's unemployment.
<P>
	Canadians know why we have high levels of unemployment. It is 
because federal economic and social policies continue to create 
unemployment not only through significant numbers of layoffs of 
federal civil servants, but there is no commitment to full 
employment. That has been made clear by this government.
<P>
	There is no long term economic or industrial strategy, no vision 
of how to address the very real challenges posed by continue 
globalization of trade, no strategy for the economic advancement 
of less developed regions, no rejection of failed policies of 
privatization and deregulation, no long term vision.
<P>
	Quite plainly the federal government has its priorities wrong. It 
has abandoned middle class and working Canadians and instead 
has listened to and responded to the concerns of its wealthy 
corporate friends.
<P>
	Recently there have been numerous reports of record corporate 
and bank profits at a time of continued and unacceptably high 
unemployment. The heads of major corporations are being paid at a 
rate 212 times that of the pay of average workers. The gap between 
the executive suite and the shop floor has increased fivefold in the 
last 30 years.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Something is wrong when a bank president or a large corporation 
president can announce record profits one day, cash a six figure 
paycheque the next, lay off a thousand workers on day three, on day 
four hold a news conference to demand that the government force 
middle class families to get by with less, and on day five attend a 
$1,000 per plate Liberal Party fundraising gala.
<P>
	Something is tragically wrong when the Prime Minister and the 
federal finance minister support all this and wash their hands of 
their electoral commitment to get Canadians working again. It is 
dead wrong in terms of the direction for Canada.
<P>
	The government is irredeemably short term in its economic 
policy. The Liberals, Conservatives and Reformers are obsessed 
with the market even when the market fails. The government runs 
things for the few at the top, not the many.
<P>
	We can begin to seriously address Canada's high unemployment 
levels only when we have a national reconciliation on the economy. 
There needs to be a co-ordinated approach in which all the major  
stakeholders play a role in generating a vision for the Canadian 
economy. A critical part of this must be the full blown pursuit of 
full employment and a commitment to full employment.
<P>
	The ability of high tech and knowledge based industries of the 
economy of the future to provide jobs needed by Canadians must 
be seriously addressed as competition from newly industrializing 
countries continues to undermine traditional industrial sectors.
<P>
	Measures to encourage industrial and business innovation and a 
financial sector committed to job creation must be developed. Our 
educational systems and our commitment to education must be 
revamped to address these challenges, and the federal government 
has a major role to play in all this.
<P>
	Only when Canada knows where it is going as a country can 
Canadians design and implement the effective measures needed to 
ensure we get there. The federal government should show 
leadership in this regard, not just wash its hands of the problems 
faced by the millions of unemployed Canadians and their families 
across this country.
<P>
	Needless to say an important part of this strategy is for Canada to 
work with other countries to make full employment the goal of 
global economic development. The presence of unprecedented 
numbers of unemployed across developed nations and in Canada 
indicates how far away that goal is.
<P>
	I challenge the federal government to look beyond the status quo 
and toward proposals that promote real and effective change. 
Canadians are demanding it and it is time for the government to 
take a lead in meeting those demands. After all, in the red book it 
promised it would.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, jobs are and 
continue to be the Government of Canada's highest priority.
<P>
	Since the government took power it has worked very hard to 
create the climate necessary for job creation and economic growth. 
A number of measures have been taken to stimulate employment 
growth in Canada, including the $6 billion infrastructure program, 
a national tourism promotion program and the reform of the Small 
Business Loans Act to improve access to capital for small 
businesses.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne and the 1996 budget, the 
government re-emphasized its commitment to increasing job 
opportunities for Canadians. For example, it doubled its 
contribution to student summer job creation this year and it 
launched Technology Partnerships Canada, a $250 million fund to 
support technology development and job creation in the aerospace, 
environmental and biotechnology sectors.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5094"> 5094 </A></B>
<P>
	The government also launched the expansion of the Community 
Access and SchoolNet programs to improve access to the 
information highway.
<P>
	The results so far show that the job strategy of the government is 
working. Since October 1993 over 639,000 additional new jobs 
have been created across the country, and these jobs are mainly full 
time jobs. In the meantime, the unemployment rate declined by 
almost two full percentage points from 11.1 per cent in October of 
1993 to 9.4 per cent in August of 1996.
<P>
	Since the government came into office, helping young 
Canadians make the transition into the workforce has been our 
particular priority. Three hundred and fifty million dollars was 
allocated to youth employment initiatives over a three-year period, 
sixty million of which was allocated to summer employment 
programs this past summer creating more than 60,000 summer jobs 
for young Canadians.
<P>
	In addition, the findings and recommendations of last spring's 
ministerial task force on youth and of the recent youth conference 
will help in the development of a new youth strategy. The strategy 
is expected to be announced later this fall.
<P>
	The government has a job creation record to be proud of. It will 
continue in its effort to help Canadians find and keep jobs, working 
in collaboration with provinces and the private sector.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this summer I watched as the prairies produced one of the 
best crops I have ever seen or ever heard about. Wheat, oats, barley, 
canola, peas, lentils and even the hay crops were good.
<P>
	Prior to the harvest the sun came out and baked the fields for 
several days.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	These were marvellous pre-harvest conditions. Farmers across 
the prairies began their harvest in earnest. Then the rain hit. For 
almost three weeks during the time when the combines should have 
been running full out, very little harvesting took place.
<P>
	According to official records, about 50 per cent of the crop came 
off the fields and got put in the bins before the rain came. Just as 
the rain stopped and the weather forecasters predicted clearing and 
warming, the frost hit and then it snowed.
<P>
	As members have seen on TV, more than an inch of heavy snow 
hit my part of Saskatchewan on the last weekend in September, a 
time that is a traditional prime harvest period. Now, during the past 
two days, more than a foot of heavy snow has hit standing crops in 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba.
<P>
	Farmers are beginning to worry. The summer had produced a lot 
of optimism at a time when optimism was sorely needed but hardly 
deserved. Farmers know they had just come off 10 very bad years. 
Incomes had dropped substantially, crops had been poor, interest 
rates were high, prices were depressed and bankruptcies were 
occurring too frequently.
<P>
	More recently, Tory governments in Saskatchewan and Ottawa 
had changed the way agricultural emergencies were financed. In 
other words, what used to be a federal responsibility became a 
shared responsibility. The province had less of an ability to finance 
agricultural emergencies than did the federal government.
<P>
	Therefore a new safety net program, the GRIP, came and went in 
a flash as a result. When the government changed, the Liberal 
government in Ottawa maintained the cost sharing principles and is 
currently negotiating with the provinces to establish a new crop 
insurance program.
<P>
	The changes to be made to the crop insurance have not yet been 
agreed to, let alone implemented. At the same time, the new 
Liberal government did away with the Crow benefit, a program 
designed to share the cost of transporting grain from the farm gate 
on the prairies to the ports on the coast with all Canadian taxpayers. 
This move immediately increases the costs of operating the farm.
<P>
	Other input costs have increased. As a result, a lot more money 
than usual has been put into the ground or paid to railways this year 
in preparation for the year's harvest.
<P>
	A good crop this year was necessary not only to pay the bills but 
to make up for the debts created from past years. Let us face it, 
everyone was looking forward to a good crop and is still hoping 
that little damage has been done by the weather.
<P>
	Yes, we may take in a good crop but we cannot ignore the fact 
that farming depends on the weather. If the weather does not 
co-operate, we as a nation cannot afford to just let farmers go. We 
cannot afford to lose our capacity to produce food for the world and 
to generate the revenues necessary to maintain rural populations.
<P>
	Therefore even in good times it is important for governments to 
ensure that contingency plans are in place just in case there is a 
crop failure or something happens to reduce the incomes necessary 
to produce the next year's crops.
<P>
	I ask the minister if these contingency plans are indeed in place 
so that we can reduce the stress already being felt in the farming 
community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal and 
provincial governments assist producers across Canada with 
significant financial protection against weather related problems. 
Crop losses, through government safety nets, are covered.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5095"> 5095 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal-provincial crop insurance program is specifically 
designed to protect producers against crop losses such as those 
associated with current weather conditions on the prairies.
<P>
	In the event of poor harvesting conditions, it provides direct 
compensation to insured producers for yield and quality losses 
which can result in reduced revenues.
<P>
	In 1996 about 80 per cent of the grain and oilseed crop acres in 
Manitoba, 55 per cent of the acres in Saskatchewan and 45 per cent 
of the acres in Alberta are insured.
<P>
	Recent reports indicate that harvesting is well advanced and that 
the percentage of harvesting completed are as follows: Manitoba, 
75 to 80 per cent; Saskatchewan, 50 to 55 per cent; and Alberta, 65 
to 75 per cent.
<P>
	In addition to crop insurance, most producers participate in net 
income stabilization account program, or NISA. NISA encourages 
producers to build up funds for use in periods of difficulty by 
matching producer contributions on a dollar-dollar basis and by 
providing a 3 per cent bonus each year of the producer 
contributions held on account.
<P>
	The funds in a producer's NISA account can be drawn on if 
revenues, due to weather related and other losses, fall below the 
five year average. Currently, prairie producers have about $1 
billion in their NISA accounts.
<P>
	In addition to the above measures, the minister may authorize 
the Canadian Wheat Board to make advance payments to ensure 
producers of grain to better finance the drying of damp or tough 
grain.
<P>
	While we hope the weather will improve so farmers can harvest 
their crops, if it does not, existing safety net programs are in place 
to assist with the losses which can result.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
