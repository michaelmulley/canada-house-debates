            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Mr. Kyle Seeback (Dufferin—Caledon, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8594451"> Mr. Speaker, the first thing to ask today is why we are here and why the House is seized with this matter. It is actually not very complicated. The House ordered documents to be produced that the government has not produced. That is it. I could sit down right now and everything would be done if the government just gave the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594452">There are all kinds of convoluted arguments, like the Conservatives are talking about this too much, but the people who have the answers are all sitting right over there on that side of the House. The Liberals could end this entire thing by producing the documents. These are not documents that the Conservatives have requested, let us make that very clear, but documents that the House of Commons has requested. The government is not doing it and that is why we are here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594453">It could be over in literally five seconds. A member of the government could stand up right now to say the government is going to produce all the documents that Parliament has requested and we would all resume our normal duties. However, they will not, so we have to ask ourselves why we are here. It is probably because the documents contain many things that the corrupt Liberal government does not want to be released. I do not use the term “corruption” lightly, but when we look at the specifics of this particular incident, we know there was corruption. It is unequivocal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594454">On June 10, Parliament adopted a motion compelling the production of documents about the green slush fund. Of course, that was supported by all parties other than the Liberal Party, the government, because it has something to hide. The government did produce some documents, that is true, and government members are going to stand up during questions and comments to say that they produces some documents. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the PCO, redacted those documents. For those watching who do not know what “redacted” means, it means they took a big black marker and covered up all the juicy parts. For anything that could get the Liberals in trouble, they said, “We better not release that.” That is where we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594455">The motion that Parliament adopted did not say that the Liberals could pick and choose which parts of the documents to disclose, nor that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the PCO, could go through them and take out anything that might hurt the government's reputation. The government's reputation is not so good right now, so it must be really bad if they are afraid that the documents would hurt the reputation of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594456">Let us remember that the redactions done by, again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the PCO, were for a Prime Minister who has been convicted not once but twice of ethics violations. Also, when the PCO was redacting those documents, let us be clear that it was not redacting that fund members met, had a couple of coffees, decided a company was at arm's length and had no conflict of interests, and gave it some funding. That was not what was redacted. What has been clearly redacted are things the Liberals know will be damaging, which is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594457">Parliament is supreme, and Parliament does not take on these powers on a whim. As I said before, this was supported by all of the parties, so it is not about one party trying to gang up on another. This is by the will of Parliament. Parliament has said that it wants the documents produced and that it does not want them to be redacted, because that was not in the order of Parliament. Parliament said it wants all of the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594458">We had to fight to get here. It is not as though the Liberal government agreed that the fund did not operate well, that there were some problems and that we should get to the bottom of them, and then provided the documents. No. There was a long, painful process where we had to continuously push and push to get the government to where we are today. It is the Liberals' continuous refusal to produce the documents, whether at committee or any other time, that has led us to where we are today, with Parliament adopting a motion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594459">Parliament does not take this lightly. We do not do this all the time. It is a rare and exceptional circumstance when Parliament demands the production of documents, and when it does so, the government should respect Parliament to follow the order. The order was not for redacted documents that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal PCO chose to redact. It is a flagrant violation of the will of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594460">That is why we are here. That is why this is going on, and it could all end in five seconds. The Liberals could just produce the unredacted documents. Members have now been pushing this issue for three days in Parliament. At any time, they could have done that, but they are not, and we have to ask ourselves why. These documents must contain so much evidence of corruption by the Liberal crony-appointed board members who rewarded themselves and other Liberal insiders. These documents must be so bad that they are willing let this debate go on for days and days without producing them. We can get to no other conclusion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594461">Now that we know the summary of why we are here, let us talk about how we got here and why we are requesting the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594462">This stuff is stranger than fiction. If we tried to make up a scandal, we could not make this up. Way back in the day with the sponsorship scandal, which I am old enough to remember, a bunch of Liberals were handing out money in brown paper bags and $400 million of taxpayer money disappeared, most of it handled by Liberal insiders and given to Liberal insiders. That was nefarious and secret and we can maybe understand how it went on for a while without being detected. However, this is very different. This government program, which I will call the green slush fund because that is what it effectively became, gave away about a billion dollars of taxpayer money. When we talk about taxpayer money, we have to think about who is paying these taxes in a really difficult time in Canada. There are single mothers working two jobs just to make ends meet. Their taxes went into this green slush fund and were abused by Liberal insiders. Let us unpack that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594463"> The Auditor General reviewed 50% of the contracts given out, and of that 50%, 82% had a conflict of interest. When I was in high school and university, I was really happy when I got 82% because that meant I did a heck of a job. This is corruption 82% of the time on half of the contracts. If we extrapolate that, we are looking at 82% of 100%, or pretty darn close, because I do not think it was just a strange coincidence that 82% of half of the contracts had conflicts of interest. Every dollar that this fund spent had to be approved by the board. Who was on the board? It was a whole bunch of Liberal government crony appointees. What did they do? The unequivocal truth of this is that they lined their pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594464">When we think about that, we can think about the million everyday Canadians in Ontario going to food banks and the tent cities we have everywhere because life has become so unaffordable under the NDP-Liberal government. What does that mean? It means that all of this money could have been used for far better purposes. If we told single mothers working two jobs and paying taxes that a bunch of crony capitalism went on worth a billion dollars, they would be absolutely outraged. They would tell us to get to the bottom of this, because this money could have made a difference in their lives and their friends' lives. It could have been used to build housing as opposed to tent cities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594465">However, this is what happens with Liberal governments. I mentioned the sponsorship scandal, so none of this is new. The sponsorship scandal was about Liberal cronies giving money to other Liberal cronies, all of this insider stuff. Some 400 million dollars' worth of taxpayer dollars evaporated, much of it handed around in shady meetings in brown paper bags. What the Liberals learned from it is that they did not have to hand money around in brown paper bags in shady meetings. They can just appoint a whole bunch of their friends to a board who can approve contracts for themselves and their buddies so that everyone gets rich and it is all legal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594466">Corrupt Liberal government members do not care about corruption. They told board members to do whatever they wanted while they were on the board, and there were no checks and balances. This went on for years and years. It was not until the hard work of Conservative members of Parliament that this corruption was discovered. Only then did the Liberals start to do a couple of things, but this is what has happened from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office appointing Liberal insiders to run a fund where members gave each other money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594467">Some people are getting an A+ in corruption. An example is Cycle Capital. One member of the board ran Cycle Capital, which got $250 million from the green slush fund. That is outrageous, and Canadians are rightly outraged by it. Imagine someone gets appointed to this board by a Liberal friend and decides they are going to give $250 million to their own company. Why not? The money has to go somewhere, so why should it not go to one of their companies? This is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594468">Did the director declare a conflict of interest and recuse herself from the deliberations on these things? No, she was not going to do that, because then the money would not have gotten to her company. This was all under the watchful eye of the corrupt Liberal government. I use the term “watchful eye” with great derision. There was no watchful eye; the government just let it happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594469">The Liberals had to know it was happening because they knew who they appointed. When someone gets appointed, the government looks into that person. The Liberals would have known the interests these people had in various companies. They would have seen the money going out to these companies, so they must have known and just did not care. We cannot draw any other conclusion from this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594470">Also, this was not a one-off. Let us talk about another incident of this, which involved the former chair of the board, Annette Verschuren, who resigned from the board in 2023 following the opening of the Ethics Commissioner investigation into the agency. Boy oh boy, we know how well companies affiliated with her did. They did exceptionally well. She did not recuse herself from decisions to award money to early-stage companies that were nominated by two institutions in which she was a member. The conflict of interest is unbelievable. During her time on the board, seven out of 25 companies invested in by the venture capital firm Cycle Capital, in which she had an interest, were funded by the green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594471">When we listen to this, we have to give our heads a shake. This cannot be possible. How is this happening in Canada? This is the kind of corruption we would see in countries where there are real problems with corruption. The only time we have real problems with corruption in Canada is when the Liberal Party is in government, as with the sponsorship scandal, when everybody was making it rain for Liberal insiders. Now, of course, we have the green slush fund, where, once again, Liberal insiders are getting rich. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594472">Guy Ouimet was also on the board. He is a venture capitalist on the board of Lithion Technologies, which received almost $4 million from the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594473"> We can go on and on and talk about this, but the fact is that this is corruption on a massive scale. We have to get to the bottom of it. How do we get to the bottom of it? We get to the bottom of it by the Liberals producing the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594474">One thing I am concerned about is the question of where the NDP is going to be on this. I know the NDP. It talks about fighting crony capitalism all the time. We need the New Democrats to stand strong with us in the demand for these documents. Two days from now will they say that they think we should move on and give up on this? That would be a tragedy. That would be defying the will of Parliament and the Canadians who want to get to the bottom of this, and get to the bottom of it we will. We will get these unredacted documents. I just hope the NDP will choose to be on the right side of this, as opposed to going back into the unholy coalition with the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594475">What we will hear from the Liberals is a whole bunch of what I like to call gobbledygook. They are going to say that we are disrupting the normal course of Parliament because of this. When we hear that, automatically remember that this could end if they release the documents. Whenever they say that this is taking up too much time in the House of Commons, we just ask them to release the documents and it will be over. However, they will not, because they know how damaging those documents will be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594476">The Liberals also say that this will be some kind of charter rights violation and that we should not give the documents to the RCMP. This is also a bait and switch. They are trying to deflect from the fact that they do not want to produce the documents. They are coming up with this grandiose scheme, and we all know this. When we say that they need to do something and they start making up all these gigantic excuses, such as the dog ate our homework, we got caught in traffic, there was a massive pileup on the highway, we start realizing that they are just explaining why they are not going to do something, that they never had an intention of doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594477">We are going to see it in the questions they are going to ask me. They are going to try to make the claim that somehow what we are doing is a charter violation, that the RCMP should not get these documents or that the RCMP already has these documents. It is all smoke and mirrors. It is all just an attempt to deflect from the fact that the Liberals will not produce the documents. No matter how many little circular arguments they try to make, when they try to go through that maze and it goes through 17 different things, trying to explain why we should stop, just remember that if they produced the documents, all of this would stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594478">The RCMP does have some documents, the redacted ones. It should get the unredacted ones. We all know why the documents were redacted. Let us think about it again for a second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594479"> Why would the government fight so hard to not release the documents? If it has nothing to hide, the truth is very simple? The truth is very simple on this, and that is to release the unredacted documents. Everything else the Liberals have to say is smoke and mirrors. It is an attempt to deflect. It is an attempt to rationalize their absolutely unacceptable behaviour, their assault on Parliament and the supremacy of Parliament. This is what they are doing. They are going to try to justify it. We are going to hear it in just a couple of minutes. No, produce the unredacted documents. That is where this all finishes, no matter what they say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594480"> The Liberals have been going on a barrage of this. They are all over social media saying that what we are trying to do is outrageous, as if we are in control. They are in control. They should release the documents and the truth shall set them free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594481">The truth actually feels good. They should just get it off their chest and then beg the forgiveness of Canadians. They should say that the people who they appointed to this board engaged in severe corruption, that they are ashamed of themselves, apologize to Canadians and resign. They will not do that. They should also promise to never to do it again, except they will. It is like the story of the scorpion and the frog swimming across the river. The frog asks, “Why did you sting me; now we're both going to die.” In reply, the scorpion says, “Because I am a scorpion; it's what I do.” Why do they keep doing these corrupt things? They are Liberals; they are corrupt.</ParaText>

They will not answer about how they could make it happen in a second. Instead, their questions are to my authenticity because they have nothing to say on this. They know the documents are going to be very bad for the Liberal government. That is why they are trying to hide them and cover them up. It is a very serious issue. They are defying the will of Parliament.</ParaText>

I would argue it cannot legally or constitutionally, but what we have seen in every other case is that it will still refuse to hand over the documents. This is why it is critically important for us to take this stand and tell the government that, at this critical point, the corruption must come to an end and the documents must be handed over.

We hope the NDP will stand with us on this and ensure we can put pressure on the government to release the documents.

All of those were blocked by Conservatives in the House of Commons and at committee, so we could not get to the bottom of them. </ParaText>

This is according to documents acquired by the Winnipeg Sun. This was hidden as rental car fees, but according to the website, it states that “Somatic sex education...is a form of sex therapy that individuals can engage in alone or with a partner”. These are taxpayer-reimbursed funds.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594518"> Before I begin, I do want to recognize a couple of things. This is my first time, outside of an emergency debate, to rise substantially in this chamber. I would like to recognize a marriage. One of my esteemed staff members was married this summer. Jesus and Jenna Bondo are now one. It was a beautiful ceremony.

He was trained in Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo and currently resides there. He was coached by Beijing Olympic medallist Dylan Armstrong, whom I went to high school with. He was double my size when we were in high school, despite being younger than me. We are very proud of Dylan and his contribution to Canadian athletics. Dylan coached Ethan Katzberg to an Olympic gold medal in the hammer throw. Ethan was also one of the two flag bearers for Canada at the closing ceremonies. We are incredibly proud of him. On the floor of this chamber I want to give him congratulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594520"> We hear the New Democrats talk a lot. I have often said that if this were a radio station, it would be all talk, no rock because that is really what we are dealing with. If I could actually pose a question and, who knows, the New Democrats may answer this, it would be to ask whether they will eventually support a closure motion from the government. If this were the old NDP, the pre-coalition NDP, I would say no. That was a party that historically fought for the underdog, that historically fought for Parliament, that recognized Parliamentary supremacy with its limits, though not many, but all of its effective exercises of discretion. That was the NDP, often known as the conscience of Parliament, a party that would challenge other parties to think about the ramifications of their decisions. That is what opposition parties are supposed to do. Opposition parties have a constitutional obligation to provide that conscientious and thoughtful opposition, but opposition nonetheless, when things are not going right. However, here we stand on the floor of the House of Commons looking at a scandal in which insiders got rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594521"> As a kid from North Kamloops whose parents immigrated to Canada without two pennies to rub together, when I see the enrichment that took place on the backs of taxpayers, I am disgusted. There are people out there who are lining up at food banks as we speak, and Liberal insiders got rich. If that is not repugnant enough, the Liberals here will not provide the documents to tell us exactly who got what, when and why. The New Democrats have said that they will vote in favour of this motion. Will they vote in favour of a closure motion from the government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594522"> I have heard before, and I am still trying to wrap my head around this, about charter rights. Now, it is no secret I was a lawyer. Perhaps the government members can enlighten me and I am certainly open to hearing it, as maybe there is something I am missing about the charter. The charter is meant to protect people from government action. It is always interesting because the Liberals like to use it as a sword. The charter was always meant to be a shield, to shield the people from the government. This is basically what is taught to us in undergrad courses or first-year law; and yet, the Liberals are talking about protecting themselves from the release of these documents. The government is protecting itself, coming in here and saying that it does not want to release this because of the charter. Perhaps the government can connect the dots; I am certainly open to hearing that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594523">Even if there is an ongoing investigation and there are questions about that, and I understand the integrity of the investigation, Parliament has a job to do, notwithstanding an investigation. That is just a fact. Investigations of this magnitude typically take years to complete. Then we have to go through what is called a charge approval process, where somebody has to look at this and they have to get all the disclosure. We have the Jordan decision, which we know well in this chamber. With all the disclosure it could be years before we actually see any charges if they are merited, which is for someone else to determine. Far be it from me to say whether somebody must be charged. That is for an independent prosecutor to determine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594524">Where does that leave us? It leaves us with a scandal where insiders, presumably people who are fairly well off, in positions to further their own interests as they own companies, can further that interest. People got richer on the backs of taxpayers. This is so disgusting. As I say it, I feel myself getting more and more angry that we are standing here asking why the documents are not just tabled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594525"> Is there anything more repugnant than stealing from the state? When I say from the state, it is actually stealing from Canadians and from me. Whether somebody is like the 104-year-old veteran whom I awarded a King Charles III's Coronation Medal to, who fought for freedoms, they are stealing from him and his taxes, and stealing from a newborn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594526"> These are the allegations that are before us, and frankly, a lot of them are substantiated. Whether it is criminal is another question, but what we know here is that there was a complete and utter misappropriation of funds, so much so that, if I understand the Speaker's ruling, we are dealing with nothing until we deal with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594527">The Liberals do not like that. There is a pretty easy solution. They can put forward the documents. When we get into politics, obviously we think about pros and cons of any course of action. I ask myself, what is going through the Liberal machine right now? What is going through their heads? They can put forward the documents and bring an end to this, or they cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594528">What are the pros of doing that? This is openness by default. I will get to that in just a minute. Why will they not do this? I am thinking out loud here. There has to be something so damning in those documents that they refuse to put them forward and that grinding Parliament to a halt is worth it. They are prepared to put aside their legislative agenda because there is something in those documents that somebody in a Liberal back room or front room has said they do not want to be revealed.

They are working any job they can, often because the Liberal government has been so slow to allow people who have immigrated to this country, who are trained in fields that we need people in, like doctors, nurses and other fields, to work in their field. They are forced to work any job that they can take and see their paycheque evaporate into rising taxes, and then what is left evaporates into inflation.</ParaText>

This is utterly shameful. It is disgusting. The Liberals will stand up, invoke the ghost of Stephen Harper and talk about how terrible things are right now because of him. Stephen Harper has not been here for nine years. We can talk about a lack of accountability. The government is not taking any sort of accountability. I am sure the member from Winnipeg will stand up and ask a question for the 1,624th time in this place. At the end of the day, where are we? They should just release the darn documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594532">I will pause here because it is an appropriate time to recognize two people in Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo who were recently engaged. One of them is a young man whom I have spoken with regularly; I know his father. My mom actually worked with his father when she was beginning as a legal assistant, and my sister went to school with his aunt.

Professor Malone has done great work. However, for a government that said it would be open by default, it has been anything but. We are standing here today because this is the height of a lack of transparency. This is a government that promised sunny ways, openness and transparency. We have been here four or five days because the government is choosing to obfuscate. This is not just the deflection that a lot of politicians do on all sides; more than obfuscation, this is deliberate stymying. The Liberal government has chosen to ignore the will of the House because there is something bad in those documents. I question why the Liberals will not just put them forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594534">The Liberals will stand up and say, “Oh, but this person really isn't a Liberal; they were Conservative once. Did members know that?” I do not care who they are. They could have been my campaign manager, but if they got rich off the backs of taxpayers, they should be held accountable in the House and through whatever independent mechanisms there are. The buck stops here when it comes to Parliament. We should see those documents, and they should be tabled. It is the same when it comes to the 11 who have either wittingly or unwittingly helped hostile states. I do not care if it is the person sitting next to me; they should be named. If they cannot be named here, then where can they be named? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594535">This is a Liberal government that has much to hide, but it is getting tired. The expectation is that people will run defence for it and do different things. However, people who stand here and who sit in the balcony at question period ask this: “Why aren't the questions ever answered? Why do we have to ask the same question over and over again?” I would say, rhetorically, to the Liberal members who are here that I wonder what their response would be if this were a Conservative scandal. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594536">For those at home, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, is supposed to be an arm's-length, not-for-profit organization; it is meant to support projects that develop and demonstrate technology. Here is the problem: SDTC executives awarded projects in which they held conflicts, equalling over $330 million of taxpayer funds. Let us go back to the middle class: How many middle-class families does it take for their federal tax burden to equal $330 million? We all know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has lavish tastes, and he has no problem pontificating about carbon taxes while he jet-sets all around the country and tells people about how they have never had it so good with their carbon rebates, which really do not make up the complete picture. They really do not tell people how much they are actually paying, especially when we think about tax upon tax and how it is levied at each and every single step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594537">How did this happen? In 2019, the Liberal industry minister, Navdeep Bains, began appointing people who would have conflicts of interest to SDTC. These are Liberal appointees. To those people who talk about Stephen Harper and say that “this person served under Stephen Harper”, as I heard earlier today, they were appointed by the Liberal government five years ago. If we know one thing about Liberals, it is that they help Liberals, appoint Liberals and want to fund Liberals. What did they start doing? They started giving themselves contracts: “You scratch my back, I scratch yours.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594538">We are here in Parliament. I talked about my roots as a kid from North Kamloops, the child of immigrants, thinking I would probably never be in a place like this; however, if I ever had envisioned it 20 or 30 years ago, the last thing I would be thinking is that a government would be stymying the production of documents over people who got rich. I will make this clear: If anybody who works for me used their position to get rich, or to steal $20, I would have no problem terminating them on the spot. That is what is expected, period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594539">In contrast, when it comes to the Liberals, when it comes to them having to deal with this scandal, they put up roadblock after roadblock. Why is this? Why are they hiding something? The reason is that there must be something substantial, something explosive. I invite people to watch question period and watch the answers. Watch how little of substance is said. We have these vague references to charter rights. We have, “Well, the RCMP are investigating, so we have nothing more to do.” Last time I checked, we are not the RCMP; we are Parliament. Parliament should have the right to figure out its own processes, and we do. The people and the Liberals, they do not understand that there are actually separations. They say that, as Conservatives, we want to meddle. They do not realize that Parliament controls its own destiny, while the RCMP controls its own destiny. These are the documents that need to come. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594540">In my view, our whistle-blower legislation should be enhanced. There were whistle-blowers who came forward and said, “This is wrong.

I am sure the member for<Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2"> Winnipeg North</Affiliation> is just going to stand up and tell us the reason. This should not happen when whistle-blowers put their necks on the line so that Canadians can know the truth.

She was appointed indirectly as the chair of SDTC; she is no longer the chair. If she goes to court, as we all believe that she ultimately will, and we do the work the RCMP has indicated to the House that it is not comfortable with, could we be compromising the trial? In terms of what the Conservatives are calling for, we could collect information inappropriately and hand it over to the RCMP.

A conflict of interest arises when somebody can benefit themselves. I think corruption is actually much more wholesale, and that is not to say the two cannot have any overlap; I think they have substantial overlap here. In my view, when we have a Liberal government that is providing contracts to its friends, or allowing its friends to provide contracts, that is not just a one-time thing where they line their own pockets. This was a decision to systematically fleece taxpayers and to do it in a way that would be covered up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594548">That is corruption. I do not know how that is not corruption. If a person or a party, in this case the Liberals, deliberately decided to ensure that people get rich off the backs of taxpayers, they were in a conflict of interest. Even an apparent conflict of interest is enough; if it looks bad, they should be recusing themselves. This did not just look bad. This was bad. They should hand over the documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594592"> The practice of funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars to companies that Liberal insiders have a vested interest in is a deeply disturbing pattern with the government. It is actually corrupt. We saw it with McKinsey, with over $100 million in contracts being inappropriately awarded while a close friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Dominic Barton, was the chairman. We saw it with Rio Tinto having been given $222 million just five months after the same Dominic Barton was appointed as its chairman. </ParaText>

We saw it with the $237-million contract given to the company of a former Liberal MP, Frank Baylis, for ventilators that were later sold for scrap metal. We see it with the purchase of the $9-million luxury condo on Billionaires' Row for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s media buddy Tom Clark in New York City.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594594"> Time and time again, Liberal insiders get rich at the expense of Canadians and are shielded from any accountability by Liberal members of Parliament and their NDP coalition. While the Liberals have been creative in finding ways to abuse taxpayers' dollars to ensure that they find their way into the pockets of their friends, they have also shown themselves to be uniquely corrupt and untrustworthy. When the government and its bureaucrats hide the documents by refusing to provide them or by heavily redacting them, they not only insult the House and infringe on the privilege of its members but they also place themselves above the Constitution and the very foundation of our parliamentary system.</ParaText>

For the Conservatives to label it as corruption and tie it to the Liberal Party is just wrong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594636">Mr. Speaker, sitting here and reflecting on the privilege motion before the House of Commons today reminds me of the 40th Parliament from 2008 to 2011. I was privileged to be in the chamber as a graduate student when the former governor general, Michaëlle Jean, gave her Speech from the Throne; and as an observer when papers were thrown in the air. Papers were thrown in the air because the former leader of the Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, brought forward a motion to produce documents related to the F-35.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594637"> Through a debate at the procedure and House affairs committee, there was back and forth between the government and the official opposition at that time to determine what papers were in fact needed. However, behind that very debate was not the Conservative Party saying it was not going to comply with Parliament. No, the Conservatives wanted to work with the official opposition, but the Liberals then used it as a political ploy to go into an election. Thankfully, Canadians understood very clearly what Michael Ignatieff and the failed Liberals were trying to do, and that was to take advantage of their parliamentary powers to push forward an election. Thankfully, the Liberals were defeated in that election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594638">It raised a serious question for me as a graduate student at that time and as a former Canadian parliamentary intern: Why use the power of privilege only to defeat a government, when the very purpose of that privilege was to get to the bottom of what the government was doing at that time? That is an important historical point to raise here today. It seems that only Conservatives seem to be bothered by the hypocrisy we have seen from the Liberal Party once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594639">Therefore, with that, the recent events surrounding the government's handling of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, program have brought this issue again to the forefront of our democratic discourse. That is the production of papers, the right of this very House to demand anything from the government that it so decides to do. That is the fundamental privilege of Parliament. Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> rightfully ruled on a question of privilege raised by the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. The Speaker's ruling confirmed what Conservatives have said all along, which is that the government violated the expansive powers of this very House by failing to surrender crucial records or papers related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594640"> Let me take this time to remind members of the government's corrupt mishandling of the SDTC program, otherwise known as the green slush fund. This program was designed to support innovation in sustainable technologies. It was established in 2001. It operated with few issues under Liberal and Conservative governments until the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. Earlier this year, the Auditor General released a damning report. It revealed that $123 million had been misappropriated by the Liberal-appointed board of SDTC. The report outlined serious governance failures, including a staggering 90 instances where conflict of interest policies were not followed; nearly $76 million spent on projects connected to friends of Liberals who sat on the board; $59 million awarded to projects that were not eligible for funding; and $12 million spent on projects that not only fell into conflict of interest, but were also ineligible for funding based on the government's own criteria. This situation not only represents a betrayal of public trust, but also illustrates a significant failure in oversight by the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. We must ask ourselves, how can we ensure accountability in government if those in power are not held to the same standards we expect from others? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594641">Conservatives have proven that the privileges of parliamentarians were violated by the government's refusal, which is why we are continuing to speak about the serious action the government has taken and indeed why the House is completely seized with this matter. This is not just a procedural misstep. It is a direct challenge to the very foundation of our parliamentary democracy. The Auditor General report made it clear that this scandal falls squarely on the shoulders of the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to insiders. The minister even went so far as to suspend the SDTC board because he knew that he was in hot water and he took the correct action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594642">The government is unjustly infringing on the right to access these documents today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594643">To further understand the gravity of this situation, we must first reflect on the historical context of parliamentary privilege. Our rights and privileges as parliamentarians are not mere formalities. They are rooted in centuries of struggle against tyranny. As the British House of Commons gained eminence as a legislative assembly, it established privileges as statutes, as a part of common law aimed at protecting its members from interference, namely from the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594644">Erskine May, a cornerstone reference in parliamentary procedure, defines parliamentary privilege as “the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament and by Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions.” In other words, I cannot do my job, nor can any other member of Parliament do their job, if this privilege is compromised. This underscores that our privilege is essential for holding the government, the Crown, to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594645">In Canada, we inherited the legacy of the U.K. through the Constitution Act of 1867, which enshrines our rights and privileges, ensuring that they are not exceeded by any authority outside of this House. The Parliament of Canada Act, 1985, further states that we retain the privileges not exceeding those “held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom”. In other words, we inherited that democratic tradition of Westminster parliamentary, responsible government. This is a powerful affirmation of our rights and responsibilities as members of this institution, drawing on hundreds of years of precedent that brings us here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594646">Let us get back to the motion. In June, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> tabled a motion asking for all files, documents, briefing notes, memoranda, emails and any other correspondence exchanged among government officials regarding SDTC. This motion was sent through, and SDTC and associated parties either redacted the documents, withheld the documents or outright refused to present the documents to the official opposition and to this Parliament. This is a clear violation of our collective parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594647">In making his arguments, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> referred to page 239 of <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, second edition, which states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594649">When the rules of parliamentary privilege in the House are disregarded, it undermines the authorities and powers the House can enact, and diminishes its ability to govern properly.

              <ParaText id="8594650">Without respecting the use of parliamentary privilege and obeying the orders of the House to produce and bring forward the requested documents, it displays a complete disregard of respect for the House, and its authority and duty to Canadians to provide them with accurate and transparent information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594651">In response to the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader</Affiliation>'s motion, the Speaker confirmed the accusations that the government violated its powers. In his ruling, the Speaker referenced page 985 of the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, affirming that, “No statute or practice diminishes the fullness of that power rooted in House privileges unless there is an explicit legal provision to that effect”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594652">This clearly establishes the House has an inherent authority to compel the production of documents vital to our oversight functions. He went on to say that procedural precedents are abundantly clear.

              <ParaText id="8594653"> To strengthen his ruling about the absolute nature of power to order the production of documents, the Speaker referenced a ruling of Speaker Milliken from 2010. In the Debates at page 2043, we can find Speaker Milliken stating the following: “procedural authorities are categorical in repeatedly asserting the powers of the House in ordering the production of documents. No exceptions are made for any category of government document”. However, the government has argued that the order to produce these documents may infringe upon charter rights, particularly regarding police investigations and privacy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594654">The <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> has contended that this order exceeds the authority of the House by seeking documents for the exclusive use of a third party, namely the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This is a very wrong and dangerous interpretation by the government House leader. The House leader does not have the right to predetermine when documents can be disclosed. It is up to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594655">Even after the Conservatives have called out the House leader and the Liberal Party for their blatant violation of parliamentary privilege, the House leader still stands by her statement that the Conservative Party wants to infringe on the charter rights of Canadians. She has even gone on social media to spread the false narrative that the Conservatives are infringing on charter rights. She is using the charter as a shield against what would otherwise likely be a criminal investigation. How is finding out the truth about the mismanagement of this program an infringement on charter rights? What are the Liberals really trying to hide from Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594656">It is essential to recognize that the House of Commons exists to hold the government accountable. The notion that the government can refuse compliance under the guise of protecting individual rights undermines the principles of transparency and accountability, which govern our democracy, have been clearly established by multiple Speakers and are, of course, written in the Constitution Act of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594657">The privileges we enjoy today were established to protect the House and its members from the power of the Crown and other authorities. As noted by Enid Campbell in her analysis of parliamentary privilege in 1966, “the House of Lords and the House of Commons may investigate any matter whatsoever, however embarrassing the inquiry may be either to individuals or to the government of the day.” That is why we retain privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594658">We know that this whole charade is very damaging to the Liberal brand in Canada. I was a member of the industry committee when we conducted hearings with Annette Verschuren on her contract as board chair of SDTC, and there was a clear conflict of interest. We would think that with the new open and transparent appointment process, Ms. Verschuren would have been disqualified immediately from even sitting on the board, but we would think wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594659">When he was still in cabinet, former minister Bains ignored several warnings about her conflict of interest and proceeded with her appointment within three weeks of Balsillie's removal. With the arrival of Ms. Verschuren at SDTC, an environment was created in which conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by the board. Board members would go on to award SDTC funding to companies in which they held stocks or positions. Former minister Bains also appointed five more board members, who engaged in unethical and illegal behaviour by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership or seats on the board. Officials from the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development sat on the board as observers and witnessed 96 conflicts of interest but did not intervene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594660">Former minister Bains was replaced in January 2021 by the current minister, and in November 2022, whistle-blowers began raising internal concerns with the Auditor General about the unethical practices they were seeing within the department. In February 2023, the Privy Council was briefed by whistle-blowers and commissioned two independent reports. In September of last year, the allegations became public, but it took the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> a month to agree to suspend funding for the organization. Then in November, the Auditor General announced that she would be conducting an audit of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594661">That brings us to today and the Liberals continuing to cover up the scandal by not tabling the documents that Parliament has requested. If the House cannot access the documents necessary to fulfill its duties, we are left vulnerable to government overreach and mismanagement. The ignorance of the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> surrounding parliamentary privilege has allowed the executive branch to resist transparency, and it is our duty to correct this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594662">In conclusion, I urge all of my colleagues to recommit to the principles of parliamentary privilege. The Liberals refusing to hand over all documents related to the green slush fund within 14 days is simply unacceptable. We must ensure that our House retains the authority to demand accountability from the government. We must also recognize that while certain information may need to be withheld for legitimate reasons, this should not be a blanket excuse for a lack of transparency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594663">The current situation is a wake-up call. It calls for a deeper understanding of our roles and responsibilities in the House.

              <ParaText id="8594688">I will start with the question raised by the NDP member from <Affiliation DbId="278635" Type="2">British Columbia</Affiliation>. The whole idea of Parliament is that this is supposed to be a chamber of debate, of conversation. Sometimes they digress, I agree, and I have certainly been in the House for some very long digressions, but what comes out of that can sometimes be quite impressive and actually miraculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594689">From having the ideas of different parties, different perspectives and individual backgrounds, all coming together in this wonderful place we call Parliament, we sometimes get to the most amazing conclusions. It is, as Winston Churchill said, the best worst system, but it is certainly our system, and it is the one we have chosen, so I will never apologize for debating an issue. Sometimes I do not like what I hear, but that is okay. When I am being heckled, sometimes I do not enjoy what I am hearing, but even that is okay. That is our right. I am proud to be in a country where we have freedom of speech and where the people have representatives here in Ottawa to defend their interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594690">Let us go back in time because I think it is important that we put context around this debate today. We have had nine years, as much as the government members sometimes like to create the impression that they just walked into town, all of these problems already existed, and they are here to save it. Every new Parliament is a complete ignoring of all the previous issues. They will say that those were because of some other guys, that those were because of Stephen Harper. They will say that they did this and they did that. Even nine years later, we still do not see an acknowledgement. I do not think I have once heard members from the other side say that they got something wrong, but they have certainly gotten a lot wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594691">Let us look at the background that this latest Liberal scandal falls against. It was not long into the government's mandate when we already saw the fall from sunny ways. I am not going to cover all the scandals because I only have 20 minutes, and that would take hours and hours to discuss, but I will go over some of them because I think it is important. Not long after the mandate, there was the vacation that the <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars. It was called the Aga Khan vacation. He claimed he was a friend. However, the ethics commissioner disagreed, and that was his first ethics violation, so we are starting there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594692">Sunny ways were looking a little dim at that point, but we will continue on. There is many to pick from, but I would say one of the most challenging scandals for the government was the SNC-Lavalin affair. We will hear, and I think this is particularly enlightening in this debate, the other side say that the Conservatives are going to trample judicial independence and the bureaucracy. No, we are not. We are simply asking for documents to be handed over to the RCMP in an ongoing investigation. That does not seem like the trampling of anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594693">What was a trampling of the independence of the judiciary, as well as of the bureaucracy, was what was alleged to have happened in the SNC-Lavalin case. The <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and if he did not do it, he came very close it, pushed on his then attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould. She, of course, had to resign to avoid this interference with the independence of the judiciary. He was looking for a deferred prosecution agreement, or a get-out-of-jail-free card, in layman's terms, for his friends at SNC-Lavalin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594694">There we had an actual case of interfering with the independence of the judiciary. This is not that. We have yet another scandal on this journey of corruption, so we will continue down the Liberals' journey of corruption, which has gone on over nine years. Hopefully we will be seeing the end of it very soon. The next one is really not that far off from the SNC-Lavalin scandal. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594695">We would figure that maybe the Liberals would learn. As a small digression, I have the best kids in the world, but, as a 10-year-old and an eight-year-old, they still go off the rails occasionally. I tell them that mistakes are okay, but repeated mistakes are not. They need to learn from these things in life. Clearly, the government is so dedicated to corruption that it will keep going. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594696">Next is the WE Charity scandal. Who can forget this notorious chapter of the Liberal government? We can argue it involved $500 billion or a trillion dollars, depending on the way we look at the numbers, but once again, Liberal insiders were getting rich with Canadian taxpayers' money. WE is an organization that is now, thanks to reporting in the media and the great work of some Conservative members on the ethics committee, troubled, at best. I will put it that way. Liberal insiders got half a trillion dollars of Canadian taxpayers' hard-earned money, and we do not know what it was for. Maybe it was to build another well in Africa or just to rename one again and again. This is the organization that the government sought to give billions of dollars to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594697">Then there is the “other Randy” affair, a more recent one. I have skipped over a bunch, such as clam scam and a number of other scams. I could go on, but I want to get closer to the present. We have the “other Randy” affair, which is unbelievable to me. I am shocked that this has not progressed into an RCMP investigation. If it has, I am not aware of it. A sitting member of cabinet directed his business in a cabinet meeting. This is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594698">Literally millions of dollars were flowing out the door to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594699">Then there is one of my personal favourites: arrive scam. For arrive scam, there were IT guys who said they could probably have created the app for $250,000, but let us be generous and say it would have cost $1 million or $2 million. No, it cost the government $60 million, and we do not even know if that is the full extent. The Auditor General said that the bookkeeping was so bad that she could not even say for sure the amount of resources that were dedicated to this disaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594700">Let us go SDTC, which is incredibly problematic. For those not following along at home, the SDTC board was to give out millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. It was funded, I believe, in the most recent funding agreement, with a billion dollars to help the environment, to fight climate change and to modernize our economy. It is important to put a little context around that. Our economy is in dire straits. Our GDP per capita has not grown over the last 10 years. There are a number of issues, most of which funnel back to the Liberal government, as to why we are on such a terrible trajectory and our growth is the worst in the OECD. There is a lack of capital that the government has smothered with overtaxation and over-regulation, but one thing that a lot of folks will point to is Canada's troubling record on innovation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594701">We produce some of the greatest ideas in the world, and I say “ideas” for a reason. I do not mean intellectual property because, oftentimes, before an idea makes the jump from someone waking up in the middle of the night saying eureka and drawing it on a napkin to it becoming a commercial idea, it has already left the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594702"> The idea of the organization of Sustainable Development Technology Canada was not in itself a bad one. It was the execution that was bad. It could have had great utility if that capital had been directed to some of the great minds currently in Canada, those produced by our wonderful universities. It could have been directed to our companies and our businesses, which could have had a real lift for the economy. It could have solved one of our productivity issues, in fact, one of our main productivity issues, which is a lack of innovation in our economy. Instead, it was funnelled outside of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594703">What happened? For those people who are not aware, there is a lot of specific information. If we want to really boil this down, SDTC board's primary job was to allocate capital. That is a fancy term, too. Its job was to take the billion dollars it was getting from the federal government and give it to individuals who would grow our economy by promoting innovation with that capital that was provided to them, which businesses need to start. Oftentimes, especially with tech companies, they can be capital intensive, and it can be years until there is a product. By having that funding operation, it could have added real value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594704">Let us go over what the Auditor General found to have happened instead. There was up to $390 million that was misspent. I think it is important to categorize the ways that the money was misspent because there was quite a variety. One was ineligibility. Members can imagine that the government gave this billion dollars to SDTC ,and it had a rule book about how the money was to be spent. That makes sense. What did SDTC do with that? It ignored it. Just in the sample that the Auditor General looked at in her report, there were 10 separate enterprises that did not fit the criteria eligibility, but they still got nearly 60 million dollars' worth of projects. That was $60 million where the board members said that they knew what they were supposed to do, as they had it in writing right in front of them, but that they were not going to give that $60 million to the businesses that fit the criteria. Instead, they picked other businesses. I do not think the Auditor General gave the reason for that, but perhaps we can draw our own conclusions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594705">We have other cases where there was a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest means that someone has an interest in a decision that is being made. A director may have ownership or their spouse may have ownership. That is a normal thing. Tens of millions of dollars went out the door in cases with a conflict of interest. Someone declared a conflict of interest, and the board went through the criteria, but then awarded the money anyway. There were also tens of millions of dollars misspent where they just simply did not follow or abide by their conflict of interest rules. There were hundreds of millions of dollars that left taxpayers' hands to go to, in some cases, Liberal insiders. That is extremely troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594706">Members can look at the scandal that is going on now. It has taken years, by the way, to make its way through, thanks to the great work of our Conservative members at the ethics committee. What will its impact be and where are we right now? The RCMP has come out and said that there is an ongoing investigation. The Conservative Party, supported by other opposition parties, brought forward a motion to produce documents. Unfortunately, we received from the government an incomplete set of documents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594707"> We received piecemeal, redacted documents that did not meet Parliament's criteria. That is troubling not just on the substance of this issue but also on a broader impact as well. Parliament, in itself, is not special. I am not special. The other 337 members are not special. The people who we support and represent are special. Each one of us represents 100,000 people combined of the over 37 million Canadians. Their money was taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594708"> At the end of the day, over a billion dollars was taken out of the pockets of Canadians. When we look at that, it is Canadians handing over a thousand million dollars. That money could have gone to helping and feeding their families. It is money that could have gone to a down payment on a mortgage or to help individuals meet their rent. That money could have gone to so many good causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594709">Instead, the government, as the rightful authority, took the money. However, when government takes money, there is a real importance to accounting for it to the rightful owners, the Canadian people. Those dollars were not generated in Ottawa. They were taken from towns like Colborne in Ontario, from places like Skeena—Bulkley Valley, Toronto and Montreal, and all brought to Ottawa. Sometimes that money is spent very well, like in supporting our women and men in the armed forces, which the Liberal government has woefully neglected. However, when the Liberal government takes a billion dollars and awards it to its friends, it is hurting the economy, Canadian people and those most vulnerable in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594710">Last, but certainly not least, the government is undermining the authority and the legitimacy of our democratic institutions. When people see scandal after scandal, at the same point when they are paying more money to Ottawa than at any point in the history of our country, they are increasingly wondering what they are getting for those dollars. They know how hard it is to earn. They know that with the Liberal government's record cost of living crisis, record increases in interest rates and inflation, they are having a harder time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594711">Then to add insult to injury, the government, which is taking more money than ever before in Canadian history and just lighting it on fire, in addition to taking all that money is also running out the credit card. Not only will our families have to pay the Liberal government debt back, our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have to pay this debt back. What will the government have to show for it, other than a few Liberal insiders getting rich?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594712"> It absolutely makes my blood boil when the Liberal government has the audacity to say that Conservatives, by calling for accountability and for the government to not be corrupt, are somehow trampling the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8594738">Just this morning, I read in a press review that the government is still investing in research for small modular reactors.

However, the Conservative Party seems to be using it as a tactic to obstruct the work of the House and the study of certain bills that have been introduced in the House. I share the same sense of unease as my colleague from Longueuil—Saint‑Hubert, who said earlier that there are so many other things we could be discussing. I want that to be perfectly clear to our constituents who may be watching our debates right now.

When Parliament orders the government to produce documents, the House has spoken and the government needs to respect that. What is the point of the House of Commons if its will is not respected? This is a legitimate question of privilege, and Parliament's authority to demand documents is clearly established.</ParaText>

On June 10, the House adopted a motion moved by the Conservative Party that ordered “the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) and the Auditor General of Canada each to deposit with the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, within 14 days of the adoption of this order, the following documents” and that those documents be handed over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594742">A little while later, we realized that the documents in question had never been tabled in the House. In the opinion of the Bloc Québécois, and definitely in the opinion of the Conservative Party, the failure to table these documents is a breach of privilege. That is what I gathered from their question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594743">One thing, however, has not been mentioned enough. I think that the responsible thing to do is to exempt the Auditor General from being obliged to hand over the documents. After all, she is not the custodian of the government's documents. We would prefer to put more responsibility on the government and less on the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594744">Then, on September 26, the Speaker of the House ruled that the question of privilege concerning these documents, about the government and Sustainable Development Technology Canada, was a prima facie case of privilege. That is why the Conservative Party now wants to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594745">Like I said, it is a legitimate question, but let us not forget that this new agenda is considerably affecting the House's legislative agenda. I will say it again because I think it is important for people to understand this. I think it is a shame that this type of tactic is being used. I am afraid that the Conservative Party is taking advantage of this opportunity to monopolize the work of the House. That way, they can prove that Parliament has come to a standstill, that we are no longer able to move forward on issues, that nothing is working anymore and that an election must be called. Maybe that is part of their strategy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594746">I heard my Conservative colleague who spoke just before me say that the NDP and the Bloc Québécois need to join the Conservatives and call for a carbon tax election. We do not need to go very far from Parliament. We can just cross the river to Quebec and ask people there if they want a carbon tax election. I am not sure many people will say yes. That does not seem to be a priority for Quebeckers right now. Quebeckers have many other concerns besides that one. I am not saying that the Bloc Québécois is not ready for an election, but it should be about serious issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594747">What the Bloc Québécois has done is give the government an opportunity to deliver for Quebeckers. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> often says he wants to deliver for Canadians. We have given him an opportunity to truly deliver results, to make things better for Quebeckers. We have given him an opportunity to make things better not only for seniors in Quebec, but for seniors across Canada. If the government does not move forward on this file, we will have a good reason to bring it down, with the support of the other opposition parties, obviously. However, we are not going to bring down the government just because somebody woke up one morning and decided they wanted to become prime minister. That is not how it works. There need to be good reasons to bring down a government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594748">Let us come back to the issue before us. Parliament obviously has the power to compel documents from the government. That has been clearly established. The only limitation on the House's ability to compel the government to produce whatever information it deems necessary is the good judgment of the House, not the goodwill of the government. The government should have no reason not to produce the documents as demanded by the House. In June, the House was clear. It ordered the government to produce this series of documents. There may have been a lot of documents, and that may be what prevented the government from producing them, but the order was perfectly clear. The government did not respect it, and that is a breach of the House's privilege. That is what we need to address today. We want the Chair to examine this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594749">As I said earlier, the Bloc Québécois leader raised another point. The Conservative Party is taking advantage of this issue to go after the Auditor General. One thing must be perfectly clear: This is not about the Auditor General. She is a highly respected officer of Parliament. As elected officials, far from putting her between a rock and a hard place, our duty is to protect her from the government. The documents she had access to were meant for her performance audit and, we would point out, they belong to the government. The government's refusal to obey an order of the House has put the Auditor General in a difficult situation, to say the least. Obviously, the government is the one at fault. It is up to the government to hand over these documents to the House. The government alone, not the Auditor General, is the one violating the privilege of this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594750"> This is a serious issue, so we urge parliamentarians to treat it as such. I do not think that has been the guiding principle in the debates so far. In particular, I think it is important to avoid partisanship and sweeping accusations. We know that there may be good reason to think that Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, failed in its duty. There may be good reason to ask some serious questions about what went on. If there is any reason to believe that wrongdoing has occurred, then it should be investigated. At that point, it is not up to us to decide whether to move forward on this issue. If the RCMP wants to receive documents, great. It may not need the documents to conduct this type of investigation. When there is evidence of corruption, when it looks like taxpayers' money has been used dishonestly, this obviously needs to be investigated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594751">There is not much more to say on this subject. However, I can provide more detail about the mandate of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594752">It is an independent foundation created in 2001. Its mission is to support the growth and development of pre-commercial clean technology companies. It reports to the minister responsible for Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. Whistle-blowers started sounding the alarm in November 2022. They had concerns about how the foundation was managing public funds and human resources. They approached the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, which advised them to contact the Privy Council Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594753">The Privy Council Office then received a 300-page document from the whistle-blower group, laying out allegations dating back to February 2022. I want to go over a few dates. In October 2023, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> stated that he was going to commission the firm Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton to prepare a fact-finding report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594754">The fact-finding report identified a number of instances in which SDTC was not in full compliance with the contribution agreement made with the Department of Industry. As a result, the department sent SDTC an action plan to address the issues identified in the report and indicated that the action plan needed to be implemented by December 31, 2023. The department also requested the suspension of funding for all new projects until the action plan was implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594755">On November 1, 2023, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada announced that it would be conducting an audit on how SDTC was financing sustainable development technologies within the Department of Industry's portfolio. The Auditor General published that audit on June 4.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594756">In short, here is what we learned from the Auditor General's report. The Auditor General found that there were serious governance issues with the fund. That was quite clear. The main problems were the mismanagement of conflicts of interest and a lack of clarity surrounding the criteria for awarding grants. As I was awkwardly trying to say earlier, we can see that there has been wrongdoing here. The responsible thing to do is to get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594757">That said, the issue that concerns us now is as follows: When Parliament is seized of a matter like this and asks for documents to be tabled, the least the government can do is respect the will of the House and table those documents. It does not get any simpler than that.</ParaText>

I did not go over the entire chronology of events, but I know that several people involved in this matter have already appeared before certain House of Commons committees, including the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594761">The Conservative Party's motion is quite clear, calling for the matter to be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

Maybe that needs to be clarified. In any case, as I said earlier, we must get to the bottom of this.</ParaText>

These rights and immunities are integral to the work of parliamentarians and are required in order to protect members of Parliament, as well as the authority and dignity of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594794"> Individual rights of members include freedom of speech in the House of Commons and committees, freedom from arrest in civil actions, exemption from jury duty, exemption from being subpoenaed to attend court as a witness; and freedom from obstruction, interference and intimidation. Collective rights of the House of Commons include the right to discipline those found in breach of privilege or in contempt and to remove members for misconduct; to regulate its own internal affairs, including its debates, agenda and facilities; to maintain the attendance and service of its members; and to institute inquiries and demand papers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594795">These rights are extremely important, and when the collective or individual rights of members of Parliament are violated, it is so serious that all other work must cease. The reason we are here today is that the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House of Commons</Affiliation> found that the Liberal government violated the collective rights of members by refusing to produce documents that the House of Commons had ordered. As I mentioned, the House enjoys or should enjoy the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents that is not limited by statute. These powers are rooted in the Constitution Act 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594796"> Since the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker</Affiliation> agreed with Conservatives that our rights as parliamentarians have been breached, all business of the House has ceased. There will be no debate of government bills and no debate of private members' bills, because the issue is so important that it must take precedence over all other business, and because the Liberal government has refused to comply with the lawful order of the House of Commons. For the benefit of Canadians who may be watching at home, I will discuss how the motion came to be and why the House has been seized with the issue for months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594797"> Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a federally funded, non-profit fund that approved and distributed millions of dollars annually to small and medium-sized businesses in the clean-technology sector. The fund was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies that promote sustainable development. The fund managed to run without controversy for many years, that is until the Liberal government came to power and turned it into a green slush fund for its well-connected Liberal buddies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594798">The trouble began when former minister of innovation, science and industry Navdeep Bains and his Liberal colleagues handpicked the board members and chair, who went on to spend $1 billion of taxpayer funds. This flagrant disregard for taxpayer dollars and blatant corruption flew under the radar for many years. It was thanks to the work of Conservatives on various parliamentary committees, but especially the industry and technology committee, that the scandal came to light and was fully investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594799"> In February 2023, the allegations surrounding financial mismanagement and ethical lapses first came to light in the form of a complaint from a group of employees at the fund. The Government of Canada responded by conducting an internal investigation, which found several issues with how the fund was managed. Parliamentary hearings began at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594800">The Auditor General of Canada first began to look into the allegations a short while later, in November 2023, and issued a damning report earlier this year. She found that 186 conflicts of interest had occurred, meaning that the board of directors and the chair had hand-picked where funding was going on. Some of the funding went to their own companies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594801"> The Auditor General took only a sampling of the funding and found that 82% of that sample was in conflicts of interest totalling $330 million. The Auditor General also found that SDTC did not follow conflict of interest policies in 90 separate cases, spending nearly $76 million on projects connected to the Liberals' friends appointed to run the fund, $59 million on projects that were not allowed or had been awarded any money, and $12 million on projects that were both a conflict of interest and ineligible for funding. In one instance, the hand-picked chair of the fund gave a shocking $217,000 to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594802">Canadians at home might be wondering how this could possibly happen. How could the Liberal-appointed board of the SDTC misappropriate such a large amount in tax dollars? How could the board possibly have so many conflicts? I will explain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594803"> Every single dollar that was disbursed by the billion-dollar green slush fund had to be approved by the board of directors. The members of the board of directors would declare their conflicts when they happened to arise; at the beginning of a meeting, those conflicts were declared. The trouble is that, in many cases, a director would stay in the room, or in some cases they would leave the room, while members were voting to give funds to their own projects. This is, of course, a completely absurd way to run a fund, and it led to these members' willfully and purposely enriching themselves and the value of their companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594804">One egregious example of the scenario is when a member of the board, Andrée-Lise Méthot, who runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital, received $114 million in grants from the green slush fund while she was sitting on the board. Her company's value tripled during her time on the board at SDTC because the receipt of the funds lent an untold amount of legitimacy to her company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594805">Another shocking tidbit from the example is that Cycle Capital's in-house paid lobbyist was none other than the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. He lobbied the PMO and the industry department 25 times while he was the paid lobbyist for Cycle Capital. Ms. Méthot then went on after her time at SDTC to become a board member at the Canada Infrastructure Bank, where she gave a handsome gift of $170 million in Infrastructure Bank money to a company owned by the chair of SDTC, Annette Verschuren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594806">I will now turn to Ms. Verschuren's conflicts, which are a second shocking example of the corruption that took place under the Liberal government's watch. Annette Verschuren was appointed to the chair of the green slush fund by former minister of industry Navdeep Bains after he had removed the previous chair, Jim Balsillie, given the latter's public criticism of the Liberal government's privacy legislation. Mr. Baines proposed Annette Verschuren, an entrepreneur who was receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies, as a replacement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594807">The minister, the Prime Minister's office and the Privy Council Office were warned of the risks associated with appointing a chair with so many conflicts of interest, and they were told that the fund had never had a chair with interest in companies receiving funding from SDTC. In 2019, Mr. Baines proceeded with the appointment of Ms. Verschuren despite repeated warnings expressed to his office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594808">Ms. Verschuren sat in on and moved two motions to funnel $38.5 million out the door in COVID relief payments, payments that went out the door in contravention of the contribution agreements that SDTC had with ISED or Industry Canada. Not only did $38.5 million inappropriately go out the door in these COVID relief payments, but $220,000 was also funnelled into Ms. Verschuren's own company, of which she was the CEO, founder, majority shareholder and sole director. She moved a motion and voted on sending $220,000 to her own company. Just recently, Ms. Verschuren was found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner of breaking ethics laws. In his report, the Ethics Commissioner stated that Ms. Verschuren “improperly furthered the interests of the beneficiaries of SDTC funding to companies associated with those accelerators.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8594809">These are just two examples of the shocking revelations uncovered by the Auditor General, the Ethics Commissioner and my Conservative colleagues. According to the Auditor General, nine directors accounted for the 186 conflicts. I will remind members of the House that this fund had run well, by all accounts, until the Liberal government came into power and turned it into a slush fund.</ParaText>

This week, they are on Parliament Hill to raise awareness about the challenges faced by the more than six million Canadians living with arthritis. They embody the spirit of advocacy that is so vital in the fight against this pervasive disease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594855">Arthritis is often misunderstood as an ailment of older people, but half the people affected are under 65, including around 25,000 children. Arthritis is the most common chronic disease in Canada. It is estimated that the number will rise to nine million Canadians, or one in four, by 2040. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8594856">The debilitating pain limits mobility, hampers productivity and, sadly, can lead to isolation and have an impact on mental health. There is no cure for arthritis, but we can make a difference and help improve the lives of those suffering from it by working together to build a healthier future for all Canadians. This includes reducing wait times for diagnosis and treatment and improving access to care.</ParaText>

In terms of a criminal prosecution, the way it normally unfolds is that the police seek a search warrant from a judge and the judge evaluates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the charter interests at stake in getting documents, something about which that party cares not. Second, we have a fundamental premise called police independence. We safeguard it in Canada. Who does not safeguard it? It is authoritarian regimes.

              <ParaText id="8595103">Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a question of privilege arising from some very disturbing events that occurred just outside this place over the weekend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595104">On Saturday, the Parliamentary Protective Service, which you are responsible for and provide policy direction to, imposed an ideological test for entry onto the grounds of Parliament Hill. According to a video posted online, a visitor is seen being denied access because he was “not a supporter of Palestine” and does “not recognize Palestine as a state”. The visitor, of course, was denied access to Parliament Hill for the sole reason that he did not hold a political opinion considered acceptable to whoever approved this requirement for entry. To my knowledge, that is the first time that access to Parliament has been subjected to a screening of political points of view, at least documented as such.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595105"> Parliament is the beating heart of Canadian democracy. It is where Canadians often come to exercise one of the most cherished constitutional rights guaranteed to them under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and freedom of expression. Therefore, to cherry-pick that point of view, as expressed on Parliament Hill, is simply not consistent with Canadian values. It should be made clear that this is in no way directed at the officer, but a question on the policy direction that you, the Speaker, are responsible for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595106">It should also be made clear that the very fact that anyone cannot access Parliament Hill because of an opinion they hold, or worse that they cannot be trusted to be in the same place as someone who holds an entirely different opinion, is a stain on the state of our country and demonstrates the divisiveness that has been allowed to fester here. This is a country that has seen hate crimes rise 250% since 2015. It is a country that has seen lawlessness and the mob rule our streets. If two groups of people who have opposing views cannot enter at the same time to express those views in one place, what has become of this country? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595107">Conservatives believe that Parliament Hill must be safe and secure while remaining open and accessible to all, including those who are peacefully protesting. All points of view from all Canadians should be heard. That is their constitutional right, regardless of whether those opinions are politically fashionable among the elites. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595108">The litmus test of recognizing a Palestinian state as the key to enter is, in fact, also the position of the Government of Canada and many Canadian allies. I am not sure what that was all about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595109">Had Conservative members of Parliament sought to access the House of Commons, our place of work, on Saturday, we would have been denied access because we would not or could not have satisfied that ideological test, even though members are free to access the parliamentary precinct. That is a well-established privilege of Parliament. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595116"> Joseph Maingot makes the simple point, in his <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, second edition, at page 176, that “No impediment should be placed on the Member in going about his parliamentary business, whether in the House, on his way to the House, or while on his way home.” Further down on the same page, he wrote, “Since Parliament Hill has always been a public place, restricting the movement of the general public on the grounds would probably be considered excessive.” To punctuate that point, he added footnote 47, which reads, “There was little if any restriction on the grounds of Parliament Hill even during the 1970 October Crisis.”</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Your Committee believes that the main problem in connection with security in Parliament is to strike a reasonable balance between the importance of allowing the public ready access to the House of Commons on the one hand and the necessity of preserving the security of the House on the other. Your Committee was governed at all times by the belief that Parliament should not be isolated from the people as a result of exaggerated security measures and that it is important in a democratic society that members of Parliament should continue to have direct communication with the public. Consequently your Committee has concluded that whatever security measures are provided...must be reasonable and consistent with the right of the public to come to Parliament.... It is not easy to reconcile these two imperatives but your Committee feels that the balance should always be in favour of permitting the public reasonable and proper access to Parliament...without intruding in any obvious way on the undoubted rights of citizens to approach their Parliament. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595119"> That sounds like common sense to me. Canadians, who elect us, have a right to come to Parliament and make their voices heard, yet it seems they have been chucked out the window in favour of the shocking news that ideological purity tests are now needed to access Parliament Hill, which is a very high impediment being imposed. Conservative MPs, even some Liberal MPs and many Canadians would fail to pass these ideological tests. Blocking politicians, especially opposition politicians, from accessing the legislature to which they were elected to plainly represent their constituents is undemocratic and unCanadian. It is the sort of thing that dictatorships do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595120">To be sure, I am not going to lay any blame on the constable who was seen in the video. Indeed, I do not hold any single frontline member of this service responsible. They would have simply been following directions decided much higher up. Conjuring up political ideological tests for accessing Parliament is not something we would expect any single constable to have simply freelanced, so it certainly comes from somewhere. </ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595125"> Beyond the matter of any policy directions that you may or may not have given, Mr. Speaker, it is important to understand that section 79.55 of the act vests responsibility of “physical security services throughout the parliamentary precinct and Parliament Hill”, delivered by the PPS, in the RCMP. In fact, the director of the PPS is required by subsection 79.56(2) of the act to be a member of the RCMP. Subsection 5(1) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act makes quite clear that the Liberal cabinet appoints the RCMP's top boss, the commissioner, “who, under the direction of the Minister, has the control and management of the Force and all matters connected with the Force.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595126">At the end of the day, this boils down to one essential question: Was the direction to require the Parliamentary Protective Service to apply a political litmus test to anyone seeking access to Parliament Hill this past weekend a general policy direction that you approved, Mr. Speaker, or was it the direction of the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> in relation to his control of the RCMP, which is responsible for physical security on the Hill? No matter how we cut it or which Liberal made the decision, ideological tests for political points of view are shocking and unacceptable and are an impediment to members of Parliament, who must have free and ready access to the parliamentary precinct at all times, not to mention all Canadians, who should be able to come to the Hill at all times for all issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595143">This January, the Federal Court made a landmark ruling finding that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal government illegally invoked the Emergencies Act and used it to violate Canadians' most essential constitutional rights to freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression. The Conservatives believe that the Liberals must answer for the government's reckless abandonment of the law and the most basic freedoms of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595144">That is why the Conservatives wanted to call several Liberal ministers before our committee to account for their decisions, as well as ordering them to return over the legal opinion that the government claimed to rely upon for its illegal and unconstitutional decisions. Regrettably, efforts for accountability over one of the most serious decisions any government could ever make were frequently resisted by our Liberal colleagues, backed by independent Senators, so that we still have not been able to get to the truth at committee. We fear this could be a foreboding signal of what is to come given our committee's final report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595145">The decision to invoke the Emergencies Act was unnecessary from the start. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> caused this crisis by dividing people. He proceeded to violate the charter and illegally suppress Canadian citizens. Since then, the government has desperately tried to defend its actions, lying to the public by saying that the police asked the government to invoke the act, something the RCMP and the Ottawa police have both denied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595146">If a Conservative government is elected, we will ensure that the Emergencies Act can never again be used to silence political opposition, because common-sense Conservatives will protect the charter rights of Canadians and unite our country and our people for hope and freedom.</ParaText>

Particularly, there is a proposed new expansion that is often mistakenly referred to as high-speed rail.

The petitioners point out the Windsor-Quebec corridor is the most lucrative part of Via Rail's network and that 70% of Via Rail's revenue comes from these corridor services. The petitioners point out that this would, effectively, gut Via Rail and negatively affect passenger rail service across Canada. </ParaText>

It is simply unbelievable that senior ISED officials who report directly to the Minister of Innovation said nothing while witnessing how millions of dollars was funnelled to companies in which board members held active conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595173"> In response to these damning findings, in June, Conservatives put forward a motion calling on the government to provide documents pertaining to SDTC to the House. The motion included provisions for those documents to be provided to the RCMP so that it could undertake an investigation on whether criminal offences were committed. I will explain why it is necessary for the House to turn over these documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595174"> As part of her investigation, the Auditor General conducted a governance audit of SDTC. She did not conduct a criminal investigation, which could explain why no criminal intent was identified.

In response to the motion, many of the Liberal government's departments either refused the House's order or redacted documents that were turned over, citing provisions in the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act. In response to this blatant disregard for the powers and privileges of the House of Commons, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> brought forward a question of privilege, arguing that the rights of parliamentarians had been breached. The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> agreed that the House has the unequivocal right to order the production of papers and found that there was a clear case of violation of the privileges of parliamentarians. Conservatives will continue to seek the truth about the $390 million that has gone to Liberal insiders through this green slush fund. On the other side of the House, the Liberals are opposing the production order for documents to be turned over to the RCMP; it appears that they are not concerned about such a flagrant misuse of funds. </ParaText>

There is a possibility it could be criminal. For Canadians watching, I would like to lay out why this debate is so important and how we ended up here. I am here today to discuss the ruling of the <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House of Commons</Affiliation> with regard to the production of documents ordered by the House on the Liberal scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, or as it has quickly become better known, the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund. This agency was created to invest in innovative, environmentally friendly technologies here in Canada, but under Liberal governance and management, it became a hotbed of corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595220">The reason for the debate today is simple: The Liberals refused to follow the will of Parliament after the Auditor General of Canada, the Ethics Commissioner and whistle-blowers uncovered clear and widespread corruption that favoured Liberal insiders. The issues all began in 2018, when the Liberals pushed out the existing chair of SDTC because he was critical of government legislation. This is another example of how the Liberals do not want independent voices around them. They only want their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595221">The Liberal industry minister at the time, Navdeep Bains, chose to appoint a new chair, an entrepreneur who was already receiving government funding through one of her companies. It was revealed that the Liberals were warned internally of the risks associated with appointing an obviously conflicted chair. They were told that up until that point, the fund had never had a chair with interests in companies receiving funding. The Liberals appointed her anyway. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and “managed by board members”. This is as described by the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595222"> Board members went on to award SDTC funding to companies in which board members held stock or positions. Liberal minister Bains went on to appoint two other controversial board members who engaged in unethical behaviour in obvious breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes. Department officials witnessed 186 conflicts at the board, but they did not intervene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595223">In January 2021, the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> replaced Minister Bains. In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices they saw at SDTC. In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, forcing the Liberal industry minister to suspend SDTC funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595224">In November 2023, the Auditor General started to conduct an audit of the governance of SDTC. Here is how the Auditor General of Canada found Canadian tax dollars were used by the Liberal-appointed members of the SDTC board: Many approved projects were found to be either, one, ineligible for funding; two, a conflict of interest; or, three, both. The Auditor General found that $58 million went to 10 ineligible projects that, on occasions, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology, and that the Liberal-appointed SDTC board approved $334 million, over 186 cases, to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. This is really quite unbelievable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595225">The Auditor General found that the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal ministers. There are a few points I want to make here. The Auditor General gave SDTC a clean bill of health in 2017. It was only after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked Liberal board members were appointed that the fund began voting itself absurd amounts of taxpayer dollars. The government will say that SDTC was at arm's length, but SDTC was not at arm's length from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595226">The minister recommends board appointments, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, ISED, has senior department officials sitting in every meeting monitoring the activities of the board. It is unbelievable that a senior department official said nothing while witnessing hundreds of millions of dollars being funnelled to companies in which board members held active conflicts of interest. Are the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, Liberal-appointed board members, and senior government officials all inept, complicit, corrupt or all of the above?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595227">Another point is that as part of their investigation, the Auditor General conducted a governance audit at SDTC. She did not conduct a criminal investigation, which could explain why no criminal intent has been identified so far. However, the whistle-blower has told the public accounts committee that he is confident that if the documents are turned over to the RCMP, criminal intent will be identified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595228">Is this perhaps the reason the government has redacted documents and refused to turn them over to the RCMP: to prevent criminal intent from being identified? The Liberals touted themselves before the 2015 election, saying that they would be a transparent government. Why are the Liberals fighting so hard to not bring to light what has occurred? How bad is it and what are they trying to hide?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595229">What makes the actions of the board of directors of SDTC so egregious is that when someone receives a Governor in Council appointment, as a person appointed by the government and entrusted to oversee taxpayer money, they are not to personally profit from their work on a committee, as a Governor in Council appointee, and neither is their family. However, that is exactly what happened, from the Liberal-appointed chair to other appointed board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595230">In a five-year period, there were 405 transactions approved by the board. The Auditor General sampled 226 transactions, only about half of them, and found that 186 of the 226 transactions were conflicted. That is 82%, which represents the $330 million. Statistically speaking, if the Auditor General were to look at all 400 transactions, the rest are probably just as conflicted. The 400 transactions at 82% potentially represent $832 million of taxpayer money. Is that why the Liberals are so desperate to not turn over unredacted documents to the RCMP?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595231">This is the level of corruption that brings down careers and governments. All of the revelations of what we know so far confirm what Canadians already know about the Liberal government: It is wasteful with the tax dollars of Canadians. Just look at the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lavish vacations, tens of billions in corporate welfare or the arrive scam. The government prefers to reward Liberal insiders at the expense of everyday Canadians.</ParaText>

The minister shut the entire agency down, which forced Parliament to step in to ensure that proper authorities could get to the bottom of the corruption. On June 10, the House adopted a motion calling for the production of various documents related to STDC to be turned over to the RCMP for review. It will be up to the RCMP to launch an investigation, but Canadians cannot trust the Liberals to provide the documents to the RCMP, so Parliament ordered them to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595238">It is a founding pillar of our democracy that Parliament remains sovereign. What the House votes for must happen, and this is what Canadians expect. It is how our system works. However, in response to the motion adopted, government departments either outright refused the House order or substantially redacted documents. Nothing in the House order contemplated redactions. The House has the absolute and unfettered power and authority to order the production of documents. That is not limited by statute; the powers are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595241">This is not the first time that Liberals have tried to deny the will of Parliament. The Liberals prorogued Parliament in the middle of a scandal investigation of the WE Charity issue in order to prevent that investigation from being completed. The Liberals violated the privilege of the House when Parliament explicitly demanded unredacted documents relating to the firing of two scientists at the Winnipeg lab, the National Microbiology Laboratory, reportedly involving national security concerns. The Liberals even took the unprecedented step of suing their own Speaker to block the release of those documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595242">Conservatives are the ones who exposed those scandals, and Conservatives will ensure that the Liberals comply with the order of the House to provide the SDTC documents directly to the RCMP and that they are unredacted so they can be investigated properly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595243"> The conclusion of their own Speaker could not have been clearer: “The procedural precedents and authorities are abundantly clear. The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any and all documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.” How will the Liberals choose to respond this time? Will they continue to hold up the work of Parliament by extending the debate into their own violation of House rules when it could be ended immediately by simply providing the documents, as a majority of the House has requested? Will they drag the office of the Speaker to court once again to delay these matters?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595244">They were forced to drop their lawsuit the last time they did this to try to stop documents from being released, but will they do this to delay information coming to light before an election? Will there be a similar scenario to what happened in 2021, when the Public Health Agency of Canada was found in contempt of Parliament for refusing to hand over documents related to the firing of two high-security virus scientists at Winnipeg's National Microbiology Lab over leaks to the regime of China during their time?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595245">Will the Liberals prorogue Parliament, as has been whispered in the halls, to hold off being accountable for the mismanagement of government? Proroguing would wipe not just the current debate; it would wipe the work of our committees studying serious issues like labour, persons with disabilities and housing. It would destroy legislation not passed. As a reminder, the Liberals prorogued Parliament in 2020 to stop the pressing investigation into the WE Charity scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595246">Over the past nine years, for all the secrecy and the extreme lengths the Liberal government has gone to with attempts to hide information and documents on scandals during their watch, the information always seems to find a way to eventually come to light, whether through access to information requests, through whistle-blowers, through arm's-length agencies or through offices like that of the ombudsman, the Ethics Commissioner, the Parliamentary Budget Officer or the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595247">If the Liberals do not trust the current Parliament, there is only one solution: a new Parliament after a carbon tax election to let Canadians decide whether the Liberals' wasteful, unethical mismanagement should continue. Canadians can decide whether they want to continue to pay for an ever-increasing carbon tax. Canadians can decide whether they wish to continue with the revolving door of violent repeat offenders, or a return to jail, not bail for those who terrorize our communities with repeat violent crimes. Canadians can decide whether they want to continue to see more money spent on fewer housing starts, or a Conservative plan to build more homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595248">Canadians asked Conservatives to clean up the ethical mess of the last Liberal government and its sponsorship scandal.

              <ParaText id="8595278">Indeed, that is the problem. We are rising today because, for the umpteenth time, this government is having ethics issues, even corruption issues. Worse still, the government is defying an order of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595279">I will quickly lay out the case. On June 10, we submitted a request for the RCMP to gain access to documents concerning a financial scandal. On September 26, the Speaker ruled that since the documents requested had not been properly tabled, the organization had to make the information public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595280">Here we are again in a situation where an order of the House and the will of parliamentarians are being challenged. The public service is not producing the documents, and it has the full support and backing of the government. What are we talking about? We are talking about a green fund to improve the quality of the air, the quality of life and the quality of the environment in Canada. In that respect, the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, or SDTC, clearly has very good objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595281">The fund allocates $100 million a year to companies as long as they invest it to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution for all Canadians and improve the quality of the environment. We have no problem with that. When we were in government, we supported that project. The then auditor general audited this Crown corporation in 2017 and gave it a clean bill of health. There were no issues. Unfortunately, people were appointed under this government, and that is when the issues really started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595282">We are talking about ethical problems. The government appointed managers and members of the board of directors. Through SDTC, these people were giving their own businesses subsidies. This is obviously a conflict of interest. Some might say that they could have left, but that would have been called a revolving door. Had they left the board of directors during a vote, we would have been talking about revolving doors rather than empty chairs, because there were so many of them. Ultimately, if the chairs are empty, perhaps we should fill them with people who are not in a position of conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595283">Unfortunately, this is what was happening for years. It was a modus operandi. When a person is not too sure about something, but they get away with it the first time, the second time and even the tenth time, then it becomes the norm. Unfortunately, that is what we have seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595284">First, an anonymous whistle-blower informed the media of problems at SDTC. Immediately, we began asking questions and we brought up the major ethical issues within that organization in the House. We dug a little deeper, talked to people, obtained information, asked questions and did our job as parliamentarians, which led the Auditor General to conduct a proper audit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595285">She combed through all the contracts awarded through the lens of how public funds were managed. We are not talking about criminal activity here. The Auditor General's job was to ensure that the money was managed properly. There was no question of a police investigation at the time. It was simply a financial matter. The Auditor General's findings were terrible for this government, for that organization and for the people who were appointed by this government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595286">In all, we are talking about 186 situations of direct conflict of interest. We are talking about nearly $400 million of taxpayer money that was not managed properly. That is a lot of money. Let us get into the details of what this might look like. We are talking about $58 million that was allocated to 10 ineligible projects, some of which could not even demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595287">For the past two years, I have had the privilege of being a member of the shadow cabinet. Our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton, the leader of the official opposition, honoured me with his confidence by appointing me the shadow minister of the environment and climate change, a position I am very happy with. I have met around 400 environmental groups since I have been here. I am no better than anyone else. I do my job. It is my job to meet people, as it certainly is the case for the Speaker. There is a reason she has been here for some time now. I do not want to be ageist, but it is due to her merits, which is to her credit. As for me, I have been here for 16 years and there is a good reason for that, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595288">I was saying that I meet with a lot of environmental groups. I always ask them what they could have done with $58 million for projects that produce results instead of projects of no demonstrable benefit to the environment or green technology development. They could do a lot with that money. When I want to twist the knife a little more, I tell them about the Volkswagen project in Ontario. I ask them what they could have done to save the planet with the $18 billion that was given away to a multinational corporation. They came up with quite a few good ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595289">Getting back to the case of SDTC, $58 million was awarded to 10 ineligible projects, and $334 million was divvied up in 186 cases to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. That is exactly what not to do. Some will say that it takes people who know how environmental businesses operate to make decisions about environmental businesses. The instinct is then to pick people from environmental companies, but that is a mistake. That is not how it works, because naturally, an approach like that puts these people in a conflict of interest. That is what the government failed or refused to understand when it appointed these people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595290"> I doubt anyone wakes up in the morning and decides they are going to defraud the system. I tend to assume that people are acting in good faith. It is a bit like what I was saying earlier. The first time, the person might hesitate, but they get away with it. They may do it another 10 times and still not be sure, but they get away with it again. After 186 times, they still may not be sure, but they keep getting away with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595291">That is why the people appointed to a board of directors should not be placeholders, as they are called in the industry. Those who know a little about the world of public administration know that there are quite a few placeholders on boards of directors. This is also true in the world of private administration. People say they are so proud to be appointed to the board of such-and-such a company. They go to meetings two or three times a month. If they are placeholder directors, they spend the required amount of time sitting on a committee and then leave. However, others do a really good job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595292">I recently met a businessperson who told me that he was very impressed with another businessperson who was a member of his board of directors. He told me that every time that person asked a question it was a “killer question” because it was not easy. Those are people who were appointed based on their skills and their independence, and who are able to make effective decisions that benefit everyone. It is clear that is not what happened at SDTC where they appointed people who were clearly in permanent situations of conflict of interest. The thing to do in that case would be to appoint different people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595293">Thousands of Canadians know how to run businesses. Institutions, universities train people to do that. A colleague was talking to me about that recently. He told me that he took a course to be a director of a company. Yes, there is a course for that. Yes, people go to school for that. Yes, there is a diploma for that. There are thousands of Canadians who are ready to do this service for the government and who will not be in perpetual conflict of interest, as we have seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595294">We are talking about $58 million that was allocated to projects that did not meet the terms of the contribution agreement. Meanwhile, a public servant said in a telephone call that this was complete incompetence on the part of this government. What is more, in her report, the Auditor General did not go easy on the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>. She said that he did not sufficiently monitor compliance with the contribution agreements, and we know how that turned out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595295">That is how we ended up in this mess. Why are we talking about it in the House today? It is because of the issue of documents. As I said in my introduction, we moved a motion that was adopted by a majority here in the House, with the support and assistance of the Bloc Québécois and the NDP. We are very happy about that. We thank them, of course, on behalf of Canadians. A majority of members in the House are demanding that we get to the bottom of this and allow the RCMP to put this organization under police scrutiny to determine exactly what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595296">Why are we going to such lengths? Of course, it is not easy, but at the same time, it has to be done, because the person who blew the whistle on this situation internally said the following when he appeared before a parliamentary committee: </ParaText>

It should never have taken two years for the issues to reach this point. What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year.... I know that the federal government, like the minister, has continued saying that there was no criminal intent and nothing was found, but I think the committee would agree that they're not to be trusted on this situation. I would happily agree to whatever the findings are by the RCMP, but I would say that I wouldn't trust that there isn't any criminality unless the RCMP is given full authority to investigate.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8595307">This brings back some rather powerful memories for me. I was at the centre of the action when these events occurred. This is not the first time that an entity has sought to withhold documents on a sensitive issue. We all recall the very murky story of the Winnipeg lab. I remember it quite well, because at that time, I had the great privilege, honour and pleasure of being the House leader of the official opposition. The extraordinarily clever and amiable team at the office of the House leader of the official opposition and I led the charge for truth and transparency. I would remind the House that the Winnipeg lab affair happened right in the middle of the pandemic. Scientists had slipped out of sight overnight. These scientists came from the country ruled by the dictatorship in Beijing, and they also worked with those people. We had a thousand questions about that. We had a duty as parliamentarians to get to the bottom of the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595308">Unfortunately, through its representatives, the Winnipeg lab refused to comply with the order of the House to testify and produce the documents we were requesting. Since they did not comply, in a rare moment in the history of our Parliament, one of the senior officials from the Winnipeg lab was summoned to the entrance of this chamber to be admonished by the House. I did not take that lightly. As a parliamentarian, it is my duty and the duty of us all to take action and get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595309">Here we are again today facing the same situation. Our constituents honour us by giving us the mandate to ensure that the taxes Canadians pay are put to proper use. I would remind my colleagues that none of the GST that Canadians paid today will go toward services or programs. All of it will go to support the colossal debt racked up by the current government. I may be digressing a little from this evening's topic of discussion. However, since we are here to talk about public finances, that fact needs to stay front of mind. This scandal broke, and unfortunately, it was only one more in a very long, despicable and sorry list chalked up by this scandal-ridden government.</ParaText>

The Prime Minister had no other choice because the people at WE Charity were in so much trouble. The only way the government could put an end to the investigation was to prorogue the House. That ended the investigation and marked a fresh start. There was the WE Charity scandal, and then there was ArriveCAN. Hundreds of millions of dollars was spent on that pitiful app, which, in the end, was used for a matter of months. It could have been done at a fraction of the cost.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8595346">Madam Speaker, today, we find ourselves in an incredible mess. I have been around this place for some time, and I can tell members that it is rare for a government to be so blatantly obvious in protecting those who have engaged in outright corruption. One would wonder this: What drives this unbelievable motivation to ensure that the evidence on the corruption that has been uncovered by committee members, followed by the Auditor General and now the RCMP looking into this, is not released? I do not know, but I have known folks who have been guilty and wanted to hide evidence. I am a dad, and I have been there. I asked my son when he was younger, “Kyler, did you eat a cookie that you weren't supposed to?” Well, he immediately backs up and moves into the corner, where there is evidence of the cookie crumbs, trying to hide them. The government reminds me very much of my four-year-old child trying to hide the crumbs, the evidence of the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595347">The government has been in power for nine years, and over its nine years, it has engaged in many different things that were found to be corrupt. Obviously, lining the pockets of Liberal insiders has become what the Liberals are known for. What is increasingly devastating is the fact that this behaviour just keeps happening again and again. It seems as though they get caught once and they say, “Well, now we know how to do this, and we will do it a bit better next time. Maybe we can do it in such a way that we don't get caught.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595348">The Liberals have decided, after having been found out and found guilty for so many different things, that the tools of government should now be used to simply cover the evidence. We have seen this before. We saw it when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty of having accepted an illegal vacation; there were attempts to cover the evidence. We have seen this time and time again with the government; the Liberals have decided that the best way to defend themselves is by trying to hide the cookie crumbs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595349">This scandal is unprecedented in recent history. This is $400 million of taxpayers' money that was handed out. The Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest, meaning that the people who were doling out the money were in conflict. They would be benefiting themselves personally with the money they were handing out. These people were appointed by and, in many cases, good friends of the Liberal Party. However, rather than saying, “You caught us. We're going to come clean”, now the government says, “We're going to stop at nothing, including ensuring that this institution isn't able to do what it must constitutionally be able to do.” That is to demand the evidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595350">This did not just happen in the last number of weeks. As a matter of fact, the government has had some time. All the parties of the House, except for the Liberals, voted to ensure that this documentation, the evidence, would be released to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595351">Now, the government claims that this would be a massive charter violation, which is its new defence. It is completely laughable. Every student of history should know, or does know, that the charter is there to protect Canadians from the government, not to protect the government from Canadians. Canadians deserve, through their Parliament, to be able to demand that evidence be brought forward; that is one of the rights and responsibilities of the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595352"> Constitutionally, it is our responsibility to hold the government to account on behalf of taxpayers. Our number one job as parliamentarians is to oversee the spending and the misspending of government. Our members found the misappropriation of funds. The Auditor General, having reviewed that, found 186 conflicts of interest, $400 million that was given to members, Liberal appointees. They gave the money, nearly $400 million, to companies that those individuals were actually part owners of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595353">Imagine that. At a time when millions of Canadians are lined up at food banks because of the policies of the Liberal-NDP government, with millions of Canadians unable to feed their kids, individuals who were appointed by the Liberal-NDP government were lining their own pockets to the tune of $400 million. It is unbelievable. Now the government says that the evidence the Auditor General found, which the government has in its possession, should not be handed over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595354">We have talked a lot about the numbers, 186 conflicts of interest and nearly $400 million that has been handed out inappropriately to line Liberal insiders' pockets. What is startling is that there were just spot audits; there was not a full audit of the program. As a matter of fact, when they went through and just chose individual grants and contributions, they did not even get to half of them. What they found was that 82% of those they reviewed were in conflict and were ineligible, in many cases, to even have the money distributed to those particular programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595355">Imagine an 82% failure rate, an 82% corruption rate. Imagine if they had done an audit of the entire program. We would see that the number would have been significantly higher if the entire program had been audited.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Chris Warkentin:</B> Madam Speaker, I hear some Liberals say that it is nothing. I do remember when governments worried about every dollar, dime, nickel and penny that was spent to ensure that they got the best return for the people from whom the money had been taken. It is unbelievable that we have now gotten to a point where $400 million here or a billion dollars there goes into the ether and Canadians live in a more difficult and precarious place than they have in over a decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595372">When we look at the stats about the last decade that have been released over the last number of months, we see an incredible story that is heartbreaking to anyone who wants to cheer for this country. The gross domestic product per capita has nearly stagnated over a decade in this country. In the past, Canada's GDP has always kept pace with that of the United States, as our economies are so closely aligned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595373">We have general commodities that have always been closely aligned to the United States. We have products that they want. They have economies and production of the products that we produce, so there have been a lot of reasons that for nearly a century, our economies have stayed relatively aligned. When theirs goes up, ours goes up, and when theirs goes down, ours goes down. We have always been pretty much linked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595374">However, over a decade, it has been incredible to watch the stats as our GDP per capita has stagnated while the Americans' has grown by nearly 20%. That has amounted to the average worker in Canada versus the average worker in the United States having a differential of $20,000 in buying power when all things are considered, including the value of our dollar. There has never been such a spread since the Second World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595375"> We have not only seen our people being paid less over the last decade, but we have also seen unprecedented growth in the price of our food, housing and utilities, our gas and electricity, in this country. What we have now is a situation where, under the NDP-Liberal government, life has become difficult for everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595376">What the government often likes to say is that there are winners and losers in the economy and we just have to balance it out. However, when we look at the entire size of the pie divided by the number of people who need to eat that pie, everybody's slice in this country has gotten smaller over the last decade—</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Chris Warkentin:</B> Madam Speaker, now a member of the NDP is yelling at me, saying that this is capitalism. That is what it is. What is incredible is that it has been under the co-operation with the NDP that we have seen the reduction in the size of the pie and the amount that each person gets to eat. The experiment has gone completely off the rails.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595379"> It has been unbelievable to watch the New Democrats agree time and time again, even as they see the evidence of everybody having to live with less. The New Democrats cheer it on and keep supporting it. New Democrats continue to see the people who live within their communities struggle more and more. What the New Democrats have done time and time again is double down. They say, “Tax the people more. Take more from the people who live on limited incomes.” What the NDP has been cheerleading for is an increase, a quadrupling, of the carbon tax in this country.</ParaText>

The average person who has to pay the bills is paying more. Why is everyone paying more and getting less?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595382"> It is because of the very few who are getting ahead and getting more. They are the Liberal insiders, the folks who are getting the $400-million payouts. This is unprecedented in this country. There was a time when Canadians would not stand for that and when their representatives in the House would not stand for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595383">However, the New Democrats are claiming that they are there for the small guy. They, number one, endorsed the program of giving massive corporate handouts to large multinational corporations. They have supported that again and again under the government. So much of the money that is being collected in higher taxes is being funnelled here to Ottawa, only to be distributed amongst those people who are most closely connected to the Liberal Party, those who have the greatest lobbyists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595384"> There is $21 billion of the money being sent to Ottawa on an annual basis that is going to Liberal insiders and consultants in the government. Imagine that. When we talk about $400 million in the program and the Liberals' refusing to turn over the evidence, having been found guilty of 186 conflicts of interest, as well as the many cases where the individuals who got money were not even eligible for the program, we know that it is just the tip of the iceberg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595385">It is heartbreaking to watch people struggle from coast to coast. I have heard, time and time again, that people just wonder where the money has gone. They are paying more and getting less. They are working hard and not getting ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595386"> We now have the evidence of what was happening. The audit was an administrative one. In 82% of the spot audits that were done, the government was found to be in violation. What has not been done yet is a criminal audit. That is why it is essential that the documentation that the government is withholding from the RCMP be released to the RCMP. If anybody is ever going to be held accountable for theft at this level, it will be because the RCMP was able to do its work.</ParaText>

The government has used the protection of cabinet confidences to keep it out of legal trouble in the past.

              <ParaText id="8595408">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech, but after listening to all this today, I cannot help but think that there is something wrong with the entire federal system. Let me explain. If the government keeps interfering this much in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction or refuses to grant the transfers requested by Quebec and the provinces, for example in health care, we are headed straight for disaster with the fiscal imbalance, which is plunging Quebec and the provinces into a much more difficult financial situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595409">Another question in this debate has to do with what the government is doing with our money. For example, our money is being put into this foundation, which has turned out to be a failure, somewhere our money should not have been invested. The problem is that it has not worked for a long time. I will give an example. From 2002 to 2013, an expert study was conducted on federal interference in the health and social services sector, a sector that is crucial right now and that needs these transfers badly. It was finally proven that, during the years when the Conservatives were in power, 37 federal programs interfered in health care. The government is trying to interfere in certain areas of jurisdiction, but it is not transferring the necessary funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595410">I am not sure where this federal system is taking us. Frankly, in recent years, we have seen governments come and go, yet the situation remains problematic. It does not change. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595411">Madam Speaker, there is no question that we have seen the most centralizing government under the NDP-Liberals over the last nine years. It has been noted that it is not just the Government of Quebec fighting the government. Again and again, provincial governments across this country have been forced to take the Liberal-NDP government to court. Take the imposition of the carbon tax, which has devastated the futures of so many Canadians. Premiers across the country banded together to fight this intrusion into what should be provincial jurisdiction. It is the imposition of what is very unethical taxation, with massive taxes on those who can least afford it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595412">My hon. colleague asked where the money goes. Unfortunately, we are finding time and time again that the money is lining the pockets of Liberal insiders. In this case, it is $400 million, but we know there is $21 billion going to insider consultants in this city. It is unbelievable. Imagine how much better off we would be if $21 billion less was collected from the Canadian people. That money could be invested in education, our children's futures and nourishing families. We could be investing in our communities. Consider small businesses and the amount of money they could invest to create employment opportunities and grow communities. It is $21 billion, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. </ParaText>

He would be aware of the various scandals, so I just want to mention a few of them that the Conservatives blocked Parliament and committees from ever getting to the bottom of. There was the ETS scandal of $400 million, the G8 misspending of $1 billion, the F-35 procurement scandal of untold billions of dollars, the $2.2 billion for the Phoenix pay system, and the anti-terrorism funding, with no clear paper trail, of $3.1 billion. That is a lot of taxpayer money, and the Conservatives refused at committee and refused in Parliament to let us get to the bottom of things. </ParaText>

After the Liberals starved the air force of resources for years, guess which jet they finally purchased. It was the F-35 jet. It gets better. Who supported them in that purchase? It was the NDP.

              <ParaText id="8595484">Madam Speaker, I wish the Liberal member had the same furor and upset that she has about the use of the word “corruption” about having the government provide the RCMP with all of the information and all the documents that this democratically elected House has ordered it to provide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595485">In the past few days, millions of Canadians have watched the continued stonewalling and blocking by the Liberals. They wonder what price, exactly, the Liberals are willing to pay and why they are doing this, making it so the House has been seized with this issue. Let us make it very clear why we are here debating this motion of privilege. It is because the Liberals were ordered by the House, by a majority of members in this House. The Auditor General found that $400 million of taxpayers' money was given by Liberal insiders and appointees, in a very incestuous-type conflict of interest scheme they developed over the last number of years, to those who were not eligible or, in 186 cases of conflict of interest, they were giving themselves, where they sit on different boards, a bunch of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595486"> We said the RCMP is looking at criminal intent in this whole scandal. The RCMP deserves to have full access to all of the documents. The House spoke on June 10 and said the government must produce the documents and give them to the RCMP, so there is no question that the RCMP does not have all the information and all the documents it needs to see, and it can look at the case and determine what exactly is going on when it comes to criminal intent regarding $400 million of taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595487"> The fact that the Liberals are so worked up and still stonewalling with respect to providing this information, and that they will give up days of government business, shows us just how out of gas they are when it comes to their own priorities. After nine years, the Liberals are just tired and out of fresh ideas. The Liberals will have the House seized for days on end, making sure the pressure stays on them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595488">If there was nothing to see here, nothing to hide and no problem, a government with integrity that believes in sunny ways and says it is “open by default” would provide those documents. It makes us truly wonder what is behind the scenes. What has the RCMP not seen that either has not been given by the government or has been heavily redacted? It makes us wonder exactly why the Liberals are so desperate to bring the House to a standstill because they do not want to turn over something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595489">This is not pocket change, by the way. Today, I have been looking up the context of the magnitude of this latest Liberal scandal, and history is repeating itself. There are parallels with the sponsorship scandal that brought down the last Liberal government 20 years ago. There are incredible similarities and parallels here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595490">Let us think about this. The Liberal government of the day of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien created a federal fund to help promote the Government of Canada in Quebec after a close call in the 1995 referendum. It had to let Quebeckers know what the federal government was doing for them in Ottawa and for national unity, saying, “Yes, we have to do our part. We are proud to be Canadian. We have to have this fund and promote Canadian federalism and the Government of Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595491"> Well, what happened? Who benefited? It was Liberal insiders with millions of dollars in contracts for little to no work, all benefiting Liberal Party insiders and donors. The Gomery commission came in, and this defeated the last Liberal government. This is not denying the fact that a couple of million dollars of stolen taxpayer money, corrupt money, for little to no work is serious. It is.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595492">However, here the Auditor General has found 186 cases of conflict of interest on money that was approved to those who were ineligible, and the total is not a couple million dollars in wrongful bad decisions, but $400 million. This was all in the name of green technology, the feel-good thing, “Oh it's green technology, we are helping the environment and doing all of these things”. They were helping Liberal insiders, and they got caught. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595493">They hate the fact that we have to talk about this, because it reminds Canadians that things never change with the Liberals. They clearly did not learn from the sponsorship scandal. We can see from the corruption that happened in the last Liberal government, a major reason it was brought down, and what we are seeing here the expression that “Liberals are going to liberal”, which is really what it comes down to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595494">Here we are in the country today in a brutal economic situation. Housing costs have doubled. The Liberals have doubled our national debt more than any other prime minister and government combined in Canadian history. They have a carbon tax that is driving up the price of gas, the price of food and the price to heat our homes. Two million visits are made to food banks every month in this country. There were 24 million visits to food banks in Canada in 2024. Forty-seven thousand people have died from opioid-related deaths in this country. More people have now died, under the Liberals' watch in the last nine years, from opioids alone, and their failed approach when it comes to so-called safe supply and tax-paid funded drugs, a lack of rehab and treatment options for people to have redemption and a second chance at life, than all Canadians in the Second World War; that is the magnitude. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595495">However, with all of those issues combined, what are the Liberals obsessed with? It is not coming up with another idea; every one they have had the last nine years has made things worse. They are obsessed with stonewalling, denying accountability and allowing the RCMP to have full access on this massive, multi-hundred-million-dollar scandal and corruption that is going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595496">I am sorry if a Liberal member gets upset with me using the word “corruption”, if that is their issue or what triggers them, but this is $400 million by Liberals appointed by this Liberal government itself. The Liberals appointed these people, and when they got caught and the whistle-blowers started coming forward, they still did not get it. They are still trying to protect the insiders and all of those who stole taxpayers' money, and who were ineligible to receive it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595497"> Another note that is important in this debate for all Canadians to know is that the Liberals say they are looking at it and are coming up with a process to review it, but it has been years now since whistle-blowers came forward. How much of that money has come back to the Canadian treasury? Not a penny; not a dollar. Out of 186 cases, with resignations all over the place, an Auditor General's report and the RCMP confirming that it is under investigation, not a single dollar has been returned to the treasury, which is absurd and tells us everything we need to know after nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595498"> I want to share a couple of things here tonight in my contribution to this debate. I think one of the things that we need to understand is the depth and magnitude of the conflicts of interest that were outlined on this situation, verified and confirmed by the independent Auditor General of Canada in the scathing report that we saw. Members can picture this, because this is literally what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595499"> The Liberals appointed members to the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC. They put their own members on a board of directors, and they got a bunch of applications in. However, this is 101 of ethics and 101 of conflict of interest. I served in municipal politics, and a declaration of pecuniary interests started off every meeting. We, as members of Parliament, have the Ethics Commissioner. We do our disclosures and our filings, as do members of cabinet, with one under investigation for breaching this because we cannot find the other Randy, but I will put that aside. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595500">We know that if we are involved in or are making a decision on something that gives us a financial benefit, we have to say that we have a conflict of interest. We have to leave the room, we cannot be involved and we cannot sway that decision. We had appointees around a table and they were voting on giving themselves and their own businesses money on multiple occasions, with government officials there overseeing all of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595501">A few brave whistle-blowers came by and blew the whistle on all of this. We see the list produced in one of the exhibits in the Auditor General's report, with directors' names that were on the board and the millions of dollars. They are a member of a company, they are a director on the board and they approve funding of $100,000, $5 million, $1.9 million, $4 million, $5.3 million, $2 million, $4.2 million, 186 times. One of the basics of being on a board is understanding governance and conflict of interest. It was not as if it were a couple of times we did it, nothing to see here, that it was an innocent mistake, because 186 times, $400 million, is not an accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595502">That is why the RCMP needs to have full access to all the documents with no redactions. The House did not say that redactions were allowed. The House did not say to hand over whatever documents they think we might want to see. The irony of all of this is that there is a conflict of interest in this case of conflict of interest. The government under investigation for appointing Liberal insiders to the board is saying that it is going to redact this and that, that maybe we do not need this document and that it is not really sure if we do. It gets to decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595503">I cannot say the number of times that I have now spoken in the House and at PROC committee about this. This is like the accused getting to tell the jury members what evidence they get and do not get to see. The government is in a conflict of interest situation. It is under investigation and it gets to be the referee and arbiter of what investigators of the RCMP get to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595504">What the House said on June 10 was that the government does not get to decide. Give them everything. Let them have full access to make the determination whether there is criminal intent here. Do not buy it for a second, because I have heard this in the last couple of days: the Liberals said that the Auditor General looked at it, and yes, found some conflicts of interest and some wrongdoing, and that they are trying to get the money back, although no money has been returned yet. They will not give an update. I asked at committee a couple of months ago how much it is thinking about getting back. How many have they reached out to? There is no answer, not a dollar, not an update, nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595505">They are saying that they are going to look after it and to not worry about it, that the Auditor General said there is no criminal intent there. The Auditor General's mandate was not to examine criminal intent; it is the job of the RCMP to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595506">As a Conservative member of Parliament, as a member of Parliament, as a Canadian who is sick and tired of the stonewalling and the waste and Liberal insiders getting ahead as it gets worse off for Canadians, it is tiring. It is tiring to have to keep telling the government to open up the books, to open up the access to law enforcement to investigate and get to the bottom of this. Liberals did not learn 20 years ago in the sponsorship scandal. We are seeing on full display here today, by their laughing and their ridicule at the beginning of my speech, that they still do not take the waste and misuse of taxpayers' money seriously at all. It is shameful. The longer they stonewall and evade accountability, the shorter the runway is getting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595507">Canadians are going to have their say in a carbon tax election. I would love for that to kick off tonight, tomorrow, the next day or so. We tried within the last couple of weeks. In the course of the last while, it is getting more intense. When I talk to folks in my part of eastern Ontario, and I have visited parts of the GTA and many parts of this great country, people are asking when we are going to have an election, to have a say. They evade that as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595508"> The Liberals are claiming all the wonderful things they are doing, how great life is, how the carbon tax is no problem and it does not matter and that people insist they want it quadrupled, yet they will not have an election to let Canadians weigh in on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595509">After $400 million has been confirmed as being misused and misappropriated, a circle of Liberal insiders approved money to each other back and forth, and years after whistle-blowers came forward, not a dollar of taxpayer money has been returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595510"> All we are saying is to let the RCMP fully investigate so it can give an answer to Canadians. If charges of criminal intent are there, it can go through the judicial process. The fact is that we are sitting here and the Liberals are so desperate to avoid that. They will allow this debate to continue for the simple reason that they just will not provide the accountability and the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595511"> After nine years, after the endless scandals, the endless ethics investigations and convictions, including of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> twice, Canadians have had enough. What could end this is just providing the documents. If there is nothing to hide, if there is no criminal intent, if the Liberals did nothing wrong, they should give the RCMP the documents and it will prove that. The government just shrugs because it has been a week without having government business by the NDP-Liberal government. It does not even care right now.

Are we saying that, with respect to any government agency or bureaucrat out there, if there are any issues whatsoever and we want to get information to the RCMP we just go to the Conservative Party and it will just hand over everything unredacted? Talk about a blur of judicial independence. Conservatives do not care what the RCMP and the Auditor General are saying.

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> gave the theme and the reason behind the whole debate, and that is to pay for the consequences of bad actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595546"> I am pleased to rise on behalf of the industrious and innovating residents of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. Today we are debating a very important motion. The motion would direct the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to study the government's cover-up of the corruption at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. There is really not much actually up for debate. The facts are clear and well established.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595547"> The former head of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC for short, told the government that appointing a person who had received money from SDTC to be chair of the board was a bad idea. The government ignored the advice and appointed the Liberal donor anyhow. Then, to absolutely no one's surprise, the board members started handing out grants to companies they had a stake in. Naturally, the employees at SDTC started to feel uncomfortable with the actions of the board. These employees carefully documented the conflicts of interest and followed the proper procedures for reporting to the ministry responsible for SDTC. These employees followed the rules and were granted a meeting with the deputy minister. The employees explained the situation. The deputy minister said it was worse than the sponsorship scandal ad scam. He said that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would flip his lid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595548">Unfortunately, the deputy minister had placed too much faith in the minister. Rather than flipping his lid, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> tried to put the lid on it. Of course the government wants to cover it up. It was explicitly, directly and clearly warned that appointing this particular Liberal donor to be the board chair was a problem. The government ignored not only the warning lights, but also the warning signs and the warning bells. The Liberals ignored all of it and appointed even more compromised people to the board. That is like warning a bartender to stop selling drinks to minors, and then he starts giving them away for free. According to the Auditor General, this involved at least $400 million of taxpayers' money and 186 conflicts of interest, that we know of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595549"> As I mentioned, this is not really a debate. Those are already the established facts, just like the ruling that the Speaker issued finding the Liberals had violated an order from the House to hand over the documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595550">Now the Liberals' junior partner is complaining that all of this is distracting the government from pursuing its socialist agenda. Once again, the NDP is revealing that it does not understand that the role of Parliament is to hold the government accountable. This is our number one job, and it is not just for opposition members. Every member not in cabinet is supposed to hold the government to account. Maybe if the Liberal backbench spent more time doing that and less time spreading conspiracy theories about hidden agendas on social media, the government might not be so badly out of touch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595551"> This motion is not distracting Parliament from its work. This is its work. If the issue were getting legislation passed, then the Liberal cover-up and Liberal corruption are the problem. That, and the NDP enablers. Enabling this corruption is the problem. Not pulling it out at the roots is the problem. Liberal corruption and incompetence is the real problem, and it impacts the lives of Canadians just as much as, if not more, than any single piece of legislation before the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595552">The founder of an exciting technology company in my riding has informed me that he may have to move his company to the United States. He will be taking the high-tech jobs it created with them. There we have collateral damage. How much of that was lost that we know of? We have a productivity crisis that is making Canadians poorer every day, yet the NDP socialist coalition is driving away exactly the types of companies we need to tackle this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595553">The government has spent the last nine years piling straw onto the backs of small and medium-sized business. However, for a particular company in my riding, it was SDTC.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595554">This is why holding the government accountable is so critical. Liberal corruption and incompetence will cost people their livelihoods. It does not matter if someone is 80 kilometres from Ottawa or 800 kilometres. Decisions made here have an impact out there. The Liberals decided to appoint a donor to be the chair of the SDTC down here, and hundreds of jobs are lost out there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595555">The only person who should have lost his job over the scandal at SDTC is the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, whose lid remains firmly unflipped. I can see that calling for a Liberal minister to resign is being met with eye rolls across the aisle, and I know that when Liberals hear a Conservative calling for a minister to resign, they will just dismiss it. They think we are just trying to score points because that is, to them, the point of a parliamentary democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595556">When a government makes a mistake, our job is to point it out. When something goes wrong in a department, the minister is supposed to resign. That way, a new minister can come in and clean house. Not only that, but the new minister is also strongly incentivized to keep a close eye on what is going on in their department, yet I would not wager a single current minister even knows half the programs being run underneath them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595557">Jean Chrétien tried to kill the idea of responsible government in our country, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, with his outspoken admiration of communist dictators, took it off life support and smothered it with a pillow. Common-sense Conservatives will resurrect it. We will restore democracy, responsibility and accountability, and those are not just sound bites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595558">As I mentioned earlier, this scandal has nothing to do with any of my constituents, yet some of them are paying the price for it. Had there been a minister who listened to the advice of the outgoing SDTC president, none of this would have happened. Good governance is good politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595559">By demanding the accountability of our ministers, Conservatives get quality ministers. Better ministers are better at passing Conservative legislation and advancing Conservative policies. Bad governance is bad politics, and this motion is all the proof the Liberals need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595560">None of this would be happening if the minister had done as his deputy predicted and flipped his lid. Everything that transpired at SDTC was not just predictable. It was actually predicted. This is a troubling pattern with these progressives. They are warned that their bad policy will have a predictably bad consequence, and then they accuse the policy critics of spreading disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595561">They pass the policy, and it goes exactly as miserably as predicted, so they start to gaslight Canadians. Whether it is the streaming censorship act, the news censorship act or the hug-a-thug act, the results are playing out as the critics expected. Less news means less choice, and more crime means more chaos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595562">Now, thanks to Liberal corruption and incompetence, Canada will have less sustainably developed technology, the kind of technology that saves lives and boosts productivity, developed by the kinds of companies that create jobs and pay the taxes Liberals love to spend. Instead, after nine long, scandal-filled years, all Canada has is more corruption, more debt, more taxes and more crime. Thanks to the carbon tax pushing up the price of food, Canada now has more scurvy too, yet all we hear from the Liberals is that everything is awesome. That may be true for the shrinking Liberal base of support, but for the rest of us, things are far more awful than awesome.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595563">The motion is a chance for the Liberals to turn their sinking ship around. Liberals will ignore this advice, but a little humility goes a long way with Canadians. They can turn over the documents, sack the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and apologize to Canadians. That is just common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595564">While I promised to be brief, there is one more element to this story. Regular viewers of my Facebook Live streams may recall this from last June. To recap, SDTC gives grants and loans to companies developing green technologies. The Liberals had ignored advice from public servants warning them not to appoint Annette Verschuren as chair of the board of directors, because Ms. Verschuren owned a company that was getting funding from SDTC. Despite the warnings to the Liberals, she was appointed as chair. Shortly afterward, Ms. Verschuren voted to give her company additional money. She was not the only board member who was in a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595565">Fortunately, employees blew the whistle. The Liberals tried to sweep it under the table, but eventually it was reported to The Globe and Mail. The CBC did several stories on the issue, and it resulted in parliamentary hearings. Ms. Verschuren appeared at the committee, claimed she did nothing wrong and then resigned a few weeks later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595566">If we search Google, we can find dozens of media stories reporting all the details over several months. The Liberals appointed someone to lead an organization that hands out taxpayer money, and that person gave money to her own business in an obvious conflict of interest. The legacy news media gave it appropriate coverage, Parliament investigated and the Liberal appointee resigned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595567">The legacy media like to point to this type of reporting and argue that exposing this type of corruption is why the legacy news media is a pillar of democracy and, therefore, should receive taxpayer-funded subsidies. The Liberals listened and have created a whole new slew of funding programs for legacy news media. One of those programs is the local journalism initiative. It gives media outlets money to hire a local journalist. The program is run by the news media lobbyists. The lobbyists selected a panel of seven people to be the judges on who gets the taxpayers' money. The judging panel reviews applications, selects recipients and decides on funding allocations. Of the seven judges, five are in blatant conflict of interest for having approved funding for their own media outlets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595568">For example, one of the judges, Linda Solomon Wood, is the CEO and editor-in-chief of the National Observer. The National Observer received funding to hire three journalists. Most outlets only received funding for one journalist. Just as with SDTC, we have a group of people in charge of handing out taxpayer money, and these people are giving that money to their own companies. We have identical scandals, but just one news outlet has ever mentioned it. This is Blacklock's Reporter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595569">The entire legacy media has dropped a cone of silence over this scandal. The reason they are all covering up the Liberal corruption is that, even if they do not receive money from the program, they can profit from it. Part of the program requires that all the taxpayer-provided journalists must share their reporting for free. News outlets can access the database of free articles through the radical far-left outfit called The Canadian Press. By the way, one of the seven judges is also the executive director of The Canadian Press. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595570">Now the government has released an evaluation of the local journalism initiative. The Liberals give themselves an A plus, but that is what happens when we hire our evaluators. More outside consultants were hired by Canadian Heritage's evaluation directorate to evaluate how well the government is doing at giving away taxpayer money to well-connected special interests. Surprisingly, the people getting the government money think Liberals are—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8595574"> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise on behalf of the good constituents of Edmonton Griesbach; like many of my colleagues, they are being ravaged by a very dangerous but predictable housing crisis. I say “predictable” because this is a crisis that was in the making. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595575">The Auditor General's report makes clear several times over that there are serious issues relative to the national housing strategy in its current rendition, but how did we get here? This is an important piece of our dilemma today, and I will speak about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595576">We had consecutive federal governments from the 1980s to the 1990s, Liberal and Conservative, that largely pulled out of new affordable housing. For example, the national housing strategy was cancelled in 1993 by then prime minister Paul Martin. What are the implications of that loss? Nearly $2 billion annually was cut from that period of time to today. The pure capital infrastructure deficit has now been downloaded, in the Liberals' own admission, to the provinces. They say it is provincial jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595577">However, it has not always been that way. It is certainly not the history of Canada, and it is not the history that many who found affordable housing after World War II or who found co-op homes during the 1970s and 1980s remember. They remember a federal government, and two of our earlier predecessors, to their credit, that were able to see something. They saw that an economy with only market housing would result in those who could not afford a home becoming homeless. What a shame it is that we could have predicted such a terrible crisis as far back as 1993. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595578">I think some of my colleagues will find some humour in this, but there were two things that happened in 1993. One was the cancelling of the nearly $2 billion of annual revenue for the national housing program that had seen people getting into homes, whether co-ops or non-market homes. We saw that happen. The second thing is that I was actually born in 1993. What a reality, to have experienced a federal government that does not want to get into the business of housing for my entire lifetime. What a shame to be a student of history to then be born and learn of the fact that many in this place could easily recall what happened in 1993. I have great colleagues in this place, from all sides, who remind me of that history all the time. However, I think what we are unanimous about, something that we all agree on, is that the federal government has a place in national housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595579"> The Auditor General said some damning things that are worth noting. The report on public accounts, which was published and released in November 2023, suggested that “Infrastructure Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada [ESDC] did not know whether their efforts to prevent and reduce chronic homelessness were leading to improved outcomes”. In addition, “Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation did not know who was benefiting from its initiatives”. It went on to suggest, “There was minimal federal accountability for [reaching] the National Housing Strategy target to reduce chronic homelessness by 50% by the 2027–28 fiscal year.” However, we do not know whether the investments that are made under the current national housing strategy will actually have an impact on the number of people experiencing homelessness. This is a real shame because we are seeing significant growth across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595580">CMHC's definition of “affordable housing” as 80% of the market rate is different from the government's recommendation of spending no more than 30% of income on housing. With rent soaring, this is increasingly difficult for many people. These are serious problems that are resulting in really serious issues. When we do not take seriously our lack of ability to plan or foresee this crisis, of course there is going to be a gap. As I mentioned, the crisis originated as early as 1993, with the cancelling of the national housing program. Non-market and other social housing initiatives have seen nearly $2 billion of revenue lost annually. Of course we could have predicted this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595581"> There are statistics from StatsCan, for example. I will back up a little just to describe exactly who this is affecting. According to a point-in-time report from 59 communities, on any given night, based on 2021 data, 32,000 people experience homelessness. This is a 12% increase since 2018, which should break all of our hearts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595582">If we can be unanimous in the House when it comes to ending homelessness, it is truly achievable. However, it takes a real effort to understand how we got here, as well as an incredible effort to understand that we have to go beyond some of the very partisan pontification that often happens in this place, when we have the solutions in front of us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595583"> The great thing about the Auditor General's office and about the public accounts committee is that there is not a group of members from the chamber relegating or creating recommendations. It is the Auditor General, who has an immense staff, immense capability and immense integrity, and is not only able to review the information presented to Canadians, like the statistics I just mentioned, but has also offered real, credible solutions, like fair reporting, that can fix some of the issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595584">Imagine if we just reported fairly on the investments by CMHC toward the real number of people who are experiencing homelessness according to the census versus the data that cities collect, for example. The data is non-aggregated. The data is really difficult for a lot of the people who are working in this space to actually find a target, but we do know the number is increasing. On top of all of that, indigenous people represent nearly 30% of people who experience homelessness each night, despite being just 5% of the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595585">This is a point that personally touches me. I had a relative who has passed on now; in 2019 he died on the streets of Edmonton because he did not have housing. He was a very good person. Many times, people would walk by him on the streets. When I would go to assist him, I would ask him what was wrong and whether he needed anything, whether I could get him something and whether he wanted a place to stay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595586">He would respond by saying that he needed to help the people in his community, that he needed to help the people living on the streets. He said that a lot of them are young people, that we need them to know that we care about them, that they have relatives and that they know they must have a chance to be seen as human.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595587">He did that work, but we need governments to do that work now. We need governments to see homeless individuals as real human beings. Housing is a human right. New Democrats have been consistent in our message that there are rights, there are needs and there are wants. Let us leave the wants of Canadians up to the market. Does someone want an Xbox? Sure, the free market should deal with an Xbox. I do not care. New Democrats support that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595588">However, what we do not support is when one treats a home, food and water like commodities. Every single one of us needs those things. A person cannot ever get a job if they do not have food, if they do not have water and if they do not have shelter. These are some of the basic organizing principles of any country. Look after one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595589">Let us look after the people in our communities so they may be able to fulfill the deep dreams they have, which I know so many do, and so they can contribute to our country. Imagine if the cure for cancer lived in the heart and the mind of someone who was homeless. To know that we could not have the ability and a social safety net to pick them up and make sure they could contribute to our great country is a real shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595590">I want to share the story of one of my constituents, named Margaret, who grew up in the Rat Creek neighbourhood in Edmonton Griesbach. She is nearly 95 years old. She came from the Netherlands just after World War II. She married a very brave and noble soldier from Edmonton. After the war, she came to Edmonton, Alberta. However, they did not have a home. They found themselves living in the basement, with her husband's brother and his family, of the family home that he had grown up in. It was overcrowded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595591">At that time, there was an unprecedented growth in Canada's population. There was a boom, which resulted in the many baby boomers whom we call our parents and our grandparents. It was a generation that had to suffer, very early on, a very traumatic housing crisis. However, the government did not relent and say it was a jurisdictional problem for the provinces. It did not say people should work a little harder to make more money because they cannot afford a home. The government said it would make the conditions possible so people could have a home. This was the post-war housing corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595592">Many may not be familiar with this anymore. The post-war housing corporation was tasked with building the homes, before the war, that soldiers required. This was so that, whether they were on military bases or otherwise, their lives could be sustainable and they could have the means and fulfill the requirements to train on a military base. After the war, these brave soldiers came back and had no homes, and the government created the post-war housing corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595593">The post-war housing corporation was tasked with building thousands of homes, particularly in my community of Edmonton Griesbach, where Margaret, who was living in the basement of her in-laws' house, feared she would never have a house of her own. She was able to meet with me some months ago, and she recounted a story that I think would inspire many of those people who are hoping to one day have a home too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595594">Margaret found that the post-war housing corporation was able to build thousands of bungalow units across Edmonton, beautiful little homes that everyone cherishes. They are a mausoleum to our history, to our co-operation and to what it means to live a good life, a humble life and one where we take care of each other. She was able to spend $50 a month buying the house from the government, with a down payment of $500. Imagine how incredible that opportunity was for her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595595">Margaret quickly moved from being in the position of not having any hope to being able to move into a home quickly. She had four children and a loving husband. She and her husband lived right into their golden years, and she still lives in that home today. That was all because the government acted. The government decided to invest and to ensure that people had a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595596">This is what New Democrats are calling for today. We believe in a country that can build the homes that people desperately need: non-market homes, co-op housing and a variety of multi-generation homes that are now needed for our growing and differing population. These are solutions that can manifest into real hope for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595597"> In the chamber, we so often speak about young people in particular and their inability to ever get a home. It is true that many young people, and many Canadians generally, believe that it is impossible now to get a home. However, the other factor that is not being spoken about is the fact that we are losing homes, affordable homes and non-market homes, very rapidly, and that is adding to the incredible challenge and the requirement of participating in the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595598">Imagine a single mom who is having a very difficult time. Let us say that she, like some people in our country, loses her job, unfortunately, and misses one month's rent. The options for that person are dire. Reports suggest that most Canadians are just one paycheque away from losing their house. It can be nearly anyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595599">Chronic homelessness can be something we all experience; however, we can also all support ending it, and it is something we can actually re-engage and create hope about. If we created, for example, an affordable housing strategy that truly met the needs of Canadians, it would be one that invested in co-op housing, in non-market housing and in transition homes and holistic supports for those who are experiencing chronic homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595600">In particular, that would mean indigenous people who have been largely living on the streets at a rate of 30% for a very long time, some of them upward of 12 years before they access a service. That is an incredibly long time and it is very difficult to try to support them, but we have to do it. It means involving community. It means investing in holistic community cultural supports like language. It means understanding the deep impacts of intergenerational trauma and the realities of the impacts of residential schools and the sixties scoop on one's own ability to manifest a future where they see themselves in a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595601">Let me give an example of that. Many residential school survivors have reported, particularly within the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, that they did not have the life skills upon exiting residential schools to truly ensure that they had the understanding and the ability to have a household that would cherish and love its own children. Many residential school survivors report that they found it difficult to even speak the words “I love you” to their children because of the immense abuse and suffering they faced in Canada's horrific residential schools, places where they were not told who they were, where they came from and whether they were loved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595602">Imagine the impact of, as a little child, being boarded away in a big building without any role models to suggest that they deserve to be in a home and that they were loved, or that they could even see a future for themselves. These are the people who are living on Canada's streets. They are people's relatives. These are Canada's consequences. We must have the courage to not just invest but also to truly listen and change. How do we do this work?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595603">Beyond that, we know there are solutions. Homeward Trust, which is a fantastic organization, created what we call the Homeward Trust By Name List in Edmonton. It counted 4,011 people who are either unhoused or without stable housing, which is up 2,728 people since January alone. The CEO, Susan McGee, says, “We've not seen this kind of month-over-month...increase in any year prior”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595604">This is an emergency that we must take seriously, and throughout the course of the discussion today, we are probably going to hear from my Conservative colleagues that the Liberals have failed. I would certainly agree with that. We are going to hear the Liberals say that the Conservatives are going to gut and cut. The truth is in between both of these positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595605">Since the eighties, both of these parties have conspired toward the very real rejection of social, co-op or non-market housing. We have nearly gotten out of the business. It is a sad state of affairs when we know we can do it. With a country as wealthy as ours, we know we can afford to house everyone, but for the very deep pursuit of pleasing the mega-elites of the country, particularly real estate investment trusts. The very unfortunate and real relationship that these groups, very large private investors, have had with consecutive governments has put at risk the livelihood of Canadians. The 4,000 Edmontonians I just mentioned are at risk because they are not being heard.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595606"> Instead, these large megacorporations are being told that they can get public money and can make a profit if they build these homes. Let us do a quick summary of that scenario. If public land comes up for sale, a developer can get a great sweetheart deal on that land and can build whatever they want on it. The government says they should build some affordable homes, and not even a majority but at least 30%. In many instances, they are not even doing that, at the very least, and are using access to public funds and public land to build for-profit housing. If their goal is to build for-profit housing and make profit, they have an option between two units. They can develop a small townhouse model that is modest at a decent rental or purchase cost, or they can build a mega mansion and sell it for millions of dollars. If they are in the business of making money, they are going to build the mega mansion and sell it for as much as they possibly can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595607">That is the story of Canada's national housing program today: to give truckloads of money to developers without any guarantee that they are going to build homes that people can afford. We have seen this time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595608"> The Auditor General made very clear in her report that she found it very difficult to ascertain whether the Liberals have reduced homelessness with the investments they have made so far. Although the national average is 30%, in Edmonton, 51% of homelessness is experienced by indigenous people, even though we make up just 5% of the population. It is a real shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595609">We know that indigenous people in particular have the solutions to end this crisis in their own communities, whether that is through innovation in sustainable building products and new ways to build on reserve or off reserve, or through ensuring that workforce development programs ensure that young people have the training and skills to do the work themselves. It would get the lobbyists and consultants out of the room, save some money and build more homes. That is what they want to do, but time and time again they find it too difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595610">We have the solutions to fix this crisis, and the Auditor General has pointed out to us the very real issues. We must have the courage to build homes that people desperately need: non-market, co-op and social housing.</ParaText>

This is one thing that the Auditor General makes clear is important to her. Second, another report must be provided by Infrastructure Canada showing how many communities have implemented coordinated access for housing support services. Third, CMHC must provide a report outlining the housing needs of vulnerable groups and evidence that these groups are receiving housing assistance. Finally, a joint report must be provided by CMHC and Infrastructure Canada indicating what measures are being taken to improve the coordination between federal departments and homelessness agencies. </ParaText>

The reality is that to get to the crisis we have today, successive Conservative and Liberal governments simply ignored the issue of affordable housing and ignored putting in place all of the investments that are critical to maintaining a housing stock.

              <ParaText id="8595625"> I want to speak to the imagination of many Canadians, including me. If these programs had not been gutted, we can imagine, for example, that the nearly 800,000 units that were sold off under the Harper government would still be here. They would have families in them. They would have people who can contribute to our economy rather than being on the streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595626"> Let us go back even further. If in 1993 Paul Martin had not cancelled the national housing strategy, largely getting Canada out of the business of supporting those who do not have homes, we would have nearly $2 billion in revenue today, maybe even more, to put toward social housing, co-op housing and transition housing. We would not have seen the problem get worse, and we could have eliminated the problem by now. What an incredible feat that would have been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595627"> However, there is still hope. There is still a chance to get Canada back on track, to utilize the memory of many Canadians toward the great investments we have made for those who do not have homes. We can reinvigorate our economy. We can reinvigorate the imaginations of Canadians. We can rebuild optimism in our country if we just act, if we have a government that takes seriously the housing situation, not just off-loading the problem to rich developers, as the Conservatives would do, and not ignoring programs, as the Liberals do. A New Democratic government would truly build affordable homes by ensuring we build affordable units, co-op units and non-market homes, and we would end this crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595628">Madam Speaker, in the member's earlier comments, he talked about some of the federal programs that rich and wealthy developers were able to benefit from. I do not completely disagree with him, but I am wondering why the New Democratic caucus, along with its Liberal friends, voted for the rental construction financing initiative. This program accounted for over a third of all funds allocated under the national housing program, and in that program, there is no requirement for developers to offer below-market rental housing units after 10 years. For those that are marked below the market rate, in many cases, like where I live in British Columbia, they are still not affordable. </ParaText>

If we could get unanimous support for the solutions that are offered to build very desperately needed social housing, perhaps we would be able to solve this crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595631">The reality of the rental construction program is that we have a terrible dichotomy between the Liberals, who do not want to do enough, and the Conservatives, who want to get more out of the business by cutting programs that many people rely on. We are stuck in this difficult situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595632"> We often hear from our constituents that this is an emergency and that we must invest what we can. The rental construction program could have been better. For example, imagine if we required, something the New Democrats fought for, that a portion of rental units had to be below the market rate. There are also additional items that relate to the ownership framework. After 10 years, one could dispose of those assets, transform those assets or transfer those assets to provincial or municipal governments or non-profit agencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595633">The solution to the problem with the rental construction program is an acquisition fund.

              <ParaText id="8595636"> Madam Speaker, we are into our fourth week here in Ottawa since the summer recess of this chamber. Over the summer, like many people here, I spent a large amount of my time door knocking. I reconnected with my constituents and, indeed, British Columbians across the province. Irrespective of where I went in British Columbia over the summer, two issues came up every single time: First, people cannot afford to live there; second, the cost of living has gone up so much. I separate those two issues because the second is about groceries, car payments, insurance and so on, just the general cost of life. The shelter issue just deals with the exorbitant costs that British Columbians are faced with. I would argue that it is probably more acute where I live in the Fraser Valley and in the broader Vancouver region, the Lower Mainland. Some questions I heard from young Canadians are as follows: “What did I do wrong? What did my kids do wrong? Why is there no pathway for the life that I envisioned when I was growing up in British Columbia?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595637">A colleague and I were talking earlier today, and we reflected on when we graduated from university, around 2006-07, and the prospects we had for owning a home in the Lower Mainland, even in Vancouver. Back then, it was still affordable. Today, a six-figure salary, living in Abbotsford, is barely enough to cover rent and basic necessities. I never thought in my wildest dreams that we would come to a place in Canada where a six-figure salary would no longer necessarily be enough to raise a family. Let us break that down. Someone may be taking home $6,000 or $7,000 a month after taxes and any pension contributions on that salary, or maybe a little bit less. They may be making between $5,000 and $6,000 a month, or maybe a bit more, on a $100,000 salary. Right off the bat, they are going to be paying $3,500 of that to rent a house or a unit that will enable them to have kids. After that, they are going to have their car payment, their Fortis payment for natural gas, their cellphone bill and then, of course, their groceries and clothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595638"> If someone is starting out today and living on a salary of around $100,000 a year, it is not necessarily enough to get by. That is the sad reality of living in Canada right now. It does not have to be this way. It was not like that before. Many Canadians surmise that the Canada they once knew is no longer there. They do not know what happened; it happened so quickly. Was it during the pandemic? Was it afterwards? They did what they were told. They went to BCIT, UFV, SFU or UBC to get that degree. They landed that first job, maybe even working for government or a small business. They thought the money they were making right now would be enough to save up for a down payment, to start a family and to live the life they always wanted to live. That dream is dying at an alarming rate in British Columbia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595639">In fact, I am 40 years old. Some of the friends I grew up with just did not get in soon enough before housing costs skyrocketed in 2016, and then again in 2019, at such an alarming rate. They wonder about this. They have great jobs and their kids are in school, but they just do not have the security of home ownership. Alberta or the Maritimes are looking a lot better today than they did five years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595640">British Columbia is about the most blessed place that anyone could imagine. We have the best agricultural land found anywhere in the country in the Fraser Valley, in the Okanagan Valley or in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island. British Columbians have natural resources in forestry, liquefied natural gas and mining that are essential to the security and well-being of all Canadians, yet we are not profiting from the wealth of our province. Many factors have led to this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595641">Most important is the housing market that has accelerated at a rate that young people who grew up in the province just could not keep up with, in terms of the market changes that happened so quickly. For many years, we tied it to the role of foreign buyers. The Conservative Party put forward a platform commitment to ban foreign buyers. The New Democratic Party put in a satellite tax for people not making money yet taking advantage of the generous social programming we have in our province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595642">However, the young person staying here today, the young nurse working at Abbotsford Regional Hospital who did everything right, does not care about all the different variables. The only things she is thinking about are when she can start a family, when she can settle down and when she can live a reasonable life that she should get as a British Columbian, as a Canadian, who followed all the rules. I guess our social contract seems a little broken right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595643">Part of the reason it is broken relates to small businesses. The majority of Canadians are employed by a small business. Businesses with one to 19 employees employ 5.2 million Canadians. In 2023, small businesses reported lower revenues compared with 2022, and in 2024, they “remain less optimistic than larger businesses” in respect to their viability moving forward. In fact, three in 10 businesses in the one to 19 employees category reported lower revenues in 2023 compared with 2022. I would suggest that the numbers in 2024 may not be too different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595644">If our business owners do not feel they can offer salaries and paycheques at a rate that is tied to the cost of living, then young people are not going to want to stay and work in those positions. If someone works in public administration or in health care, the government cannot afford to give them a salary that keeps pace with the rampant inflation we have seen as well. Young people are stuck between a rock and a hard place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595645"> I know that for a future Conservative government, we have some big challenges to address this problem, to create powerful paycheques again and to give these young people hope. Right now, they do not know what they are going to do and that is a problematic place to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595646">One thing we could be focusing on that we have not addressed yet, and which, I think, there is broad unanimity in Parliament to address, is housing supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595647">Yes, in my previous question in tonight's debate, I talked about the rental construction financing initiative, but there has been a historical amount of money allocated to building homes in Canada. Unfortunately, we have not seen those homes built yet. In the report we are discussing tonight, they talked about hearing from Infrastructure Canada, which is working with CMHC to address the real challenges young people are facing in our country. I think those are good recommendations and good points to follow up on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595648">One of the things the Conservative Party wants to do is tie future infrastructure dollars to the number of new homes being built. Across the board, the number one thing I think all governments recognize is that we need to build a lot more homes. Parliament is only one level of government that needs to play an active role in this but an important one, because we hold the federal taxation power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595649">The federal government funds a large portion of all infrastructure in Canada. I believe the federal government needs to start signalling, in real and concrete ways, to municipalities that until municipalities start permitting more, until they start being more efficient with the taxpayer dollars they collect through property taxes and development cost charges, and until they build the homes that young people need, the federal government is not going to give them the infrastructure dollars. I think we need to start with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595650">It is not just me saying it. Romy Bowers, the president of CMHC, has said it again and again. I think every economist in the country understands that if we do not get a handle on supply, we are not going to meet the objectives of young Canadians. We have to meet the objectives of young Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595651">The Conversation reported, “Canada’s housing market is among the most unaffordable, with one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among OECD member states. Housing prices soared over 355 per cent between 2000 and 2021, while median nominal income increased by only 113 per cent.” Home ownership is increasingly precarious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595652">For people like me, us millennials, who are talking to their baby boomer parents or their parents' friends, when we say it is so much harder to get a home, they will say, “People just need to pull up their own bootstraps and get that second job.” Well, no. Today in British Columbia, in the Fraser Valley or Lower Mainland, it would take, on average, about 25 years just to save up for a down payment to purchase a first home. I think some of the cheapest homes in the community I live in, looking at townhouses, are easily over $600,000, probably $700,000, and for a single detached home, if you can still get one, it is more like $1.3 million or $1.4 million today. Even if someone is making a six-figure income right after graduating from one of our universities or trade schools, they are not going to be able to afford to get into the market. That needs to change, and supply needs to be a central component. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595653">One of the biggest challenges we face related to supply, going back to our businesses, is that insolvencies have increased year over year. In the last report from Statistics Canada, the number of businesses in Canada has decreased by 9,000, most notably in the construction sector. Until we start doing something to change business confidence in Canada, we are not going to see more homes built because right now, be it because of the capital gains changes, the CPP and EI tax increases or the red tape that small businesses face, we are not going to see more people start businesses in the home-building construction sector. They do not see a path to profitability like they used to in Canada, despite the growing need. We have to change things on housing. We have to change the number of homes being built and how businesses feel that they can operate in the economy today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595654">I would be remiss in my time if I did not quickly touch upon homelessness because the biggest consequence of not building enough homes is that people are falling between the cracks more and more often across Canada. In October 2023, there were more than 30 homeless encampments spread out across the Halifax regional municipality. By July 2024, the number of homeless had risen to 1,316, a 30% increase in just nine months. According to Cheryl Forchuk, a professor at Western University in Ontario, “Government data estimates that there are some 235,000 homeless people across the country, but that is only counting people who access shelters.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595655">In some cases, even our refugees are homeless, including, for example, Ukrainian evacuees in Calgary. Agencies have said that they have found newcomers sleeping on the streets, at the airport or at homeless shelters because nothing else is available. Toronto's shelter system has seen a 283% rise in violence over the last decade due to overcrowding and inadequate mental health support. The PBO has outlined “that the number of chronically homeless people has increased by 38% relative to 2018.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595656">Habitat for Humanity noted, “61% of young Canadians aged 18-34 are concerned about their ability to pay their mortgage or rent over the next 12 months.” RE/MAX outlined in its fall 2024 market housing outlook, which just came out on September 3, that 28% of Canadians said they are considering moving out of not only British Columbia, but also our country for greater affordability. On October 31 of last year, The Globe and Mail reported, “A new survey suggests stalled construction projects are holding up the delivery of at least 25,000 homes across Quebec...the figure potentially represents just a fraction of the true number of blocked units...since just 42 of the association's members responded to the survey” related to housing construction in Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595657">Regarding some of the government's responses to this, the housing accelerator fund has been a big failure. After giving Toronto $471 million, Toronto increased development cost charges by more than $20,000. Those costs are passed on to first-time homebuyers and others alike. After giving Ottawa $176 million, Ottawa increased its development charges by 11% and 12%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595658">Vaughan was given $59 million to reduce red tape, and within a year, it increased development charges by 25%, or nearly $40,000. Mississauga increased development charges by over $10,000 within a year of receiving $112 million from the Liberals under the housing accelerator fund. Abbotsford, my community, is proposing to increase development cost charges by 53%, despite receiving $25.6 million from the housing accelerator fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595659">My next point is that municipalities cannot be putting their bureaucracy and red tape onto the buyers, who need more affordable homes, and the government has to put stricter conditions on funds like the housing accelerator fund if municipalities are going to access federal dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595660">One of the other consequences of our precarious housing market is the use of food banks. The need for food banks in British Columbia has never been greater than it is today. With 382,000 British Columbians living in poverty, according to the market basket measure, B.C. currently has the second-highest poverty rate in the country. This number includes 40,000 children in low-income families and 36,000 seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595661">In my own riding of Mission, it is reported that over 5,000 people access the food bank each month, in a town of 46,000 people, and 38% of those people are under the age of 18. Archway Community Services, also serving my riding, reports that Abbotsford can no longer meet the demands for increased food bank usage and is urgently looking for more space to fill donation bags and give children, especially, nutritious food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595662">Food Banks Canada's 2024 poverty report shows that almost 50% of Canadians feel financially worse off compared to last year, while 25% of Canadians are experiencing food insecurity. On top of this, Food Banks Canada reported that the cost of living has become so high that food banks have seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595663">As a direct consequence of the Liberal government's inflationary spending and taxes, millions of Canadians are struggling to keep their heads above water. New research from the Salvation Army shows that nearly a third of Canadians continue to feel pessimistic about their future and their personal finances, while 25% of Canadians continue to be extremely concerned about having enough income to cover their basic needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595664">For this reason, Food Banks Canada downgraded the government's grade from a D in 2023 to a D- in 2024. Canadians desperately need relief, but the Liberal government is no longer listening. Last month, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to hike his carbon tax again, which is going to increase the cost of food again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595665">In conclusion, as food security worsens in this country, Conservatives are going to continue to call for an election to axe the carbon tax, to build more homes, to fix the budget and to stop the crime, which is an issue I did not even touch upon tonight. The Canadians I met with this summer at doorsteps reflect some of the damning statistics I listed off this evening. That is, they followed all the rules in Canada; they did what they were supposed to do, but the Canada they once knew is not the Canada today; and they do not feel they can get ahead in their province or in their country like their parents' generation could. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595666">On this side of the House, Conservatives want to give young people a future again. We want to provide them hope, and right now they just do not feel that. We need to work to call an election, to have a carbon tax election, and bring Canadians affordability and change to restore hope once again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595667">Madam Speaker, I would like to suggest to the member that it is incorrect to think of this as a new problem. One of the first meetings I took as a new MP back in 2016 was from people who said they could not afford to buy a house. That is one of the reasons we, as a government, put together all the means, the studies and the money to undertake the national housing program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595668">It is also true that the housing costs increased during the previous administration, not only the Harper years but certainly the Martin-Chrétien years, as well as in the previous administration, or the Mulroney years.

Government does indeed have a role to play. The leading reasons why homes are not being built are, number one, red tape and permitting processes; number two, access to workers to build the homes we need; number three, access to businesses to do that work to build the homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595671"> I believe that the government could have designed its programs more effectively, and the Liberals could have pushed municipalities to push for more density in the period of time that they have had in office. They did not even mention pushing for densification or tying infrastructure dollars to the number of housing starts until the last few months, even though it is well known that these are some of the key things that we can do to increase supply.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595672">Madam Speaker, we share a lot in common in terms of the problem. The problem is clear: Whether it is in British Columbia, in Alberta or here in Ontario, Canadians cannot keep up with the cost of their mortgage or their rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595673"> However, we differ in terms of the solution. I would agree with the member that the Liberals have spent a lot of money, but they have spent that money giving it out to large corporations like real estate investment trusts and other groups that build for-profit homes and sell those homes for profit. Any public spending should go to public good. In this case, the Liberals' housing strategy is public money for private good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595674"> The Conservatives' solution is more of the same as the Liberals' approach. Rather than investing, however, we would still require municipalities or real estate investment trusts to build the homes that people could afford, but they are not going to do it. Their objective is purely profit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595675">How can the member square the circle that selling off public land to rich developers is in any way different from giving those same developers a boatload of money or a boatload of public land? The result is the same: Canadians have no homes. We need to have the courage to actually speak about non-profit and social housing. Could the member speak to those two points?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595676"> Madam Speaker, with respect to the future objectives of a Conservative government, we can do a lot more to see housing starts improve drastically in Canada without actually spending any additional dollars. That would take leadership, and it would take a federal government that is willing to incent municipalities to improve processing times to get more homes built quickly and then tie housing starts to infrastructure dollars for other matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595677"> The federal government also has a role to signal, like with respect to the housing accelerator fund where all these big municipalities took federal money and, in addition to that, put more taxes onto the backs of homebuyers. We can stop all those things as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595678"> With respect to the comment about federal lands, I believe that the Treasury Board can establish efficient guidelines to ensure that people who are purchasing land from the federal government to build housing are subject to criteria that ensure that the land is being used for the best purposes of all Canadians. Maybe even in some cases, those lands are used for co-operative housing or different societies that want to help people suffering from addiction. We can do a lot more if we put the proper parameters in place. My argument today is that the current government never did.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595679">Madam Speaker, even in opposition, Conservatives have put solutions before the House to address the housing crisis. One of them is Bill <Document DbId="12568130" Type="4">C-356</Document>, the building homes, not bureaucracy act. I am perplexed by the fact that all other parties voted against this common-sense piece of legislation. I asked the New Democrats tonight why they had opposed this bill and they said they had certain objections to the section about selling off federal lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595680">However, notably, the section on selling off federal lands in this report would not prescribe particulars around what kind of housing would be constructed there. It does not contain limitations on additional policies that might be put in place around that. It simply says that a report would need to be tabled on an inventory of public buildings and land, identifying land suitable for construction and to propose a plan to sell at least 15% of any federal buildings; and that all land would be appropriate for housing construction subject to certain exceptions, and would require the Minister of Public Works to place these properties on the market within 12 months of tabling the report. The report does not contain any of the sort of strictures or necessary implications that the NDP has applied. It simply talks about making buildings and land more available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595681"> On that basis, I do not see any credible reason why the other parties would have rejected the common-sense proposal that Conservatives have already put forward to the House.

              <ParaText id="8595685">In an ideal world, a group of concerned Canadians would come together and maybe access the 100% GST tax break, but the reality is, if they are going to be selling public lands, that goes to the group that is the highest bidder. Think of a real estate investment trust that is buying up land. The latest report suggests that 20% of all land is owned by real estate investment trusts. The problem lies in the market. Relying on the market to be the solution or incentive for why people should build homes on land they cannot afford is a silly proposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595686">What I am suggesting is that a more realistic approach to the Conservative plan would allow the most wealthy among us, the billionaires, to outbid their neighbour for something they want to buy. To top it all off, the Conservative plan would give them, they just mentioned it, a 100% GST tax break. Therefore, the GST tax break would go to the billionaire who buys the public land, so the people are out of public land where they can build an affordable unit and are out the opportunity to collect revenue for real programs and services. That is why we are opposed to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595687">Would the member comment on the importance of investing in social housing that is not on the market to avoid the program the Conservatives' bill would propose?

              <ParaText id="8595692">Tonight, we are proceeding with concurrence debate; this is debate on whether the House should agree with the 31st report of the public accounts committee. This is a very important report that deals with the issue of homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595693">Before getting into the particulars of the report, I think it is important to reflect on where we are as a country. For a long time in Canada, we had a deal, we had an understanding that if we worked hard, played by the rules and worked to serve our community to advance the common good, we would be able to live a healthy, happy and comfortable life. Sadly, as a result of policies pursued by the NDP-Liberal government over the last nine years, that deal is now broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595694">As we turn to the issue of homelessness tonight, and to the issues of poverty that surround homelessness, more and more Canadians are struggling who never would have expected to be in this position before. People who spent their lives giving to food banks are now receiving from food banks as a result of changes in their situation because of decisions, actions and policies by the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595695">The public accounts committee has a mandate to study and review reports of the Auditor General. The Auditor General analyzes various programs and policies of the government to see if they are meeting their stated objectives. It is not the Auditor General's role to make a priori determinations of the good, of what a particular policy should be. Rather, the Auditor General's role is to determine whether particular programs are lining up with the stated objectives, doing the things they are supposed to do and measuring the things they are supposed to measure, as well as whether actions of government accord with policies and objectives that have been put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595696">I have had the opportunity to serve on the public accounts committee. I am not currently a regular member, but I am there often nonetheless, and I was a member of it previously. Reviewing reports of the Auditor General, we found her consistent disappointment with the government failing to measure up to its stated objectives in its actions. The members talk a good game about a lot of things, but they fail to follow through and to deliver results. We see this time and time again with reports that come before the public accounts committee, in the fact that the government is not meeting its stated objectives, and it is not measuring or following appropriate policies in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595697">If we take a macro look at what the government is all about, what the problem has been over the last nine years, it is that we have a government that fundamentally believes it is the thought that counts. They want to express that they care. They want to put in place policies and frameworks with names that sound good, that exude a sentiment of solidarity. However, they are uninterested in whether these programs actually deliver results. They believe that it is the thought that counts. We believe that it is the results that count. We can have a policy that sounds good, but if it does not actually deliver positive outcomes, then what is the point? It is not the thought that counts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595698">Moreover, we often hear from the government members that we can read whether they care about an issue from how much money they spent on an item. They will tell us they are spending more on this and more on that. I think that is supposed to be a demonstration of their concern for a particular issue. They are spending a bunch of money on something under a particular policy heading, and we are supposed to read into this that they care about those kinds of issues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8595699">What Canadians are really interested in are the results. If the government is spending more on something but the results are worse, then quite obviously people are worse off than they were before. I think what Canadians care about, particularly now when so many people are struggling, are not the good thoughts or the good intentions, or even the amount of money that is spent. They care about the concrete results and how they impact their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595700">As Canadians are struggling, they are reflecting on the fact that one cannot eat a good thought and cannot live in an announcement. A good intention will not keep them warm at night. This is the problem with the situation presided over by the NDP-Liberal government. Despite its desire for Canadians to conclude that it is the thought that counts, Canadians are realizing that they cannot eat a good thought and cannot live in an announcement, and that good intentions will not keep them warm at night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595701">That brings me to the particulars of the 31st report of the public accounts committee, which is extremely damning in its assessment of the government's performance when it comes to the issue of homelessness. I will just read, from the beginning of the report, the key findings of the Auditor General. The first is that “Infrastructure Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada did not know whether their efforts to prevent and reduce chronic homelessness were leading to improved outcomes”. They did not know whether what they were trying to do was actually leading to better outcomes. That is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595702">The next finding is, “Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation did not know who was benefiting from its initiatives.” The third key finding was “minimal federal accountability for reaching the National Housing Strategy target to reduce chronic homelessness by 50% by the 2027–28 fiscal year”. That is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595703">That is the government's much-vaunted housing strategy, and we find that the government literally does not know whether its efforts to prevent and reduce chronic homelessness are leading to results. It has no idea. It cannot claim that it is producing good results because, according to the Auditor General, it simply does not have that information. It is not tracking it. CMHC did not know who benefited from the initiatives, and there was minimal accountability for reaching the targets in the national housing strategy. That is extremely damning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595704">The government loves to talk about the fact that it has a national housing strategy. It says it has a great announcement, a great statement and a great framework, but it is not even assessing or measuring the results. It does not have basic information. It is not tracking whether its efforts actually produce good outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595705">We can only conclude, from hearing the way the Liberals talk and then looking at the Auditor General's report, that they really believe that it is only the good thoughts that matter. They think it is the thought that counts instead of the results that count. It is time we have a government in this country that is authentically concerned about the well-being of Canadians; is concerned about the results of policies; is focused on virtue, not virtue signalling; and is focused on what happens to Canadians, not on wrapping itself in the aura of showing it cares through announcements and through expenditures, yet not tracking the results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595706">There is a damning report from the Auditor General after nine years of failure on housing. Of course, Canadians did not need to hear the report to know that the government is failing on housing. Canadians know that the deal that has defined our country, the deal that hard work leads to opportunity, has been broken under the government. Canadians know that the price of rent, the price of housing and the price of food are way up, and that life is becoming less affordable as a result of policies pursued by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595707"> There is a failure to support the construction of new housing. The carbon tax has made food less affordable. Inflationary government spending far outstrips anything we have seen in this country before, more than doubling the national debt. These are concrete policies that are having concrete negative impacts on our national life.</ParaText>

In that spirit, Conservatives have not only begun to plan for an alternative government but have also concretely put before the House, in this Parliament, proposals to address the housing crisis right now. A more wise and more humble government would have adopted these proposals, but sadly the government has not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595709">Conservatives put forward Bill <Document DbId="12568130" Type="4">C-356</Document>, a comprehensive plan to address the housing challenges facing our country. It was put forward by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. Bill C-356 is the proposed building homes, not bureaucracy act. People following at home can actually find the key recommendations in Bill C-356 and in the Conservative supplementary report at the back of the 31st report of the public accounts committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595710">They are common-sense recommendations that I think any reasonable person would find worthy of support, yet all other parties in the House voted against the bill. It does not make any sense to me that members of the NDP-Liberal coalition would reject this common-sense plan. Of course, if there were particular details that they wanted to adjust slightly, they could have supported it at second reading and proposed those amendments at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595711">However, they did not just vote against particular provisions at a later stage; even if they thought the bill was imperfect, they were willing to throw it out wholesale. I do not think the bill is imperfect; I think it is an excellent bill that could have been adopted in its present form. NDP-Liberal members who are quibbling about details could have supported it to go to committee at least, but they did not; they rejected the principle of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595712">What is in Bill <Document DbId="12568130" Type="4">C-356</Document>? First, it calls for the establishment of “a target for the completion of new homes in high-cost cities that increases 15% every year and ties federal infrastructure funding allocated to high-cost cities to that target”. Essentially, municipalities would have a target for new home construction, and if they exceed that target, they would get a bonus, but if they fail to meet that target, they would lose out on some federal funding. It would use federal funds to stimulate municipalities to take action to allow the construction of more homes in their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595713">It would create an incentive for municipalities at the local level to remove red tape that prevents new home construction. It would not be prescriptive on how they do it. It would respect the principle of subsidiarity, allowing local decision-making around development, but it would set vitally necessary targets in order to move us forward in the direction we need, which is building more homes in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595714">The bill would “provide for the reallocation of $100 million from the Housing Accelerator Fund to municipalities that greatly exceed housing targets”. That is about rewarding municipalities that exceed their target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595715">Next is requiring “that federal transit funding provided to certain cities be held in trust until high-density residential housing is substantially occupied on available land around federally funded transit projects' stations”. In other words, if the federal government is putting money into a big transit project, it is common sense that we would expect that there be substantial new housing built around those transit stations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595716">That is a reasonable thing for the federal government to expect in the process of providing the funding. We would not want to see big new transit projects that were not associated with people's ability to actually live at and around where the transit stations are. The bill would also “make it a condition for certain cities to receive federal infrastructure transit funding that they not unduly restrict or delay the approval of building permits for housing”.</ParaText>

It will focus not on good thoughts and good intentions, but on good results and on the common good.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595733"> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is right to situate what we are talking about in the context of this report within the larger context of a government that does not care about results. It seems to believe it ought to be judged on its intentions instead of on the results it produces. However, Canadians are struggling and suffering, and they are not comforted by the fact that the government purports to have good intentions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595734"> There are other examples of this failure to be concerned with results that I was going to get to and did not have the chance. One issue we are studying right now at the government operations committee is indigenous contracting. The government has a policy that is supposed to benefit indigenous businesses, yet it has been inept at actually determining who and what an indigenous business is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595741">Madam Speaker, Canadians are increasingly worried about the broken promises, half measures and watered down policies of the Liberals. Time and time again, we see the government exempt companies that are making record profits while their emissions go up and up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595742">This summer, we heard from concerned environmental groups that the government was going to once again walk back its promises when it comes to delivering a strong, sustainable finance framework. We were appalled but not surprised to find out the government was looking at including fossil fuels in its sustainable labelling system. This means the government believes that some fossil fuels are considered sustainable. This is completely unacceptable. It is greenwashing the actions of the big banks, it is greenwashing fossil fuel companies and it begs the question of why the Liberals are doing this greenwashing dirty work for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595743">Canadian banks are already among the worst in the world when it comes to funding the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas sector is now the only sector in the Canadian economy that is increasing its emissions, not reducing them. For that, it is being rewarded. Recently, the Competition Bureau and Ad Standards have been investigating greenwashing in advertisements about the claims made by big oil on clean gas. If the Liberals include fossil fuel subsidies in the taxonomy, they will join oil and gas lobbyists in misleading Canadians. Also, reports show that when emissions are included from production, processing, pipeline transportation, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification of gas, exporting it will not reduce global climate emissions, as the oil and gas industry claims, but will make global warming worse over the next three decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595744">The Conservatives and big oil love to point to China's coal use as the reason we need to continue expanding oil and gas in Canada, yet the amount of wind and solar power under construction in China is now nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined. According to recent reports, new research shows that fossil fuels could displace this renewable energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595745">The Liberals are listening to the misinformation spread by Conservatives and oil and gas lobbyists. Maybe this should not surprise me, because the government has met with oil and gas lobbyists over 1,200 times. That is nearly five times a day. Our planet is burning, and the Liberals continue to listen to oil and gas lobbyists instead of climate experts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595746">Environmental experts are saying they would rather see no sustainable finance taxonomy than one that includes fossil fuels. Greenwashing the sustainable financing labelling system is the wrong choice. Can the member confirm whether the government will be once again caving to the interests of big banks and big oil and gas? Will it make loopholes that allow fossil fuels to be labelled as sustainable?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8595747">Madam Speaker, as I have said many times before in the House after debating with the hon. member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, and generally, with any non-Conservative member who would like to talk about fighting climate change, lowering our emissions and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, it is heartening to be able to discuss how we fight climate change, not if we fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595748"> It does seem, however, that the Conservatives are hell-bent on increasing our emissions. Indeed, the failed former leader of the Conservative Party, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, seems to believe that Canadian emissions are actually superior, that they are better than emissions from other places. He often says a CO2 molecule does not have a passport. That is true. That means one emitted in India, Canada or China is relatively equivalent in that manner, so we need to be focusing on global solutions as well as our carbon footprint here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595749">We have proven measures to lower our carbon emissions here in Canada. It is true that Canada is about 0.5% of the global population, with a little bit more than 40 or 41 million people. Out of 8 billion, that is 0.5%. However, we are responsible for more than 1.5% of global emissions. That means, through basic math, that a Canadian is unfortunately responsible for three times the global average. That is because we are a developed country, and we are an oil and gas-producing country. We are rather wealthy. We heat our homes in the winter, and we cool them down in the summer. We know that all of those activities need to change over time. That is why our government is bringing forward a taxonomy for the sustainable finance of the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595750">Back in 2021, Canada signed the Glasgow statement, where we committed to end new and direct support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector. We are also the first oil and gas producing nation in the world to put a cap on oil and gas emissions. We are taking huge steps forward on conservation, committing to 30% of Canada's land mass to be conserved by 2030. Just recently, a little bit more than a year ago, in July 2023, the Government of Canada released the inefficient fossil fuel subsidy assessment framework and its guidelines, which will ensure that all federal government subsidies provided to any fossil fuel industry align with the climate agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595751">Oftentimes, the NDP likes to paint all fossil fuel subsidies or any kind of support for the energy sector with the same brush. That is not just simplistic, but it is also the wrong approach. Some oil and gas subsidies go to clean up orphan wells, and others make sure that we have energy, sovereignty and solutions in the far north. Those things are important. However, we are also at the same time taking concrete action to eliminate those inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. That is not all we are doing. Over the past couple of years, the government has worked to transform Canada's financial sector and provide the enabling conditions to align private capital with our sustainability goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595752"> In budget 2022, the federal government committed to moving towards mandatory reporting of climate-related finance risks across the Canadian economy. As the member knows, because we sit at the environment committee together as colleagues, this includes new requirements for federally regulated financial institutions to disclose climate-related risks. Our government believes that big polluters should be held responsible for their actions. In line with that commitment, effective fiscal year-end 2024, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which is OSFI, published its guidelines for the management of those climate-related risks. I am happy to say that, in a very short time, we are going to have what is called a taxonomy, so a list, a glossary of terms for the sustainable finance of the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595761">Madam Speaker, my intervention is about corrections but I have to correct something that the hon. member just said a second ago, that our emissions were down 8%. Our emissions were up several thousand per cent last year, 2023, because our forests were on fire. We became the world's third largest emitter. The lousy forestry practices of the government are a substantial contributor to that ecological catastrophe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595762">I am here to follow up on a question I raised on September 27 regarding a conflict of interest in which cows have been purchased from members of an advisory group styled “prison farm advisory panel” in Joyceville, Ontario. This panel was set up by the Liberals as a first step in fulfilling their 2015 election promise to reopen the prison farm at Joyceville, which at that time had recently been shut down. The minister's approval of the panel's request to include cows in their plan for a reopened prison farm was contingent on the panel's assurance that this would be an achievable goal at “no extra cost” within the farm's original $4.3-million budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595763">However, following a litany of errors, the costs of constructing the cow barn have ballooned to $16 million. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that in order to create a situation in which these cows would be purchased and thereby financially benefit the members of the advisory panel, it has been necessary to spend many millions of dollars that would not have been spent had the project actually been about what it was supposed to be about, which was providing job training to inmates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595764">The entire reason for reopening the farm, the entire ostensible reason, was that the newly elected Liberal government rejected Corrections Canada's rationale for shutting down the farm. The rationale was that, in the form in which it then existed, the prison farm was not teaching marketable job skills to inmates and thus was not helping them to reintegrate into the community. The Liberals brushed this reasoning aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595765">Immediately following the 2015 election, the then-minister of public safety, Ralph Goodale asked Corrections Canada to outline options and recommendations for reopening the prison farm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595766">In a November 2015 briefing note, the CSC responded that prison farms did not enhance offender employment. CSC pointed out that prison farms are actually counterproductive. They actually lead to less employment and more recidivism because they direct financial resources away from more effective offender training programs. CSC was particularly opposed to reintroducing dairy operations. Instead, CSC recommended that if a prison farm program did have to be opened, it should have minimal start-up costs, no expensive equipment or infrastructure, and must at a minimum break even.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595767">To achieve these goals, CSC recommended small plot farming in lucrative specialty crops, such as lavender and garlic, which former inmates would be able to grow in small amounts with limited capital investment and to sell at venues such as farmers' markets that are open to someone with a history as an offender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595768">All of this was ignored and, at present, the plan is to hand this $16-million barn over to McGill University. The barn will be staffed by four people, none of whom will be inmates. CSC has identified only two offender positions related to the dairy research and this is in basic data entry. Otherwise, prisoners will gain only generic soft skills from doing groundskeeping tasks such as whipper-snipping. These are activities that prisoners were already engaged in before this project came along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595769">Why has so much money been spent on something that will achieve so little to prevent recidivism—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8595771"> Madam Speaker, the Government of Canada remains committed to evidence-based policy that is informed by experts. That is why a prison farm advisory panel was established back in 2017. The panel works to bring together agricultural and farming leaders, among others, to provide informed recommendations on program ideas and how we can better protect our communities through offender rehabilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595772"> Regarding the claims being made, there has been no preferential treatment or conflict of interest. All decisions have been open and transparent and made to ensure the value for money for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595773">CSC works to support local farmers and local communities where the penitentiary agriculture program operates. All cattle are chosen specifically based on criteria such as their health, age, size and production capacity, as well as overall costs. At no point is a vendor selected based on who the seller is, and procurement costs are always determined based on fair market value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595774">CSC has a long history of supporting local farmers. For example, in 2011, following the closure of CORCAN farm operations at the Collins Bay and Joyceville institutions, CSC signed leave and licence agreements so local farmers could use the lands for agricultural purposes. Today, farmland is being maintained and utilized through the penitentiary farm program, which has included rebuilding land and crop production and incorporating environmental considerations and opportunities in planning and utilization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595775">I am proud to note that CSC is recognized as an international leader in the development and delivery of correctional interventions. The penitentiary agriculture program helps federal inmates gain employment skills to find meaningful employment in the community, which enhances reintegration and reduces recidivism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595776">The farms at the Joyceville and Collins Bay institutions provide on-the-job and vocational training that relates to the agricultural industry, but is also transferable to other industries to help support offenders in their reintegration. Research dating back to earlier than 2014 has found that inmates who participate in the CORCAN employment programs while incarcerated are more likely to be granted parole and more likely to get a job in the community. As we know, offenders who find jobs in the community are three times less likely to reoffend. Programs such as those offered by the penitentiary agriculture program contribute to safer communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595777"> I would like to thank members of the panel, who have helped contribute to the success of these farms. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8595780">Madam Speaker, today is the first anniversary of the horrible October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. One year later, we continue to grieve with the families who lost loved ones and with the survivors of sexual and other forms of violence who carry the scars of that terrible day. We continue to demand the release of the many hostages who remain captive. We need to bring them home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595781"> My grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. Growing up and learning about the Holocaust, I was always haunted and perplexed by the images of Holocaust victims. It is with these images in mind that Jews today fight back against those who try to kill them. It is good, right and necessary that peoples and nations defend themselves. While self-defence can be morally complicated and necessarily involves the making of difficult distinctions, it remains absolutely necessary for a people with the will to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595782"> At the root of this conflict is the aggression sponsored by the Iranian regime. This regime is pursuing a threefold strategy in the Middle East: to demonize Israel, to thwart regional peace efforts and to use the struggle with Israel as cover to colonize Arab states through terrorist proxies. This strategy responds to significant strides that have been made in the pursuit of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours. It is wrong to suppose some inevitable antagonism between Jews and Muslims or between Israel and Arab states. Israel has, in fact, normalized relations and is actively collaborating with a growing number of regional partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595783">However, in response to this collaboration, Iran's regime seeks to unite Israel's remaining opponents and use them for colonial expansion against other regional rivals. While Israel is the primary rhetorical enemy, Iran and its proxies are also waging a campaign to destroy and subjugate other states in the region, starting with Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. These, along with the Gaza Strip, are now places where the regime ruthlessly suppresses its opponents and stages attacks against Israel that are aimed at undermining regional peace efforts and creating further opportunities for the Iranian regime's expansion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595784"> We have good reason to believe that the Iranian regime specifically wanted the October 7 attacks and directed them in order to create the conditions in which the expansion of the Abraham Accords, particularly the expansion to include Saudi Arabia, would be much more difficult. Given this context, the Iranian regime will not accept a ceasefire as long as its strategy continues to advance its real objective, which is the subjugation of its Arab neighbours. The real path to peace, therefore, runs through the weakening of the capacity of the Iranian regime; the strengthening of popular movements against the regime, inside Iran and elsewhere; and the strengthening of engagement with regional players who have an interest and a capacity to make and enforce regional peace. These are things that we have long called for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595785"> More than six years ago, the House passed my motion calling for the listing of the IRGC as a terrorist organization. While this has now finally happened, the failure to act for so long gave the regime extensive runway to continue to operate, recruit and fundraise here on Canadian soil. Much damage has already been done as a result of this senseless delay. In government, Conservatives would take swift action against the Iranian regime and its proxies. That action would be in support of the people of Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran itself, all of which have been victims of this terrorist regime. We reject doctrines that demonize whole peoples, and we call for the liberation of all peoples from Iranian domination. The Iranian regime is the greatest threat to the sovereignty and self-determination of peoples in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595786">Here in Canada, the principal concern that I hear from many Jewish and Muslim leaders is about security. For everyone, Canada feels less safe than it once did. Foreign interference, attacks on different communities, the dramatic rise in anti-Semitism and an increase in crime in general leave many people feeling that they are a long way from home. While working for peace and justice everywhere, we must place the highest priority on the security of all people here in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595787">Madam Speaker, before beginning my remarks, I would like to acknowledge that today is the one-year anniversary of the terrorist organization Hamas's launching a horrifying attack against Israel. Our government stands with Jewish people and Israelis on this painful anniversary, and we will not relent until every last hostage is returned home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595788">As the member opposite knows, on June 19, our government listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC, as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code. The Iranian regime has consistently displayed a complete disregard for human rights both inside and outside Iran, as well as a willingness to destabilize the international rules-based order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595789">Listing the IRGC builds on the Government of Canada's broader efforts to ensure that there is no impunity for Iran's unlawful actions and its support of terrorism. The decision to list IRGC through the Criminal Code listing regime sends a strong message that Canada will use all tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist activity of the IRGC conducted both unilaterally and in knowing association with listed terrorist entities such as Hezbollah and Hamas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595790">As a now-listed entity, the IRGC meets the definition of a terrorist group under Canada's Criminal Code. As an immediate consequence of this listing, Canadian financial institutions, such as banks and brokerages, are required to immediately freeze the property of the listed entity. It is a criminal offence for anyone in Canada and Canadians abroad to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by a terrorist group. As my hon. colleague knows, listing the IRGC is one of the tools the government has used to limit the threat posed by the Iranian regime and to call out its undermining of peace and stability in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595791">We have been and remain resolute in our determination to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its support of terrorism and systemic human rights abuses. The government holds Iran accountable for its actions with a wide suite of additional tools, including listing key entities and proxy actors in Iran's so-called “Axis of Resistance” under the Criminal Code terrorist-listing regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595792">Since 2012, Canada has continuously upheld the listing of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps force as a terrorist entity. The force is Iran's primary tool for terrorist operations in providing arms, funding and paramilitary training to other terrorist groups, including the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, as well as other destabilizing forces, like the Houthi, which continues to attack civilian ships in the Red Sea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595793">Again, Canada imposes various measures against Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It has been and continues to be sanctioned under the Special Economic Measures Act, SEMA, which explicitly targets IRGC, its leadership, and several suborganizations, including the IRGC air force and air force missile command.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595794">Since October 2022, Canada has imposed 17 rounds of SEMA sanctions targeting 155 individuals and 89 entities at all levels of Iran's security, intelligence and economic apparatus, including on April 24 listing Iran's minister of defence. All told, 446 Iranian individuals and entities have had their Canadian assets frozen under SEMA.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595795"> Madam Speaker, I would also like to comment on the Iranian regime's role in fomenting violence in Sudan. Sudan is in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation, and the Iranian regime's support for one of the belligerents fighting in that terrible civil war is contributing to the crisis. Estimates are that over 2.5 million people will die in Sudan this year. To put that in perspective, that is more than the entire population of the Gaza Strip.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8595796">The horrors in Sudan and how other actors are fuelling that conflict desperately need more attention from the House, from the government and from governments throughout the world. This is another example of the Iranian regime's sowing violence and discord around the world. The member mentioned that six years after the House voted to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization, the Liberals finally did it. My question is simple: Why did it take so long? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8595798">The member opposite is correct: The situation in Sudan is truly tragic. It is precisely why the government continues to take all of the necessary actions to destabilize terrorist entities here at home and abroad. We will continue to do this work and list additional individuals where needed. We have various tools, as I have laid out: not only listing but using our SEMA sanctions and our special economic measures through that act.</ParaText>
