              <ParaText id="8642518">My community is no exception. At Grand Valley Institution, the percentage of indigenous incarcerated folks has even increased by 10% since 2020. It is what makes the work of incredible organizations centring reconciliation in their justice system all the more vital. The Healing of the Seven Generations' bail release supervision program helps folks break generational trauma and prevent recidivism as well as community justice initiatives. Its stride program helps incarcerated folks heal and build the community connections that help them to be successful after release.</ParaText>

I am very proud because, for all those years, I have dedicated my life to doing what I love most, and that is giving back. Small business owners tend to be generous with their time and money. They share their innovative ideas and create wealth for all our communities. Small business owners are creators above all. They create wealth, jobs, attractive living environments, investments and community infrastructure by giving back. Their ultimate goal is to make their community a better place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642525">I salute the hard work of all these small business owners, who fight day in, day out to succeed, grow and thrive in a constantly changing world. Small businesses like mine, with fewer than 50 employees, are the backbone of this country. They never run short of challenges, but that is a good thing, because challenges breed innovation and excellence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642526">I wish all small businesses across Canada a happy Small Business Week.</ParaText>

As president, he has given us confidence in the agricultural future of our beautiful region.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8642557">As a member of Parliament representing a vibrant community of people from Sikh and Hindu backgrounds, I recognize the deep ties that bind Canada and India, yet the chilling evidence presented by the RCMP reveals a betrayal of our shared values. It is unacceptable that foreign agents would operate with impunity on our soil, terrorizing communities and threatening our safety. We have seen extortion, arson, threats and even loss of life instilling fear in the South Asian community, with the particular targeting of Sikh Canadians. This is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642558">Every Canadian deserves to live with safety, free from intimidation and violence, regardless of their beliefs or heritage. Our government has taken significant steps to confront these threats, but we must also stand united as a community, Sikhs and Hindus alike. We cannot allow fear to divide us. We must support one another and advocate for justice, accountability and the protection of our rights. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8642564">Now, according to an article from the Salvation Army, the food bank in Kenora is challenged just to keep stock on its shelves. Rising demand and food costs are making it difficult for people to be able to afford to make donations. In fact, the food bank has been forced to reduce the number of visits per month for each guest, and this will only get worse if the costly coalition quadruples the carbon tax, which will cost Ontario families $1,400 per year in carbon tax alone. In addition, the Parliamentary Budget Officer has once again confirmed that Canadians pay more in the tax than they get back in rebates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642565">We know that the government and this carbon tax are not worth the cost. Canadians want to know when they will have a chance to vote in a carbon tax election so that they can vote to axe the tax and bring home lower prices. </ParaText>

That is exactly why we have stepped up to put money on the table for municipalities as they change their densification rules and zoning laws to accelerate the process of building housing, and continue to solve this housing crisis that Canadians are facing from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

It is no surprise that, after nine years of the Liberal government, Statistics Canada reports that violent crime has risen by 50%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642821">The people of Swan River see crime in the streets every day, and that is why they are calling for jail, not bail, for repeat violent offenders. The people of Swan River demand that the Liberal government repeal its soft-on-crime policies, which directly threaten their livelihoods and their community. I support the good people of Swan River.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8642831">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to request an emergency debate in this chamber, consistent with other emergency debates that have taken place, with regard to the subject matter of the trade route on the Windsor-Detroit corridor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642832"> In less than one week, on October 29, the Government of Canada, unless there is intervention, will permit class 3 and class 8 hazardous waste materials to cross the American-owned Ambassador Bridge. This would be detrimental to our economy; basically, 24% of the national trade between Canada and the United States takes place on this bridge. It has the drinking water for millions of people, the largest fresh water supply in the world and an ecosystem that is right on our doorstep. The material, which includes battery components, battery fluid, hydraulic acid and other things, will cross an over 90-year-old bridge, which is going to cost us with respect to traffic management and ecosystem difficulty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642833"> It was cleared by the Michigan Department of Transportation after it did a thorough investigation on its side about the routing, but that has never been done on the Canadian side. In fact, the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario did not even make a submission on this with respect to the negligence. The City of Windsor and the Windsor Fire and Rescue Services have opposed it. Many different individuals on the U.S. side have also opposed this. None of them have done any of this work, and there is currently no plan in place to deal with a spill or the materials that could get into our drinking water. It could also cause a backup and a delay in traffic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642834">This chamber was seized with the blockade of this route in 2022 because it cost the Canadian economy billions of dollars. In fact, in Sarnia, just a month ago, a small leakage that could have been cleaned up properly, as facilitated through a process, shut down that bridge for several hours. That is hundreds of millions of dollars that would take place in the Canadian economy. Not only that, but we do not even have the fire and rescue services plan yet to deal with those issues, so we cannot even use some of the proper techniques necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642835"> Further to that, the CBSA union and the CIU, which has been doing the oversight on this, have not even been trained or notified by the government with regard to the issue. Therefore, there is no protocol in place, and the City of Windsor is scrambling to deal with this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642836">There have been no public hearings. There have been no consultations with the indigenous communities that I am aware of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642837">The potential danger of explosions and accidents is expanded because the small bridge capacity on the plazas is something that will create further problems that will not be able to be addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642838">The Windsor-Detroit ferry service operation has been opposed to this. It closed just recently. For over 30 years, it brought the materials across in a safe way, with a perfect record. Only recently, through lobbying in the United States, did this change take place at the Michigan Department of Transportation. This is what is odd: We have ceded our sovereignty to the Michigan Department of Transportation, and the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada have not even made representations on this. In fact, they have stood down on it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642839">A number of different issues have arisen on this bridge in the past. In fact, we had to bring in a law in this country, called the International Bridges and Tunnels Act, because the private property before that was something that we could not even deal with. We had no laws in this country to deal with it. However, because of the behaviour and the management of the Ambassador Bridge, a new law was crafted and created in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642840">In summary, I want to make sure that we have a chance to discuss this issue in Parliament. If we do not act right now, the routes of those vehicles will change. They are going to go into densely urban areas on the Detroit and Windsor sides. In addition, we do not have any plan in place to date to deal with this issue and, if there is a problem, the consequence to the economy will be significant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642841">This is an over 90-year-old structure that will have corrosive materials expanded to its system; they could even cause permanent damage. Basic questions relating to firefighter training have not even been provided for right now. There is no plan or support for that. There has been no containment or environmental concern plan developed by the federal or provincial government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642842">There is a fuel-specific risk that could expand the complications of it, and we do not even know if the Ambassador Bridge authority has provided the proper economic impact assessment for its insurance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642843">I conclude by asking for this to be looked at tonight, because the Government of Canada has to act. If we do not act right now, a private American billionaire and the Michigan Department of Transportation are going to determine the fate of the international crossing that crosses not only Detroit, Michigan, but from Montreal all the way to Florida. This is with respect to the trade and traffic of 25% of the Canadian economy, as well as the drinking water of millions of people and an ecosystem that is very fragile. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642844">This has been denied on this 90-year-old bridge to date. A process is in place wherein, in a matter of months, within the year or just soon after, the Gordie Howe International Bridge will open up with the best standards for containment, capture and design for that, similar to Sarnia, which has this in place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642845"> It is very suspicious that after all these decades of denying access to these types of capabilities on the bridge, this is being provided when the solution is right in front of us. There is a looming deadline and we have no plans whatsoever in place. Not even union workers or the fire department in the city of Windsor have been trained on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642846">Why would we change things right now? We have safe crossing solutions in Sarnia at the moment. We will have the Gordie Howe International Bridge open very soon. The chamber needs to discuss this because so much of our economy and ecosystems are at risk. They are very unique and could be permanently damaged. The risk factors are so significant that the history of our crossing, with the freedom of the Underground Railroad, will be disgraced, because if an accident happens, it will pollute one of the most magnificent pieces of fresh water in the world and one of the strongest economic links to our number one trading partner.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8642849">Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, the regular business of this chamber has been put on hold because of the Liberal government's refusal to produce the documents ordered by the House. Parliament is, in fact, seized by this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642850">We are unable to get back to the regular business of this place. Whether it is the doubling of housing costs, Liberal food inflation or the crime and chaos in our streets, there are many pressing issues that deserve the attention of the House. However, this privilege motion must be dealt with. We must ensure that Parliament has the powers necessary to hold the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642851">To be clear, the Liberal government has the power to bring this debate to an end. The Liberals could choose today to comply with the production order that was adopted by this House and affirm the collective parliamentary privileges of this chamber. Instead, they continue to dig their heels into the sand. The Liberal government is more preoccupied with the protection of those involved in the Sustainable Development Technology Canada green slush fund than they are with ensuring the integrity of this institution and the health of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642852">Parliamentary privileges are vital to the proper functioning of Parliament. These privileges ensure that the House and its members are protected from undue interference so that we can hold the government to account. This includes the collective privilege of the House of Commons to order and compel the production of documents that it deems necessary to carry out its duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642853">The Conservative motion adopted this past spring ordering the production of documents relating to the green slush fund does exactly that. The motion requests documents that are necessary to hold the government to account for its abuse and misuse of tax dollars through the green slush fund. The receipt of these documents will allow Parliament to provide proper scrutiny of the government's program and the government's spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642854">The Liberal government's refusal to provide the documents obstructs our collective ability to hold it to full account. The Chair's finding in this question of privilege is clear. The motion ordering the production of documents was adopted by the House and the request itself was clear, but the government has not complied with it. The redaction of certain documents and, in other cases, the outright refusal to provide documents are unacceptable. Withholding this evidence is a breach of the House's parliamentary privilege, and the impact of this failure to comply with the production order is not to be underestimated. The impact goes beyond just this particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642855">The Liberal government's actions are once again eroding the public's confidence in this institution. The corruption that has been exposed in the SDTC green slush fund is shocking and chips away at public trust in the government. If there is no real accountability for those involved in the corruption, it would be a massive hit to the confidence of Canadians in the checks and balances of this public institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642856">Trust in our public institutions is a fundamental pillar in a healthy democracy. The erosion of trust in the Canadian Parliament should not be taken lightly by any member of the House. Distrust in this institution breeds division, feeds cynicism and apathy and is ultimately a threat to our democracy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642857">While the Liberal government continues to stand in this place telling us to simply just move on, we cannot move on. We have a duty to Canadians to safeguard this institution, to ensure that the privileges of this House are not violated by a government with something to hide and to ensure those who brazenly misuse and abuse Canadian taxpayer dollars are held to account. We as members of Parliament have a duty to fight back against the erosion of trust that is being fuelled by the Liberal government's obstructive tactics. Accountability and transparency are the remedies to the distrust that has been sown by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642858"> That is why common-sense Conservatives continue to stand firm with our demands. We have a responsibility to Canadians and to the constituents who elected us to this place. The corruption that ran rampant in SDTC cannot go unchecked. The evidence related to the green slush fund must be handed in so that a criminal investigation can be conducted. Those who knowingly and intentionally stole or misused public funds must be held to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642859"> The Auditor General's report on SDTC is incredibly damning. In fact, when we read the Auditor General's report, we see there is no question that SDTC became a slush fund for Liberal insiders. SDTC awarded money to ineligible projects, and these projects clearly did not meet the goals or objectives of the program. However, they were still handed taxpayer funds. In total, at least $59 million went to projects that were not even allowed to receive money. According to the Auditor General, no steps were taken to recover funds used for ineligible projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642860"> It is clear that ultimately, it is a failure of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor these contracts. The minister failed Canadian taxpayers by not ensuring that public dollars were being used appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642861">The ineligible projects are just the tip of the iceberg in this scandal. In addition to identifying the funding of ineligible projects, the Auditor General identified 186 cases of the SDTC board of directors violating the Conflict of Interest Act, and that in 90 cases they directly violated their own conflict of interest policies, conflicts of interest that were identified using SDTC's own records. Those are public funds awarded to Liberal insiders, with case after case of connected Liberals getting ahead using taxpayer dollars. In some of these cases, projects received funding despite being both ineligible for funding and tied to a conflict of interest. That means Liberal insiders were awarding themselves or their friends taxpayer funds for projects that, by all accounts, they should have known were ineligible for funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642862"> Let us not forget that the chair of the SDTC green slush fund, who was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government, awarded $217,000 to her own company. The chair of the fund awarded her company these funds even though the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act clearly states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8642864">Conflict of interest policies and directives are necessary to protect the interests of Canadian taxpayers, but the SDTC green slush fund did not follow the Conflict of Interest Act or even SDTC's own conflict of interest policies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642865">The complete disregard for established conflict of interest practices calls into question all of the decisions that were made by SDTC, yet the Liberal government allowed the continued misuse of taxpayers' dollars to go on. The Auditor General was very clear in her findings that the blame for this scandal lies at the feet of the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>. The minister failed to ensure that this billion-dollar fund had the oversight necessary to ensure the good stewardship of public funds. While the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> seems comfortable to allow this corruption to go on with no accountability, common-sense Conservatives are not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642866">The corruption at the Liberal’s SDTC green slush fund is evident and cannot be swept under the rug. That is why the House adopted the Conservative motion on June 10, ordering the production of documents in relation to the Liberal’s SDTC green slush fund. Those documents contain evidence of the corruption at the fund and should be handed over so that there can be a criminal investigation. Those documents were supposed to be received within 14 days of the passage of that motion. It has now been more than four months since the adoption of that motion, and the evidence has not been turned in. This is a violation of a house order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642867">It is a breach of parliamentary privilege, yet still, after weeks of the House being seized with this issue, the Liberal government does not want to hand it over. It would rather grind Parliament to a halt than hand over the evidence. We already know that 400 million taxpayer dollars were misused on projects that were ineligible or tied to conflicts of interest. The question then becomes this: What more are the Liberals hiding? What is buried in that evidence that they are so desperate to hide? What is more damning than what has already been revealed? There is another question: Who on those benches are they trying to protect? If the government has nothing to hide, then it would only make sense to bring everything to light to ensure that those who were responsible are held accountable. By not ensuring the production of documents requested, the Liberal government is actively covering up the evidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642868">What is truly shameful is that this is not the Liberal government’s first breach of parliamentary privilege in an attempt to cover up its failed governance. The Winnipeg lab cover-up is yet another example. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was so desperate to keep the Winnipeg lab documents hidden, he fought tooth and nail to cover up the details surrounding the ability of the People’s Republic of China to penetrate our nation’s maximum security lab. He was so desperate to keep hidden the evidence that scientists secretly collaborated with the PRC’s top military scientists. This breach posed a threat to Canada and our allies, but the Prime Minister’s primary preoccupation was keeping hidden the details of this massive national security failure. The Liberal government went so far as to defy four parliamentary orders and take the former House of Commons Speaker to court. Then, of course, we all know that the Prime Minister ultimately called a snap election to wipe the decks clean. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642869">Parliamentary privileges exist to ensure that members of Parliament can carry out their duty to hold the government to account. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is once again trying to cover things up, and we cannot allow this latest breach of parliamentary privilege to go unchecked. Quite frankly, Canadians cannot afford for the Prime Minister and his corruption to go unchecked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642870">It is absolutely disgusting that, while Canadians across the country are struggling to feed, heat and house themselves, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government allowed 400 million of taxpayers' dollars to be wasted or stolen by well-connected Liberals. This corruption is a slap in the face to every hard-working Canadian who is bringing a paycheque home and still struggling to put food on the table. After nine years in office, that is the record of the NDP-Liberal government: over nine million Canadians experiencing food insecurity. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642871"> Food insecurity has increased 111% under the government's watch. That means that nine million Canadians do not know where their next meal is coming from. Food Banks Canada has reported that almost 50% of Canadians feel financially worse off than they did last year; 25% of Canadians are experiencing food insecurity; and, across the country, food banks have seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021. That is the result of the NDP-Liberal government's failed policies, such as the costly and punishing carbon tax, which it continues to double down on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642872">The carbon tax is adding to the input costs of groceries at every single point in the supply chain. It is taxing the farmers, the processors, the shippers and the grocers. At the end of the day, those costs are passed on to Canadians at the grocery stores, but of course, it affects more than just groceries. The punishing carbon tax is increasing the cost of everything. It is adding to the cost of basic necessities, such as fuel, food and home heating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642873">In the midst of this affordability crisis and record inflation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his NDP coalition partners have repeatedly voted to hike the carbon tax, and they remain hell-bent on quadrupling it. Canadians are facing financial hardship because of the Prime Minister's taxes and his inflationary deficits. The Prime Minister's reckless deficits have pushed inflation to its highest level in 40 years and have driven up interest and mortgage rates. The Prime Minister's inflation has eroded the paycheques of Canadians, but not all Canadians are impacted in the same way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642874">The PBO has confirmed that lower-income Canadians are disproportionately impacted. The paycheques of Canadians cannot even afford the lifestyle they had just a few years ago. That is because paycheques cannot keep up with the skyrocketing costs of food, shelter and transportation, but while low-income Canadians struggle to stretch their paycheques, the wealthiest Canadians have seen their wealth grow. That means that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inflationary deficits and taxes have resulted in a wealth transfer to the wealthiest Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642875">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is causing financial misery for those Canadians who can afford it the least, and at the same time, the Prime Minister and the Liberal government are allowing public funds to be spent unchecked. That is unacceptable. It is ethically and morally objectionable. The Liberal government's deficits year over year are fuelling inflation, and there is $400 million in misused funds that are adding fuel to the fire, fuel that is making it harder for Canadians to make ends meet, not to mention the countless better uses there could be for those dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642876"> This cover-up must come to an end. Canadians must get the accountability and transparency that they deserve. The Liberal government's repeated breaches of parliamentary privilege, ethics violations and corruption scandals have broken the trust and confidence of Canadians in this institution. This is further weakened when Canadians continue to see their financial situations deteriorate while well-connected Liberal insiders are getting rewarded. Trust in our public institution is built on transparency and accountability. Ending the cover-up would help us to take steps toward restoring that trust and strengthening the resilience of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642877">The amended motion that we are considering today lays out clear instructions for the committee on procedure and House affairs. It is already clear that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> failed to protect the misuse of taxpayer dollars, and if the Liberal government is going to continue to impede the release of evidence, then it is vital that this issue be given the fulsome and careful consideration that it requires. The stakes are high, and the Liberal government's dismissive attitude is to not treat this issue with the seriousness that it deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642878">The government's continued fight against transparency and avoidance of accountability threatens the health of our democracy. The Liberal government must hand over the unredacted evidence, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must end the cover-up so that Parliament can get back to regular business.</ParaText>

I do want to share a little bit of history of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642924"> We all remember, in 2016, the cash-for-access fundraisers that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was hosting. He wanted to get donations for his party so certain Liberal insiders, certain lobbyists, could have access to the government. Only a select few, his friends and people who supported the Liberal Party's agenda, get access to him. The last I remember, “prime minister” means “first servant”. The Prime Minister is for everyone, for all Canadians equally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642925"> There was the 2017 Aga Khan scandal, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> accepted a family vacation. For the first time in history, the prime minister violated conflict of interest guidelines. He was found in violation of four sections of the act. However, he just brushed it off. He said that the Aga Khan was a personal friend. He was a personal friend who was a billionaire. Canadians do not have that option; they do not have friends with private islands giving them free vacations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642926">In 2019, there was the SNC-Lavalin scandal, with bribery and pressure from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who even pushed senior cabinet ministers out because they would not listen to him. Jody Wilson-Raybould was one victim, one casualty, whom the Prime Minister did not even hesitate to kick out of caucus. Why? It was because of his own personal gain. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants it his way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642927">Again, this comes back to the point I mentioned earlier: It is about entitlement. The Liberals think they know better. They think that they deserve better. It is always about them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642928"> We cannot forget the 2020 WE Charity scandal in 2020. It was all over the news and in the media. It was talked about in our communities. The government handed out a single-source contract, not open to other tendering, for $912 million to a charity that we all know has strong ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642929">The charity paid all expenses for different ministers who took trips and spoke at its events. They broke ethics law. We remember that the former finance minister, whom the Liberals now call a “random Liberal”, was forced to resign because of that scandal. It all comes back to the core trust that Canadians put in us: We will not act in our own best interests but in the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642930">One of the latest scandals was the arrive scam app. I have spoken about it in Parliament before as well. The app should have cost only $80,000. How much did it end up costing Canadians? It cost at least $60 million, and every single day we hear more about the scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642931">The app did not work. It wrongfully sent 10,000 Canadians into quarantine, away from their jobs, away from their families and sometimes paying the out-of-pocket expense to live in a hotel. All this was for an app that did not work, yet the Liberals gave a contract to their insiders. There were allegations of identity theft with the scandal, including fraudulent and forged resumes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642932">There were no checks and balances when it came to handing the contracts out. Even a small business owner knows, when hiring someone, to do some due diligence themself. The contract was for millions and millions of dollars. There was contractual theft. There was price-fixing and collusion in the scandal. Can people imagine if this were happening at a private sector corporation? What would be done to the CEO or to the executives? They would be fired and be criminally charged for this kind of behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642933">Again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not care. He continues to enable the behaviour. His senior bureaucrats were part of the scandals. The list is so long; I could be here all day. My whole 20 minutes could be spent on just listing all the scandals. I actually had to shorten them to try to fit in as many as I could today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642934">In 2023 there were the McKinsey contracts. How much money was involved? It was $209 million. Contracts were given to McKinsey &amp; Company without proper and adequate oversight. Many of the contracts were not competitive. They were given to the Liberals' insider friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642935">The point I am trying to make is that it is a pattern; it is not the first time. If the Liberals stay in power, it will not be the last time. Past behaviour predicts future behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642936">The Liberals try to appoint people in their departments and in their independent bodies who are supposed to oversee some of this stuff. In 2023, the Liberal government appointed Martine Richard as the Ethics Commissioner. Guess who she was. She was the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>'s sister-in-law. What a way to stop corruption: put one's own family in to investigate the corruption within our Parliament and to oversee the problem and the crisis. What do people think is going to come out of that? Nothing. Thankfully, she did not end up staying in the position, because that would have been another conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642937"> How many times is this going to keep happening, where the Liberals continue to break the trust of Canadians? It is a very sacred relationship. We are public servants. We come to this chamber to work for our communities, with integrity. Service over self is something I speak about quite a lot in my community. However, for Liberals, it seems like it is about insiders over service, which is why we are here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642938">Now we have a new scandal unfolding. Make no mistake; if it was not for the Conservatives pushing in committees and holding the Liberals accountable in question period, they would love to have this brushed under the rug as well. We are not going to let that happen. Conservatives will always be a strong opposition. We will hold the Liberal government to account every step of the way. </ParaText>

                <B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Arpan Khanna:</B> Madam Speaker, they can heckle me all they want; it is fine. We are not going to be quiet on this side of the House, because we want the truth to come out. Government members can try to heckle and try to delay. They can do whatever they want. We will always fight for the taxpayer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642941">In the new scandal we are talking about today, 400 million of Canadian taxpayers' hard-earned dollars have been misappropriated. The Auditor General, who is the independent body who oversees and demands accountability for these contracts, found 186 conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642942">There were people making decisions on contracts for their own benefit. One person would go out of the room, the vote would happen, the board would vote in favour and that person would come back and sit back down. The next person would get up and leave the room, the vote would happen and that person would get the contract and sit back down. That is not how we do business. That is corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642943">A lot of whistle-blowers came forward and shared their concerns. There was violation after violation and they still keep rolling out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642944">We have asked for these documents to be presented, unredacted, so we can get to the bottom of this scandal. The Speaker ruled on this. We all want the truth, but again, Liberals are not releasing the documents. It begs the question: What are they trying to hide? Who are they trying to protect? This $400 million is not a small amount of change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642945">We have seen Liberals paralyze Parliament because of the corruption and their cover-up. It is sometimes said that the crime is bad but the cover-up is even worse. We are seeing attempts every single day to cover this up. The money the Liberals have wasted on this scandal and every other scandal I listed earlier today is taxpayer money, which was not given to us easily. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642946">When I am in my riding, I hear from that single mother who is working double shifts and feels she is being taxed to death, but who sometimes believes the money that goes to the government might help her one day. She makes the sacrifice of being away from her family. I hear from that senior on a fixed income, on a fixed pension, who is getting clocked taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642947">I also hear from that owner of the mom-and-pop shop who has taken a massive line of credit, who took the risk of starting a business. The people who put all their life savings into these businesses are paying more taxes. When the Liberal government is taxing Canadians to death, each dollar means something. People are paying their taxes with their blood, sweat and tears. That money comes to the government. All people ask is that the money that gets spent helps make their lives better, is not wasted and is not given to the government's friends.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8642948">We know how tough life is right now. Two million Canadians are lining up at food banks and one in four are skipping meals. There are seniors who cannot afford medicine anymore. We have seen businesses shutting down, and 60% of Canadians are only $200 away from bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642949">We saw what happened in B.C., where 15,000 people lined up just to get a bag of rotten potatoes, or potatoes not fit for sale. People are struggling. Every dollar that goes out of their pockets makes it tougher for them to live and raise their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642950">Canada had a promise that the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation> spoke about today: If people worked hard in this country, they were able to save some money, buy that dream house and go on a vacation once in a while. However, when the government is taxing people to death and then recklessly spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' hard-earned money on itself, that is a problem. While Canadians line up at food banks, the government is lining the pockets of Liberal insiders. That is something quite concerning to all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642951">Conservatives take this very seriously because we hear this story every single day. When my colleagues and I are door knocking, when we are at events or meet-and-greets, this is a number one concern. Constituents say the government keeps taking more and more, and it keeps spending it recklessly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642952">Tax dollars come to the government, and what do the Liberals do? Line their own pockets. We have to keep reminding them this is not something that will go away; it is something we will keep fighting for. It is a scandal we are not going to let go away until the government brings these documents to the committee, has the RCMP investigate this and has some transparency and openness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642953">On this side of the House, we take this job very seriously. Seeing the Liberals not comply with the Speaker's ruling sends a very strong message that they are hiding something and that the problem is a lot bigger than what we may even know. On the Conservative side, we are going to keep fighting the good fight. We are going to get to the bottom of this scandal and we are not going to stop; we are relentless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642954">We are not going to stop fighting for Canadian taxpayers. We are going to make sure the documents come out, and we want this to stop paralyzing Parliament. We want to go back to our core values and our core message to fight for Canadians: We will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642955">We are not going to let the government continue to steal money from Canadians. It is not going to happen, at least not under our watch. Our ask to the Liberals, again and again, is to please release the documents, unredacted. This could all stop if they give us the documents. This will stop when they pay back the money that Canadians are owed. It is not their money; it is the Canadian taxpayers' money.</ParaText>

Consider the “in and out” scandal of 2006, when the Conservative Party transferred funds between its local and national campaigns and in the process exceeded the spending limits set out in election laws. As a result, it was found guilty and fined $50,000 for breaking election laws. Then there was the robocalls scandal, pertaining to calls that were made to give voters misleading information. It resulted in a nine-month prison sentence. The Conservative Party was guilty. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8642988"> Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this privilege motion regarding the failure of the government to produce documents pertaining to Sustainable Development Technology Canada. I look forward to offering my insights and to speak up for and on behalf of the hard-working people of York—Simcoe. This is their House, just as it is the House of all Canadians. It is not the Liberal government’s House, no matter how much it wishes that were true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642989">Peace, order and good government are the defining principles of our nation and have been since Confederation. For 157 years, these principles have underpinned the very promise of Canada, a promise that if people work hard, they can have a great life in a safe community. However, after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that promise is broken because the Liberal government has disregarded these fundamental principles and its obligations to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642990">There is no peace as Canadians suffer from skyrocketing crime and chaos in every community across the country because of the Liberals’ insane catch-and-release policies, policies that are putting dangerous repeat violent offenders, as well as hard drugs, back onto our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642991">There is no order as Canadians suffer from the economic vandalism the government has wrought on this country, as our people face rising costs, fewer jobs and smaller paycheques. At the same time, more taxpayer dollars are now being spent on servicing Liberal debt than on meaningful health care and infrastructure investments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642992">There is no good government, as the Liberals have shown time and time again that they are not concerned about what is best for our citizens. They are only preoccupied with improving their own political fortunes and lining the pockets of their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642993">A case in point is the matter before us now, a matter that has seized Parliament for weeks. The Liberal government has failed to turn over documents to the RCMP regarding a $400-million scandal that saw Liberal-appointed executives funnel money to their own companies, implicating them in 186 conflicts of interest. The Auditor General issued a damning report on this matter. She called out the former Sustainable Development Technology Canada agency for “significant lapses” in its oversight and management of taxpayer dollars. Once again, we are seeing the Liberals disrespect taxpayers to benefit other Liberals. The Liberals are blocking the legally ordered production of documents and dismissing the supremacy, will and authority of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642994">The government was given a choice, but instead of being accountable, respecting the work of Parliament and respecting the interests of Canadians, the Liberals have chosen to cover up the evidence involved in this scandal. The greed, corruption and conflicts of interest by Liberal appointees in this scandal are absolutely staggering, as are the lengths the Liberal government will go to cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642995">This is truly shameful, but it is not a surprise. After all, we have seen this many times before. There was the Aga Khan scandal, the cash for access affair, the SNC-Lavalin affair, the WE Charity controversy, clam scam, ArriveCAN and now the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642996">Time and time again, the Liberals have been found guilty for unacceptable ethical failings that have led to the inappropriate waste of significant amounts of public funds. Where does the blame lie for these failings? Certainly, every single Liberal across the way needs to take a good long look at themselves and what their “sunny ways” government has become. </ParaText>

In this case, the head is the head of the government, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is the Prime Minister who is ultimately responsible for his office, his staff, his ministers, his departments and the direction and policies of his government. It is the Prime Minister who has had to apologize on multiple occasions for breaking the law and for ethical violations. Members will remember when he said “it sucks” when he got caught, but his government does it time and time again. In doing so, the Prime Minister and his Liberal government have made a mockery of our conflict of interest laws by repeatedly flaunting them, with no consequences. By refusing to respect the will of the House and turn over documents related to the green slush fund, the Liberals are only further compromising the trust that Canadians have in our institutions and the entrenched processes we have here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642998">It is no wonder the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s record-low popularity has coincided with a historic distrust in our institutions among Canadians. According to a Leger poll released yesterday, the record-low trust in our institutions tracks with similar reports from the Edelman Trust Barometer, which has tracked low and declining trust in government for some time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8642999"> It is no wonder Canadians have such little faith in government and other institutions. Canadians are hurting, and they are disillusioned with the state of our country, a country where a healthy meal, a decent home, a safe community and a good quality of life are now out of reach for so many. When we see the lengths this government will go to entrench its Liberal insiders and friends and cover up wasteful spending, all while families can barely afford to make ends meet, they are absolutely incensed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643000">This reminds me of my by-election in February 2019. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal strategists thought they could flip York—Simcoe, and he made two well-publicized appearances at a chicken restaurant in Keswick. However, at that time, folks in York—Simcoe were very upset with the Prime Minister for his direct involvement in pressuring Jody Wilson-Raybould in the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair. I had heard that at just about every door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643001"> I remember a little story from after my win. When I was being sworn in, it was the first time I had ever met the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I was outside these very doors here and was very excited to represent the people of York—Simcoe. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> was excited. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278218" Type="2">Huron—Bruce</Affiliation> was excited and high-fiving me. When I was standing outside the doors, our leader at the time, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, was there. He said I would probably meet the Prime Minister and could shake his hand or not. I remember the leader of the NDP pacing back and forth; he wanted to go first, and I said I was just happy to be there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643002">Lo and behold, there came the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who walked up to me and said, “Scot, you have a lot of good people in York—Simcoe.” I said, “Mr. Prime Minister, we have some beauties.” He then said, “I was at a chicken restaurant twice in your riding”, and I said, “Mr. Prime Minister, I was trying to get you back a third time.” He asked why that was, and I said, “Because every time you came, I got 500 lawn sign requests.” Then he looked at me and I said, “Just kidding, Mr. Prime Minister.” Anyway, we had a laugh. However, all joking aside, five years on, the sentiment we felt in York—Simcoe then has now spilled out and is shared by folks on every street and town from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643003">Canadians want accountability. They want transparency. They want their government to act in the interest of Canadians. I truly believe that, right now, they are disappointed in the Liberals' conduct, their involvement in the green slush fund and other scandals, and their blatant efforts to cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643004">The unpopularity of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party as a whole can be traced right back to their contempt for Parliament and disinterest in the needs of Canadians, as well as the lengths they will go to look after their own and cover it all up. The green slush fund epitomizes all these things. The claim by the Liberals that the order to provide relevant documents to the RCMP would somehow compromise the investigation is absolutely bogus. If someone came to a police officer with information related to a crime, the police would not turn away and say, “No thanks, we are going to have to come about that on our own.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643005">RCMP officials, once in possession of the full, unredacted, unabridged documentation with regard to this matter, can assess for themselves its admissibility and relevance to their investigation. They can do this just as they have done with documents already received as part of this order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643006">Surprise, this is Parliament doing its job. This is our national police force doing its job. Unfortunately, wedged in the middle, we have the corrupt Liberal government intent on covering the whole thing up. The degree to which members opposite have sought to gaslight and mislead Canadians on the green slush fund is disheartening, to say the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643007">The Liberal government has attempted to invoke the charter when defending its indefensible position not to produce these documents. That is a joke. The Liberals were actually found in violation of the charter when they invoked the Emergencies Act in the winter of 2022. They were positively gleeful when trampling over the rights of Canadians back then, and now they want to suggest that enabling the RCMP to do its job through the production of documents somehow encroaches on the rights of individual citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643008"> I spoke earlier about a fish rotting from the head down. This is one of the biggest fish stories I have ever heard, if I ever heard one. Speaking of fish stories, by the way, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada</Affiliation>, whose department was responsible for the scandal-ridden Sustainable Development Technology Canada, claimed to Conservatives that they just need to move on from the scandal. He called it a political drama that was putting the clean tech sector at a disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643009">We know who wants to move on. The green slush fund happened right under his nose, and they have been found out for their role in this very concerning matter. The fact that legitimate businesses involved in reducing environmental impacts are being affected by this shows the real consequences of Liberal corruption and mismanagement in this country, never mind the amount of taxpayer money that has just been misspent and wasted by the Liberals. This has had a catastrophic impact on the environment far beyond just this one industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643010">I will remind members here tonight that the Lake Simcoe cleanup fund was cancelled by the Liberals in 2017, and they promised to bring it back. The <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood on the shores of Lake Simcoe for this big announcement in 2019 and committed and promised $40 million.

              <ParaText id="8643011">Instead, I have had to spend the last five years telling people involved in the grassroots efforts to clean up and restore the lake the sad truth. The Liberal government will not support their efforts like the previous Conservative government did, because the government would rather ensure the money only flows to its Liberal friends. That has not stopped the grassroots community members from continuing the work as best they can for the lake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643012">I am also proud of the residents of York—Simcoe who have planted over 1,000 trees, which I have given out over the past five years at my Canada Day barbecue celebrations.

What a contrast to Liberal insiders who have been making good money through the grifting and self-dealing enabling by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643013">All of this shows just how much contempt the Liberals have for Parliament and the role of the House of Commons in our democracy. The Liberals think the House, the people's House, is an inconvenience to be bypassed and ignored. They do this all the time. Ministers frequently refuse to appear before committees. When they do, questions are deflected to bureaucrats instead of the minister responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643014">The Liberals tried to give themselves unlimited spending and taxation powers during the pandemic. They took the Speaker to court over the release of the Winnipeg lab documents. They routinely use their appointed flunkies in the Senate as a workaround to defeat and gut bills duly passed in this place, such as my current bill, Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, a financial protection for fresh fruit and vegetable growers from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643015">There is an overall disregard for our institutions. The reluctance on the part of the government to produce documents related to the green slush fund is very concerning to say the least, especially since Parliament and its officers are examining multiple other scandals and ethics violations in addition to this one. There is an ongoing affair with the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">employment minister</Affiliation>'s continued involvement with a company dealing with government grants and contracts, which is a violation. We all know about the arrive scam app, an absolutely insane boondoggle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643016">What excuse will the Liberals conjure up to try and get out of being accountable on these matters? They voted against allowing the Auditor General to investigate GC Strategies. They refused to provide the documents on this occasion. What lengths will they go to, to cover up these scandals when Parliament tries to shine a light on them? Canadians see this and the determination by the Liberals to block investigations into corruption within the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643017">As the official opposition, Conservatives have been focused on improving the lives of Canadians. However, by paralyzing Parliament, the government has made it impossible for anyone here to address issues like the doubling of housing costs, Liberal food inflation, and crime and chaos. I have been prevented from speaking on local issues as well, such as the illegitimate Georgina aerodrome, the unfair rural carbon tax rebate, the no-show Lake Simcoe clean-up fund and many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643018">People in York—Simcoe are truly on the outside looking in. I am calling on the Liberals to finally submit the documents as ordered. If they have nothing to hide, they should give the files to the RCMP.

I think Canadians, at some point, are going to be looking at the House and wondering what the heck we are doing here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643037">The RCMP has raised some concerns, and we cannot ignore those. Would it not make sense for the Conservatives to stop putting up speaker after speaker so we could arrive at a decision to send this to the procedure and House affairs committee? Maybe then the Conservative members on that committee would have the opportunity to question the RCMP as a witness and we could come to some kind of an arrangement. Maybe the RCMP could explain what the procedure is and what kind of an investigation it is going through. I am just trying to throw out some ideas to get through the impasse here. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643047"> Madam Speaker, as usual, I am very proud to rise this evening on behalf of the constituents of Oshawa to hold the government accountable for its Liberal corruption. I must say, though, that I am not rising with any pleasure this evening. I have been going back to my riding, trying to explain how the government has corrupted our institutions and corrupted how the government works. It really is a sad example of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643048">We all know that the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could end this. He could end it by releasing the documents uncensored, so that Canadians could learn the truth about the $400-million Liberal green slush fund cover-up. We could be finished with this. However, the Prime Minister has continued the ongoing theme of corruption in his government by refusing to do so. More than 10,000 pages have been censored to cover up the most important information about the Prime Minister's hand-picked Liberal appointees to the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643049"> This theme of corruption has also been demonstrated by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Liberal government through shutting down the rights of parliamentarians to receive certain information through Order Paper questions or through ATIPs. Our parliamentary privileges need to be protected. Our privileges are continually being breached by the corrupt Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643050">Today, I would like to address the importance of Parliament and parliamentarians receiving information that Canadians are demanding. The Liberals' scandals are too many to list. Liberal obstruction has become a rule instead of an exception. This past weekend, when I was in Oshawa, people were asking me how much longer they would have to put up with these continued scandals and misappropriation of their tax dollars. Their frustration is at a level that I have never, ever seen before. Oshawa wants to know where their tax dollars are going. Is the money being spent prudently? Are we getting the results that Canadians want and need right now? All we are asking for are the documents to show where the money went. We have all heard that if we want to understand what really happened, we have to follow the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643051">Parliamentarians and Canadians have tools to hold our governments to account. One tool, as I mentioned, is access to information, or what people call ATIPs. This is where Canadians can ask for specific emails and follow the trail of money and how we spend their tax dollars. Sadly, the government routinely returns ATIPs sometimes fully redacted, covering up the information that Canadians have a right to know. A second tool that parliamentarians have is something called Order Paper questions, or OPQs. I have submitted several of these OPQs that were returned with incomplete answers and word salads that did not even make any sense. Third, as in this case, Parliament has rights and privileges. The House enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents that is not limited by statute. These powers are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643052">That brings us to our debate today. What brought us here? On June 10, the House adopted a motion calling for the production of various documents related to SDTC to be turned over to the RCMP for review. That is in the record. In response to the motion adopted, departments either outright refused the House order or redacted documents before turning them over, citing provisions in the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act. Nothing in the House order contemplated these redactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643053"> In response to the failure to produce documents, the Conservative House <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege, arguing that the House privilege had been breached, due to the failure to comply with the House order. On September 26, the Speaker issued a ruling on the question of privilege raised and found that the privileges of the House had, in fact, been breached.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643054">Let us take a look at this. If this were a private affair and criminal activity were suspected, documents would be turned over and an investigation would be started. In this case, the Auditor General looked at a five-year period, and he found that an incredible 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board of directors were conflicted. This was only over part of the mandate; there could be more. Public office holders are entrusted to oversee taxpayer dollars and not to personally prosper from their work in government. Sadly, however, that is what happened, and the directors of the slush fund were unapologetic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643055"> The minister had replaced the original chair because that chair was criticizing the program, and he put in his hand-picked director. One director was incredibly aggressive with the actions she took. This woman was appointed in 2016 by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and her name is Andrée-Lise Méthot. She runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital in green technologies. Andrée-Lise Méthot's companies, before and during her time on the board, received $250 million in grants from SDTC. Some of that was before, and I will talk about that in a minute, but when she was on the board, $114 million went to green companies that she had invested in. During her time on the board, the value of her company, Cycle Capital, tripled because of getting an SDTC grant. This is a stamp of the Government of Canada's approval that allows for these companies to raise other funds. The House will never guess who her lobbyist was. Her in-house, paid lobbyist for 10 years was the current radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, before he was elected. While he was lobbying for Cycle Capital, the minister got $111 million. That is incredible, but it is just the example of one director. According to the Auditor General, nine directors accounted for 186 conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643056"> I will speak about another board member who was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Guy Ouimet. He admitted in committee that $17 million of green slush fund money went to companies that he had a financial interest in. He said it was a small amount of money. In Oshawa, we have people losing their jobs. We have people standing in lines at food banks, and the food banks run out of food before noon. We have seniors living four to a room. However, this hand-picked Liberal says $17 million is just a small amount of money. Our community finds that insulting. It may be a small amount of money to a Liberal elite, but it is not for most Canadians, and that amount of money went up 1,000% in value since the investment was made in 2019. It certainly pays to be a Liberal insider; unfortunately, Canadians, people in my community, are suffering now, and $17 million is not a small amount of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643057">It is our job here in the House of Commons to expose the corruption and things we have authorized money for in Parliament. It is our job, and it is time the Liberals started caring about it. The challenge and the concern I have is that this corruption routine seems to have become ordinary business for the Liberal Party. It is why I feel that this is really a sad moment in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643058">I would like to review a few things that Canadians may have forgotten about, some important things that have happened with the government that made Canadians start realizing that it was not business as usual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643059">We all remember the SNC-Lavalin affair. Unfortunately, the allegations of political interference led to criminal prosecution, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response and handling of the situation really impacted judicial independence and the rule of law. We will remember that when the Prime Minister's justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was asked to do something improper, she stood up to the Prime Minister and as a result was basically pushed out of cabinet and government. Ultimately, this resulted in a situation where three prominent female Liberals left. We are talking about Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott, one of the more competent ministers of health, and my neighbour and friend Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She even wrote a book about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643060">The way the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> interfered in this affair forced Canadians to look at their institutions and judge how they were functioning. The Prime Minister does not have a problem going on vacations, but what he wanted to do is cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin, granting a contract to a company that gave money to his family members and handing out billions of dollars to Liberal insiders and consultants. This is just one of a long list of instances of the Prime Minister using government funds to benefit himself and his friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643061">We all remember the WE Charity scandal too, in which the Liberal government awarded a contract to WE Charity. This charity had huge ties to his family. There were huge ethical conflicts of interest, and there were parliamentary investigations and findings. One of the reasons I am saddened tonight is that it impacted the public's trust in the government. Despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> admitting he did something wrong and despite the Ethics Commissioner finding that he directed his staff to explore options for providing the money to WE, he was not found guilty. However, we know that his then finance minister, Mr. Morneau, had an entirely different experience with the WE Charity scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643062">I want to talk for a few moments about the COVID-19 response and the spending during that response, because many businesses in Oshawa went bankrupt. People lost their businesses and homes. There was huge criticism over the amount of money, how it was spent and how things were managed, but we still have not evaluated the government's support for these programs and how effective they were. There seems to be a lack of transparency in spending and accountability measures, and we have not looked at the public health implications and long-term effects. However, we do know that the actions taken were extraordinary and the amount of coercion and force the government utilized was unprecedented. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643063">I am hearing over and over from Canadians that they should have the right to make personal medical decisions. However, as we saw, sadly, the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made deliberate decisions to go beyond guiding and protecting Canadians, to a point of punishing people who chose not to get COVID-19 vaccines, not because there was evidence that punishing them would make Canadians safer, but because he thought that scapegoating a small and unpopular minority of Canadians would make him more popular. The sad thing about that approach, as we remember from the election, is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> politicized a health issue. I want to give kudos to a Liberal member of Parliament, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278558" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation>, who stood up to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and stated on the record how disappointed and sad he was that the Prime Minister had decided to politicize Canadians' personal health decisions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643064">I want to bring to the attention of the House yet another example of the government obstructing parliamentarians and disrespecting our parliamentary privileges. Even today, we are trying to get information in regard to the pandemic response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643065">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278435" Type="2">Provencher</Affiliation> asked an Order Paper question, Question No. 2745, in regard to Pfizer contracts and what Health Canada did not answer. All he wanted to know was when the former minister of public service and procurement, the former minister of health, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada received the contract. He also asked when Health Canada, the Public Health Agency, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport were briefed on the contents. Unfortunately, he received no answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643066">In the United States, there is a different system. Quite often, they go to the courts. Here in Canada, we do not have the same type of system. Canadians expect us, as parliamentarians, to use our privileges to get answers for them. Sadly, the government gives word salads or returns redacted documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643067"> I would like to take a moment to talk about the ArriveCAN scandal. ArriveCAN is something that was also implemented during the pandemic. I remember talking with the Privacy Commissioner in committee; he had extreme concerns about implementing something along the lines of the ArriveCAN app because of privacy issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643068">We talk about the situation and the amount of money that was wasted on ArriveCAN; this is just part of it. There are huge controversies surrounding the effectiveness of this app, including privacy concerns and, of course, the costs associated with it. I remember that the Privacy Commissioner basically said, “Well, this is something that could be utilized for a very short-term period.” However, the government continued on and on, even though the evidence showed that the vaccine and the government's approach was not actually stopping the transmission of COVID-19. The Privacy Commissioner recommended that the data collected should be destroyed, but the Public Health Agency continues to utilize it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643069">Canadians are worried about their privacy, and here we have an app that not only cost way more than it should have but also affected Canadians' ability to travel. We have to look at this in case there is another pandemic or emergency. In that situation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had no problem continuing with his family vacations. This demonstrates the perception of elitism and privilege toward the public health message, and his own adherence to the rules. In other words, it was something that he wanted Canadians to follow, but he did not want to follow it himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643070">Another really important incident, where there was a similar situation to that we have today, was the Winnipeg lab scandal. I still do not think we have gotten to the bottom of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643071">We have to say, “When does it stop?” The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation> is calling for a carbon tax election because it is not going to stop. The Liberals are at a point now where they do not even realize any ethical breaches. It has become the regular way of doing business. The response is basically saying, “Gee, I am sorry”, and then going on and doing it again and again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643072">In the Winnipeg lab scandal, we saw officials from the Communist Party of China having access to some of our most vital biosecurity materials. We see that how the government handled it affected our relationship with China. Canadians are now very aware of Chinese interference, which, I guess, will be another speech that we have to manage. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643109">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has reneged on all of those promises. He is a failed leader. He has abused the trust put in him. The failed, corrupt government has literally been embroiled in scandal after scandal for the last nine years, and here we go again talking about another scandal, this time the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643110">As a result, the House of Commons has been at a standstill for 13 days now due to the government's refusal to hand over documents. Over the past weeks, we have engaged in countless debates regarding the privilege motion. I can only assume that Canadians have been bombarded with a barrage of differing views and misleading narratives surrounding the government's green slush fund. Given that the parliamentary press gallery often shies away from highlighting Liberal corruption, I want to lay out the facts clearly and simply for the people who are watching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643111">It all began with SDTC in 2017. SDTC was supposed to provide funding to companies with innovative and legitimate ideas aimed at improving Canada's environmental record. The government funnelled a staggering one billion tax dollars into SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643112">However, the Liberals appointed their friends to the board of SDTC, including the chair. The board was responsible for deciding who received funds. What did the board members do when they convened? They chose to redirect the money back to their own companies. There was a shocking $400 million spent not on enhancing environmental outcomes but rather on enriching Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643113">In addition, a further $58 million was granted to 10 projects that were entirely ineligible and could not even demonstrate any environmental benefits or the utilization of green technology. The Ethics Commissioner determined that the chair of the board broke the law twice by funnelling money to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643114">How do we know all of this? A brave whistle-blower stepped forward and testified at committee, exposing this damning and explosive scandal. They said, “What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year.” Further, they also expressed that they believed that “the...government is more interested in protecting themselves and protecting the situation from being a public nightmare.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643115">Instead of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s upholding his mandate of running an open, honest and transparent government, he and his Liberal colleagues are paralyzing Parliament by refusing to release all unredacted documents and evidence related to the green slush fund. This is not just a matter of ethics; it is also about the integrity of our democratic institutions. Canadians deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent and who is benefiting from the decisions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643116">This refusal to hand over documents can only mean that what they are hiding is far worse than we can imagine. Which particular cabinet minister are they trying to protect from criminal liability? Just how damning are these documents, that they would stall Parliament for 13 days and defy the order of the Speaker just to conceal the $400 million they handed to their friends? Clearly, what they are trying to conceal is prioritized above the very productivity of Parliament itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643117">The government House leader and several other Liberal champions of corruption like to defend and deflect their failure to comply with the Speaker's order to release documents by saying Conservatives are somehow trampling upon charter rights. This is a blatant attempt to shift focus away from the Liberals' reckless spending and corruption, a far too common tactic for this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643118">One would think the Liberals would know what it means to attack charter rights, as their unprecedented use of the Emergencies Act allowed them to freeze bank accounts without court orders, authorize broad police powers and restrict peaceful assembly. Even civil liberties organizations and former judges at that time raised alarm bells, saying there was no justification for such extreme measures. Then we had Justice Mosley in the Federal Court of Appeal, who pronounced that the government had essentially breached a number of charter rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643119">Why should Conservatives heed the Liberals' advice on respecting the charter? They only uphold it when it aligns with their political agenda. Their track record reveals a blatant disregard for the very rights they now claim to champion, all to deflect responsibility for their misuse of taxpayer funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643120"> When it comes to protecting individual freedoms, Conservatives lead with principles, while Liberals pick and choose when it benefits their agenda. The invocation of the Emergencies Act was not about protecting Canadians; it was about silencing criticism and crushing opposition. The same applies now as we demand accountability for the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643121"> The Liberals are raising concerns that the Speaker's House order could infringe on charter rights, especially regarding police investigations and privacy, but let us be clear: It is the Liberals who are abusing their power by refusing to comply with an order of this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643122">They claim we are violating, specifically, section 8 of the charter, which protects privacy from unreasonable search and seizure. However, the truth is there is little to no expectation of privacy in these documents. They were created by public servants spending taxpayer money. They belong to the public. Furthermore, the House order does not force the RCMP to take any specific action on the documents. Law enforcement can choose to disregard them if it sees fit. However, if the RCMP finds evidence of potential criminality, it must pause its review and obtain judicial authorization to continue. This process protects against any claims of a charter breach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643123">The charter is there to protect people from the government, not to protect the government from accountability. What we are witnessing is a clear attempt by the Liberals to dodge accountability for their actions concerning SDTC and taxpayer funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643124">As Conservatives, we are committed to transparency. Canadians deserve to know how their money is being spent. We will always stand against overreach and demand accountability from the government. Pursuing transparency is not an infringement of rights; it is essential to our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643125">I have had the opportunity to sit on many committees regarding SDTC and the Liberals' green slush fund. I have been watching this unravel for quite some time now. Considering all the testimony we have heard, the ministers we have spoken to and the numerous reports from the Auditor General, it is completely mind-boggling that the government and its members are still trying to cover this up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643126"> Despite the overwhelming evidence revealing the depths of this corruption scandal, the Liberals continue to evade accountability. They are avoiding it so fiercely that they are willing to stall the work of Parliament, diverting our attention from the critical issues that matter most to Canadians, like soaring housing costs, food insecurity, rising crime rates, increasing drug use and the growing homelessness crisis. This is nothing short of shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643127"> The Liberals continue to tell the press that they are eager to move past this debate, claiming it is the Conservatives who are wasting time and resources. Let me remind the Liberals that they are the only members of this House who voted against this motion; that they alone possess the power to resume parliamentary proceedings. They could refocus on the issues that matter to Canadians by simply handing over all unredacted documents. It is as simple as that. Instead, they choose to hide behind procedural delays, prioritizing their own political survival over the urgent needs of everyday Canadians. It is a government that is completely tired and has lost touch with reality, more concerned with covering its tracks than addressing the struggles of the citizens it was elected to serve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643128">Perhaps this can serve as a wake-up call to the government. Recent polling from Abacus Data paints a stark picture of the growing discontent among Canadians. A staggering 57% of those living in Liberal-held ridings want their member of Parliament to call on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to resign and not seek re-election. Let that sink in to the Liberal members who are listening to this speech. This is not just a minor concern. It is a clear signal from the electorate that it is fed up with the Liberals. Time is up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643129"> Moreover, only one in five Canadians believe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should run again. Almost half of Canadians want him to resign immediately. This not just the rejection of his leadership; it is an entire rejection of the approach the current government has taken. Among those who voted Liberal in 2021 but have since lost faith in the party, the numbers are even more alarming: A staggering 40% want the Prime Minister to resign immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643130"> This is not just about political preferences; it is about accountability and trust, accountability in the face of corruption. The evidence of mismanagement and unethical practices surrounding SDTC and the Liberal government's green slush fund is undeniable. Canadians are tired of seeing their hard-earned tax dollars misused while the government tries to cover its tracks. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s unwillingness to address these issues head-on and hand over the documents has clearly eroded trust and made it clear that accountability was never a priority for him and the government. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643131"> The question we must now ask is this: How much longer will the government ignore the voices of the very people it was elected to serve? The Liberals can no longer afford to dismiss the mounting discontent as mere political noise. We know that at least 20, if not 30, members really wanted the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to resign as of today. They must recognize that their actions have consequences and the people and Liberal members are demanding change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643132"> These data reflect a fundamental shift in the political landscape. Canadians are seeking true leadership that prioritizes their needs and not a government more focused on self-preservation and evading accountability. The public is rightly outraged at the corruption that has been allowed to fester under this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and it is time for the Liberals to face the reality of their situation or to step aside and give Canadians the carbon tax election they want and deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643133"> It is time for our country to be led by Canada's next great Prime Minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. As Conservatives, we stand ready to offer a vision that restores trust and accountability in government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643134"> It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to listen to the people and step aside for new leadership that puts Canadians first. The call for change is loud and clear, and Conservatives are more than ready to form government, end the corruption, end the scandals and ensure that the voices of Canadians are heard. More importantly, we are ready to respect always the source of the funds that drive this country: taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643135">In conclusion, it is clear that the rights of Parliament and Canadian taxpayers have been violated by the government's refusal to comply. The Speaker has ruled that the House must pause its work until the government fulfills its legal obligation to provide these documents. The Auditor General has exposed the shocking reality that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has clearly turned the SDTC into a green slush fund for Liberal insiders, with $390 million paid out in 180 cases of conflicts of interest. It is unacceptable that the Prime Minister and his ministers were aware of this corruption and did nothing to stop it. The same whistle-blower I quoted earlier called out the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister for innovation</Affiliation> not once, not twice, but three times. In fact, they did not stop short of saying that he deliberately misled Canadians, that he misled Parliament and that he knew about the abuse and did absolutely nothing about it until he, the Prime Minister and the corrupt government were outed by the press. The Auditor General has also clearly laid the blame on the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> for his failure to monitor these contracts properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643136">When did we lose the whole concept of ministerial accountability? At the very beginning, I read the words of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about how they would make mistakes, and when they did, they would own up to them and learn from them. In my three years as a parliamentarian, I have yet to hear one apology from any member of the corrupt government. Those were false words and false promises. Canadians are clearly coming to the same conclusion that I certainly have: We were basically sold a false bill of goods in 2015, 2019 and 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643137"> Only common-sense Conservatives are committed to ending this corruption and getting real answers for Canadians. We will hold the government accountable. It is our constitutional obligation to do exactly what we are doing right now, and we will continue to do this as ferociously as possible, each and every day, until the government releases all the unredacted documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643150"> Mr. Speaker, prior to the current Liberal government, which has been in power for nine years, the Conservatives were in power for nine years. I happened to be in the House for most of that time, and under the Conservative government, the Phoenix pay scandal cost taxpayers $2 billion, a $50-million slush fund was administered by Tony Clement and there were a number of Senate scandals. Also, the Harper government was found in contempt not once but twice for, guess what, refusing to hand over documents ordered by Parliament detailing how it was spending money on crime bills and dealing with the Afghan detainee matter. There was also election fraud galore, for which we watched Dean Del Mastro, a Conservative MP, be led off in handcuffs to jail. If we were to try to find out whose list of corruption and scandals was longer between the Liberals and the Conservatives, we would be here all day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643151">The Speaker has ruled, in agreement with the Conservatives, to produce documents to PROC. There is no order to produce all of the documents to the police. If my hon. colleague wants such an order, why do the Conservatives not raise a question of privilege and ask the Speaker to order that all documents be produced to the police? Is it because they know the Speaker will not do that? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643159">Obtaining search warrants is one particular tool that law enforcement members can use, but they will only rely on search warrants when there is no co-operation in an investigation, particularly from a complainant. As I indicated in my speech and in my responses to a couple of questions, the Liberal government is the complainant. It has a duty to release documents to assist the RCMP in its investigation. Search warrants are a tool but are not required to obtain each and every piece of evidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643160">As I also indicated in my speech, if the RCMP receives all the documents unredacted and there is a concern that there was no judicial authorization, there is something called the discoverability rule. As the RCMP is reviewing material, if it has a suspicion of some level of criminality, it is legally bound to stop the review, write to a justice for judicial authorization to continue that review and then potentially lay charges. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643168">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour to be able to enter into debate on the important matters that are before the House. We are soon coming to the close of what I believe is the 13th day of debate on a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643169">The many Canadians who I know are watching, and watching with great concern, may ask, “What is ‘privilege’ and why does it matter?” It is a word that is used in many different contexts across society, but when it comes to the idea of privilege within Parliament and within our parliamentary tradition, the Westminster system of governance that goes back more than eight centuries to the mother Parliament in the United Kingdom, there are constitutional principles that speak to the idea that members of Parliament have a thing called “privilege”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643170"> To unpack that just briefly, it has to do with Parliament and its members, of which a Parliament is made up. That is why, after an election, there is a Parliament. We are in the 44th Parliament, which is made up of 338 MPs. A government is not the Parliament, but rather a Parliament empowers and gives authority to a government to be able to make decisions. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government have survived only because a majority, which includes the NDP and often the Bloc Québécois, has given the authority for the government to continue to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643171">It speaks to the idea of privilege and the foundational principle that in our democratic system, it is elected members of Parliament who make up a Parliament. This place and the institutions; the traditions; and the constitutional conventions, both written and unwritten, an important aspect that sets our parliamentary democracy apart from, for example, that of our American counterparts, speak about what our parliamentary system is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643172">Part of what that is, and a key part of why we are having the debate and discussion here today, is that the government finds itself in conflict with the very constitutional foundation of what our democracy is. When I first spoke to the motion 13 days ago, I outlined some of the specifics surrounding that. I now have the opportunity to once again enter into the discussion and to highlight again how important it is that this place be allowed, be empowered in, and above all be respected in its ability to call for, in this case, documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643173">In the aftermath of the privilege motion's having coming forward, I wrote a news column to share with my constituents what was happening and what is so important about documents. As with the idea of privilege, it is about more than just a stack of documents that would highlight something about the issue at hand. It is about the ability for Parliament to ensure that it has access to something that it, only by its power, is able to inform. In fact I remember that there was some controversy a number of years back when a reporter, I believe, said that Parliaments come and go but the government stays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643174">The only reason the government stays is that Parliament, the supreme law-making authority of the land, allows it to. The only reason a prime minister can be in office is that Parliament allows that prime minister to be, in what we call “confidence”. I do not think that my constituents have ever had confidence in the current government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the coalition, but certainly from coast to coast to coast we are hearing increasingly that Canadians do not have confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643175"> There is the idea that a Parliament has the ability to have unfettered access to documents to ensure that, in this case, there is significant alleged criminality. A whistle-blower has made the statement that it was a sponsorship-level type of scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643176">We will look back to the Chrétien and Martin era and the Gomery inquiry. I remember in fact that when I was a young politico, my then MP, Kevin Sorenson, sent me the abridged copy of the Gomery inquiry, which it outlined some of the incredible corruption perpetrated by then prime minister Jean Chrétien and followed by former prime minister Paul Martin. That brought in some of the most significant accountability reforms in our nation's history when former prime minister Stephen Harper was elected.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643177">With that push to ensure mechanisms, we brought in the Ethics Commissioner and ethics rules for parliamentarians to ensure that there were conflict of interest rules, which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been found guilty of breaking, like many other cabinet ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643178">However, it comes back to the very idea that Parliament is the supreme law-making authority of the land, and Parliament represents democracy. Before us we have an almost $400-million scandal with conflicts of interest and hand-picked Liberal appointments. Quite frankly, it just stinks. Whistle-blowers have come forward, putting their careers on the line, to say that this is wrong. They could not in good conscience continue to operate within the context of not letting people know the level of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643179">That is why over the last 13 or so days, it has been bewildering that, despite Parliament and the constitutional conventions that have established this place and its more than eight centuries of history, those Liberals are so quick to dismiss the whistle-blowers to cover up their corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643180">It would be very straightforward. That government could release these documents. It could do it today and then this Parliament could get on with its business, but the Liberals refuse, and one has to ask “why?” It seems like each and every day there is a different excuse as to why they will not do it. They say one thing one day and one cabinet minister stands up and peacocks about something, and then another will stand up and say something else. It seems like their message is always changing, but Canadians are asking the simple question “why?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643181">Why are they unwilling to allow full transparency on the $400 million? It would not be for MPs to simply peruse these documents, but to give the RCMP unfettered access to ensure that we can get answers to the very foundational questions about this scandal and the alleged corruption that were brought forward, not by Conservatives, but by whistle-blowers, in some cases within the Liberals' own department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643182"> I look forward to being able to pick up on a series of further points tomorrow. I would simply conclude my speech today by saying this: The government has created a circumstance where it has normalized constitutional crises, and that is where we are today. We have seen it before when the Liberals tried to have unfettered taxation ability, and because of Conservatives pushing back, that was rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643183">We see on a regular basis that the Liberals are willing to throw the Constitution under the bus for their narrow political interests, and it is time for that to end. It is time for accountability. It is time for Parliament, and the supremacy that it should enjoy in our democracy, to be restored, and when Conservatives are elected, that is what we will do.</ParaText>

Instead of debating substantive legislation or talking about serious issues in Canada, Conservatives want to filibuster their own motion and prevent it from ultimately passing. It is something that we want to see go to PROC. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643210"> Mr. Speaker, when will Mark Carney disclose his conflicts of interest?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643211">That is the question I asked the government about three weeks ago. The answer? Well, none. They refused to answer that question and instead accused me of engaging in personal attacks. When the adviser to the Liberal Party happens to be the chair of one of the largest asset management and private capital firms in the world, is it really a personal attack to ask when he will disclose his conflicts?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643212">We do not know what all of his business interests are or what his remuneration is and how much he benefits when the share price of, perhaps, one of the companies that Brookfield owns rises in reaction to government news. These are important pieces of information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643213">Is the government shielding the adviser to its party's<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> leader</Affiliation> from transparency laws when it allows Carney to function as an adviser to the Prime Minister? After all, that is really what he is. This whole business of “adviser to the Liberal leader” is as if the Liberals would not have us believe that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>, who, at least today, is the Liberal Party leader, and the Prime Minister, are the same person. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643214">Mark Carney is advising the Prime Minister without having to have his conflicts of interest declared. This is not an academic question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643215">Just a few weeks ago we saw the Liberals make an announcement about mortgage insurance ceilings. This benefits one of Brookfield's companies: Sagen is one of the mortgage insurance providers in Canada. The ceiling going from $1 million to $1.5 million is an enormous business opportunity, and the markets reacted to that. Share prices got a good solid bump that day when the announcement was made. Therefore, it is relevant to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643216">Canadians need to know all the conflicts of interest around this adviser. I mentioned this in the premise of the question. The parliamentary secretary said that it was really good news because the mortgage announcement was going to increase construction, and it was going to be good for Canadians. Well, no. We had testimony yesterday at the finance committee that the only people that can get the maximum benefit of that increase to mortgage insurance limits are people who earn $350,000 or more per year. This announcement is good for the mortgage insurance business and for Brookfield. If we had a conflict of interest disclosure, we would know just how good it might be for Mark Carney, but they will not do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643217"> I ask the <Affiliation DbId="311626" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> tonight if she could tell us on what date they will ensure Canadians will have the conflict of interest disclosure on this adviser who advises the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation>, but the leader of the Liberal Party, for now, is the Prime Minister, so we may only be scratching the surface. This adviser has all kinds of other business dealings with governments, not only the Liberal government, but other governments around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643218">It is time for Canadians to know what the conflicts and potential conflicts are, so we can get on with separating the interests of what is good for Mark Carney, the Liberals and their friends from what is good for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643219">Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to talk about what really matters to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643220">Since 2015, our government has been making important investments to grow the economy, strengthen Canada's social safety net and support Canadians. We introduced the Canada child benefit, which has lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. We reinforced the security and dignity of retirement income by strengthening the CPP and increasing old-age security for seniors aged 75 and over. We made generational investments in $10-a-day child care, cutting child care costs by at least half already. We also introduced the Canada carbon rebate to maintain an incentive to reduce pollution while putting more money in the pockets of hard-working Canadians in provinces where the federal fuel charge applies. All of these investments have made life more affordable for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8643221">However, we know that Canadians continue to face challenges while the cost of living remains high. That is why, in budget 2024, the government invested in new measures like the national school food program, which will help an additional 400,000 children get the healthy food they need to learn and grow, and the Canada disability benefit, which will help improve the financial well-being of over 600,000 low-income persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8643222">This is also why we continue to invest in the dental care plan, under which two million Canadians have already been approved to get the dental care they need from a dentist or hygienist. We do this so that every generation has a fair shot at receiving the dental care they deserve while making life cost less. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643223">We are also helping to make life cost less through our ambitious housing plan. We have committed to building more homes faster, increasing housing affordability, growing the community housing sector and making it easier to rent or buy a home. Our government recently announced a suite of bold reforms to mortgage rules to make mortgages more affordable for Canadians and put home ownership within reach. We are also expanding eligibility for 30-year insured mortgage amortization to all first-time homebuyers and to buyers of new builds. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8643225"> In fact, for the past past nine months in a row, inflation has been within the Bank of Canada's target range. Inflation fell to 1.6% in September, a 43-month low. Today, the Bank of Canada lowered the interest rate to 3.75%, which is going to help so many Canadians with their mortgage rates, credit cards and other borrowing costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643226"> These are powerful economic proof points. They show that Canada's economy is strong and resilient. They show that our economic plan is fiscally responsible. That is important because it means that we can afford to make investments and in turn make life more affordable for Canadians.</ParaText>

Let me be the one to let the parliamentary secretary know that, per capita, the economy is smaller today than it was in 2015. That is the legacy of the government. It has shrunk the economy. Canadians are poorer now than they were when the government took office nine years ago. That is the legacy of the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643231"> Mr. Speaker, we are back this evening to discuss UNRWA and the government's failure to safeguard Canadians' hard-earned taxpayer dollars against funding terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643232">On October 2, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> if he shared his <Affiliation DbId="300012" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s very blind trust in UNRWA. Unbelievably, the Minister of International Development had described UNRWA as one of his “trusted agencies”. So profound was the minister's trust that he broke his promise to Canadians and reinstated Canada's funding to UNRWA. This happened even before the release of a UN report on its investigation into UNRWA staff being involved in the October 7 terrorist attack. Let us be honest here: As is true whenever the UN investigates itself and examines one of its own agencies, the report had no intention of derailing the global funding gravy train. This is expected. However, the report was not all rainbows and unicorns. Even the UN had to admit that there was something very wrong with this tainted agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643233">Let us look at the recommendations. The report recommended that UNRWA create a centralized neutrality investigations unit. That sounds impressive. Let us have a unit to investigate the neutrality of a UN agency. However, if UNRWA was so lily-white, why call for the establishment of such a unit? The report also recommended that UNRWA update its code of ethics and its staff training, as well as that it find more ways to screen UNRWA applicants. That is a bit strange for an innocent UN agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643234">Why does it need to screen better? Could it be that it has been hiring terrorists? Unfortunately, that is exactly what has been happening. We recently learned that UNRWA is seeking immunity for staff involved in the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. The agency was even forced to admit that one of its employees, an alleged educator killed in Lebanon, was a Hamas leader. What a revelation that is. It does, however, bring ridicule on the UN report's findings and its absolution of UNRWA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643235">In my initial question, I asked whether the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shared his <Affiliation DbId="300012" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s very blind trust in an agency that Canadian taxpayers fund into the millions, which just happens to employ terrorists. What a sad charade it is. With so much smoke swirling around how UNRWA operates, it is unconscionable for Canada to have acted so quickly to restore funding. We are not talking about a few dollars. In 2022, Canada pledged almost $32 million, making us the 11th biggest donor. In May, the Minister of International Development doubled down on his largesse in terms of terrorist support. The minister announced that Canada would provide $65 million, including $25 million as part of Canada's recurring payments to UNRWA. An additional $40 million would go to UNRWA and to other experienced partners in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643236">While we have Canadians who are hungry and struggling to make ends meet, the government is giving Canadian taxpayer dollars to a terrorist-hiring agency. This is completely immoral and unacceptable to Canadians, and the government is failing its duty to safeguard our dollars against funding terrorism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643237">My question to the <Affiliation DbId="311626" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> is the same one the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refused to answer: Does the <Affiliation DbId="311626" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> share the <Affiliation DbId="300012" Type="4">Minister of International Development</Affiliation>'s trust in UNRWA? If they will not answer that question, would they agree that Canada should not fund terrorism, yes or no?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643238">Mr. Speaker, of course, we continue to unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Canada also continues to support Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8643239">The allegations that UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 attacks were troubling. Following these allegations, the UNRWA immediately and proactively dismissed the employees who were named and co-operated fully with the investigation and review called for by the UN Secretary-General. The UNRWA has also continued to strengthen its neutrality mechanisms.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8643240">On March 8, 2024, Canada announced that it would resume funding to UNRWA. This decision was taken in light of the serious and significant reviews under way and the steps undertaken by UNRWA to address allegations and reinforce its neutrality mechanisms. Canada had seen the interim report of the investigation being done by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services and was satisfied that there was no significant obstacle to resuming aid as the named employees were no longer work for the agency. Other donors also came to this conclusion shortly thereafter and resumed funding to UNRWA before the ongoing review and study were finished. When resuming funding, Canada and other donors also considered the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and the significant need for increased assistance. It is also important to recall that UNRWA provides up to 60% of all humanitarian assistance in Gaza, and its systems are essential for delivery of aid by other partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643241">Reports that UNRWA is requesting that its employees be shielded from persecution by invoking their diplomatic immunity are false. These media reports conflate the initial investigation into the alleged participation of UNRWA staff in the October 7 attacks with a lawsuit filed in the United States against UNRWA and some of its senior officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643242"> We are aware that an UNRWA staff member was reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike in Lebanon on Monday, September 30. At the time of his death, the UNRWA employee had been on administrative leave without pay since March, following allegations that he had links to Hamas. The employee denied being a member of Hamas, but was nevertheless being investigated by UNRWA's internal investigation unit at the time of his death. Detractors incorrectly asserted the employee was subsequently reinstated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643243">UNRWA reports that throughout the investigation, the employee denied his affiliation to Hamas. The first time that UNRWA received confirmation of his role in Hamas was on Monday, September 30, 2024, when it was confirmed by Hamas. This case underscores UNRWA's diligence in responding to information about alleged activities by staff that are incompatible with their role as UN employees. We acknowledge the other UNRWA employees who have been killed in this crisis and are concerned about the continuing attacks against UNRWA personnel.</ParaText>
