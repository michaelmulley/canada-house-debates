                  <QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">At report stage, a bill is examined as a whole and not clause by clause as is the case at committee stage. Generally, the rules relating to the admissibility of amendments presented at committee stage also apply to motions in amendment at report stage. However, certain rules apply only to report stage. For instance, since 1968 when the rules relating to report stage came into force, a motion in amendment to delete a clause from a bill has always been considered by the Chair to be in order, even if such a motion would alter or go against the principle of the bill as approved at second reading, and a motion to amend a number of clauses of a bill has been considered out of order.</QuotePara>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As a general principle, the Speaker seeks to forestall debate on the floor of the House which is simply a repetition of the debate in committee. Normally, the Speaker will not select a motion in amendment previously ruled out of order in committee, unless the reason for that ruling was the requirement for a royal recommendation or that the amendment moved in committee had proposed the deletion of an entire clause of the bill. Furthermore, the Speaker will normally select only those motions in amendment that could not have been presented in committee. In such cases, Members can send a written submission to the Speaker explaining why it was not possible to present these motions in committee.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="7826914">Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What the member is referring to is outside of normal process. The member should have corresponded with the Speaker's office to express his concern, as opposed to trying to anticipate what a Speaker's ruling might be. The Speaker, from what I understand, is very close to making a ruling. To interject at this point in time is highly inappropriate. The member should have been in correspondence with the Speaker's office prior to doing what he is doing currently. I would suggest to the member that he wait until there is a Speaker's ruling before he tries to anticipate what the Speaker is going to say.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7826915">Madam Speaker, in response to the point of order from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, I would just state that the intervention by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> is in anticipation of such a ruling. It would not be appropriate for an individual member to try to persuade a Speaker in a private forum beforehand, when a decision is about to be made. It might be inappropriate to try to go in that direction. I do think that the member for Calgary Forest Lawn is laying out the point in advance of the Speaker's making a ruling on this important matter.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7826916">Madam Speaker, on the same point of order, just logically, I am confused by the arguments from the member for <Affiliation DbId="293762" Type="18">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. He is saying that the Speaker is, in his view, about to make a ruling, and, therefore, that the member should wait to hear the Speaker's ruling before making arguments that would be material to the Speaker's ruling. It seems to be quite logical that members would want to make arguments to the Speaker prior to the Speaker's ruling, in order to inform the Speaker in their deliberations about what ruling they are going to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7826917">The Standing Orders are also explicit about the fact that oral arguments may be part of the deliberations around which amendments are put forward. Standing Order 76 describes not only the procedure whereby members may write to the Speaker, but also the procedure whereby members may address or be called upon to address the Speaker with oral arguments. It is fairly rare that we are in the situation where this is necessary, but insofar as the situation is necessary, the procedure being followed by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation>, is clearly anticipated by the Standing Orders.</ParaText>

As I am going to raise in a question of privilege shortly, there was a mad scramble, which limited the rights of members in terms of submitting amendments. Therefore, some degree of recognition of that fact is important in this case, in light of the fact that the government is trying to limit the ability of members to move amendments and make arguments by these last-minute changes to the schedule. I hope that is part of the consideration as well.</ParaText>

Had she committed in writing to appearing for two hours, the events that unfolded at the Standing Committee on Finance would not have happened. It is because of the minister's refusal to appear that the normal business of the finance committee during its study of a budget bill were unable to occur, and that, instead, a closure motion was adopted, leaving little opportunity for committee members to submit amendments to Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>. </ParaText>

The Chair interrupted the programming motion in such a way that the amendments could not be table-dropped or moved from the floor. Instead, he ruled that the only amendments that could properly be moved were to the ones provided to the Clerk before May 19. Notably, this was before testimony was supposed to be wrapped up. He also ruled that subamendments could not be moved, because members would need the floor in order to move a subamendment, but he refused to allow debate under the programming motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827014">What occurred at the Standing Committee on Finance was precisely this. Members' ability to speak was not explicitly limited in a particular sense, yet the Chair acted in a way that limited the ability of members to speak and move amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827015">I acknowledge that there will be some dispute on this point, because the committee adopted a programming motion of sorts. However, the Chair took it upon himself to then make rulings that in fact went far beyond the particulars of the programming motion. That is, the Chair did not confine himself to the programming motion. Instead, he made additional decisions that further limited the ability of members to speak and to bring forward points and/or move subamendments. This was a violation of Standing Order 116(2)(b), which materially affected the privileges of members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827016">Standing Order 116(2)(a) says, “Unless a time limit has been adopted by the committee or by the House”. In this case, while a time limit was adopted, it did not prescribe the things the Chair said it prescribed. Thus, in the process, the privileges of members, in terms of the ability of members to move subamendments and to speak, was limited.</ParaText>

The point that I was making, and the reason why I think taking note of the motion at finance committee is important, is that Standing Order 116(2)(a) says, “unless a time limit has been adopted by the committee or by the House”. The committee did adopt a motion that prescribed time limits. However, that motion did not establish time limits in the way the Chair was applying them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827042">I have read most of the motion from the finance committee, which I think establishes the point that, after 4:30 p.m., on Monday May 29, it was agreed that the questions would be put. It was also agreed that amendments were to be submitted to the committee by Friday, May 19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827043">However, and this would be clear if I had read all of it, but it should be clear enough, and members can take my word for it if they wish, the motion before the finance committee made no mention of the exclusion of subamendments. It is well-established procedure in the Standing Orders and the rules that members may move subamendments to amendments once they are on the floor. I did not propose to speak to the subamendments, but I did, on multiple occasions, seek the opportunity to move subamendments at committee—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827062">Madam Speaker, I would welcome the members who have returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827063">The programming motion did not mention an exclusion of subamendments. I, as a member of Parliament, believe that it is consistent with my privileges to be able to propose some amendments at the committee stage. The right to move subamendments flows from what is referenced in Standing Order 116, namely that “the Standing Orders shall apply so far as may be applicable”. That is Standing Order 116(1).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827064">This is the first violation of privilege. Standing Order 116(1), which prescribes the right of members being applicable from the House in committee, was not applied in the process of the determinations made at committee, and the Chair made a ruling to not allow subamendments, which were not mentioned in the motion. Having read and reviewed the motion in detail, it makes no mention of whether subamendments could be moved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827065">In another respect, we saw a violation of privilege in members' right to speak around the ability of members to raise points of order. Although the ability to raise points of order are distinct from points of debate, a member's ability to raise points of order, to identify violations of order that have occurred at committee, can be reasonably seen to flow from the provisions established in 116(2)(a). It says that the Chair may not limit the ability of members' right to speak and that violations of such right may be brought to the attention of the Speaker. This was also a matter that was violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827066">Further, we saw a violation of privilege in the rights of members to vote. The sacredness of the rights of members to vote is well established. Every time members have faced impediments in their ability to vote or have been blocked in their ability to vote, and we have seen various instances of this have been raised, including things that are on their face trivial, such as limits to transportation, that have obstructed the ability of members to get to the House, the House has ruled in favour of members in the importance of their privilege and of their right to vote.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827088">Madam Speaker, just to clarify, I was conceptually grouping the violations of privilege that had happened at committee. I think there were a number of violations of privilege that happened at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827089">The second issue, and this was raised as a question of privilege at committee, does touch on 116(2)(b), and that is the right of members to be able to vote. It is the right of members to be able to raise subamendments that was limited, which is a matter of privilege of members. It was the right of members, as well, to be able to vote at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827090">I remember the time this happened because the points of order were in relation to the finance committee continuing to sit during Question Period. At 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday, members were trying to raise points of order with respect to the fact that the finance committee was continuing during Question Period. While members were raising those points of order, the chair, in spite of that, proceeded pushing through to have votes take place, which a number of members were not able to participate in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827091">This was raised at the time as a violation of the privileges of members, and it has obviously materially impacted the bill that is before the House. This is also an issue of privilege, the rights of members to vote on something as critical as the budget implementation bill was limited by the process that unfolded at committee. This is a matter that should be of grave concern to all members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827092">I would just say as well that the subamendments that we wished to raise were substantive and were in fact submitted to the clerk in advance. Admittedly, they were not submitted in time for the deadline for the submission of amendments, which was Friday, May 19, however, they were submitted in advance of the consideration of those amendments. It would be impossible to submit subamendments to amendments unless those amendments had already been seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827093">There would be no way to submit subamendments and get those subamendments in time for the amendment deadline, because members obviously have to be able to see the amendments in order to be able to then move the subamendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827094"> There were a limited number of subamendments that were emailed to the clerk. Many of them were emailed in both official languages. The clerk had them. They could have been moved. They should have been moved. It would have been a matter of privilege for members to be able to move those subamendments. They were prevented from doing so by a ruling of the chair. That ruling was challenged, but a majority of the committee did not choose to uphold the privileges of members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827095">It is in those circumstances, the right to move subamendments and the right to be able to vote, that I have raised this question of privilege in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827096">There is one very distinct issue of privilege, as well, that is important to raise, because it deals with what happened after the committee, that is with the process for being able to move report stage amendments and the process for being able to bring those report stage amendments to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827097">There are various services available to members in the drafting of amendments, the drafting of subamendments and the drafting of report stage amendments. These services are particularly important for members of the opposition. The reality is members of the government, when it comes to drafting amendments, subamendments and report stage amendments, have resources available to them that are associated with being in government that members of the opposition do not have available to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827098">It is important for members of the opposition, especially, to be able to access those resources in a timely way that corresponds to the calendar of being able to bring these issues before the House. The right of members to be able to do that in a timely fashion depends on the ability of members to receive support from the House in order to be able to bring those things forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827099">I became aware, yesterday afternoon, of a last-minute change in the schedule. This was in response to the Thursday question, after Question Period, moved by the <Affiliation DbId="278905" Type="4">Associate Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, when he told the House that Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> would be brought forward to debate. He said tomorrow, which is today, Friday. At the time, I immediately sent my draft of the subamendments that I had wanted to move at committee, that I would like to move at report stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827100">My view is that, given that they could not be moved in committee as a result of the ruling of the chair that subamendments could not be moved, they could then be moved in the House as report stage amendments.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827104">The issue is that I sent six distinct subamendments to the House of Commons drafting service and I asked that these be generated as report stage amendments, which was a request that I sent in as soon as I was able to, following the announcement of the change in the timeline. At that point, I expected to be able to receive that information back from our legislative staff at least by 6 p.m. so that I could put them on notice by the deadline, by 6 p.m., so that we could get the report stage amendments in and that at that point they would be on notice so that they could be moved. I did, in fact, send a letter to the Speaker making my argument. I did all the things that I could within the very tight timeline that I had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827105">However, of those six subamendments that were submitted to the legislative staff, I only got one of them back. Therefore, my request for drafting was only honoured in one out of six cases. I want to be very clear that I am not criticizing the staff. The staff here work very hard; they do their best within very tight parameters but it is a question of how many staff were available and it is a question of the resourcing that was available. These raise questions of privilege for members who should be entitled to move those report stage amendments. I wanted to move those report stage amendments—</ParaText>

In 2021, his brother-in-law was murdered by the Taliban, so the rest of the family fled for their lives across the border. If Pakistan follows through on its threat to deport Afghans, they too will be killed. However, because these events happened before July 2021, the family does not qualify to come here.</ParaText>

What makes this decision so disappointing and frustrating is the fact that nearly 8,000 residents in Fort Erie alone are without a family doctor.

Implementing a national certification testing standard such as this would mean foreign-trained health professionals would get a chance to take a test and receive an answer and a certification within 60 days. This would go a long way to helping solve the staffing shortages now plaguing Niagara Health, and it would deliver the improved health care services that Fort Erie and Port Colborne residents rightly deserve.</ParaText>

The second carbon tax will add 20¢ on a litre of gasoline on top of the 40¢ from the first carbon tax. Who can afford a 60¢-a-litre increase?

This is why I came here to Parliament, to be honest, and this is something that business owners have been crying about. People knew and said this was going to happen. I have been in contact with officials. In my riding, there is a sense of fear and a sense of despair, quite frankly, and it is just horrific news coming out of our community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827531">Madam Speaker, I will try not to be more than a few minutes, but I did want to contribute to the question of privilege that was raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>. I took him to have raised three separate questions of privilege, and it may be that he wants to subdivide those a bit more. I do not know, but I am going to respond to what I think were the three major themes of his intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827532">One had to do with his ability to move subamendments; another had to do with a vote that was taken on a particular clause that was at issue at committee; and the final one was about drafting for report stage amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827533">With respect to his ability to move subamendments, I think it is important for the Speaker to know the following as this question of privilege is deliberated. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> did mention that the committee had adopted a programming motion by unanimous consent. It was very clear that there was to be no debate during the votes after 4:30 this past Monday. That means that no member was able to get the floor to move a subamendment, so I think it was pretty clear by the terms of the motion. It should not have been a surprise to the member that there would not have been the ability to move subamendments. I think that was foreseen by all members of the committee when they agreed to that programming motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827534">I would also say that there was, in fact, time to move subamendments, which I think is an important thing to consider with this question of privilege. The committee met last week for about 10 hours to consider clause by clause. During that time, Conservative members of the committee chose to filibuster on a motion they had presented, and that ate up all the time we had to discuss the amendments that had already been presented according to the deadline or to move subamendments to those amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827535">That was a choice by members, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> substituted in on the committee to be part of that filibuster at one point. There had been warnings. I intervened at the committee to say that we were risking losing the time we had, not only to debate amendments, but also to move subamendments, so I would say, in this respect, the member's question of privilege is a bit like a member who tied themselves to a chair in their own home and then claimed they were physically obstructed from getting to the House of Commons. It may be true, but it is superficially true, and I do not think it is really a matter of concern for the House. I would note also, as the member did, that he submitted his amendments, to the extent he did, after the deadline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827536">On the report stage amendments, he said that he was not aware that the bill would be called for debate today until it was announced in the Thursday question. However, I would say that members should know, and perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> does not know, in which case that would be tragic and he should be informed, members can contact drafters and ask to have amendments drafted well in advance of the bill being called for debate. All of us who were following the progress of that bill at committee knew that it had passed out of committee on Tuesday night. We knew that it had been reported to the House on Wednesday. There was nothing stopping that particular member from contacting drafters earlier in the process to ensure he had those amendments drafted and ready to go for when the bill was ultimately called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827537">Of course, we knew that, with a bill being reported back to the House from committee on a Wednesday, the first day eligible for debate would be a Friday, so I respectfully submit that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> knew, or ought to have known, that the bill could be called Friday and had ample opportunity to prepare his amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827538">In respect of the missed vote on a clause at committee, there was certainly a lot of disorder in the room going on at that time. I think if we were to go check the video, we would find that the proximate cause of that disorder was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> when he opened his microphone, took an electronic device and held it to the microphone. He was playing question period into the microphone. One of the reasons that caused so much disorder was, as we know and as we have been told many times, this causes harm to the interpreters. We are not to hold electronic devices playing sound of any kind to the microphone because it hurts people and it is a workplace safety and health issue for the interpreters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827539">There was no reason for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> to do that. He could have made his point in many other ways, ones that were not damaging to the people who support our work in the House of Commons. The chair asked him to stop. He would not stop, and disorder ensued. I will not belabour that point any further.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7827540">All that is to say that this was part of what was going on, so there is a reasonable question as to whether the Chair ought to have tried to call a vote in the midst of that level of disorder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827541">However, I would note, and I think it is important for the Speaker to know when deliberating on this question of privilege, that when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> raised this as a question of privilege at the committee level, the committee agreed, by unanimous consent, to go back and redo the vote on that clause, ensuring that everyone knew we were voting on that particular clause and that they were paying attention during the vote to ensure that all those votes were cast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827542">Those are things that I think are really important for the Speaker to note while deliberating on these points of order. I think the member is referring to certain things that if they had played out some other way might have been quite serious, but the committee was very willing to entertain the legitimate concerns the member raised. I think that is evidenced by our providing unanimous consent to go back to the vote and I think it is evidenced by the programming motion that is at issue in all of this having been agreed to by unanimous consent after being negotiated between Liberals and Conservatives and then being presented to the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827543"> I think those are all things that really ought to be taken into account, and I suspect they may be things that the member himself may want to contemplate for future instances.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827547">Madam Speaker, it is indeed an honour and a privilege to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document>. I want to begin by acknowledging the importance of the arts and culture in Canadian life. While the motivation for this bill may be admirable, I do question, at a time when one in five Canadians is skipping meals, when we see record-high food bank usage, when we see Canadians struggling to make their rent and mortgage payments, why the government would use a Senate public bill to advance such a matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827548">That said, I am pleased to rise and speak to various issues related to Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document>, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act regarding a parliamentary visual artist laureate. I must admit that I personally am not much of an artist. I am not an expert on the art world. I am one of those people who know when art looks good or what I think looks good, although many people will not agree with my perspective. Certainly, I do not have many original artworks hanging in my home. Those I do have that are originals were created by some of the cutest constituents in my riding, aged seven, nine and five.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827549">However, I do appreciate the art that our world creates and, certainly, in my riding, as in so many ridings across the country, there are many opportunities to see those great works of art at the local level, in places like Minto or Stratford, whether it is the Gallery Stratford or the weekly Art in the Park enterprises in Stratford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827550">Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document> proposes to create the position of a parliamentary visual artist laureate, who, according to the bill, will be “an officer of the Library of Parliament.” This bill follows a similar formula that was used over 20 years ago to create the parliamentary poet laureate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827551">It is important to recognize that here on Parliament Hill, we do indeed have an impressive collection of visual art. Many of us who were privileged enough to be able to sit in the original Centre Block, and certainly some of us miss that historic building, will know some of the work that was included in that building. After it was rebuilt, on February 3, 1916, many visual artworks were included in it. It had many great paintings and sculptures, many of which were carved in the interior Centre Block stone itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827552">What many might not know is that much of the stone in Centre Block was deliberately left unmarked upon construction so that future art could be carved into the building over the decades. The art on Parliament Hill was sculpted as our country was sculpted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827553">What is more, outside this very chamber are the portraits of many former Speakers of the House of Commons and the portraits of 21 of the 22 former prime ministers. I am personally quite fond of the painting of Canada's ninth prime minister, Blanshard Township-born Arthur Meighen, the right hon. member who was perhaps the greatest orator that this House has ever seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827554">It was, in fact, Canadian historian Arthur Milnes, when he was doing work on a project on Arthur Meighen, who discovered a serious blunder related to that portrait. While the portrait had been displayed on Parliament Hill since it was painted by Ernest Fosbery in 1948, it had never been officially unveiled or dedicated. Fortunately, that oversight was corrected when then prime minister Stephen Harper, then Speaker Peter Milliken, former prime minister Joe Clark and then senator Michael Meighen rectified the situation and held an official portrait unveiling in February 2011.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827555">As a side note, I would note that this past Tuesday evening, I had the great privilege of speaking with our former Senate colleague, Michael Meighen, at the opening night of the Stratford Festival's 2023 season. It gives me the opportunity to highlight former senator Meighen and the Meighen family for their strong support of the Stratford Festival and, in particular, the Meighen Forum, which makes such contributions to thoughtful reflection on the arts and culture in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827556">Back to the Meighen portrait, it was displayed in Centre Block with the other prime ministerial portraits until they were moved here in 2018. While it is unfortunate that the formal portrait unveiling did not occur while Arthur Meighen was still alive, perhaps having a parliamentary visual artist at the time may have rectified that situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827557">I did mention that the portraits of 21 of our 22 former prime ministers are hung on these walls. The one that is missing is our former prime minister Stephen Harper, who is yet to have his own portrait unveiled. I know all members are looking forward to the day when we unveil his portrait as one of Canada's great leaders of this century.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827558">Another great work of art that hangs within the parliamentary precinct is entitled <I>The Ghosts of Vimy Ridge</I>. It was painted in 1928 by William Longstaff. This magnificent work shows a dark sky over the Vimy Ridge memorial in France. The description of the painting from the House of Commons says:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827562">This painting used to hang in the railway committee room of Centre Block, where the opposition parties held their caucus meetings. However, since the closure of that building, it has been moved to the main floor of the Wellington Building, a building in which I am pleased to have an office. I am able to pass by that painting each day on my way to work. It reminds us of the bravery and sacrifice of so many Canadian soldiers who helped make this country what it is today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827563">Recognizing that the bill is likely to pass, I would encourage the first holder of this position to prioritize the creation of more paintings and artworks to honour the Canadian soldiers who gave their lives in other battles, including at Normandy, in the Korean War, in more recent peacekeeping missions and, certainly, in the war in Afghanistan. I would note that, about two months ago, I learned of a great painting in Cambridge, Ontario, that honours the lives of the 159 Canadians who died in Afghanistan. This painting needs a new home, and I think it would be appropriate that such a painting be displayed here on Parliament Hill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827564">Before I wrap up, I want to highlight one visual artist from my riding, Horatio Walker. Born in Listowel in 1858, Horatio Walker was primarily a self-taught artist, and he soon became known for his beautiful paintings depicting rural life in Canada. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Canada in 1918, and he became its president in 1925. However, his works have never been displayed here on Parliament Hill, nor have I found a record of any of his paintings displayed within the precinct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827565">Part of the mandate for the parliamentary visual artist laureate, as provided in Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document>, is to “give advice to the Parliamentary Librarian regarding the collection of the Library and acquisitions to enrich the Library’s cultural holdings”. If this position is created, I hope that the first parliamentary visual artist laureate will take the initiative and ensure that at least one of Horatio Walker's great paintings, which depict the spirit and beauty of life in rural Canada, will be displayed here on Parliament Hill for all Canadians who come here to view and reflect upon. I know for a fact that just a kilometre from here, a few of his paintings are sitting in storage at the National Gallery, where they are not being viewed by anyone. It would be wonderful if just one of them came to Parliament Hill, so that they could be seen by so many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827566">As well, indigenous art has often been undervalued and unseen in Canada's history. I am hopeful that, if this bill were to pass before this Parliament dissolves, a future visual artist laureate would make a concerted effort to ensure the work of indigenous artists are made well represented within this place. Certainly, as shadow minister for Canadian heritage, my office was in contact with a gentleman in New Brunswick who is looking for a home for several pieces of indigenous art from the great Christian Morrisseau. Thus far, he has found little receptiveness to placing them here. I would hope that the new parliamentary visual artist laureate would find a way to make that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827567">To conclude, Canada is home to so much great art, as well as so much great culture, that we ought to celebrate it and share it with all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">Mr. Peter Julian (New Westminster—Burnaby, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7827568">Madam Speaker, I am rising in support of Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document>. It is a two-page document. It is very straightforward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827569"> It basically asks the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Commons to select the parliamentary visual artist laureate. It would ensure that the person would hold office for a term not exceeding two years. It would ensure that their mandate would be to promote the arts and culture in Canada, and I will come back to that in a moment, because it is for that reason that I am supportive and the NDP is supportive of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827570">The visual artist laureate would produce artistic creations, sponsor artistic events, give advice to the parliamentary librarian and perform other related duties. Therefore, the visual artist laureate could play an important role in fostering the arts. This is important; there is no doubt, and I will come back to why this is important in just a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827571">Because it is a brief bill, it is important to comment on what we do in this place. The reality is that private members' legislation can make a huge difference in people's lives. I am going to talk about two bills that have performed that, really responding to the needs of people in a way that is fundamentally important. I am not suggesting the visual arts laureate is not responding to some need. It does help to foster the arts sector, and for that reason we support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827572">Last night I was at a vigil on Parliament Hill, just a few steps from this place. Moms Stop the Harm had a vigil for members of their families who had passed away due to the toxic drug supply in this country. It was a profoundly moving event as we listened to each of the families step forward to speak about how toxic drugs had had an impact on their family and about the devastating loss of their loved one. Members will recall that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation> brought forward Bill <Document DbId="11496256" Type="4">C-216</Document>, a health-based response to substance use. This bill would have helped those families immeasurably, right across the length and breadth of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827573">This bill on the visual arts laureate will pass easily. I have no doubt that members of all parties will support it, and the visual laureate will be put into place. It is a good thing. I am not suggesting it is a bad thing. It will make a difference in fostering the arts, and, for a number of reasons, that is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827574"> However, the reality is that Bill <Document DbId="11496256" Type="4">C-216</Document>, which would have saved people's lives, was defeated in the House, with Conservatives and Liberals voting against it. The Moms Stop the Harm family members who have lost a loved one lament the fact that in this place we are willing to vote for legislation that is sometimes symbolic and sometimes positive symbolism, and that sometimes makes a difference, but we are unwilling to take the courageous step of adopting legislation that would literally save people's lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827575">I experienced the same thing in presenting as a private member's bill the Canada pharmacare act. Members will recall that two years ago we had a vote in this place on that. There is no doubt that universal pharmacare saves people's lives. Every single country that has universal health care has universal pharmacare. In Canada, the Canadian Nurses Association tells us that hundreds of Canadians die every year because they do not have the financial resources to pay for the medication that will keep them in life. There is no doubt that a private member's bill putting the foundation in place for universal pharmacare would have made an enormous difference in people's lives, yet, again, Conservatives and Liberals in this place voted that down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827576">We have a symbolic piece of legislation, a private member's bill that we do not oppose, to establish a visual artist laureate. It will be adopted by all members of Parliament voting together. We will vote unanimously, perhaps, to put in place a visual artist laureate, but what about universal pharmacare? What about putting in place health care measures that would actually save people's lives and provide support to those who have addictions and are struggling with substance use?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7827577">This is what I find difficult: It is that while we can reach unanimity around things that do not necessarily make a difference in people's lives, time and time again, as a House, as members of Parliament, a majority of us vote against the essential measures that would actually make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827578">With that caveat, I would like to return to Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document> and what I hope will come out of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827579">The reality is that the arts sector in Canada has been a major motor of the economy. I would particularly like to shout out, as the member of Parliament for New Westminster—Burnaby, to the Arts Council of New Westminster and the Burnaby Arts Council for the work they do each and every day to foster the arts and to foster community togetherness in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827580"> The two communities I represent have very strong artistic sectors, and it is the volunteer work that folks have been doing over years that has led to that. We have been very fortunate in the communities I represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827581">However, with COVID we have seen how the arts sector has been hard hit, right across the country, with a 25% decrease in employment levels in arts, entertainment and recreation. In many cases, we are seeing a one-third loss or a 50% loss of gate receipts for festivals and for performing arts, so there is no doubt that the arts sector particularly suffered through COVID and has not been fully revived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827582">For that reason, it makes sense to ensure that a parliamentary visual artist laureate position is put in place and that the laureate immediately starts to work to help publicize the arts sector, to help make a difference in the arts sector, and in a sense to help to revive the arts sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827583">I believe fundamentally that we need to contribute to the arts sector and make that difference right across the country, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278704" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> just agreed with me. The member for Nunavut is a huge supporter of the arts. As we know, Nunavut is a major engine of the arts but is not receiving the support from the federal government that I think other parts of the country should be receiving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827584">The federal government needs to step up far beyond the issue of putting in place the parliamentary visual artist laureate. There is also the restoration of funding that needs to take place right across the country, I would suggest in New Westminster—Burnaby, Nunavut, North Island—Powell River, Nanaimo—Ladysmith and South Okanagan—West Kootenay, as well as right across the country. I have colleagues who represent very vibrant arts sectors in those communities. In fact, I have been to every one of them. It is amazing what the arts sector does in every one of those communities—shepherded and supported by strong members of Parliament, I would add. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827585">The reality is that the federal government has not been there since COVID. There was support that the NDP forced through during COVID to ensure that much of the arts sector that was hard hit by COVID made it through, but now the federal government is stepping back and saying that they are on their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827586">There is the exception, in that we will have a parliamentary visual artist laureate, but that is only a small step in what is actually needed to provide supports to the performing arts and the festivals of arts and culture right across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827587">This is fundamentally important. It goes far beyond the private member's bill. We are sometimes called upon to speak to private member's bills that are symbolic; in some cases they are symbolic, but they have added elements. In this case, there is a symbolism that does provide for other elements, the promotion of the arts on Parliament Hill. Hopefully it will make a difference in the federal government's response to the artistic sector, because ultimately, the federal government needs to step up and go beyond this private member's bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7827589">Madam Speaker, I rise today to close our current debate on the matter of Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document> at second reading, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and to establish a parliamentary visual artist laureate for the parliamentary library.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827590">I would first like to address a couple of comments raised in my colleagues' comments today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827591">The Conservative member spoke about why this is important when we have issues such as people relying on food banks. I would like to point out, as I did in my first speech in the House, that the arts and artists were very negatively impacted during COVID. As just mentioned, many have not fully recovered yet. It is important to bring attention to the arts and the importance of the arts. They were there for us during COVID, even though their revenues suffered tremendously. That is one of the reasons this position is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827592">We also heard from our NDP colleague about other competing priorities, like pharma care. That is the issue we have with the arts. The arts are often competing against other priorities and they often lose. That is a concern. That is why I think this position, this role, is so important to Canadians and the arts community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827593">I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to former senator Patricia Bovey, who has championed this bill every step of the way. Her passion and appreciation for the arts have laid the foundation for our debate, and it is thanks to her that this bill has come to fruition. We owe her our profound appreciation for her invaluable effort and years of service in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827594">The bill presented before us today is one that recognizes and embraces the immense value of art in our country. We are surrounded by culture, beauty and a myriad of visual arts. Our art is a reflection of our Canadian identity and the Canadian soul. It unifies us in our endless appreciation and brings us together in admiration of the many artists who have dedicated countless hours to creating captivating works for our eyes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827595">I would also like to take a moment to thank Senator Wilfred Moore, who first introduced this legislation back in 2016. Although his bill was not able to pass before the dissolution of Parliament, he was the first legislator to introduce the idea of a parliamentary visual artist laureate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827596">I would like to express my gratitude for the kind words spoken by my colleagues as we have debated this bill. It has been frequently stated that art is universal, transcending barriers of language and ideology. It pleases me to witness the truth of this sentiment and that art has touched all of our lives in some shape or form. It communicates ideas and our experiences from every corner of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827597">The Canadian painter Emily Carr once said, “Pictures should be inspired by nature, but made in the soul of the artist; it is the soul of the individual that counts.” It is a profound statement that encapsulates the essence of art and its ability to externalize the depths of an artist's emotions. Through the establishment of this office, we can bring those words to life within the House of Commons. We can give a voice to the soul of our country through its visual creations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827598">Ms. Carr, like too many other talented artists, was not widely recognized for most of her life. At the time, her artistic approach was neither appreciated nor understood. She suffered the fate of countless individuals who waited years to witness the full recognition of their work, if received at all. It will be the duty of the parliamentary visual artist laureate to seek out that talent, give them a platform and ensure that our artists receive the respect they deserve as soon as possible, not posthumously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827599">With the passage of this bill and the establishment of this office, we will honour the works, events and exhibitions of Canadian artists everywhere. The creation of a parliamentary visual artist laureate sends a message to the rest of the country and the world: Art is a universal language that knows no boundaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827600">Canada respects and celebrates this language, embracing the diverse cultural values within our country. From the Pacific coast to the Québécois to the countless indigenous communities and so many others, we want to dedicate an office that ensures their work does not go unnoticed. We value their immense talent and the contributions they have made to our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in showing our appreciation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827601">An office such as the one proposed by this bill would serve as an opportunity for many young artists. Its establishment would provide a platform for young up-and-coming artists to gain exposure and support for their craft. It would foster an environment where new talent can proudly showcase their work and achievements to a broader audience. By doing so, we take another step toward fostering a vibrant, thriving artistic community right here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827602">The parliamentary visual artist laureate would serve as a champion of artistic expression and advocate for its recognition within the country. Collaborating alongside the Speaker and members of Parliament, their insight would be an invaluable resource as we consider the profound influences of culture and art on policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7827603">The passage of Bill <Document DbId="11474321" Type="4">S-202</Document> and the establishment of this office symbolize our commitment to celebrating the transformative power of art. By creating this position, we honour our cultural heritage and pave the way for future generations of artists to thrive. I implore all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, on division. I look forward to seeing my bill through to its successful conclusion.</ParaText>
