The day is dedicated to raising awareness about the dangers of electric shock injuries, which can have long-term health effects with no cure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598706">Proper awareness and safe work practices are essential to preventing these injuries and ensuring the safety of tradespeople. Key safety practices include establishing electrical-safe work conditions by isolating electrical equipment, testing for the absence of voltage and using lockout and tag out protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598707">I want to thank the organizations behind the electrical injury day of recognition for their ongoing commitment to promoting health and safety in the industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598714">Because of these conversations, I know how important the government's initiatives have been. Our national child care strategy has helped more women enter the workforce than ever before. Our women's entrepreneurship strategy is providing loans, investments and a critical knowledge hub.

              <ParaText id="8598716">Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. Protesting for peace in the Middle East and mourning the civilian death toll is legitimate, but shouting, “We are Hamas, we are Hezbollah” or “Death to Canada” in protest on October 7, as we saw in Vancouver, is despicable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598717">This echoes the problems we are also hearing about in Quebec. The Bloc Québécois unreservedly condemns such statements. There is a difference, a gulf, between freedom of expression and claiming to be part of a known terrorist entity. There is a wide gap between wishing for the Palestinians' safety and freedom and calling for the death of Canada. That is coming from a separatist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598718">I have a message for those who really want a ceasefire. They should ask their federal government why it is doing absolutely nothing rather than intimidating their Jewish neighbours in Quebec and Canada. They have nothing to do with this. That is the difference between a pro-Palestinian protest for peace and an anti-Semitic rally to incite violence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598722">Farmer by day and prolific poet by night, he composed verse, not in English but in his native Icelandic. He has been called the greatest poet of the western world, having published more than 2,000 pages of high-standard poetry. The local Stephan G. Stephansson Icelandic Society, formed 50 years ago, restored the original home site, which is now an Alberta provincial historical site. The Writers' Guild of Alberta annually presents the Stephan G. Stephansson award in Stephansson's honour as it celebrates this amazing poet and playwright.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598730">Unfortunately, in some provinces, the recommendation is to begin screening at age 50. That means that many women are diagnosed in the later stages of the disease, which reduces their chances of survival.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598980">Madam Speaker, I move that the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, presented on Tuesday, October 4, 2022, be concurred in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598981">I am pleased to start the debate on this report, which is entitled “Facial Recognition Technology and the Growing Power of Artificial Intelligence”. My constituents in Trois‑Rivières regularly talk to me about these two topics. They are worried about these things. We hope to be able to shed light on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598982">Over the past few years, facial recognition has become common. We like it when our iPhone recognizes us and every app can start opening up without us having to do anything. There is a catch, though. An iPhone recognizes a face, obviously, but who has read their iPhone's terms and conditions? Do users know what happens to the image that has been recorded? Do they know if they own their own image? What are the restrictions on the use of that image?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598983">At the time of the study, those were the types of questions that got the committee interested in this topic. We are going to show that there are immense benefits to facial recognition. However, there are also some immense drawbacks. We are going to have to be able to weigh these types of things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598984">Facial recognition has obviously improved over time. The report, which dates back to October 2022, is quite relevant. However, it must be said that since the emergence of generative AI, these kinds of tools have started developing more rapidly. It is getting hard to keep up. There are no real regulations governing the use of AI or facial recognition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598985">A few years ago, in February 2021, the Privacy Commissioner released an investigation in which he found that Clearview AI, a facial recognition company, had violated the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. Basically, what happened was that when shopping mall customers looked at the store directory screen, their image would be recorded and they would be tracked through the mall to monitor what they were doing in order to build profiles on them. The commissioner found that these practices violated the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598986">Facial recognition is more than that. There is surveillance everywhere. Many things can be associated with facial recognition. To go a step further, I would like to propose a definition of facial recognition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598987">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Facial recognition...is the process of identifying a face from a digital image or video. [Facial recognition technology] can be deployed in real time or on static images. It uses computer pattern recognition to find commonalities in images depicting human faces.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598988">Obviously, it does not always work perfectly. Someone may have such a bad night that their iPhone does not recognize their face in the morning. It is not perfect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598989">However, we have to admit that although this technology does make our lives easier, it can also poison our existence. Several witnesses told us that this identification technology sometimes has a lower success rate among Asian people and people of colour. This is a problem if, for example, facial recognition is used by police to identify a witness or an accused person, and the wrong person is identified. Obviously, a 30% success rate for Asian people and people of colour is a bit low, so clearly, we need to be careful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598990">Facial recognition equals identity. Identity is how someone presents themselves to the world, how they relate to others. It is the most beautiful definition of otherness, and I am certain my colleagues in the room can easily appreciate that. Otherness is how we present ourselves to others. Our face is unique. Some may say that some faces are less so than others, but our face is unique. It is a valuable source of identification.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598994">Madam Speaker, as I was saying, there are many different uses. Did people consent to those uses? Did they consent to being in an ad when they were walking down the street? Did they consent to having their image captured as they were getting on a bus in Trois‑Rivières? Did they consent to their comings and goings being tracked? Did passengers arriving at Trudeau airport consent to being identified for their passport using facial recognition?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598995">How is that data being used? Did people consent to that? Is that data protected? After the data leak at Desjardins, we have to wonder whether facial recognition data at risk too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598996">This is certainly something we need to work on. Unfortunately, the lack of regulations gives the bad guys a definite advantage. Those looking to sidestep regulations sometimes succeed, but it is complicated. However, if there are no regulations, then it is the wild west, really.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598997">Let me give a few examples of the benefits that facial recognition technology has to offer. Daniel Therrien, the former privacy commissioner of Canada, said that facial recognition can be used to solve serious crimes, such as missing children cases. It can also be used for other compelling state purposes, such as in the border context to ensure that people of concern can be identified at the border while not impeding the flow of travellers to the country. Obviously, that is desirable. These kinds of uses are intended to protect us. I think we would all support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598998">However, there are drawbacks, and they often concern mass surveillance. One thing is immediately obvious. Mass surveillance is definitely being done without a warrant. People are being surveilled at baseball games, on the bus and in the subway. Although the goal may be to identify a perpetrator, everyone is surveilled in the process. That is problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598999">As for the disadvantages, Patricia Kosseim, Ontario's information and privacy commissioner, told us that, with regard to facial recognition, the biggest concern of commissioners across Canada is mass surveillance, whether done by a third-party private sector company on behalf of the police or by the police service itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599000">Assistant or deputy commissioners of the RCMP candidly told us that they were using facial recognition without a warrant and without letting the public know. Obviously, we can expect the RCMP to use facial recognition for legitimate, worthy reasons. However, the privacy commissioner also found that there had been serious and systemic failings to ensure compliance with the act before collecting personal information and before collecting information in general, for that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599001">I was talking about shopping malls a little earlier. I mentioned the buses in Trois‑Rivières because facial recognition is used on them too. I think we need to be careful, because on top of the inherent bias against Asian people and people of colour, for example, criminal bias exists as well. Poor-quality cameras can produce images that lead to a person being incorrectly identified. In short, facial recognition is not foolproof.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599002">Now, our faces can be used for other purposes as well, including disinformation. We have started seeing videos on social media of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris kissing and partying together. They are public figures, but the same thing could happen to us. We could show up in a photo or video with someone who was never actually with us, doing something we never did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599003">We have to be careful. Disinformation is a serious problem today, one whose impact we often underestimate. All sorts of foreign actors can put information out there for all to see, thinking that they can convince people. Last week, I believe it was Tuesday, Communications Security Establishment Canada intercepted 6.6 billion attempts at disinformation in Canada. That is just another day at the office for the CSE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599004">The fact is that all of this information contributes to how we think. It may lead us to do things that we may not have done otherwise. That is a problem. Facial recognition is one many tools of disinformation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599005">There is another rather remarkable thing that is concerning. When it comes to the environment, we often hear talk of social licence. We need to be careful because social licence is a form of renunciation, for example, we would prefer A to B. Social licence does not necessarily equate to enthusiasm. However, there has never even been a debate about social licence or future social licence for facial recognition. It is assumed that, if we are in a public place, our face is part of the mosaic and that, if we did not want to be there, then we could just do nothing. In my previous career, people often told me that they had not done anything wrong and so it was no big deal if their image was being captured. I often answered those people by saying that, if they knew what could be done with those images, they might be more concerned. There are always malicious actors around, whether local or international.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599006">The topic is not being discussed. We discussed it once with our colleagues on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. We discussed it with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278574" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation>. However, these discussions have not necessarily filtered through to society as yet. Some groups have apprehensions, but no discussion is happening. Concerns are being raised, but that is not enough. Ultimately, we concluded that we should probably make a few recommendations. Given the total absence of any regulations, we had to at least come up with a few proposals that would make the use of facial recognition more transparent. I am going to quote a few of the 19 recommendations, including the first and foremost among them, which reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599007">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the Government of Canada amend...the <I>Privacy Act</I> to require a government institution to ensure that the practices [when using facial recognition]...are lawful.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599008">We are talking about the Canada Border Services Agency, the passport office, a whole bunch of places like that. We figured that the Privacy Act had not been revised since before the Internet arrived on the scene, and that a little update would be in order. I am throwing this idea out to my colleagues on the other side of the House. All kinds of committee reports have been presented and, in its responses, the government often says that we have some good ideas. However, an intention without action is just an intention. It is worthless, even if it is a good one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599009">We also thought there should be clear sanctions for privacy violations committed by the police. After all, law enforcement agencies are among the biggest users of facial recognition. I am not blaming them; there are legitimate reasons for using it. However, when they do violate privacy, whether voluntarily or not, there should be clear sanctions. When an action has no consequences, people continue doing it because there is no cost, financial or otherwise. It becomes a habit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599010">The following is another one of our recommendations:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599011">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the Government of Canada amend the Privacy Act to require that prior to the adoption, creation, or use of facial recognition technology, [the government] seek the advice...of the Privacy Commissioner...</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599012">The Privacy Commissioner needs to be consulted before a facial recognition tool is developed. This recommendation was made in 2022. In 2024, while Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C‑27</Document> is being studied in committee, people are still questioning whether Canadians need to be protected. It is right there, in black and white, in the report. We have to protect citizens because this data is not always used for legitimate reasons, and even if it is used legitimately, it is often used without a warrant. We have to be careful. I think this is a serious warning. To illustrate how important this is, the fact is that two years later, we are still talking about it. There have been no conclusions and, in fact, the situation has sometimes been trivialized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599013">I want to talk about another interesting recommendation. It is not often discussed. It is the right to be forgotten. Someone might want to be removed from the network. The European Union adopted a similar recommendation. The right to be forgotten is the possibility of contacting an agency that coordinates everything in order to allow an individual to not be automatically identified on social media or to be forgotten if they want to disappear. This may seem odd in a time of influencers who take selfies every four seconds, but a person may not want to be on the web for very legitimate reasons. We want the government to require “service providers, social media platforms and other online entities operating in Canada to delete all users’ personal information after a set period following users’ termination of use”. This could include responses to polls, text messages a person sends, or photos in which they are identified. We would like to make it possible for this to be deleted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599014">I will not quote the other 16 recommendations. By the very nature of the recommendations that were made following a lengthy consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, provincial commissioners and stakeholders who promote facial recognition, as well as those who criticize its use, there was unanimous agreement that something had to be done. As we know, nature abhors a vacuum, and where there is nothing, the nothing gets filled with something. It is frustrating.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599015">Just before I close, I would like to quote a witness, Carole Piovesan, from INQ Law. She said that we need to be careful, that we need to increase transparency, but that, if we are going to do it, we need to do it “with a scalpel, not an axe”. The idea is to be aware of this relatively new technology, which, after two years, is no longer all that new. We can benefit from it, as I have just outlined, and we can guard against the harms, particularly the ones I mentioned.</ParaText>

Through that advancement there is a responsibility of the different stakeholders, in particular government, to look for ways in which we can actually ensure that our laws and regulations are of benefit and provide the type of assurances that Canadians want to see. It does not matter where one lives in Canada; it is just the general feeling, I believe, that a vast majority have.</ParaText>

The responsible person is the one who can promise things. In this case, we are talking about the government.</ParaText>

As an ethicist, he brings subject matter expertise that is often lacking in terms of the nuance of these critical discussions, particularly around technology that many of us have only really scratched the surface on. He will recall, in talking about the strength of the recommendations, two recommendations in particular. One was recommendation number 18, which was unanimously passed by the committee, that the Government of Canada impose a federal moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology by federal policing services and Canadian industries unless implemented in a confirmed consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. What we came to find, and I am sure the hon. member will recall and perhaps can expand on this, is that this was the Wild West. Departments were using this technology without any kind of formal privacy impact assessments, there was no contemplation by the Privacy Commissioner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599041">In 2014, however, they made two decisions. They decided to have schools teach critical thinking so that people could make what I would call reasonably enlightened choices. They also decided to bolster independent media by strengthening their independence and freedom. The two conditions for countering disinformation were therefore education and strong media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599042">I am forced to concede that here, in Canada, these things are somewhat lacking. It saddens me, because I have not seen many places that teach critical thinking, even to young children. Right now, all we see are local media crumbling and collapsing. We have become fertile ground for disinformation, especially when it is spread by malicious foreign actors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599046">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and speak on an issue that I know is very important to all Canadians. I wanted to make note of a couple of things before I really get under way. When we think of the Internet, I think that we need to put it into the perspective of how things have changed over time in a very significant way. I would suggest that applies more to the industry of technological changes related to the Internet and computers: it is virtually second to none, and it is something we all need to be much aware of. It is an issue our constituents are very concerned with. I think, at the end of the day, we need to recognize just how much things have changed and the importance of governments to show that not only do they understand the issue, but they also have taken tangible actions in order to address the many different concerns out there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599047">I will start off by saying there are a number of pieces of legislation that are all related to that technological change. If we canvass Canadians, we will find that there is a wide spectrum of ways they use the internet. There are many benefits to it, and there are many drawbacks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599048">The legislative agenda that we have put forward and advanced over the last number of years deals with both sides: How important it is to have a framework that enables us to protect, for example, the marketplace; and how important it is that we have laws that protect the victims of the abuse that takes place over the Internet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599049">I would like to cite three pieces of legislation and where they are at today. It is not necessarily because of the government's will to constantly push opposition members in trying to get through the legislation, but I believe that these are the types of legislation that a vast majority of Canadians would ultimately support. I can make reference to the issue of protection, for example. I think there have been four concurrence reports from the Conservative Party, this is either the second or third from the Bloc and I know the New Democrats have done a concurrence report. This is all during government business. Then we have had the issue of the matters of privilege. No Conservative is standing up saying, “Why are we doing these concurrence reports when we should be dealing with the privilege?” This is because the privilege is actually being used as a tool to prevent the discussion of legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599050">Why is that important to highlight right now? It is because one of the pieces of legislation we have been trying to push out of second reading is Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act. That is a piece of legislation that ultimately protects individuals and our communities from inappropriate behaviour taking place on the Internet and creating victims. These are the types of things to which I question, what role does government have? This particular report raises a number of concerns on the impacts of AI and facial recognition. Imagine all the images on the Internet today that Canadians do not want on the Internet.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599051"> I am thinking of a breakup where one spouse is, without the consent of the ex, putting inappropriate pictures on the Internet. Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> is legislation that addresses an issue of that nature, yet it continues to be frustrated in terms of getting through the House of Commons on second reading. However, I know that a majority of members of Parliament who are sitting in the House of Commons actually support Bill C-63. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599052">We have Bill <Document DbId="11862853" Type="3">C-26</Document>, which deals with the important issue of cybersecurity. When we think of cybersecurity, we can imagine the data banks out there collecting information and how critical that information is. We are defending and supporting Canadians, where we can, through issues related to privacy and the potential leak of data bank information. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599053">There was a time when a data bank was paper-driven, and the shredders might have had good business at the time. I remember going into an embassy where I saw containers full of correspondence. Containers are disappearing as more and more things are becoming digital, and that applies in many different forms. In literally seconds, millions of data points can actually be lost and ultimately acquired by someone who might have malicious intent. However, we are still waiting for Bill <Document DbId="11862853" Type="3">C-26</Document> to ultimately get that royal assent, not to mention Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599054">Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> has a great deal to do with what we are talking about today. I think members need to fully understand, when we look at how important this issue is, that the last time we actually had a modernization of the acts that are in question, and I am referring to Bill C-27, was back in 2000, over 20 years ago, when iPhones did not exist. Can members imagine a time where iPhones did not exist? I can, and it really was not all that long ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599055">When I was first elected, when I turned on the computer, the first thing I heard was a dial tone, a ding-dong, and then I was logged onto the Internet type of thing, and it took quite a while to get that connection. People used five-and-a-half-inch floppy disks. However, from 1995 to 2001, we really started to see an explosion of Internet advancement and technology, and it continues today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599056">Let us think about where the government has put its investments. It is not only toward protecting Canadians, but toward ensuring that communities have access to the Internet because of how critical it is to all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599057">We can look at one of the largest expenditures in my own province of Manitoba, which expanded broadband Internet into rural communities. It is being financed through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Ironically, it is the same Canada Infrastructure Bank that the Conservatives say is doing nothing and has no projects. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has said he is going to get rid of the Infrastructure Bank. However, in Manitoba, we have seen the Internet expand through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599058">The Internet is an absolutely essential service today. Back in the late eighties and going into the nineties, some might have said it was an option. Today, it is not an option. The year 2000 was the last time the act was updated. For almost a decade, Stephen Harper chose to do absolutely nothing to protect individuals' identifications from being consumed through the Internet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599059">This government, for a number of years, has been looking at how we can modernize the protection of Canadians through the Internet and how we can maximize the benefits of the Internet, while minimizing harms to society. Those are the types of initiatives the Government of Canada has been taking to show, in a very real and tangible way, whether with legislative or budgetary measures, that it understands the technology. We are going to continue not only to be there but also to invest in it. It is one of the reasons that Canada virtually leads the rest of the world in many areas, especially on AI and facial recognition. It is because we understand, looking forward, the role that they are going to play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599060">That is why it is so important to bring forward legislation and, ultimately, look across the way. In a minority situation, we need a sense of co-operation coming from all opposition parties. It does not take a majority of members to prevent things from happening in the House. All it takes is one political party. Any political entity in the House that has 13 or 14 members can cause a great deal of frustration, even though a majority inside the House might want to see actions taken. In the last federal election, a minority government was elected, but that does not take responsibility away from all political parties to take the actions necessary to support what is in the best interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599061">That is why I am standing up to speak to the report, which had a lot of work. I was not at the committee, but I can assure everyone that a great deal of effort would have been put into coming up with the report.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599062">Having read some of the comments provided by the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s office in response to the report, obviously the government has taken the report very seriously. If members want to get an appreciation for the content of the report, I would encourage them to take a look at it. They should also look at the response the government has provided to the report. I suspect that if they were to take a look at the response, they would find that once again, much as in the many comments I have put on the record thus far, we have a government that understands the issue and the report and has taken action, not only today but previously, to deal with the concerns being raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599063">All we need to do is take a look at Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. In his response, even the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> made reference to Bill C-27. If members are genuinely concerned about the report, they should be sympathetic to at least allowing Bill C-27 to get out of committee. Why would that not happen? I can assure members, contrary to what the member across the way said, that as a government, we are constantly listening to Canadians. That is why we will find within our measures, whether they are legislative or budget measures, the thoughts and ideas of the people of Canada being reflected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599064"> The Speaker's constituents, my constituents and all of our constituents are genuinely concerned about what is happening on the Internet today. To amplify that fact and the need for change, I quickly made reference to the year 2000, when we last had legislation. We had a big gap when absolutely nothing was done. I call that the Stephen Harper era. Then we had a government replace that era and it immediately started to work with Canadians to get a better understanding of the types of legislation and regulations that are necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599065">The best example that I can come up with, because of the explosion of iPhones out there today, is the issue of Facebook and how many people participate in Facebook. How many people own an iPad or iPhone or are on Facebook, Instagram or the many other social media, which did not exist in 2000? None of them existed. If that is the case, as I stated, I think a good question to pose is why there is resistance to supporting what Canadians want to see. Why would anyone oppose the framework legislation that we are bringing forward that would protect the interests of Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599066"> As I said, it is not like the Internet is an option nowadays. Today, it is an essential service. People will go to the Internet for a wide spectrum of reasons, whether it is streaming a favourite show from the past or something more recent, or looking at issues related to health conditions. I am always amazed at how the general knowledge of the population continues to grow on health-related issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599069">Madam Speaker, we are debating a report that was presented by the ethics committee on a study it did in 2022 about facial recognition and the advancement of artificial intelligence. One issue that has come up is that the technological advancements in AI are having an impact on the spread of disinformation and misinformation. They are also affecting and impacting the privacy rights of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599070"> One thing the Privacy Commissioner has talked about frequently at the ethics committee is the need to update the Privacy Act to ensure that privacy is a fundamental right for all Canadians. I am wondering what the member's opinion is on that and whether the government has any plans to update the Privacy Act to recognize that privacy is a fundamental right.</ParaText>

I made reference in my comments to Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act.

              <ParaText id="8599073"> The biggest barrier is not a lack of ideas or legislation. The biggest barrier is, in fact, the Conservative Party of Canada, which continues to prevent legislation from ultimately becoming law. On the one hand, the Conservatives talk about the importance of privacy for Canadians and the importance of cyber-related issues, but when it comes time to advance legislation, they are found wanting. If my colleague believes that we should have legislation, I would encourage him to allow legislation to get through.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599096">What we are doing here today is something called a concurrence debate. It relates to a report that was actually submitted to the House in October 2022, two years ago, on the topic of facial recognition software. This might seem like a very niche topic, but it is really not. Facial recognition software has become pervasive in use, especially here in Canada, and the report provided a set of recommendations on safeguards that could be used to protect Canadians' privacy and their data, as well as to prevent negative social impacts such as the use of facial recognition software to do things like racially profile people from marginalized groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599097">The report had some pretty clear recommendations. It was issued in October 2022, and the government abjectly has failed. It has let two years go by without implementing a single one of the recommendations to protect the health, safety and privacy of Canadians. I want to talk about what the government is going to say that it did in response to the report, and then debunk it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599098">The government tabled a bill, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which has two components. It has some content with regard to privacy and some content with regard to artificial intelligence. The problem with the bill is that virtually every type of civil society group, as well as academics and businesses, has panned both components of the bill for a variety of reasons. Many members of the House have asked for the bill to be split so that the two very disparate topics could be studied separately. The government has refused to do that. Most importantly, the bill contains absolutely nothing on facial recognition, absolutely nothing that materially addresses the recommendations in the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599099">That is why when the Liberals stand up and talk about this, they have to dance around the issue. My colleague from the NDP rightly asked how many of the recommendations had been put in place. The answer is zero.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599100">I am going to outline what the key failures of the bill are and then what the impacts of that are on Canadians. This is not necessarily a front-burner issue, but I think it was really important that the report was brought forward today, because it is something Canadians should be concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599101">There are problems with unregulated use of facial recognition. I know this can sound really technical for some people, but I have to explain how pervasive it is. If someone were to walk into a shopping centre today, there is absolutely nothing stopping that shopping centre from using high-definition cameras to capture their every move, capture their biometric data, attach it to other profiles that the person might have with other companies and then use that information to make a profile on them about what they can afford and how they could be targeted for advertising. In really bad cases, they could be targeted for negative security experiences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599102">This is a very pervasive technology. Basically, anywhere there is a camera, facial recognition software can be and is likely being used. It is being used not just by the private sector; it is also being used by governments, and there are almost no limits on what the Liberal government can do with facial recognition software in Canada today. That is highly problematic for several reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599103">First of all, it is a massive invasion of Canadians' privacy; many times, they do not even know it is happening. That is because of the lack of regulation. The failure of the government to address the recommendations and put regulations into Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> means that Canadians' privacy is at risk. They do not have the ability to consent to when and how facial recognition software can apply to them. The second thing is that this opens them up to big-time data misuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599104">As I said in the shopping centre example, there is really nothing preventing a shopping centre from selling biometric data and putting together a broader profile on somebody to be used for any purpose, without that person's ability to reject it on moral grounds. Under the fundamentals of privacy in Canada, we should have the right to reject it. I would almost argue that it is a human right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599105">The other problem is that it can lead to discrimination and bias. Many studies have shown that facial recognition software actually treats people of colour differently, for a wide variety of reasons. Of course that is going to lead to discrimination and bias in how it is being used. There should be restrictions on that to maintain Canada's pluralism, to ensure equality of opportunity and to ensure that people of colour are not discriminated against because of a lack of regulation. To reiterate, none of these things are in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599106">The unregulated use of facial recognition software, because the government failed to regulate it in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, can also lead to suppression of speech. Let us say that a government wanted to use facial recognition software to monitor people on the street. There would then be, within different government departments, some sort of profiles on who people are, what they do or what their political beliefs are. If government officials see them and maybe a few of their friends coming from different areas and walking to a gathering spot, that could, in theory, be used to disrupt somebody's right to protest. There are absolutely no restrictions on that type of use by government in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599107">We can also see how facial recognition could be used by the government for extensive overreach. Many members of this place will talk about wrongful convictions with respect to facial recognition software. There have been cases where facial recognition software was used to lead toward an arrest or a warrant. Because there are not clearly defined limits or burdens of proof for the use of the technology, it can lead to wrongful arrests and convictions as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599108">It leads to a loss of anonymity. I think we have the right to be anonymous, certainly in this country, but that right has been breached without even any sort of debate in this place, because the government has failed to put the regulations into Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599109">Frankly, the lack of regulations, particularly on government use of facial recognition technology, also means that there is a lack of our ability as legislators to hold the government to account on whether or not it is overreaching. Because we do not have the requirement in law for governments to be transparent about how they are using facial recognition software, we cannot in this place say whether there has been an overreach or not. It is very difficult to get that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599110">To be clear, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> has been panned at committee by civil liberties groups and civil society groups because of three things: It fails to define “biometric function” as sensitive data, fails to provide clear restrictions on when and how businesses and government can use facial recognition technology, and fails to provide adequate safeguards for individuals, especially regarding consent and the potential for discriminatory outcomes. The bill is a failure. It should have long been split, as has been the request of multiple parties of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599111">Furthermore, the reality is that we have not had the debate in the House of Commons on what the guidelines should be for facial recognition technology. What the government has proposed to do in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> is to take that out of this place, this vital debate, and put it in the hands of some Liberal-controlled regulator to be determined behind closed doors, with big tech companies, not us, setting the boundaries on that. That is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599112"> I want to talk about what the government has done. First of all, it has put unfettered use of facial recognition software out into the public. It has failed to define it in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. Then it went one step further. Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the government's massive draconian censorship bill, would go one step further in putting a chill on Canadian speech. It is another layer of Canada's loss of privacy, Canada's loss of speech and Canadians' loss of rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599113"> When the government stands up and talks about Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the draconian censorship bill, as somehow being a response to facial recognition technology, this is not only laughable; it should strike fear into the heart of every Canadian. All of these factors combine to really put a chill on Canadians' privacy, their right to assembly, their right to freedom of speech and their right to live their life without government intrusion or the intrusion of merchants who might be using their biometric data to sell it to other companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599114">It is just insane that Canada has not acted on this. We know that the Liberal government has not acted on it because it is in chaos right now. It has so many scandals, spending crises and ethical breakdowns. However, the one thing it has been focused on is censorship. That is because it does not want Canadians to hold it to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599115">I am very glad that the report is being concurred in in the House. I find it an abject failure of the Liberal government that it has not acted on the recommendations, which, frankly, are non-partisan and should have been put into law a long time ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599124">Madam Speaker, the government has failed on the fronts that my colleague mentioned in two ways: action and omission. On action, the government has censored Canadians through Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which has had a massive effect on YouTube creators, censoring who gets seen and who does not. Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document> has resulted in a news ban for online media platforms, so Canadians cannot get the news. It has also put many newsrooms out of work, so now the government cannot be held to account. Now the government is proposing Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, which will lead to a kangaroo court, wherein any Canadian could be dragged through with vexatious complaints based on their political opinions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599125">As well, through omission, by not putting limits on facial recognition software, the government can overreach and use Canadians' biometric data without any limitation. All of that leads to a police state, a censorship state, and something that every Canadian, regardless of political stripe, should be absolutely opposing with every fibre of their being.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599131">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599132">I thank my colleague for pronouncing my riding name so well. She did a very good job. Above all, she has a wealth of experience, having been a minister in a previous government, which did a great deal for technology, among other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599133">We are talking about a report on facial recognition technology that was tabled two years ago. The reality is that the government has had two years to act on the report's recommendations. Unfortunately, it has done nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599134">Many of our colleagues here have talked about Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>. I have the pleasure of serving on the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, which is responsible for Bill C-27. It is important to understand that facial recognition is nowhere to be found in Bill C-27. It is a bill on artificial intelligence and privacy, but there is not a single line in that bill that talks about facial recognition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599135">I would like to review the chronology of events surrounding Bill C‑27. This is important, because it gives us one more opportunity to consider how the government operated. Earlier on, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> said it was transparent and proactive, that it was doing lots of things, that it had introduced bills, and that it was holding consultations. I have news for him: On June 16, 2022, two and a half years ago, Bill C‑27 was introduced for first reading here in the House. On November 4, 2022, six months later, we debated it at second reading. The bill reached the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology on April 24, 2023, another six months later. However, Bill C‑27 was delayed when other government legislation was given extended consideration, including Bill <Document DbId="12130509" Type="3">C‑34</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="12288299" Type="3">C‑42</Document>. Therefore, to some degree, the government deliberately delayed consideration of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599136">During the study of Bill C‑27, we heard from numerous witnesses. We learned that 300 groups had been consulted. The problem is that they were consulted after the bill was introduced, not before. Surely, if the minister had consulted the organizations beforehand, he might have been able to include something about facial recognition in his bill. It is good to hold consultations, and we have absolutely nothing against that. It is an important thing to do, but ideally, it should be done before the bill is introduced, to avoid situations like the one we are in now, namely that we are still debating Bill C‑27 at the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology. I think there are roughly 250 amendments, including 55 amendments that the government moved to its own bill. How can such a thing happen? How can the government introduce a bill and then move 55 amendments a year and a half or nearly two years later? Someone somewhere must have done a bad job drafting the bill if, after introducing it, the government ended up consulting 300 groups and moving 55 amendments. We call that working backwards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599137">On September 26, 2023, we began studying Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, and we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who, we know, is an excellent salesman. I will give him that. Since the member for Winnipeg North told us to try to say nice things about what the government is doing, I will do just that. The government has an excellent Minister of Industry. He is a good salesman. I have no doubt he could “sell fridges to the Eskimos”. It is incredible. That said, I think that as the bill progressed, the minister was put in a position where he should have backed down, in a sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599138">Contrary to what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278647" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation> said earlier, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> does not cover a whole slew of topics. It covers two: artificial intelligence and privacy. The part of the bill on privacy is what we are debating right now. The progress of Bill C‑27 has been hampered because the Liberals want to establish a tribunal, even though no other country in the world has done that. We do not want this bill to establish a tribunal. There are already other authorities that could do this work, such as the Privacy Commissioner. We do not want to create an additional authority because that would require additional funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599139">We also want Bill C-27 to move forward. The minister keeps telling us that Mr. Bengio from the University of Montreal is the father of AI in Canada and basically in the world. When Mr. Bengio appeared before the committee, he said that we needed to act quickly. We want to, but the reality is that the bill is ill-conceived. The very first witnesses who appeared before the committee told us that this bill is poorly designed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599140">First, artificial intelligence should have been addressed in a separate bill rather than bundled together with privacy, even though we agree that these two topics have elements in common. That does not necessarily mean that the two topics needed to be addressed in the same bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599141">We moved several amendments to this bill. I must say that the committee is working collaboratively. In some committees, there are attacks, it is very politicized, it is very political and it is very partisan. I must say that at the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, we all work very collaboratively. We try to move bills through as quickly as possible, but in the case of Bill C‑27, that was unfortunately not possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599142">Other events took place in 2023 and 2024. I think we have done an amazing job. At committee, many witnesses came to talk about artificial intelligence itself, and their testimony was very interesting. One witness in particular surprised us a bit. They practically said that we are facing a third world war, a technological war that will be fought not with weapons, but with AI. We were a bit shaken when the witness told us that. We thought they were being a bit alarmist, but the reality is that we heard very solid arguments from the experts from across Canada who also appeared at committee on this topic, at the invitation of the various political parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599143">Europe has just passed legislation on artificial intelligence. Here in Canada, if the government had been willing, this bill could have been split up to separate the two subjects. We could still do that. Right now, we could limit ourselves to resolving the issue of AI, in line with what just passed in Europe and what is about to pass in the United States. Their bills have been studied extensively. Quebec already has a law in effect, Bill 25. It is not fully aligned with the legislation that will be created in Canada. A number of legal experts told us that all the provinces' laws absolutely must be consistent with the federal legislation. All of these things come into play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599144">Facial recognition is a fundamental point when it comes to Canadians' quality of life. We have to make sure that people will not be identified by technology that will allow racial profiling, for example. Obviously, we do not want that anywhere. Just two weeks ago, a former Montreal police chief said that there was racial profiling in Montreal. The City of Montreal will probably be charged for that. Things would be even worse if we had tools to facilitate racial profiling.</ParaText>

I was actually proud to participate, as the NDP critic on the committee, in studying and drafting the access to information, privacy and ethics committee's facial recognition technology report called, “Facial Recognition Technology and The Growing Power of Artificial Intelligence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599160"> Today's concurrence motion on our standing committee report, although two years past, remains perhaps even more important today as the technology continues to surpass any legislative regulations and, in my opinion, ethical restrictions. This important and timely work addresses the critical issue of the use of facial recognition technology and its growing power, especially within law enforcement and other sectors of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599161"> As the ethics critic for the NDP, I believe that it is vitally important to scrutinize this technology through the lens of equity, accountability and human rights. The Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics produced this extensive report. Throughout our study, we heard the concerns of 33 witnesses, many of whom were raising alarm bells about the disproportionate harms inflicted on racialized communities and by the unchecked deployment of these technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599162">Let us start with the facts. Facial recognition technology systems are often powered by AI and are hailed for their ability to supposedly streamline processes, verify identities and assist in law enforcement operations. However, the evidence shows that this technology is far from neutral. As we heard from multiple witnesses, including privacy advocates and experts, facial recognition technology is riddled with algorithmic bias, and its misuse can have severe life-altering consequences for people who are already marginalized by society. Witnesses like Cynthia Khoo from the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School, Angelina Wang and Christelle Tessono from Princeton University made it clear that facial recognition technology is 100 times more likely to misidentify Black and Asian individuals. For darker-skinned women, the misidentification rate can exceed one in three. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599163">Now, the system works nearly perfectly for white men, but for racialized individuals, especially Black and indigenous people, it is a flawed and dangerous tool that amplifies the biases already present in our institutions. We have heard time and time again about cases in the United States where Black men were wrongfully arrested due to the errors of facial recognition. Robert Williams, Najeer Parks and Michael Oliver were all victims of a broken system that disproportionately criminalizes Black bodies. Although no such cases have yet to surface in Canada, we cannot ignore the very real possibility of this happening here. We know there is systemic racism within our own police forces, a fact acknowledged by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. So, the use of facial recognition technology, FRT, only serves to exacerbate the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599164">The committee also heard from civil liberties groups, like the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, ICLMG, that the use of this technology by law enforcement is not just flawed but fundamentally dangerous. We are seeing the potential for mass surveillance without public consent or adequate oversight. Tim McSorley of the ICLMG warned us that this is already happening. The RCMP admitted to using FRT tools like Clearview AI to track individuals without public knowledge or legal safeguards. This is surveillance of our most vulnerable communities under the guise of security, and it is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599165">However, the harm does not stop at law enforcement. We must consider the broader societal implications. Facial recognition technology is not just about identifying criminals, it is also about tracking people in public spaces, at protests or even as they shop. This is a direct threat to fundamental rights, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and the right to privacy. Let me be clear, those most affected by this are the very communities that are already subject to overpolicing: Black, indigenous and other racialized people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599166">Beyond this, we must acknowledge the wider context of how big tech companies, like Google, operate in these grey zones between public-facing ethics and the pursuit of profit through military contracts. Google's involvement in military projects, like Project Nimbus and Project Maven, facilitated through its venture capital firm, Google Ventures, is a stark example of this hidden agenda that is unfolding right now in the genocide in Gaza.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599167">Project Nimbus, a cloud computing contract among Google, Amazon and the Israeli government, facilitates military operations. Critics argue that these operations contribute to surveillance and human rights violations, particularly in occupied Palestinian territories. They test it there, and then they export it around the world. Similarly, Project Maven was a highly controversial initiative in which Google partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop AI technologies that improved drone targeting capabilities, technologies that have a devastating impact on civilian populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599168">Although Google publicly distanced itself from Project Maven after internal protests, we know that the company's venture capital firm, Google Ventures, continues to invest in defence and AI companies with military applications. This allows Google to maintain financial stakes in military advancements even as it outwardly claims to step away from these projects. They include activities that are currently under ICJ investigation as war crimes by the Israeli government on the people of Palestine in Gaza and the West Bank. Former staffers who once worked on such military contracts as Maven continue to find themselves in start-ups funded by Google Ventures, ensuring that the ties between big tech and the military remain intact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599169">The use of drone technology and AI in warfare is expanding. We have seen military droned dogs that are armed and have the ability to track down people, including civilians. Therefore, Google's involvement in these venture capital activities demonstrates that these corporations are still very much engaged in these projects, although through more covert financial channels. While Alphabet may distance its brand from military contracts, it continues to benefit from and shape the future of warfare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599170">There is a revolving door between tech companies and the military-industrial complex, which is facilitated by investments from companies such as Google. This underscores the ethical concerns that we must address as a Parliament. The government's role in regulating these technologies is crucial. There are 18 recommendations that came out two years ago, and I challenge the hon. members from the Liberals side to stand up and actually talk about what meaningful action has happened over those two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599171">This is crucial to protecting privacy and civil liberties. Not only that, but it is about preventing big tech from operating unchecked in areas that have profound implications for human rights. The report does not just outline the harms; it also provides a path forward, with several key recommendations that are necessary to mitigate these risks. I asked the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> to please refer to the recommendations and come ready to talk about them in a meaningful way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599172">To be clear, the committee has called for immediate action, including a federal moratorium on the use of facial recognition technologies by police and Canadian industries unless they consult with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and obtain judicial authorization. I would extend this even further to say that these moratoriums ought to include any type of technology, be it deemed primarily lethal or part of a lethal technology that could be used in conjunction with the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the West Bank. Such technology needs to be subject to an immediate arms embargo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599173">Furthermore, we need stringent measures for transparency and accountability. An AI registry must be established in which all algorithmic tools and any entity operating in Canada are listed. Civil society must be actively involved in these discussions, particularly those representing marginalized groups. Witnesses such as Dr. Brenda McPhail from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association warned that, even if the technology were flawless and 100% accurate for every person, it would still pose a danger. This is because it would be perfect for the discriminatory gaze of law enforcement, making it easier to target racialized communities that already face systemic discrimination.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599178">One of the issues that has come up consistently over the last nine years with the government, and we have heard directly from the Privacy Commissioner on this on several occasions, is that oftentimes the Privacy Commissioner is considered an afterthought. They are not even consulted on any of the legislation. The office and the commissioner are not consulted in such a way that they could proactively provide advice to the government in order to avoid many of the pitfalls the hon. member spoke about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599179">I am wondering if the member could speak about the importance of the involvement of the Privacy Commission.

              <ParaText id="8599180">Madam Speaker, the truth is, many of our arm's-length commissioners do not have the resources, the teeth or the legislative ability to really dig in to hold government accountable. Yes, they might have mandates, but what we found at committee, if the hon. member will recall, is that the RCMP often refused to answer our questions fully and truthfully. It did not have what is called “a duty of candour” in terms of being able to answer questions and be held accountable. We often found at committee that the RCMP would send members of the law enforcement chain of command who did not have adequate answers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599181">If they were doing that to us, as parliamentarians, I can only imagine how frustrating the process is for privacy commissioners, as an afterthought. I cannot recall exactly what the number was, but we only scratched the surface on how this is being used ubiquitously across government. What we came to find out was that the vast majority of departments never once considered a privacy impact assessment, even though that was required by their departmental mandates.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599189">It is sad that we have not seen the government use this report for what it should have been used for. It is a call for action to deal with many of the issues of artificial intelligence, and it puts due light and justice not only to areas of concern but also to some of the good that AI can do, as my colleague referenced, when it is applied to conditions that have oversight and due diligence related to knowledge and awareness. It also looks at the vulnerabilities of AI as it is being built out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599190">I have had the opportunity to attend several conferences across the United States and Canada on artificial intelligence, and I can say that we are missing the opportunity to act in a responsible fashion. My colleague mentioned some practical examples, and I will return to those in a few minutes. I want to start by identifying that at the industry committee, Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, to deal with artificial intelligence, has been languishing since the start of this Parliament. That bill was tabled by the government and not a single thing took place with respect to it for a full year. We had a series of hearings and discussions with testimony that lasted weeks upon weeks to get to the bill, and at that time, we identified several problems. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599191">There are two key components the New Democrats have been pushing for with regard to this bill that are important right now. The issues over privacy, which there seems to be a path forward to resolve, were part of the bill. Then the government decided to put artificial intelligence in the bill as well, which complicated the bill's sense. The government tried to sneak one past everybody by combining these pieces of legislation, which was not necessary. In fact, it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation> who got the bill separated for votes in this chamber, which we can still have, but the bill should never have been put together like this. The protection of Canadians' privacy should have been, foremost, the part of the bill we did first, before even going to testimony on artificial intelligence, instead of trying to sneak one by the Canadian public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599192">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278613" Type="2">Hamilton</Affiliation> has outlined some of the deficiencies of artificial intelligence related to facial recognition, which this report speaks to. However, artificial intelligence, given some of the models that have been developed to date that people use, also already shows biases with regard to race, religion and the inputs it has. I have heard from the Amazons and the Googles at different conferences, and they admit to their failures in creating algorithms. They have biases for race and different genders built and baked into their systems because the people generating AI are not diverse and do not have to deal with the consequences of people being identified and misidentified mostly based on not being white and male. That is a known fact in the entire universe of AI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599193">In fact, at the time the government tabled the bill, a number of AI scientists broke from the major conglomerates to warn humanity about that. However, we have seen what has taken place from how badly the bill was manufactured, as we have over 200 amendments on this bill alone. As referenced here in the chamber by one of my colleagues on the committee, over 50 amendments were from the government, which tells us how badly it was crafted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599194"> Those are very important factors to identify, because we are passing on protecting Canadian privacy and on updating the Privacy Commissioner. That is identified through several excellent recommendations in this report, which call for action. Despite that, not only have the Liberals done nothing, but on top of that, they filibustered their own bill. Even in the past week, when the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was in Montreal, the Liberals blamed the committee and the opposition for holding up the bill. His own members filibustered their own bill before we broke at the end of the last session. That is what took place in committee and they blamed us publicly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599195">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> at committee just last week whether he regretted his comments or at least wanted to clarify them, but he doubled down. We have been requesting amendments to deal with the Privacy Commissioner and to protect Canadians, which they know of, but the Liberals are hanging onto the idea that we want to be complicit in an AI strategy that is not fundamentally vetted and has the not-for-profit community, the public and the academic community all concerned.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599196">The Googles, the Amazons and all the others that are going to benefit from this are not concerned, and that is why they are clinging on to keeping the bill together. What I want to talk about, in terms of how we can move forward, the NDP's proposition to deal with the one carrying point that has a problem. This has united the other members on the committee, the Conservatives, the Bloc and the NDP, who are concerned about a tribunal system set up regarding the Privacy Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599197">We have concerns about that because the Competition Bureau has a tribunal over top of it. As New Democrats called for stopping the takeover of Shaw by Rogers, the government allowed the Competition Bureau to be sued for $5 million for doing its job by Rogers itself. The New Democrats defended the Canadian public. They defended the position that should have been there, which was not to let this takeover take place. On top of that, the public was punished by not even having their representation be able to carry the case without repercussions that were allowed from Rogers and Telus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599198">To wrap up quickly, the real repercussions are as follows: We have seen the Lavender project used by the Israel Defense Forces, using artificial intelligence, as a practical situation that has cost human lives. Today, this has consequences for thousands of families in Gaza. It is a real situation that has come to take place since this report was published. It is a real situation in which artificial intelligence in the military needs oversight and control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599199">I agree with my colleague and the rest of the committee in their call for halting artificial intelligence face recognition right now until we get some controls. It is about time the Liberals actually came to the table with solutions instead of putting up problems and other problems in the future.</ParaText>

We are here again, day after day, asking for accountability. “It is hard not to feel disappointed in one's government when every day there is a new scandal”. Do members know who said that? Those were the words of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> more than 10 years ago, back when he was somebody who at least pretended to care about honesty and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599209">That was then and this is now. We are nine years into the Liberal-NDP government and it has proven that absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is another day and another scandal, just another reason we are here. Indeed, we are deeply disappointed in the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599210">We have $400 million of taxpayer money in question. That is more than in the sponsorship scandal, another scandal the Liberals are well known for in Canadian history. We have over 186 conflicts of interest, as determined by the Auditor General, and more Liberal arrogance and sanctimony that seem to suggest “rules for me, and not for thee”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599211">We have already been here for a week trying to make the government turn over the documents, at least to the police, and comply with an order from the Speaker. The Speaker ruled that what the government is up to, or whoever's advice it is taking, is against the rules and it should produce these documents for the House. However, the government refuses to listen, ignoring the order right here in the House, an order of Parliament, and a decision of the Speaker, in a blatant effort to obstruct the truth and hide the paper trail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599212">That is why we are here, day after day. If the Liberals are trying this hard, there must be something really bad in those documents, and we are going to find out somehow. We are going to be here for as long as it takes for the people of this country to get accountability for the corruption, and for the Liberals to turn those documents over to police, so this place can get back to doing the work of Parliament.</ParaText>

That is exactly what the order of the House asks it to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599214">There is a way to bury this out of sight and out of mind, and out of accountability, to skirt the consequences of whatever the Liberals are hiding.

              <ParaText id="8599218">The former finance minister Bill Morneau proved it again and again, like when he somehow forgot he owned a luxury villa in France, or when he sold off the shares to a company that he directly influenced as finance minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599219">Let us not forget about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who breached conflict of interest rules while in office. He used his position to get VIP treatment from foreign officials in violation of ethics laws. He did it again during the WE Charity scandal, funnelling nearly a billion dollars into an organization that employed members of his family and members of the finance minister's family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599220">Who could forget SNC-Lavalin, where the government spent months inappropriately pressuring the Attorney General to give preferential treatment to a big, powerful Liberal-supporting company, despite a paper trail of corrupt actions from here all the way to the Great White North? There was also the former Liberal MP who got over $200 million on a sole-source contract to provide equipment that was never used. I know it is difficult to keep up with the scandals. I find it difficult too and I work here.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599221">Then, of course, there is the arrive scam scandal. The Liberals paid $54 million for an app that could have been built in a weekend for $250,000, an app that did not work and inadvertently sent tens of thousands of people into quarantine. They covered up that scandal, just like they are covering up whatever they are covering up today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599222">It is a shame that we see all this grift and corruption happening in Ottawa. These are just a few examples. I think about what my family and parents would say about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599223">My parents came to this country with nothing. As many members of this chamber know, they were refugees from a Communist eastern European country. My dad drove a taxi and worked in a small business so that my mom, my brother and I could go to school. My parents paid their taxes. They did what they were asked to do by society. They scrimped, saved and worked harder than anybody I have ever known just to give us a better life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599224">It is those tax dollars that the government is using to ship to Liberal insiders. It is the tax dollars of single mothers who have to work overtime just to have a little bit extra every month so they can pay for food or fill up another tank of gas in their car. It is the tax dollars of seniors who have to make a choice between eating, heating their home or paying for medicine because the cost of living in Canada has become just too high for them. It is the tax dollars of those who recently came to this country with a vision painted for them by the government, only to find that things here are far from what they expected and were promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599225"> A million people in my province alone used a food bank in the last month. The best that the government could do for them was to take their money and use it for people whose only qualification for it was to have a Liberal membership card. It gave almost $400 million to a board it appointed so its members could give that money to their own companies. That is what we are discussing here today. Then the government goes back to those middle-class families, because it is the middle-class families who are using food banks, to tell them that their taxes are too low and that they should pay even more in taxes so that it can do more of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599226">We can debate for days in Parliament to get the government to turn over the evidence of its wrongdoing to the police. It does not even have the basic respect to tell Canadians what is going on with their tax dollars. If it did, we would not be here for the seventh day in a row. It is covering up the evidence again. That is exactly why we are here, and we are going to be here until it produces those documents, as the Speaker said it should. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599227">Speaking of Liberal membership cards, I think we should talk about corruption in the government. I do not know that we can do that without bringing up Mark Carney, carbon tax Carney, as we like to call him, and I think many other Canadians are now calling him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599228">Just a few weeks ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave carbon tax Carney a plum job of being the new phantom finance minister, giving him a job that he so desperately wanted. He is getting all the perks of being a finance minister. He will get to set economic policy and give the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> advice. However, he has none of the burdens, such as the pesky ethics and conflict of interest rules that every other member would have to go through if they still worked in the private sector like he does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599229">That means Mark Carney gets to continue to sit on boards of massive corporations, such as Brookfield, where he can continue the time-worn Liberal tradition of enriching insiders with Canadian tax dollars, the exact same thing the Liberals refuse to produce documents for in the House today. It took him just days to get there. Already, Brookfield is asking Ottawa for another $10-billion new fund. That is a fund that Brookfield would pocket with management fees. We have no idea how much he is going to get paid for that. We have no idea what that looks like and what the returns will be. These are just a few of the jobs. The chair of Brookfield is one of them. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s phantom finance minister is another. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599230">On top of that, Mark Carney has another job. He is going to be the guy who will be in charge of raising dough for the Liberals in the next election campaign, and he is already sliding into people's inboxes asking for money if they are on the Liberal donor list, unless they end up in their spam folder, which it seems most Canadians have by now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599231"> At some point, the breaking of the conflict of interest rules here become so obvious. It is also obvious that there is disappointment in so many other things that the government does. It would start to become comical if it were not such a serious issue. Maybe Mark Carney can call the other Randy and give him some pointers on conflict of interest. This is what I am talking about. We cannot even keep track. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599232">That brings us to where we are today with Sustainable Development Technology Canada. That is the organization we are discussing today. Essentially, it is a billion-dollar slush fund, with Canadian tax money spent at will. It was supposed to give money to companies developing new technology that would grow our economy, help reduce our carbon footprint and all of that, but what actually happened? That is what we do not know. Nearly $400 million was misspent. Ten businesses did not fit eligibility requirements, but they got $60 million. Board members had the rules right in front of them, but they chose not to follow them or were simply unable to. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599233">We have a <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who disregarded all of that, who simply did not pay attention. His job is to pay attention. We know that 82% of contracts analyzed by the Auditor General had conflicts of interest. If there was a school of corruption, these guys would be honour students. The Auditor General raised the red flags. Members from many parties in this House raised red flags too, even the New Democrats, who are practically still best friends with the Liberals. They ripped up the agreement a couple weeks ago but taped it back together, and now we are in a weird time where they sort of yell at them a bit. However, the Liberals refused to respect the order of this House, an order that reigns supreme in this country, an order from the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599234">We have been here before. We already knew that Liberals disrespect laws and all kinds of ethics norms for how ministers and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should behave. He broke the law. That is just one more example of how the Liberals disrespect Parliament. We saw it when they tried to use the COVID crisis as an excuse to give themselves unprecedented spending powers, probably to funnel more money into Liberal pockets. We are still unravelling some of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599235">That is exactly what happened just months later. The Liberals got caught red-handed in the WE Charity scandal, and rather than face Parliament, they decided to prorogue Parliament in a clear effort to avoid accountability. Some say that maybe there is an expectation they will do that again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599236">Then there was the Winnipeg lab case, where again and again they were held in contempt of Parliament for refusing to produce documents and stonewalling the investigations of this House. That is just another case of incompetence and corruption, and exactly what we are going to keep talking about on behalf of all Canadians who want accountability and answers from them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599237">It is clear that there is only one avenue left. The government clearly does not care about the Ethics Commissioner or the Auditor General because it disregards them so often. There used to be something called ministerial accountability in this place. When ministers are involved in scandals, they get promotions, kept in cabinet or shuffled to a different role where maybe they are out of the spotlight for a bit, but nobody ever faces consequences. It is obvious that this extends to the Liberals' disrespect for Parliament too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599238">It is time to call in the big guns, the RCMP. The Liberals should turn over the documents to the RCMP. If this happened in any business, the business would not have to go to some committee. It would turn everything it had over to the cops, especially if it was telling Canadians that it had nothing to hide and if it was boasting, like the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>, who boasts every day in this House that he has had four investigations on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599239">However, the Liberals are refusing to provide documents, and their arguments change as the days go on. First it was some weird argument about a charter violation, which is questionable because some ministries turned over documents. It is only charter violations if the government does not want us to see documents that have something really bad in them. I am going to say this very slowly so that people at home understand it: The charter is there to protect people from the government; it is not there to protect the Liberals from giving almost $400 million to their friends.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599240">Their story changed again. I think that the latest refrain is that Parliament does not have to demand the documents because the cops do not want all the documents. If we have nothing to hide, then turn over the documents. I am sure there is something to hide, because otherwise we would not be in the seventh day of speaking at length to this very motion about an obstruction and a defiance of a Speaker's ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599241">The Liberals should be able to turn the documents over to the police so Canadians can get the accountability they deserve and so we can get this place back to work for all the people who cannot afford to eat, for the two million people who use a food bank across the country over the course of a month, and for those who cannot afford a home because the price of a home has doubled over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599242">The price of rent has doubled. The price of a mortgage payment has more than doubled, with inflation and interest rates rampant and out of control over the last number of years, putting Canadians further and further behind. There is crime, chaos, drugs and disorder in our streets. What is happening in this country, with the burning of a Canadian flag in one of our largest cities, in front of an art gallery, where people shout in the streets now, “death to Canada”?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599243">Those are the things, the work, Parliament should be getting back to. Some ministers do not have the courage to get up and condemn them, and there is an awful lot of silence from everybody in the backbenches on issues like that. Instead they get up and make argument after argument. Some make less sense than the last ones they put forward, and their story changes every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599244"> Conservatives will be here for as long as it takes for Canadians to get the accountability, for the Liberals to turn over the documents to the police so they know who got rich and which Liberal insiders with Liberal memberships got rich with $400 million of tax money. That is what we are here to do. I assure Canadians that when they get the answers to those questions, they are not going to like them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599245">The Auditor General has only so much power. It is Parliament that is supreme and can order the documents, because we, the people here in the chamber seats, are elected by the people who want accountability from the government. If the government believed in the institutions that it purports to protect, it would trust the RCMP to redact whatever it needed to redact to keep the privacy of those who made no trouble at all, and to make sure that those who need to be accountable to the people actually face justice for potential criminality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599246">That is why we are here today. That is why we are going to continue to be here on behalf of Canadians: to get accountability. The Liberals should turn over the documents to the police so we can get back to work.</ParaText>

The reason we are actually here right now is that we did provide information to the committee. Yes, it was redacted, just like Stephen Harper redacted information on numerous occasions. The Conservatives say that this is not good enough and that they want the information, but not for members of Parliament. They want to get the information and give it directly to the RCMP. The Auditor General and the RCMP have disagreed with the tactic that the Conservative Party is raising today.</ParaText>

Why was it appropriate for Ms. Verschuren to resign but inappropriate for the minister to do the same?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599270">The previous speaker, my colleague, referenced ministerial accountability. Where is it? This brings back some memories of the sponsorship scandal. Members may recall that the year was 1996 when the Liberals founded the sponsorship program to promote federalism in Quebec. Two Auditor General reports found that the Liberals, under Jean Chrétien, had overseen the spending of $250 million through the sponsorship program between 1997 and 2001. Of those funds, $100 million was redirected to the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party. The scandal led Canadians to vote out the Liberals for the next decade, in favour of Conservatives, who could be trusted with the public purse strings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599271">Now history is repeating itself. As the early twentieth-century writer and philosopher George Santayana wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” It seems that the government has forgotten the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599272">Let us fast-forward to today. Here we are once again. Apparently the Liberals feel that they are “entitled to [their] entitlements”, a phrase infamously coined by former cabinet minister David Dingwall. The scandals are numerous and mounting. What I am incredulous about is that, over the past nine years, there has been no accountability from the top. Again, I reference ministerial, or even higher, accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599273"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has thrown those who did not succumb to his will under the bus. Let us think of the Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould and the Hon. Dr. Jane Philpott. However, he himself has not taken any responsibility for what is arguably the most scandal-plagued and corrupt government in recent Canadian political history. I have a laundry list of Liberal scandals to validate my point. I only have 20 minutes, but I am going to take a crack at touching upon just a few of the conflicts of interest and corruption cases here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599274">Again, I am going to ask this: Where is the accountability? In 2020, a firm in the riding of the then<Affiliation DbId="253382" Type="4"> minister of public services and procurement</Affiliation> was paid $150 million for COVID-19 vaccines that were never delivered. Medicago was that firm, and it received $173 million in research money, for a total of $323 million in federal aid. Medicago was to build a vaccine factory, but that never transpired. Once again, the Liberals shut down any investigation into why taxpayers paid such an amount and received nothing in return. Unfortunately, this is an all-too-common pattern for the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599275">Bill Morneau is another former minister who was scandal-prone. He began his political career by violating the Elections Act, for which he was fined. He participated in a series of “department-supported events” in his official capacity as finance minister during the pre-election period for the 2019 election. This “caused the expenses related to those events to benefit the [Liberal Party of Canada]”. This is the same minister who forgot to declare that he had a villa in France. I am to address all questions through the Speaker, so Mr. Speaker, have you ever forgotten a house?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599276">Mr. Morneau also sponsored Bill <Document DbId="8502232" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which just happened to increase the value of pensions sold by the minister's company Morneau Shepell. When the bill was tabled in the House of Commons, the value of Morneau Shepell shares jumped. Coincidentally, the Minister Morneau held 21 million dollars' worth of those shares. Conflict of interest, anyone? Again, I reiterate, where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599277"> CBC reported that when former minister David Lametti left cabinet, many people were wondering why. We have since learned that the former attorney general cancelled a verdict of first-degree murder against Jacques Delisle, a former judge, even though all legal experts were against this decision. Mr. Lametti and the government refused to answer why he had done that, even though Delisle later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599278"> I am not done yet. In fact, I am just getting started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599279">The disregard and breaches of ethics kept on coming. In December 2022, the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development</Affiliation> of Canada was found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner of giving contracts to her best friend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599280"> Who can forget, of course, the case of the other Randy? Last July, the ethics committee uncovered text messages showing that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages</Affiliation> continued to direct his company while he was minister. In another sheer coincidence, his company received nearly $120 million in government grants and contracts. Again, conflict of interest, anyone? Where is the accountability? The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> testified that the Randy referenced in these texts was not him, but another Randy who just happened to work at the company that he had a 50% ownership stake in. At the following committee hearing, his business partner testified that, really, only one Randy ever worked at this company and that was the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599281"> Friends and family of Liberal cabinet ministers have also inappropriately benefited from their ethical lapses. The <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> failed to report, as required under the Conflict of Interest Act, that her husband John Knowlton, a director at LifeLabs, was among several businesses awarded COVID-testing contracts, as confirmed by the health minister. Blacklock's reported that LifeLabs received COVID-testing contracts worth $66,307,424 on June 23 and a separate $1.9-million contract on August 20 when the transport minister was the minister of public works. It is another case of “nothing to see here, folks”. Conflict of interest, anyone? Where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599282">Who can forget Scott Brison when he was President of the Treasury Board? He was trying to block the approval for a navy supply ship that was being built at Davie shipyard in favour of the powerful Irving shipyard. He used to chair one of the investment firms as his spouse sat on the board of directors. He then worked with the government to have Vice-Admiral Norman charged with a breach of trust before Vice-Admiral Norman was exonerated of all charges in 2019. Is there no limit to the lengths to which government members will go to to enrich the lives of themselves and of their friends?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599283"> I would be negligent if I failed to mention Navdeep Bains, whose name has come up in earlier interventions. He is another former Liberal cabinet minister. As minister of innovation, science and industry, he pledged that the government would demand that the big three, Bell Canada, Rogers Communications Canada and Telus Communications, would lower their prices by 25% in the next two years for cellphone plans that offer between two and six gigabytes of data. In April 2023, former minister Bains was appointed by Rogers to its executive leadership team. The hiring of Mr. Bains does raise concerns, especially in the light of the government's approval of the Rogers-Shaw merger. Did anyone on the government side of the House dare to question the blatant conflict of interest here? Where is the accountability?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599284">Of course, no Liberal scandal chronicle would be complete without mentioning the SNC-Lavalin affair and the WE Charity scandal. I have previously mentioned how former ministers Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were victims of the government's corrupt behaviour. SNC-Lavalin was more than just breaching ethics rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599285">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a travesty of the separation of the power between his office and that of the Attorney General's office. The PM ignored the independence of the Attorney General to help his friends at SNC avoid criminal prosecution. In doing so, he orchestrated a campaign to pressure the Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to overrule the independent public prosecution. No one should be above the law, not even the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599286"> Another infamous scandal was, of course, the WE Charity. This time, it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family who benefited greatly. Margaret Trudeau was paid approximately $250,000 for speaking at 28 events, while the Prime Minister's brother Alexandre spoke at eight events and received about $32,000. In testimony before MPs on July 28, Marc Kielburger said Sophie Grégoire Trudeau was reimbursed more than $200,000 in expenses for appearances at WE Charity events, and the WE Charity covered $41,000 in costs for Bill Morneau and his family in 2017 for trips to Ecuador and Kenya to review the organization's humanitarian work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599287">I would be remiss if I did not touch upon the notorious arrive scam and GC Strategies, the Liberal-friendly company that charged at least $60 million for the app, which was to have cost $80,000. To add insult to injury, 76% of the contractors did zero work on the app. Once again, the Canadian taxpayer footed the bill with zero accountability on behalf of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599288">I am still not done. Unbelievably, there are more illicit Liberal practices to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599289"> Let us talk about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Christmas vacation at the Aga Khan's island and the subsequent $50 million in federal funding the Aga Khan Foundation has received since 2016 from the government. The vacation lasted until January 4, 2017, eight days in total. It was later disclosed that the government expenditures for the trip had amounted to $215,000. The Prime Minister then adopted the position that he and the Aga Khan were close friends, and the trip was of a more personal nature, even though they had not seen each other in 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599290">It is more of the “entitled to my entitlements” philosophy, I guess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599291">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a penchant for luxurious vacations. Most Canadians would agree he is justified in taking a vacation; I certainly do. However, I do not believe they would agree he should satisfy his champagne tastes on the taxpayers' dime. Although it took some persistent digging through access to information, the PMO finally admitted it was the Prime Minister and his wife who stayed in a $6,000-per-night hotel suite while attending the funeral for our sovereign Queen Elizabeth II.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599292"> The stay at the Corinthia London hotel became just another shameful display of a lack of respect for average Canadians by billing them an astounding $400,000. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office were not forthcoming with these details. Witness what we are doing here today and for the past week. Again, it is an abhorrent lack of accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599293"> I would be remiss if I did not mention the disastrous trip to India by Canada's first family. As The Economic Times reported at the time, “Trudeau’s time in India was criticised for its lack of official business, not to mention—”</ParaText>

The fiasco included having his own celebrity chef flown in from Vancouver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599299">However, all of this pales in comparison to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> inviting convicted terrorist Jaspal Atwal to dinner. Mr. Atwal was convicted of attempted murder in Canada in 1987 after he tried to assassinate a visiting Punjabi cabinet minister.

              <ParaText id="8599300">There has not been accountability for the India fiasco, and Canada was left red-faced with embarrassment and $1.66 million in debt. There are simply too many Liberal breaches of ethics violations to name them all here today. I have not touched upon the Julie Payette fiasco, nor the <Affiliation DbId="300003" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>'s interference in the Nova Scotia shooting tragedy. Members will recall that he pressured the then-police commissioner Brenda Lucki to publicly release information about specific firearms used in the shooting to advance the federal government's gun control legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599301">Following the resignation of the former ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, who I believe resigned due to overwork, the Liberal government decided to appoint Martine Richard, the sister-in-law of the current <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, to replace him. Again, is that not a conflict of interest to anyone? Where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599302">This is why common-sense Conservatives have raised this question of privilege. This is why we are here today, why we were here yesterday and the day before, and why we will be here tomorrow and in the coming weeks, if necessary.

              <ParaText id="8599324"> Mr. Speaker, I think that the good Canadian citizens watching the debate at home, or here in the gallery, would be forgiven if they thought, listening to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278434" Type="2">Chatham-Kent—Leamington</Affiliation>'s speech, that the motion were somehow about getting the documents. The motion is a very good one. It has nothing to do with getting the documents; it has to do with referring to committee the matter of the Liberals' refusal to give the documents. At committee, I assume we could get some answers for Canadians about the scandal. That seems like important work to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599325">It reminds me of a quote from <I>Jerry Maguire</I>: “You had me at ‘hello’.” We want to vote on the Conservatives' motion to send the matter off to committee, hold some hearings and get the answers. Why do they seem so insistent on not taking “yes” for an answer? How many times are we going to have to stand here and say, “You had us at ‘hello’. Let us go to committee. Show me the money.” That is right: Show me the committee and let us get the answers for Canadians as soon as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599332"> Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we are here today discussing this privilege motion, which has effectively paralyzed Parliament because the Liberals refuse to give up unredacted documents because they are afraid of what those say. Frankly, they are fully aware of what they say. If they were not concerned about the contents of the documents, they would have allowed us to resume the work of the House many days ago and would have kept a consistent story. It has been quite interesting, actually, how many different stories we have heard from the government on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599333">I had a really cool conversation this summer with someone, and they explained to me that they were a business owner with a couple of different businesses. There were some complications, and they had a family member who got sick. After their family member got sick, they decided that they were going to hire an employee to handle a bunch of the books. They hired someone they already had on staff whom they thought they could trust because they were a family friend. However, over the course of more than a year of employment, this family friend, who was an employee, siphoned off cash from the business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599334">This was not a small amount of cash; it was actually quite a large amount of money. They were trying to figure out why their GST numbers were not balancing at the end of the year, so they had an accountant look into it further. As they started to dig through it, they realized that the employee had siphoned off a large amount of money and were faced with a dilemma. This was a family friend and an employee who had been with them for a while, but this was a large amount of money they needed to recover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599335">They decided they had one of two options, so they went to this employee with the two options: either the employee paid back this money or the employee could deal with the RCMP and they would go to small claims court. They said that if the employee paid them back, they would just pretend it was all good. The employee would no longer work for them regardless, but those were the options. I remember hearing this story and thinking at the time that it was really heartbreaking because their child was sick and they admitted they lost a bit of oversight over their business because they were focused on other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599336">It is clear that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, as he has even said, did not sufficiently monitor the contracts. Well, that is his job. The minister's job is to make sure that the government's money is being spent properly. He does not have the excuse of a sick kid taking over his contracts or his ability to do his job. He is in this job. This was his responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599337">The NDP-Liberal government continues to put up different arguments about how we are violating charter rights, saying that somehow the right to misappropriate government money while Liberal insiders get rich is worth more than the constitutional rights conferred on Parliament to have these documents. We have seen this multiple times after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government. The list of scandals, as many of my colleagues have listed off, is large. There are so many scandals at this point that it is hard to keep them straight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599338">I will get into a space that I think is really important. It does not matter what happened. The Liberals know that people got rich and got money through conflicts of interest that they should not have had, and they refuse to provide documents to the RCMP. They are the employers, and this is perhaps the ideological difference between Conservatives and Liberals. We believe that every single person who works for the Government of Canada or a subsidiary of the Government of Canada is an employee of the Canadian people. As the representatives of the Canadian people, when Parliament votes and decides that we must have documents to send to the RCMP, the Government of Canada is acting on behalf of its employers, who are the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599339"> It appears that the Liberals believe that the employer is the Liberal Party of Canada, and that unless the Liberal Party of Canada says that it is okay, they are going to continue to block these documents from being released. However, they did release some of them, which is the interesting part of this. The production order had a whole list of documents, and the Liberals complied with a part of it, but it was heavily redacted. They effectively took a big, black permanent marker and crossed out large sections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599340">As every single different argument has been put forward by the government, I am assuming that I have some understanding as to possibly what is right and what is wrong, but the reality is that they are hiding. Like any parent will say, the most nervous a parent gets is when their child goes quiet and hides, because they know that there is possibly going to be a good answer, but 99% of the time it is going to be something really bad, or something that is going to require a lot of cleanup. What this government is doing by blocking and refusing to comply with this order shows that it is afraid of what those results are. The Liberals are the only ones who know what those unredacted documents look like. If they thought they were okay and that there was no problem, they would just turn them over to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599341">We are not saying, “Give me, the member of Parliament for Fort McMurray—Cold Lake, these documents that have potentially personnel information and private information.” We are not saying to hand it over to every single parliamentarian. We are asking to have them unredacted and sent to the RCMP so that if there is a problem, the RCMP has all of the available information, can look into it and potentially go after that. That is the crux of this issue. The fact is that the Liberals continue to fight. I ask: Why is this a problem? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599342">The Auditor General found that this government has turned this into a complete and total slush fund. There was $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of any green technology. So, that is $58 million to completely ineligible projects that were connected to Liberals. Then there was another $334 million, over 186 cases, to projects for which board members held a conflict of interest. So, $334 million and 186 cases where groups that had conflicts of interest got money. There was $58 million to projects that did not ensure that contribution agreements and terms were met. This is not just incompetence; this is negligence. It is approaching fraud, if it is not already at fraud. This is very troubling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599343"> We have Canadians right now who are lining up at food banks, who are having a hard time putting groceries in their shopping carts and putting food on the table to feed their families. We have families who never thought they would need a food bank lining up at food banks and having to eat that piece of humble pie so that their children get meals. We have people who are skipping meals in Canada because of out-of-control inflation, out-of-control interest rates, and because, after nine years of this Liberal-NDP government, everything has become broken. Their out-of-control spending has led to ever-increasing inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599344">I often think about inflation, because my dad used to talk about how things were so inexpensive when he was little. Basically, during my entire childhood, a chocolate bar was the same price from when I was like four years old, when I remember going to the grocery or convenience store and getting a chocolate bar, to when I was an adult at 16 years old and working in a convenience store for the first time. So, when my dad used to say, “This used to cost 25¢ when I was a kid”, it made me think that he was really old, only to realize that he lived through wild inflationary times and out-of-control interest rates that impacted the cost of living for his generation, which made it really difficult for people in his generation to initially buy a house.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8599345"> In fact, when my dad bought his first house, he told me, interest rates were 18%, and that was because of the fiscal policies of Pierre Trudeau. My dad was lucky to have a good job in Fort McMurray and managed to save money while renting a house until he could pay cash for a house, which is something no one can even imagine as feasible today because the cost of living is so high. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599346">Most young people today do not even see themselves being able to save up enough money for a down payment on a house, and that is because of the absolute train wreck of fiscal policies of the Liberal-NDP government. Time and time again, the government continues to fail Canadians. Its job is to look out for Canadians' best interests, and yet here we have yet another example of extreme incompetence, or worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599347">We have a <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who did not sufficiently monitor contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. I really question whether the Liberals are being serious about what their job is. We have been very clear on this side. Every single Conservative speech has asked that they release the documents to the RCMP so we can go back to our next piece of business here. The fact that they continue to block any possibility of this moving forward is part of the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599348">So many whistle-blowers came forward. It was not that the government found this out through government audits. This was found because of a whole bunch of whistle-blowers and the diligent work of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> going through the books. The part that really is frustrating to a lot of Canadians is that $334 million and 186 different conflict of interest cases should be enough to stop everything. However, with the Liberals, it is just enough for them to keep going and pat themselves on the back for all of their successes, that if they just taxed people a little more, it would stop forest fires, and if they just did a little more, somehow everything would get better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599349">Canadians know the way to make life better is to have a carbon tax election and elect a common-sense Conservative government that can get our economy back on track. After nine years, Canadians have had more than enough of the NDP-Liberal government spending their children's and grandchildren's futures into absolute poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599350">I am very proud to be here today as a member of His Majesty's loyal opposition, a position that means holding the government to account. Conservatives are not oppositional for the sake of opposition. We are charged, through our parliamentary system, with holding the government accountable for its actions. Right now, it is not showing any accountability or transparency, nor is it showing Canadians the work they deserve. I and many of my colleagues will continue the charge to hold the government accountable on this failed policy and these failed spaces. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599353">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure, as always, to rise in this place, and tonight I am here to talk about an unsatisfactory response to a question. That is what we do at the late show.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599354">It was on May 10. Actually, I will back it up. On April 1, the government raised rents for Canadian Armed Forces personnel who live on base. It raised the rents on base housing. This was at a time of an affordability crisis for all Canadians, a housing crisis that exists all across Canada, and a crisis of morale, recruitment and retention within the Canadian Armed Forces, which has left the Canadian Armed Forces with 16,000 vacancies. Because of this, the defence committee actually moved a motion unanimously and reported back to the House asking the government to reverse the rent increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599355">The motion was to not proceed with the rent increase, but it was on May 10 that I asked the government if they would, given the unanimous report from the defence committee, along with the general crisis of recruitment, retention and morale in the Canadian Armed Forces, and the crisis of housing across Canada that affects all Canadians, reverse the rent increase that the government placed on our Canadian Armed Forces personnel on base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599356">The response that I got from the government during that afternoon question period was a non-answer. The <Affiliation DbId="311641" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> did not answer the question at all. She went on kind of an arrogant rant about not taking lessons from the other side on the Canadian Armed Forces, so she did not answer the question. She just deflected and ignored it, but it is worth returning to the point that the defence committee itself, of which that parliamentary secretary is a member, unanimously voted to call on the government to not increase the rent on the forces personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599357">However, the parliamentary secretary can actually be heard at the meeting instructing her own side to just vote for the motion, saying that it was not binding as it just gets reported to the House and that it did not really mean anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599358">This is the level of doublespeak that we see from members of the Liberal caucus. They will literally vote at a committee to urge their government to take a particular course of action, but just shrug their shoulders and know that it is not binding and that the government will not do it. It does not hurt them to unanimously vote. They would not have the courage to oppose the motion if they actually agreed that it was only fair to raise the rent on our troop. Instead, they went ahead with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599359">There is a cost-of-living crisis in this country, and it affects the members of the Canadian Armed Forces. We are down 16,000 personnel. There are 10,000 more who are undertrained. These are the best of the best. I have met our troops. I have seen them deployed, and they just want to serve. They are the best, and they are let down by the government constantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599360">This base rent increase might seem like a trivial matter. It might seem small, but it is not, and the government could signal to the forces members that they support them by not increasing their rent.</ParaText>

This funding will help support our plan to construct approximately 650 new units over the next five years on bases with the greatest housing demands, such as Borden, Esquimalt and Gagetown. However, we know that more needs to be done. That is why, through Canada's updated defence policy, “Our North, Strong and Free”, we are committing an additional $295 million over the next 20 years to the military housing portfolio. This funding gives us the resources to continue building and upgrading existing housing. It would also help us establish a Canadian Armed Forces housing strategy to guide our housing efforts in both the short term and the long term in order to help CAF members and their families. </ParaText>

These investments will enable the Government of Canada to provide Canadian Armed Forces members and their families with affordable, safe, and comfortable housing now and in the years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599367">The Government of Canada has also put a number of safeguards in place to ensure that members of the Canadian Armed Forces pay fair and equitable rents across Canada, whether they live on or off base. For example, the Canadian Forces housing agency reviews and adjusts housing costs annually to reflect changes in the local rental market.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599368">The Canadian Armed Forces housing strategy has also placed a 25% cap, based on gross household income, for CAF members currently living in military housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599369">To become more responsive to the needs of CAF members, last July, our government replaced the post living differential, the PLD, with the new Canadian Forces housing differential, the CFHD.</ParaText>

She did not answer the question then. I have repeated and revisited the question. She spoke for four minutes without answering it. Therefore, we will just take it as no: The government is not interested in reversing the rent increase it placed on the CAF. Fine, that is its choice. It comes amid a recruitment and retention crisis, in which we have repeatedly heard at committee that the horrific condition of base housing is a factor in people leaving the forces. She spoke in her remarks about the commitment to build 600 units over five years. There are 7,000 people on a waiting list right now for housing. That answer is not going to cut it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599374"> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise on behalf of the overtaxed people of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. Like the overtaxed Canadians across the country, residents of the Ottawa Valley want a carbon tax election now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599375">The socialist-separatist coalition has made its position plain for all to see: There will be no relief for Canadians until the Marxist members secure their pensions. The need for an election and an end to the wacko government has never been greater. The government has lost touch with real Canadians. Just look at how the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responded to my question last June about scrapping the carbon tax. Instead of defending the carbon tax, the minister tried to “change the channel” by bragging about the Liberals' higher capital gains tax. Canadians are angry about higher taxes and the Liberals' bold new policy is to increase taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599376">The Liberals have adopted the motto “Beatings will continue until morale improves.” The taxes will go higher until their polls improve. The government has lost touch with reality. Its members have trapped themselves inside a simulation. That is not a reference to <I>The Matrix</I> or a metaphor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599377">Statistics Canada built a tax simulator; anyone can download it for free. It is widely used by academics, banks, businesses, parliamentary budget officers and even the finance department. It simulates the impact of tax changes. The Liberals put their carbon tax in the simulator and it spit out the number 80/20. The simulator said that 20% of Canadians would pay more in carbon taxes than they receive in climate bribes. The simulator said those 20% were mostly the top 20% of income earners. Any time a simulator spits out a ratio like 80/20, it should set off alarm bells. 80/20 has its own Wikipedia page for a reason. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599378">These technocratic-loving Liberals forget that sometimes a statistic can be both accurate and true while being completely fictional and entirely false. There is a good chance the <Affiliation DbId="311641" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> who was selected to respond shortly was handed a speech that includes a phrase like, “The average household gets back more than it pays.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599379">In Canada, the size of the average household is 2.51 people. I do not need to conduct a door-to-door census to tell members there is not a single household with that number of people in it. The Liberals will tell us the average household is doing great under the carbon tax, that the average household gets back more than they pay. The problem is that the average household of 2.51 people does not exist. It is a statistical fiction, just like the government's mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599380">More Canadians voted for Conservatives in the last two elections than voted for the Liberals, yet these Liberals have arrogantly behaved as if they won a majority. They kept increasing the carbon tax. They have increased taxes on property and capital. They tax our work. They tax our energy. If we try to catch a break to relax, they increased the taxes on alcohol, tobacco and cannabis too. We cannot even watch a movie without paying their Netflix tax now. Just to rub the salt into the wound a little harder, on top of the Liberal carbon tax, the video streaming tax, the beer tax and the new digital services tax is the GST, because nothing says Liberal like charging a tax on a tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599381">If there was ever any doubt the Liberals are out of touch, I expect this <Affiliation DbId="311641" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> to put those doubts to rest. They will either invoke the simulation to claim the fictional average household is doing great, or they will resort to climate alarmism and try to convince Canadians higher taxes will fix the bad weather. Maybe they might even do both, but that proves they do not listen to Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599383">Mr. Speaker, I have to say that the member gets a gold star, because she actually mentioned something so important: The average household gets back more than it pays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599384">The Conservatives seem to be obsessed with the idea of a secret cover-up, but there is none. We have always fully cooperated with the Parliamentary Budget Officer and will always do so. Our government has been clear: The vast majority of Canadians receive more money back in their pockets with the Canada carbon rebate. The member just said it. I am so happy that she knows this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599385">We are responding to the growing climate emergency the world is now facing, and Canadians are seeing it as well. From wildfires to increasingly frequent heat waves, floods, droughts and hurricanes, Canadians are becoming increasingly aware that we need to take climate action now. Carbon pricing is an essential start-up to curb emissions, because it cannot be free to pollute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599386">The Parliamentary Budget Officer's analysis of Canada's carbon pollution pricing system confirmed that the majority of households receive more in Canada carbon rebate payments than they face in direct costs due to pricing. Low- and medium-income households benefit the most. This is so important: Anyone who lives in a rural area or a smaller community receives a 20% top-up to their Canada carbon rebate, reflecting the fact that they may face higher costs and have fewer short-term options to reduce their emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599387"> Do not take our word for it. The Governor of the Bank of Canada has explained that carbon pricing contributes no more than 0.15% of inflation per year, a tiny fraction of the high inflation we have seen. Economists estimate that carbon pricing contributes, at most, just 0.33% of grocery price increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599388">Putting a price on carbon pollution is a proven method of reducing carbon emissions, and it continues to be the simplest, most effective way to fight climate change. That is exactly what we are doing. Unlike the Conservative Party, we are focused on proven, evidence-based solutions to the most pressing issue facing Canadians. The federal government released Canada's 2024 national inventory report, which shows that Canada is on track to meet our emission-reducing goals for 2026, and also on track for 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599389">Carbon pricing works, and it has been shown to be the most cost-effective way of fighting climate change. The opposition clearly is not interested in what we have to say, but would they listen to Premier Moe? In May 2023, Premier Moe said that Saskatchewan actually considered alternatives to the federal carbon pricing but found that they were all too costly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599390">Our government is committed to taking action on climate change, and that is exactly what we will continue to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599394">Mr. Speaker, here I am again at the end of the night, the last person here, fighting again for coastal people. Well, it is me, you and the parliamentary secretary, but I would rather be doing other work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599395">For three years, the Liberal government has allowed a company in Union Bay to break apart not a boat but a massive ship that is extended into the water, over the high tide line, and onto land. This would not be allowed anywhere in the world. Even countries that have extremely poor environmental regulations, like Bangladesh, would not allow this type of activity. It is unbelievable that this company is breaking apart a boat that has contaminants in it without a self-contained floating dry dock. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599396">Something we can do in Canada is break apart ships in a responsible way, and there are companies doing that. I am going to talk a bit about those companies, but they are doing it in the right way because they are following the rules. When a company breaks the rules, we would think the federal government would enforce the regulations we have in place or, if we did not have regulations, would create them, but not in this case. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599397">This company in Union Bay is in operation despite the objections of the Province of British Columbia, which has issued two abatement orders, and local communities. The Comox Valley Regional District has an injunction against the company to stop its harmful activity. They are waiting for a court date. The Tla'amin, the Qualicum people and the Comox people have all voiced their opposition to what is taking place. As I said, nowhere in the world would anyone allow this type of activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599398"> When I brought this question to the House in June, the provincial government at the time had issued an abatement order because the company was discharging effluent at 15 times the limit for copper. When I raised this question earlier in the week, it was because the province issued a second abatement order. This time it was 100 times the limit for copper and 13 times the limit for zinc. The Liberals say the federal government's baseline is not as low as the province's, but is it 100 times lower than the province's when it comes to copper and 13 times lower for zinc? Is that what we are dealing with? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599399">This is absolutely absurd. What is it going to take for the federal government to finally step in? I have asked the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> about this, and her reply is that she is dealing with it; it is an abandoned and derelict vessel and she is getting good at that. She cites the ocean protection plan. This is not an abandoned and derelict vessel. This is a massive ship being deconstructed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599400">I want to highlight a couple of things. There is a lot I have to say on this and I will keep coming back if I have to. There was some lobbying done by Seaspan. We would think a reputable company would be concerned about all levels of government being concerned about this operation. We found out through an FOI request that it lobbied the province, and the owners of this company, as far as I know from the research we have done, are foreign owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599401">We know the Liberals and the Conservatives are corporate-controlled parties, but the depth of this is deeply concerning. Is this what is going on? Is Seaspan putting pressure on the federal government so that it does not take action? Is that what is happening? Coastal people deserve to know. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8599403">The Government of Canada recognizes that safe recycling processes are vital to ensuring the careful and secure handling of environmentally hazardous substances such as asbestos, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and ozone-depleting substances. Canada aims to ensure that ships are recycled safely at the end of their operational lives without causing unnecessary risk to human health and the environment. Ship recycling in Canada is recognized as the most environmentally sound method to dispose of ships that have reached their end of life. Many provisions affecting ship-recycling facilities are governed by the provinces and territories, such as environmental and waste management and workplace occupational health and safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599404">Overall, Canada has some of the strongest laws and regulations across federal, provincial, territorial and municipal jurisdictions, and we remain committed to working with all levels of government to make sure Canada's ship-recycling facilities remain among the safest in the world. The Canadian Coast Guard has received numerous inquiries about vessels that are intended for deconstruction at the Deep Water Recovery recycling site in Union Bay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599405">The Coast Guard has undertaken several assessments of the area where the vessels are awaiting deconstruction at Deep Water Recovery. If pollution enters the marine environment from a land-based spill, the Coast Guard will report the pollution to the emergency management ministry in British Columbia and provide assistance as required. The Coast Guard has reminded the deconstruction company of its responsibility under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, to prevent any release of oil or other pollutants from reaching the marine environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599406">The Government of Canada is taking actions to reduce the number of vessels of concern in Canadian waters and minimize their impact on coastal communities, the environment and the public. Under the oceans protection plan, as of January 2024, the Government of Canada has removed 584 wrecked, abandoned or hazardous vessels across Canada. The Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act was adopted in 2018 and came into force in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8599407">The objectives of the act are to strengthen owner accountability and to enable more proactive government action to address the risks posed by problem vessels. Under the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act, an owner is prohibited from allowing their vessel to become a wreck due to failing to maintain it. Under Canadian law, vessel owners are responsible for their vessels at all times. They must take all actions necessary, including repair, salvage and prevention or cleanup of leaking fuel and oil. Vessel owners must contact the Coast Guard if their vessel is sinking, has sunk or is a threat to discharge marine pollution.</ParaText>
