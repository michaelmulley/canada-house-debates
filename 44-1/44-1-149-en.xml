            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7546293">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to be the first member of the House to rise and speak in 2023. I would like to wish all my colleagues from all parties a happy new year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546294">We hope that we all have a prosperous year, working together productively and introducing bills that will make a difference. We hope to see strong, decisive action, especially when it comes to language, but also in the fight against climate change. That is very important to me. We also want decisive action for our seniors, meaningful action for housing, and action that will really improve people's lives. I think we also want to hear the expression “triple, triple, triple” less often in the House. I think everyone would like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546295">I am very pleased to speak to Motion No. 62. I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, with whom I was lucky to work at the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. He is doing remarkable work. I think this motion is very important. There are all kinds of humanitarian and human rights crises going on in the world right now. I became aware of that, and it is something that matters very much to my colleague as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546296">I think it is especially important to talk about the motion before us this morning, which is about what is happening to the Uighurs. I would note that here in Ottawa today, on Parliament Hill, we have Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress; Omer Kanat, executive vice-president of the World Uyghur Congress; Mehmet Tohti, executive director of the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project; and many members of the Uighur diaspora. I thank them for being here on Parliament Hill, and I hope their presence here will help put some pressure on this government. I really think that is what we need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546297">First, I would warn my colleagues who are sensitive and have a tender heart. I am about to tell members a really horrific story, one that will make our hearts pound, give us the chills and absolutely stun us. My colleagues should do what I did before becoming a politician. They should put themselves in the other person's shoes. They should try to see things from the perspective of the person I am going to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546298">This is the story of a Uighur woman who immigrated to Canada several years ago. Her father became very sick and this woman decided to return to her country. When she arrived in her home city, she was welcomed at the airport by her sisters. Her heart filled with joy as she was so happy to see them. It was a meaningful moment. However, a sense of unease came over her. She did not know why, but she sensed that she was not welcome. In the taxi, they asked her to remain silent and not to talk. She thought that things would be all right when she arrived at her home, but her sister asked everyone to turn off their cell phones. She whispered to her that something had been installed on their roof the previous evening and that she had to be careful about what she said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546299">One night, at a restaurant, she noticed three men seated at the table next to her. She realized they were government agents. She was scared and did not finish her meal. These men watched her suspiciously. She slipped out into the market, which used to be quite vibrant, only to realize that no one was there. Her sister told her that most of the people had practically disappeared overnight, including her best friend. The situation was untenable and was jeopardizing her family. She had no choice but to leave. She left behind her dying father and her sisters, never to see them again. It was a heart-rending farewell. She returned to the comfort of her home in Quebec, while her family lives in fear in China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546300">This is a very real story. The actions of this government have been very tentative and weak. The government has reluctantly acknowledged that China's treatment of the Uighurs constitutes genocide. While an entire people is being persecuted and employed in so-called vocational training schools, surrounded by walls and barbed wire, watched by guards equipped with batons and shields, the government across the way seems just a tad hesitant.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546301">It is also important to remember that many women are being raped. Some women told the committee about the sexual and psychological abuse they have suffered. Children are being taken away from their families and placed in orphanages or state-run schools. Good people are being forced into factories as slaves, primarily outside the Xinjiang region, further contributing to the shrinking Muslim population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546302">This is the same government that decided to boycott the Olympic Games, but to no effect. That is what it decided to do rather than demand that the games be moved so that the event could not be used for Chinese propaganda. It was as though the human rights violations and attacks on human dignity that we are talking about were somewhat or partially acceptable. The government will not go all the way with sanctions, because it thinks it can negotiate with people's suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546303">This morning, it is very important to point out how ironic it is that Motion No. 62 states that the government determined that China's treatment of Uighurs is genocide, when, in reality, the executive, the council of ministers, cravenly abstained during the vote on the previous motion in February 2021. We sincerely hope that such will not be the case this time, that the government will take the bull by the horns, show some backbone and truly acknowledge that what is happening in China right now is a genocide against the Uighur people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546304">We are talking about a regime that spies on and tracks Uighurs even beyond its own borders. Cameras and facial recognition technologies are used to track down deserters. Just like in bad sci-fi movies, this government introduces new family members through sponsorship programs. For example, one day I could end up with a new brother named George who would live with me and who my children would call their uncle. He would have me sent to a prison camp, beat my children and rape my wife. Meanwhile, my colleagues would turn a blind eye and wonder whether boycotting an event would have any kind of political impact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546305">The government is talking about bringing 10,000 Uighurs to Canada, which is approximately 0.08%. Those are the lucky ones who will be able to enjoy our openness while hopefully avoiding the Chinese service stations set up in our country. They will avoid forced sterilizations and no longer be assimilated. That said, what about the 99.92% of Uighurs who will continue to be raped, assaulted and abused and who may end up with a new brother? Are we going to be complicit in the abuse that these people are going to suffer or will we finally take action to support and help these people, these humans?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546306">There is also talk of foreign interference, given that many of the bordering countries are participating in this genocide, some without the option of refusing. Canada is not immune to these pressures. While the House of Commons passed a motion in 2020 calling on the federal government to have a plan to counter foreign interference, nothing has been done so far. Even in Quebec, we now have Chinese police stations that are calling the shots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546307">Are we going to do like we did with Yemen? Are we going to keep pretending we are not to blame by consenting to play a political game and by denying our responsibility when we sell arms to Saudi Arabia that are then used to kill Yemenites? Even as we give, we participate in torture. Is that who we are? Can we look forward to this government tabling a refugee resettlement plan quickly so that this does not fall off the radar while people are left to suffer?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546308">These people are enduring slavery, torture, rape, sterilization, abuse, persecution, suffering and death. I admire these deeply resilient human beings who are risking their lives to fight for their freedom and who are not giving up on that dream.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7546309">Madam Speaker, today we are debating Motion No. 62, a motion that focuses on the human rights abuses and genocide being carried out against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims by the government of the People's Republic of China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546310">I would first like to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, for his important motion. All parliamentarians must stand firm in defence of fundamental human rights and condemn such gross violations, wherever they occur around the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546311">Canada has an obligation to uphold and defend human rights in the international community and support Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, who are facing horrific persecution. I want to send a clear message that New Democrats support the motion, and we stand in solidarity with them in their fight for human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546312">The Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development has studied the human rights situation of the Uighurs. The subcommittee heard witness testimony documenting the mounting evidence of human rights abuses, including mass arbitrary detention, separation of children from their parents, forced sterilization, forced labour, torture and other atrocities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546313">It was the subcommittee's conclusion that this organized and systematic persecution, which includes the largest mass detention of a minority since the Holocaust, constitutes a genocide, as per the genocide convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546314">Back in 2018, the subcommittee on international human rights stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546315">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">if the international community does not condemn the human rights abuses in Xinjiang province by the Government of China, a precedent will be set and these methods will be adopted by other regimes. Complacency is entrenched by a lack of access to Xinjiang; by the lack of free press; and through the silencing and harassment of Uyghurs living abroad.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546316">Sadly, since then, human rights abuses have only intensified, and the situation has become even more urgent, demanding greater action. New Democrats have pushed the Canadian Parliament to recognize the treatment of Uighurs as genocide and have called on the government to use every tool at its disposal to help end these abuses. On February 22, 2021, the House unanimously recognized the actions of the Chinese government against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims as genocide, despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of cabinet abstaining from the vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546317">Recognizing and fully condemning this genocide was a critical first step, but Canada can and must do more to take a stand against the horrific human rights abuses. Motion No. 62 recognizes that Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims who have fled to third countries face intimidation to return to China, where they face serious risks of detention and other atrocities. The motion also recognizes that many third countries face continued diplomatic and economic pressure from China to detain and deport Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, meaning that even in other countries, they are not safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546318">Importantly, in light of this grave situation, the motion calls on the Canadian government to urgently leverage IRCC’s refugee and humanitarian resettlement program to expedite the entry of 10,000 Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in need of protection. Urgent action is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546319">The NDP fully supports Motion No. 62. However, I will be introducing an amendment to ensure that Uighurs are admitted to Canada via a special immigration measure. New Democrats believe Canada should increase the total numbers of vulnerable people we welcome to our country, including those from East Turkestan, Ukraine, Afghanistan and other places where people are subject to the worst violations of their human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546320">This is consistent with the subcommittee’s recommendations, which call for the creation of “an exceptional refugee stream” to expedite entry for Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims. The creation of an emergency refugee program was also among the key recommendations advocated by the World Uyghur Congress. We should not be pitting communities against each other by robbing Peter to pay Paul.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546321">Further, while the NDP supports this important motion, there is much more work that needs to be done to put an end to the persecution of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546322">Human rights advocacy organizations have been tireless in their work calling for greater action and highlighting the need for the Government of Canada to take a stronger stance for human rights. Some of them are here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546323">Groups such as the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project have called on the government to implement the recommendations of the subcommittee report. One of these recommendations is that the Department of Justice develop a comprehensive human rights due diligence law that would compel businesses to respect the most current international human rights standards across their global operations and supply chains, and be held accountable for harms caused in relation to their operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546324">Alarmingly, global supply chains are tainted with forced labour. Consequently, advocates have called on the government to strengthen trade restrictions to prohibit the importation of goods manufactured in the Uighur region. Products sold in Canadian supermarkets and stores are being made by Uighur forced labour. This includes products such as bath towels, quilts and clothes, which are made with cotton from the Uighur region. Corporations such as Nestlé, Del Monte and Unilever have also purchased tomatoes from Chinese companies in the Uighur region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546325">China is one of only eight states that has not yet ratified the International Labour Organization's convention on ending forced labour. Between 2017 and 2019, it is estimated that more than 80,000 Uighurs were forcibly transferred out of the Uighur region to work in factories across China. In 2020 alone, reports revealed that 83 global companies were indirectly or directly involved in employing Uighur workers under forced labour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546326">A recently released report on the automotive sector has revealed the use of Uighur forced labour throughout the supply chains of major auto manufacturers. The report found that more than 100 international automotive parts or car manufacturers have some exposure to goods made with forced Uighur labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546327"> It is completely unacceptable that companies are allowed to profit off of persecution, that supply chains involve forced labour, and that the products we purchase are manufactured using forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546328">Advocates are also calling on Canada to push for an end to the arbitrary detention of Uighur human rights defenders in China. Canada should be working with civil society organizations to advocate for the release of those human rights defenders who have been imprisoned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546329">New Democrats have also called for sanctions to be imposed on government of China officials responsible for the perpetration of grave human rights abuses. This is also consistent with the recommendations of the subcommittee on international human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546330">The creation of a special immigration measure to expeditiously bring Uighurs and Turkic Muslims to safety is an essential part of Canada's role in defending human rights and taking a firm stand to denounce this ongoing genocide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546341">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 62 by my friend, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, regarding Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546342">I want to thank him for his leadership on this and many other issues of human rights around the world in his role as the chair of the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. The bipartisan support we have seen for this motion is a testament to his hard work across party lines, and I am pleased to add my voice and my vote in support of this important motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546343">What does this motion seek to do? It consists of four primary components.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546344">The first clause asks us to recognize that Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims who have fled to third countries face pressure and intimidation by the Chinese state to return to China. The evidence makes this an undeniable truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546345">In the second clause, we are asked to recognize that many of the third countries these refugees fleeing persecution and genocide are residing in are facing strong diplomatic and economic pressure from the Chinese government to deport these refugees. Again, there is ample evidence to support this undeniable truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546346">The heart of Motion No. 62 comes in the third clause, which calls for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, and the government, to undertake steps to expedite the entry into Canada of 10,000 Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in need of protection over two years starting in 2024. This is such an important measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546347">I have served on the immigration committee since I was first elected in 2015, and I know that we cannot solve the global immigration crisis through resettlement alone. We need a multi-faceted approach that includes humanitarian aid and diplomatic pressure to improve conditions on the ground. Many refugees want to stay near their country of origin, as they are hopeful conditions will improve to allow a safe return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546348">We need to support those refugee host countries that often lack the resources to care for large refugee populations, but the Uighur community is facing an ongoing genocide. I was proud to stand with the yes votes in 2021 when the House of Commons voted to recognize this sad fact. Canada has agreed to accept 10,000 Uighur refugees fleeing genocide who are most in need of protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546349">It is our responsibility as a free and prosperous nation. It is our duty as a democratic nation to tell the world we are a voice for human rights. It will signal to China and the world who Canada is and where we stand. Hopefully, it will also encourage like-minded countries to step up to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546350"> Canada has always done our share in times of crisis. In the late 1960s, we welcomed 1,100 Czech refugees fleeing from the Soviet invasion. In the 1970s, 7,000 Chilean and other Latin American refugees found safety in Canada after political upheaval. We welcomed Iranian refugees after the overthrow of the Shah, Bosnian Muslims escaping ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav civil war, and more than 60,000 so-called boat people following the war in Vietnam. More recently, we resettled more than 25,000 Syrian refugees, provided a safe haven for thousands of Ukrainians, and we are well on our way to resettling at least 40,000 Afghan refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546351">Canada punches above its weight, but this is not simple altruism. Refugees make Canada better. They enrich our nation, our economy and, of course, our lives. People whose families came to Canada through previous waves of immigration are today members of the House of Commons. They are giving back to this country with their service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546352">In my community, the first waves of Syrian refugees found jobs in grocery stores, restaurants and landscaping companies. Now, more than five years later, they are opening their own businesses, running their own restaurants, hiring people and providing employment to others. They are also becoming Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546353">I have spoken here before about two Syrian success stories in Scarborough Centre. Aleppo Kebab serves delicious Syrian food, while Crown Pastries has the best sweets in Scarborough, especially at Eid. I cannot help but imagine what great things these 10,000 Uighur refugees will achieve in Canada. One of them may even be the next chocolate king, like Tareq Hadhad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546354">What is clear, though, is that too many Uighur people will never have the opportunity to achieve their full potential, to realize their ambitions and their dreams. That is why Canada must act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546355">Lastly, the final clause of Motion No. 62 calls for the government to table a report on how the refugee resettlement plan will be implemented within 120 days of the passage of this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546356">I welcome this motion and its call for the urgent resettlement of 10,000 vulnerable Uighur refugees in Canada. It builds on our recognition of the genocide occurring in Xinjiang and sends a message to China and its Communist government that Canada and the world are still watching. I hope Parliament will ensure that the hard-working team at IRCC, whom we have asked to do so much in recent years, have the resources they need to do all we ask of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546357">As I said earlier, resettlement alone is not an option. Canada must go further to keep the plight of the Uighur people in the public eye, to keep up pressure on China and to rally our allies and the international world with all diplomatic means in defence of the Uighur people. When the government released its new Indo-Pacific strategy, some pundits complained there was not enough attention paid to China. Indeed, the goal is to diversify our commercial and diplomatic interests in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546358">I recognize this may not be helpful to some of those with vested business interests, but I ask them, how can Canada have business as usual with a regime that is perpetrating genocide against an entire community, that puts a minority in re-education camps and then denies their very existence? How can Canada have business as usual with a regime that kidnaps our citizens to be held and used as pawns in business disputes? The answer is clear: We cannot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546359">China must uphold its international human rights obligations. Human rights are universal. National sovereignty can never be used as a pretext or an excuse for the violation of human rights. We cannot let the world forget that an estimated one million Uighurs and other Turkic groups are in concentration camps in Xinjiang, where they are subjected to forced labour, gender-based violence and torture. Uighurs who have fled their homes to third countries are still at risk of deportation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546360">I have always been a voice for human rights around the world, for the Afghans fleeing the Taliban, for the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, for Coptic Christians in northern Iraq and for the Palestinian people denied their basic rights, and I will always raise my voice for those in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546361">With my vote on this motion, we send a message: We will not look away.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546371">Since that motion passed in the House, the government has not addressed the concerns it raised. The UN human rights commissioner recently released a report again highlighting the atrocities being committed against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims by the Chinese regime. If we do not act now, when will we?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546372">The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration unanimously passed a motion calling on the government to extend existing special immigration measures to Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, allow Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in third countries who are at risk of being deported back to China to seek refuge in Canada, and waive the UNHCR determination for Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims. This motion is in the same spirit as that one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546373">It is no surprise that the Chinese government, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, denies what is taking place. In doing this, it is following the pattern set by other autocratic regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546374">The government of modern Russia continues to deny the death of millions of innocent Ukrainians in the Holodomor, even as once again it is assaulting the Ukrainian people. Like the Chinese, it denies the history. The world knows better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546379">This House has already stated that the crimes against the Uighur people are a genocide. The time has come to do more than just offer words of support, unless all we want is for the world to see how virtuous we are, how we are on the right side. We must do more, but what should that “more” look like?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546380">It seems simple to say that we must open our borders, that in a country with as much geography as Canada, 10,000 or more people are easily accommodated. Perhaps there are logistical questions in moving thousands of people from the other side of the world to Canada, but if there is a will, logistics can be overcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546381">However, we need to remember there is more to this equation than geography and seeing how many people can fit into a particular space. We are not talking about numbers here. We are talking about people, people who have been driven from their homes in fear of their lives and who have been persecuted in ways many of us cannot imagine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546382">It is not that they want to leave China, but faced with a choice of life or death, they have chosen life. A new life in Canada can offer hope, hope for a new life in a peaceful land where they will not suffer for their ethnicity or their religion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546383">I know, first-hand, that it is possible, for I have experienced Canada as a welcoming place, but should it be the first choice? Has anyone thought to ask those fleeing the genocide if coming to Canada is their first choice or their second or their third? Maybe starting fresh in Canada seems more appealing than life in refugee camps, but do they know the reality of what life looks like in Canada? I applaud the spirit of this motion, but I wonder if we have explored all options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546384">Would these refugees be happier if a way could be found for them to be integrated into community life in the countries where they have taken refuge, rather than travelling across the world to a place with an unfamiliar language and culture? Could Canada help with that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546385">The government is not very good at hands-on compassion. Ask any recently arrived immigrant. Many who come here find that Canada is not that promised land after all. The truth is that people fleeing conflict zones and attempted genocide need more than just a roof over their heads and a few language lessons. They need to know that they are safe and accepted, that there are people in this new land who are very happy to see them, who want to be their friends and who value them for who they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546386">Government programs, no matter how well-meaning, cannot replace the personal touch. Those fleeing genocide, and indeed all newcomers to Canada, need someone who can help with the basics. For some, that would be a family member who has come here before them, but for most of those fleeing conflict, such as the Uighurs, it would be a Canadian reaching out in friendship to a newcomer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546387">That is what we did with the boat people coming from Vietnam in the early 1980s. That is what we have been doing with those refugees who came from Syria seven years ago, and those who continue to arrive on our shores today. We, here, can say, “Let us bring in these people who need our help”, but it is the Canadian people who will make these newcomers feel welcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546388">Conservatives believe that Canada's immigration system should uphold Canada's humanitarian tradition of providing safe haven for refugees. I think that may be something that all political parties can agree on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546389">There may be some who are concerned about the reaction from the government of the People's Republic of China, which has been trying to have the countries where the Uighurs have taken refuge return the refugees, in violation of international law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546390">I would not be surprised if the Chinese ambassador to Canada calls me to complain about the words I have chosen to use today. His government insists that there is no genocide and feels insulted when people talk about it. I would invite the ambassador to take a trip with me to the border areas of the neighbouring countries where the Uighurs have fled. I would invite him to talk with the refugees, to hear their stories, and then I would ask him again if there is no genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546391">I doubt I will have that opportunity, but we in this House do have the opportunity to show our support for the Uighur people. I urge all hon. members to do so.</ParaText>

My wish for us here in Parliament is that we will be able to work together across party lines with no regard for the interests of individual political parties. I dream of a world where an election campaign lasts only for the time allotted for that campaign and then, afterward, people work together for the common good. That is what we should always be trying to do. That is what I always try to do. I may not always be perfect at it, but I am definitely trying. I urge everyone to do the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546395">I would like them to know that we truly respect them. We respect them and we are here to try to help them. I invite every member of Parliament here today to try to put themselves in their shoes for a moment. They are here in Canada’s Parliament, in a free world where people have the right to live according to their values and beliefs. They are thinking about their families and their nation, which do not have such opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546396">Let us truly think about it. Let us put ourselves in their place. Let us imagine that our brother, uncle, grandfather, daughter, wife are left all alone while we are forced to go to a re-education and training centre, which is actually a concentration camp. These are serious issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546397">We do not say this lightly. We have evidence. We have heard testimony, horror stories. Earlier, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278648" Type="2">Longueuil—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> eloquently shared the testimony of people who visited their family and cut their trip short to avoid hurting the people they love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546398">I find it difficult to imagine how a member of the House of Commons could sleep peacefully after voting against a motion like this one. That is how I feel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546399">Clearly, the Bloc Québécois will vote in favour of the motion. The Bloc Québécois rejects any partisanship and wishes to protect the oppressed. Of course, we cannot do it all. My Conservative colleague raised a good question earlier, wondering whether these people really want to come to Canada. Of course not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546400">Anyone proud of their country would want to stay there and take part in its collective social, economic and cultural development, helping it thrive on the world stage. They would want to promote their nation throughout the world so that all could benefit from their values, progress and achievements in their own quest for improvement. Everyone wants that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546401">However, this is a situation where people fled to avoid being imprisoned. They fled to avoid torture. They fled to save their wives from rape. They fled to save their daughters from forced sterilization.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546402">Let us think about it for a minute. These women are being forcefully sterilized. It is all well and good to say that China is an important economic partner, but at some point we have to take a stand. We need to do more than take a stand: we need to do what we can. I think that welcoming people who are facing these risks into Canada is the least we can do. Let us do it and not be afraid to do it with our head held high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546403">I hope that all the members in the House, including the cabinet, will support this motion. In 2022, we adopted a motion to recognize the genocide of the Uighur people and the members of the cabinet abstained. That sends a very sad message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546404">We need to get as close as possible to a unanimous vote in the House. I would ask members of the government to have the courage to recognize and assert that there is a genocide in progress and to commit to welcoming these people into Canada and doing what it takes to help the Uighur nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546405">There are formalities in the motion. It mentions taking in 10,000 people. Of course, the Bloc Québécois will vote in favour. In any case, the Bloc Québécois usually votes “yes”. However, we might have been able to do more. Why not take in 15,000 people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546406">The motion mentions 120 days to implement the plan. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, who is a member of the government, sponsored the motion. I congratulate him for it and give him a tip of my hat. As a member of the government, he is aware that the government moves slowly and that it set a 120-day time frame. The NDP has just proposed an amendment to change the time frame to 100 days, and this makes us very happy. However, we might have done better there as well.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546415">It is a beautiful thing to hear voices united together, echoing as one, for this particular motion, a motion to help our human family and address a pressing issue. Whether one views it as genocide or grave and serious crimes against humanity, it is an issue that must be addressed with clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546416">This motion will be looked at not only by Canadians, but also by the international community. It is critical that we are clear on this issue and show leadership. I hope and expect each and every member of this chamber, regardless of position or party, will vote for this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546417">Why do I say that? We need to lead. Canada is a middle power. We have the ability to concretely move the needle on things in this world. I ask those who are making a decision right now on how to vote to take a deep and hard look at the information they have access to. Some have information that is only public and others have information that is confidential and classified. I ask individuals who are reflecting on this decision right now to take a look at that information to see what is actually happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546418">We know that at least one million Uighurs and other Turkic minorities are in concentration camps and have been forced into labour. Their identities are being erased and they are being forced to become people they are not. This is abhorrent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546419">We have seen this happen in history to different people. We have seen communities wiped off the face of the earth, and the Uighur people are suffering that today. The one million of them who have been forced into concentration camps and forced to produce products that we unwittingly wear and consume are not only forced to work, but are also separated from their children. Hundreds of thousands of children are being made wards of the state permanently. They do not return home during the summer and remain permanent wards of the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546420">Women are being forcibly sterilized with IUDs that are so horrible and terrible that when physicians remove them, the whole womb has to be removed. The IUDs are so crude that they are fused to the womb, meaning these women can no longer have children. As a result, eminent jurists have said that, legally, the issue of sterilization and what is happening to the Uighur people meet the level of genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546421">However, let us not debate too much on terms. Let us recognize that there is a minimal floor. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, recently came out with a report stating that what is happening likely amounts to crimes against humanity. Once that level is engaged, there is a responsibility for states to protect. That includes Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546422">Former prime minister Brian Mulroney took leadership on the issue of apartheid and Canada went down in the history books. We speak about that moment in time as leadership. Today, we need leadership on this issue. That is why I implore each and every member of the House, regardless of position, to make their intent clear and vote for this motion when it comes up. Canadians and the international community will be watching. We need to take leadership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546429"> Members may recall that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage made a series of amendments to the bill, which were presented to the House in the committee's fourth report on December 9, 2022. The committee also ordered that the bill, as amended, be reprinted for the use of the House at report stage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546430">The House concurred in the bill, as amended, at report stage on December 13, 2022, and adopted the bill at third reading the following day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546431">Following passage at third reading, as per the usual practice, House officials prepared a parchment version of the bill, which was transmitted to the Senate. Due to an administrative error in the committee's report, which was also reflected in the version of the bill that was reprinted for the use of the House at report stage, the report and the bill both included a subamendment, adding a new clause 27(1.1) to the bill, which had been negatived by the committee and should not have appeared in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546432">Given the tight timelines between the presentation of the report and consideration of the bill at third reading, the error went unnoticed before the bill was passed. Nonetheless, the decision taken by the committee was clear, as recorded in the minutes of the meeting. The Chair has no reason to believe that members were misinformed when they adopted the bill.</ParaText>

The records of the House relating to this bill are complete and accurate.

              <ParaText id="7546434">Similar situations have been addressed by my predecessors, such as in a ruling on April 12, 2017, found at page 10486 of Debates. Guided by this precedent and others, similar steps have been taken to address the current case. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546435">Once the error was detected, House officials immediately communicated with their counterparts in the Senate to inform them of the situation. The Chair then instructed House officials to take all the necessary steps to correct the error in both the committee's report and the bill itself, and to ensure that the other place has a corrected copy of Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>. A revised version of the bill will be transmitted to the Senate as per the usual administrative process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546436">Furthermore, the Chair has asked that a rectified “as passed by the House of Commons” version of the bill be printed and that the fourth report of the committee be corrected accordingly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546448">I want to start with a few thanks. I first of all want to thank the thousands of advocates across this country who have been waiting and fighting for this day for just over 52 years. It was 52 years ago in December that the Royal Commission on the Status of Women came out with its landmark report that asked the Government of Canada and suggested that it put in place an affordable, high-quality, inclusive and accessible child care system across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546449">Fifty-two years is a long time to wait, and there are lots of families who went through child care during that period of time. However, what I have heard from stakeholders and advocates across this country is that now is a good time to start. It is never too late to do the right thing, and here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546450">Today, we have agreements signed with 13 provinces and territories. As of December, almost all of them have reduced fees by 50%, and we have one more that is going to be making a good announcement very soon. More of those fee reductions are on their way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546451">What excites me about this system and about this bill is the impact it is having on families. I have had occasion to to travel to almost every province and territory across the country over the past year, to engage with families and to hear from them the stories about how this system is making a difference in their lives. I have yet to speak to a child care centre representative or a family who has not talked about the very real and tangible impact that this reduction in fees is having on their families' bottom line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546452">I will start by talking about one of the things that we have been doing as a federal government for a while, and that is the RESP, the registered education savings plan. For decades, we have been encouraging families to save for post-secondary education. We understand that this is a huge expense, but that it is important for all of our children across this country, for the future of our country, to make sure that they have the opportunity to attend post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546453">Child care fees can range between $12,000 and $24,000 or even more per year. Multiply that by three or four or five, depending on the province they are in, and it could be two or three times the cost that the average student would spend on post-secondary education, yet we did not have any mechanism, until recently, to support families for this major expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546454">It is an expense that starts right at the beginning of their family's journey, often when they have recently purchased a home or when they are just getting started in their careers. We are talking about tens of thousands of dollars. That is a huge impact and, not always but often, it results in the lower-income parent deciding to take a step outside of the workforce, because it just does not make financial sense for them to carry on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546455">The stories I have heard over the past year are changing that. I have been to every province and almost every territory. I meet parents. It is often a mom, I have not heard from a dad yet, but I am looking forward to that as well. However, I hear from so many moms who talk about the fact that it is because of these lower child care fees that they are returning to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546456">There was the mom in Ottawa a couple of months ago who said that because of the 50% fee reduction she enrolled her daughter in day care, and she is returning to work full time as a real estate agent. She spoke of the impact that it had not only for her family's finances but also for her career development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546457">In Richmond, B.C. in December, in talking to a mom of three, she said that it is because of these reductions that she is able to go from part-time to full-time work, because she can now afford to have two of her children in full-time day care, with one of her children in school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546458">In Nova Scotia, a mom whom I was talking to said that because of these fee reductions, she is not only returning to full-time work, but she breathes a sigh of relief when she goes to the grocery store. She is not as worried about making sure that she can afford to buy healthy, nutritious food for her family because of the significant fee reductions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546459">Most recently I was talking to a mom in my community of Burlington, Ontario. She explained that when she and her husband saw the 50% reduction in child care fees, they decided they would not have to give up their house. Financially it made sense to keep her child enrolled in day care. They would be able to afford their mortgage and both of them could keep working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546460"> This initiative is having a real tangible impact on families across the country, and I could not be prouder to be part of a government that is delivering this important policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546461">That brings me to today and the introduction of this legislation at second reading. I hope all members in the House are going to support it and get it through committee quickly, so we can cement this important legacy for Canadian families, children and women right across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546462">Let me talk a bit about what Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would accomplish. It would provide support for the continued implementation of an affordable Canada-wide system by enshrining the vision, guiding principles and a commitment to long-term funding. It would enhance transparency and accountability by requiring the minister responsible to report annually to the public on progress being made on the system. It would establish in law the national advisory council, which, by the way, is having its first official meeting today in Ottawa. This legislation would also build on the early successes of the Canada-wide agreements.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546465">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would build on the collaborative work we have undertaken with PTs and with indigenous peoples from coast to coast to coast, and it is driven by a shared interest, and close partnerships and collaboration. It respects provincial and territorial jurisdiction and the co-developed indigenous early learning and child care framework that was jointly released and endorsed in 2018 with the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the Métis National Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546466">By enshrining these principles and vision into federal law, we are building stability into the child care system, and not just stability but also predictability and commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546467">We want provinces, territories and indigenous peoples to know that the federal government is in there for the long term. Importantly, we want parents, families, child care providers and early childhood educators to know that the federal government is also there for the long term. That is so important with Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>, because we have seen in the past, unfortunately, when in 2006 then-prime minister Stephen Harper ripped up the child care agreements with the provinces and territories. It was one of the first acts the Conservatives did when they came into government. We need to ensure we are doing everything we can to make it harder for any future government, like a future Conservative government, to take that away from families, to take that away from our children and to take that away from the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546468">Let me talk a bit about the Canadian economy, because child care is one of those amazing policies that is not just good, smart, feminist, social policy, but it is good, smart, feminist economic policy. For every one dollar invested in child care, the economy sees a broader return of $1.50 to $1.80.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546469">It is estimated that the Canada-wide system could raise real GDP in our country by as much as 1.2% over the next two decades. An OECD report shows that improvement in gender equality and family friendly policies has boosted growth in per-capita GDP by between 10% and 20%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546470"> In Sweden, for example, when it brought in universal affordable child care, female employment rates increased by almost 30%. The IMF estimated that closing the participation gap between Canadian men and women in the workforce could raise Canada's GDP levels by 4% in the medium term. That is $92 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546471">Gender equality, ensuring women have access to economic opportunities, ensuring our children get the best possible start in life, is not just good for us as a society; that is excellent for our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546472">Let us talk a bit about what that means in real terms. We talk about the macro picture, but when we look at what that means, we have an example in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546473">Quebec is celebrating 25 years of universal day care. Quebec went from having the lowest female workforce participation in the country in 1998 to now having the highest. In fact, some of the highest rates of women with children under the age of four are working in the entire OECD. If Canadian women join the workforce at the same rates that Quebec women have over the last 25 years, that is an additional 240,000 workers entering our workforce today. That is an impressive number. Those are workers in Canada, people who want to be part of the workforce, but for economic reasons have not been able to justify it or make it work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546474">As I said, I have talked to moms all across the country for whom this is making the difference. This is really exciting. As to where this is going to set us up as Canada in our future, for our economy and, most important, for Canadians, the potential is unmatched. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546475">I want to spend a bit of time talking about the workforce. We know there is no child care system in Canada without the talented, qualified, well-trained, caring early learning and child care workforce. I want to give a big thanks to each and every one of them. During the pandemic, they went to work so that Canada could keep working. We saw what happened when child care centres were closed. It meant parents were staying home with their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546476">It is pretty hard. I do not know about other members, but I was home during the pandemic for the first six months and my two and a half year old was home with me. It is pretty tricky to get work done when parents have a two year old or a two and a half year old with them. Anyone who is a parent or has been a parent of a young child can attest to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546477">Those child care workers went to work during the pandemic. They went when we needed them most. We need to recognize that, we need to say thanks and we need to ensure that we have the system in place to support them with good wages and that they have an environment in which they can thrive, grow and develop their careers as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546478">When we talk about child care, we talk about the economic impact and the social impact, but we also need to talk about the impact that it has on our children. Being in a safe, secure place is important, one where they feel loved, where they feel cared for, where they are well taken care of, but also where learning is part and parcel of the framework. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546479">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> likes to talk about setting up a generation of super kids in the country, and I could not agree with her more. As a mom who is so grateful to the child care workers who made it possible for me to do my job while my son was little, the absolute illumination that he had when he went to day care and the explosion in learning that I saw from him is one of those things for which I will be eternally grateful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546480">When we talk about child care, there are so many spinoffs that are important for our society and our economy. I like to describe it as a home run, because it is good for our children, it is good for our families and it is good for the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546481"> Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is going to help us cement the role of the federal government. It is going to ensure that we are there in the long run for Canadian women, families, children and Canadians in general. It is going to ensure we are setting the country up for the 21st century to take hold of those opportunities and ensure that every child in our country has the best possible start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546482">I hope that my colleagues from all parties in this place will support Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> and move it forward so we can provide that commitment and assurance to Canadians and their families that the federal government is there in the long term, that we support our children and women, that we are setting Canada up for success.</ParaText>

One concern I have brought up many times in the House is how early childhood educators historically, and I would say even now, have been underpaid and undervalued.

              <ParaText id="7546501">It is important to reiterate that the legislation is complementary to the agreements we have signed with provinces and territories. Each one of those agreements does have a commitment to a wage grid, to benefits, to ensuring we are supporting the early childhood workforce. Of course, that is very much within the provincial and territorial jurisdictions, and provinces and territories decide what those wages are.</ParaText>

As a mom and as the shadow minister for families, children and social development, I cannot understate the importance and value of affordable, quality child care. However, affordable, quality child care does not exist if one cannot access it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546520">I do not think we will find a Canadian who does not want what is best for their children. However, we must acknowledge that it is not the government’s job to decide what is best for one's child. Rather, it is the parent, the caregiver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546521">Every Canadian deserves to choose what works best for their family when it comes to child care.

              <ParaText id="7546522">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would not offer choice for families. In fact, it would exclude many Canadians from accessing quality, affordable child care. This bill speaks exclusively to those who already have a child care space with a public or not-for-profit child care operator. It does not offer anything to families who have been on wait-lists for years. It does not offer anything for families who choose to raise their children at home, use a grandparent or access a private or home-run day care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546523">There is no freedom to choose in this bill, and there is absolutely no mention of how to manage the frontline burnout and labour shortage of child care providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546524">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would not solve the problem of the staff shortages and the out-of-control wait-lists to access child care across this country. In fact, the bill would do exactly the opposite. It would increase the demand for affordable child care and leave parents with no access. This bill would subsidize the wealthy instead of prioritizing our most vulnerable families who need child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546525">The bill specifically says, “enable families of varying incomes to benefit from affordable early learning and child care programs and services”. In a cost-of-living crisis, why is the Liberal government subsidizing the most wealthy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546526">This message is from Morgan, who sent it to me. She says, “I think my story is pretty common among new parents right now. I have three children, one in school and I have to go back to work in February from my latest maternity leave. I’ve been on the waitlist since I was 8 weeks pregnant and still won’t have any care for at least another year likely.” She asks whether she is just supposed to give up her career, her income, her pension and her benefits. She continues, saying, “I’m not sure how I am supposed to provide for my family with no income. Many daycares I have reached out to say they have had to shut down some of their rooms, meaning even less child care spots.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546527">Here is another story from an operator in Peterborough, Ontario. She says that they have a child in their preschool program who is eligible for the Canada-wide early learning and child care program, or, as many call it, the CWELCC, and who has a sibling in the senior before and after school program who is not eligible for CWELCC because of their age. Program eligibility, for those who do not know, is only for children under six.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546528">The day care operator says that the parent fee for the preschool child is $19.85 a day, for up to 10 hours of care. The day care is open 7:30 to 5:30. This fee includes a hot lunch prepared by their cook, as well as two snacks each day, also prepared by the cook.

              <ParaText id="7546529">She asks where the equity is in this. Families who have children over six are not entitled to CWELCC program fee reductions and therefore are paying more for under four hours of care than families who are entitled to a full day of care with a hot lunch and two snacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546530">This example points out many of the flaws in the bill. What about parents who work shift work, are entrepreneurs or who work weekends? Where can they take their kids for child care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546531"> Second, how would the bill create more spaces when the child care operator who has written this letter is located in a school, and there are physically no more spaces to put in the school?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546532">Furthermore, how would this bill help with the labour shortage? There is no labour strategy in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546533"> Matthew Lau’s synopsis of this bill and the Liberals' failed attempt at child care is spot-on. He writes that the challenges are the same across the board and there are not enough qualified staff to keep all existing child care centres running at full capacity, let alone staff new spaces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546535"> Andrea Hannen, the Executive Director of the Association of Day Care Operators of Ontario, or ADCO, gives many examples of what we can expect with this Liberal flawed bill. She says, for example, that taxpayers and the families who use the program will wind up paying more and more for it, while all children will wind up getting less and less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546536">This bill, like most Liberal policy, says a lot of really nice things but gives zero details on how any of these nice things will be delivered or how they will be achieved. The Liberals love to promise unrealistic expectations, and then act shocked when they cannot achieve them. They also love to tell taxpayers to just trust them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546537"> After eight years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and seeing how badly Canadians are suffering, we do not trust them. The Financial Accountability Office of Ontario says there is a committed shortfall of $1.2 billion in 2026-27 based on the minimum federal and provincial commitment. We have barely started, and we can already see there is no sustainability plan here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546538"> Susan Cake, chair of Child Care Now Alberta, an advocacy organization, says that there has been a giant frustration in Alberta about the lack of communication, that everybody does not know what is going on, does not know where funding is coming from and does not know where they are going to get money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546539">I want to take a minute right now. This is very important to listen to, because as members may have heard earlier, the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> talked about how this is such an advancement for feminism. This bill would do exactly the opposite. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546540">Feedback from the Association of Alberta Childcare Entrepreneurs said that the majority of private child care in Alberta is operated by women, with a large number being immigrant women, and that the impact of this agreement and the intention of the federal government to prioritize the business model of child care rather than the affordability, accessibility or quality of care is having the opposite effect on women. It notes that we are seeing a women-led industry targeted and pushed out of business, and that women across our province are facing bankruptcy and losing their homes because they signed on to this agreement because they wanted and advocated for affordable child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546541">The association also notes the creation of a two-tiered child care system. For example, one of its directors has a centre in Grand Prairie. She had a wait-list of over 400 families, so she decided to expand even though she understood the new spaces would not have access to the affordability program. Now in her centre she has her original 120 spaces with families paying an average of $13 a day, and 86 new spaces with families paying an average of $65 a day for the same care in the same centre. This is an unintended consequence of this child care program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546542">The written feedback also says that there are new centres sitting empty. They are fully operational and licensed, but because of their choice to be private operators, they cannot access subsidies for families. There are centres with wait-lists of 100 families but only four children attending, because the other families need the subsidy and cannot access it in that centre. These women who have invested their savings and taken the initiative to open centres and meet the needs of their communities are going bankrupt. They likely have signed 10- to 20-year leases with personal guarantees of their families' homes and assets, but the federal government is restricting them from having access to a fair market to operate their businesses. The message this sends is that the choice of these parents does not matter and that these women are collateral damage to meeting this Liberal campaign promise in an NDP coalition.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546543">As the Association of Alberta Childcare Entrepreneurs has pointed out, we must have private child care along with public and not-for-profit centres to meet the demand and to offer the choice to fit what is best for families. However, the language and intention of this bill clearly leave private child care operators in the cold. The exact language from the bill reads that it is to “facilitate access to early learning and child care programs and services — in particular those that are provided by public and not for profit child care providers”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546544"> How can we expect to meet the demand without private operators? We cannot. We need them, yet this bill clearly leaves out any representation from private operators on the national council. What does that say? It says the same thing the Liberals always say, namely that they will decide what is best. They will decide how to spend our money. They will decide who the representatives are at the table. They do not believe in the fair market or having freedom of choice. It is not right. It is not good leadership, and it is not a good long-term strategy for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546545">Ontario’s Financial Accountability Office projects that by 2026, there will be 602,000 children under the age of six whose families will want $10-a-day day care, but the province will only be able to accommodate 37,000 of them. That will leave 38% of children without access. Government estimates also suggest that by 2026, there could be a shortage of 8,500 early childhood workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546546"> In British Columbia, 27% of child care centres turn away children because of a lack of staff. One director, who oversees 13 child care programs that comprise 350 spaces, said that in the past two years, they have had to close programs temporarily, whether by closing for a day or two or shortening hours for the week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546547">In Peterborough, we have 4,200 licensed child care spaces in our city and county. There are 3,500 children on the wait-list. Frontline burnout is hurting our entire economy and contributing to our mental health crisis, as is not being able to access quality child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546548">When the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> says that more women will be able to go to work, she is misleading Canadians. One cannot go to work if one lacks access to child care. One cannot help address our labour shortage without available day care spots. They will say they are going to create more spaces but give zero details of a plan for achieving that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546549">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> does not solve these problems. It is not a child care strategy. It is a headline marketing plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546550">Women are rethinking having children because of the cost-of-living crisis and because there is just no access to child care. I know many women who put their name on a wait-list before they were pregnant; now they have toddlers but no indication if they will ever get a child care spot. Accessing quality child care is one of life’s greatest stressors. Any mom or parent watching this knows that leaving their child with somebody is the ultimate stressor in life. Parents need choice about who to leave their children with. It is an indescribable stress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546551">Parents deserve access to quality child care; more importantly, our children deserve access to quality care. If we are not invested in our children's welfare, then what is our future? Children are our future. They are our most precious resource, and this bill does not put children first. It is a marketing plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546553"> “I have been on a wait list for my 21 month old son since the day he was born, I have never come off of it nor have I received notice that I am coming to the top of any list, let alone some of the choices I feel would best suit our families needs. I’m now pregnant with my second and have already registered this baby on the list in hopes of having more success next time. I have spent countless hours on Facebook groups, asking friends, on paid service websites trying to find adequate care. It’s sad to me because I thought I would be choosing the center/provider that best suited our needs as a family, but it would appear that we are being forced to just accept whatever we get. I have also heard from friends who applied strictly for part time care who gave gotten calls from centres that only accept full time spots. This makes me question how many people are taking up spots on a list for full time when in reality they only require part time care? This seems like a simple issue to fix in the application process. In Facebook groups I see posts every single day of mothers and fathers desperately seeking care as their time on leave has run out and they still don’t have a reliable option. I consider myself lucky, I decided to leave my job after maternity leave and start my own business because I don’t feel I will ever be comfortable leaving my children wherever I get to the top of the list first. This has presented its own challenges as a full time parent &amp; a full time entrepreneur, but at least I am not desperately seeking care left between feeding my family &amp; staying home to care for my children”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546554">She goes on to state, “This entire thing breaks my heart as I also think that while there are certainly many dads highly involved in the search for care, it ultimately seems to fall on women who are now being forced to leave their careers and remain home with their children despite wanting to return to the workplace”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546555">It is really unfortunate that someone cannot be present with their children because they are so stressed out about whether they will be able to find child care and go back to work. They do not have a choice; they have to go back to work to pay for food because of inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546556">In terms of poor planning, alongside not providing clear communication or details on this ideologically driven bill, we have reports coming from child care centres explaining that parents are being charged an extra fee because, as everyone watching knows, the cost of food has skyrocketed after eight years under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546557">As reported by The Globe and Mail, “Governments' daycare budgets didn't account for inflation, and it's affecting how kids are fed”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546558"> Ashley Collins is co-chief executive officer of Compass Early Learning and Care, which operates 40 child care programs across Canada. She estimates that Compass has had to increase its food budget by up to 10%. She said, “There's so many multifaceted things like we need to do from an operational level – make sure that food can continue, but also our staff, being able to make sure we're still putting money into increasing wages”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546559"> According to The Globe and Mail, “Compass programs will continue to look for sales on food and adjust menus accordingly rather than cut food offerings or add them as an extra fee”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546560">“How unfortunate would it be that centres are feeling like they have to add that extra fee at a time when fees are supposed to be going down,” Ashley Collins said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546561">There is so much wrong with this bill, and I cannot stress enough that Conservatives believe in freedom of choice for quality, affordable child care. Everybody wants that. However, this bill is flawed, and simply listening to parents, child care operators and frontline workers should have given the knowledge needed to fix it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546562">We just need to listen to the people who are impacted by this to know what not to do. Clearly, the Liberals believe that Ottawa knows best. Conservatives know that Canadians know best, not Ottawa bureaucrats. We are elected to serve the people, and service means listening and doing something that is better, not worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546563">There are concrete policy decisions that can help families. Affordable and quality child care is critical, but if it cannot be accessed, it does not exist. It is great that we are having this conversation.

All of the issues she raised are issues that have arisen because we did not have national leadership on child care. There was no system before. The system that was there was a patchwork, and it did not provide for the needs of families across this country. Wait-lists existed before and exist today.

There is no national strategy in this bill. Why is private day care not represented? Why is there no private representation on the national council?

I know that in Ontario, the PC government has quietly removed some of the profit caps, allowing for the expansion of for-profit care. We know this is problematic, and it is not supported by main national child care organizations, such as Child Care Now and the Childcare Resource and Research Unit, or unions, such as NUPGE, CUPE and Unifor.

              <ParaText id="7546606">I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>, an act respecting early learning and child care in Canada, which was tabled by the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation> on December 8.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546607">If passed, Bill C‑35 will enshrine in law the Liberal government's commitment to maintaining long-term program funding for the provinces and indigenous peoples, as well as guiding principles for that federal funding. The bill contains no specific financial promises for the national program, but enshrining it in law could make it more difficult for a future government to dismantle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546608">As we know, for many years now, many Canadian families have been envious of Quebec's child care system, because child care often eats up a large portion of their household income. These families have long dreamed of being able to benefit from the same service that families in Quebec have been receiving for decades. It is therefore high time that all Canadian families were able to access child care without breaking the bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546609">In 2022, Quebec celebrated the 25th anniversary of its family policy. On January 23, 1997, the Parti Québécois government's Minister of Education, Pauline Marois, unveiled the Quebec family policy, which was based on five main pillars: child care services and parental leave; the family allowance; the work premium; the solidarity tax credit; and the refundable tax credit for child care expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546610">The family policy was developed as a result of changes in Quebec's population, including an increase in the number of single-parent and blended families, greater numbers of women in the workforce, and the troubling rise of precarious employment. This groundbreaking policy allowed Quebeckers to improve their work-life or school-life balance and benefit from more generous maternity and parental leave, and it extended family assistance programs to self-employed workers and workers with atypical work schedules. This model is a valuable program that the entire Quebec nation is proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546611">Providing early childhood educational services was also a giant step forward for education in Quebec. These services increase students' chances of academic success and prevent them from dropping out, positively impact early childhood development, allow for the early detection of learning disabilities and adjustment difficulties, and ensure that all young Quebeckers start off on the same footing, regardless of their sex, ethnic origin or social class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546612">Considering the popular support they enjoy, the new child care centres rank among one of the greatest successes of the new social economy, being democratically managed using an approach that involves both parents and educators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546613">The mission of Quebec's early childhood education services is threefold: one, to ensure the well-being, health and safety of the children receiving care; two, to provide an environment that stimulates their development in every way, from birth to school age; and three, to prevent learning, behavioural and social integration problems from appearing later on. Child care services provide a conduit for instilling values, culture and language. This system helps children grow and develop more healthily from an early age. This is an important principle of childhood socialization and sharing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546614">In my opinion, a real family policy like the one in Quebec, which includes components such as family leave, income support and an accessible child care network, must be integrated into a coherent whole in order to be effective, so it should be overseen by just one level of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546615">I myself took advantage of our child care services, and my children received an education that contributed to their success in life. It is truly a pleasure to bring a child to the centre in the morning, knowing that they are safe, that they will learn something and discover their creativity, and that they are picking up life skills by making friends they can play with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546616">I have to say that the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> in principle, but we think it is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, it does not comply with the distribution of powers set out in the Constitution, but on the other, it excludes Quebec from the federal family policy for the next five years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546617">Let me explain. The Constitution clearly states that education and family policy are not under federal jurisdiction. Moreover, although the bill states that the provinces will be able to certify child care services and determine the applicable criteria, it also states that every government in Canada will have to comply with the principles set out in the multilateral early learning and child care framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546618">This framework is full of good intentions and fine principles, but it is based on the federal government's supposed spending power, which Quebec does not consider legitimate or legal. One thing is clear: This bill was not tabled in the right parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546619">On the other hand, the bill excludes Quebec from the federal family policy for the next five years. The Quebec government will receive $6 billion in compensation for opting out of the centralizing policy. This demonstrates respect for Quebec's aversion to federal meddling in its jurisdictions, especially since Quebec is not only a pioneer in child care services, but is hailed as a model for success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546620">Nonetheless, unlike Bill <Document DbId="3073187" Type="4">C‑303</Document>, Bill C‑35's predecessor, there is no indication of any exemption for Quebec in the current wording of the bill. This is how clause 4 of Bill C‑303 was worded:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546621">
                <LegislationQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Recognizing the unique nature of the jurisdiction of the Government of Quebec with regard to the education and development of children in Quebec society, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Government of Quebec may choose to be exempted from the application of this Act and, notwithstanding any such decision, shall receive the full transfer payment that would otherwise be paid under section 5.</QuotePara>
                </LegislationQuote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546622">The agreement signed with the Quebec government is valid for five years. However, giving Quebec the full right to opt out of this program would help avoid another dispute between Ottawa and Quebec City when the federal government inevitably interferes in Quebec's jurisdiction, as it is wont to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546623">During the joint announcement by the federal government and the Legault government, the Premier of Quebec indicated that the federal government would continue to help Quebec and that the agreement would respect Quebec's jurisdictions. The Premier of Quebec, Mr. Legault, said that after 2026, he will expect help from the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546624">The passage of Bill C‑35 would make it possible for Quebec to recover significant sums that it could use to complete its network and enhance working conditions for workers in the sector. By allowing Quebec to opt out and be fully compensated, Bill C‑35 takes into consideration these two opposing tendencies in federal-provincial relations, which is rare on the part of the federal government. Outside Quebec, Ottawa is seen as a force for social progress, which results in a strong tendency towards centralization. In Quebec, we reject this interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546625">However, as I just mentioned, unlike its predecessor, Bill C‑303, specifically clause 4, this bill does not provide for the right to unconditionally opt out. It is essential that this be included in order to reflect this opposing view of Canada, that is centralization outside Quebec and respect for jurisdictions within Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546626">Finally, it would be a good idea for Bill C‑35 to emulate its predecessor by recognizing the Quebec government's unique expertise on day care services in North America, as the international community did in 2003. In its study of day care in Canada, the OECD stated that it is “important to underline...the extraordinary advance made by Quebec, which has launched one of the most ambitious and interesting early education and care policies in North America....none of [the Canadian provinces] showed the same clarity of vision as Quebec in addressing the needs of young children and families”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546627">In closing, it is my hope that all Canadian families will one day be able to enjoy the same child care benefits as Quebec families. We know that, in addition to giving a financial boost to Canadian families, this would enable more mothers to enter the job market. It is an investment in a better future for our children, and our children are the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546633">Madam Speaker, one of the trends we are seeing, which has really been accelerated by the pandemic, is flexible work. People are working from home and looking to be able to combine family life with work in different ways. Therefore, they are still very much needing child care, but they are looking for more creative options, which may be in their neighbourhood, may be at odd hours and may reflect the particulars of their work situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546634"> One of the concerns I have with the government's one-size-fits-all approach to child care is that it would fund a particular kind of child care model that is not consistent with the way many families live. As technology changes, the government's program is not keeping up with this evolution and how people are trying to combine work with family life. I wonder if the member could talk about whether she agrees that the government's approach is failing to be flexible to accommodate all families with the way the program is structured.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546648">A few minutes ago, I heard my colleague ask if we could encourage people to get into politics and set aside partisan rhetoric on the thousands of files before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546649">Today I have the great pleasure of speaking to Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C‑35</Document>. I say bravo because we are entirely in favour in principle. I am very proud of that. I must also say that my colleague did a fine job explaining the ins and outs of everything that might be missing from this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546650">I will talk more about the pride of Quebec for more than 25 years now. Having heard the speech by my Conservative colleague, I hope to give the others a bit more of an understanding of the purpose of this bill and the need to see it through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546651">I want to look back because I want to talk about how proud I am. Just before being appointed, the first female premier of Quebec introduced a forward-thinking family policy that changed the lives of countless families and boosted the economy. It levelled the playing field for everyone and put children on the path to educational success, and I am very proud of that. What is more, the policy was implemented in a reasonable way that did not break parents' budgets. That is why, at the time, it was known as the groundbreaking $5 day care. Today, it does not even cost $9 a day. For us, it is still a good program with benefits that I will talk about in the next few minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546652">As the minister said earlier, in 1997, this program made it possible for children from all walks of life and all social classes to attend day care and for all parents, both men and women, who had never even considered doing so, to go back to work and become independent, to prepare to take the path I talked about earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546653">Madam Speaker, my colleagues are really bothering me. I thought we had set the stage for a minimum level of respect.

              <ParaText id="7546656">Madam Speaker, in Quebec, we call them <I>centres de la petite enfance</I>, or CPEs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546657">This has allowed parents, like me for that matter, to not have to make the agonizing choice of deciding which parent should stay home to educate and prepare children for school based on family income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546658">Twenty-five years ago, many women often earned less than their spouses. The child care system has not only provided equal opportunity for children, but also equality and prosperity for women. If we look at the numbers, we can see there has been an increase in women in business and in the workforce. As we know, the numbers are incredible. A quarter of a century later, and the numbers do not lie. We cannot ignore them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546659">Quebeckers are very proud of this model. Obviously, I am, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546660">Earlier, my colleague mentioned that Quebec has been cited as an example, particularly at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In 2003, it was noted that Quebec had implemented one of the most ambitious education and child care policies. It was very ambitious when you look at North America as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546661">Here is what I want to tell my Conservative colleagues. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in child care returns almost $2—$1.75, actually—in tax revenue. An extra dollar invested in health and early learning saves our health, social and judicial systems $9. As I said at the start, the child care system makes a huge contribution to economic development, equal opportunity and the prosperity of women who want to be in the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546662">We also have numbers that show lower drop-out rates, and I am very proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546663">We agree with the principle of the bill. Who would oppose giving our kids the best possible opportunity? If that is where we start from, I think we have a proposal that we can re-evaluate in five years. Quebec's child care model is not new; it has been around for over 25 years. We have numbers to prove all this. I think we might even see the Conservatives admit that helping the community as a whole has an enormous impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546664">As a brief aside, I can say that one plus one equals two. If we take the necessary steps to educate people in their workplace and improve their working conditions, we could see a significant reduction in the labour shortage that exists across Quebec and Canada. The labour shortage is therefore not a good argument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546665">Since I have barely three minutes left, I would like to talk about what I experienced more than 15 years ago and why I am proud to have been so heavily involved. I was the president of La Fourmilière early child care centre. This was at a time when program coordinators had to be deployed to ensure that spaces were maximized and that the programs could be managed in both institutional and home-based settings. In fact, there are still home-based child care centres operating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546666">This is very important to me. I want to take 20 seconds to recognize a woman who dedicated her life to early childhood education. Thirty years ago, it was called kindergarten. Then there was a program called Passe-Partout. Today, it is called the CPE La Fourmilière.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546668">Obviously, jurisdictions need to be respected. We in the Bloc Québécois keep saying that. Who could be against that? Just five minutes ago, we heard a member mention that, for once, jurisdictions were respected when it comes to the right to full compensation. I look forward to getting this bill passed. I hope things will turn around. Maybe the same will happen with health transfers. That is my biggest wish for 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546669">On behalf of our children, the next generation, the economy and women's empowerment in the workforce, I want to congratulate the minister for taking action and standing her ground. The Bloc will be there.</ParaText>

It is odd to be talking about this here, because education matters are usually discussed at the National Assembly. How can we say that the labour shortage and the lack of attention paid to the private sector mean that we are not going to go ahead and not even try it? The bill provides for a five-year timeline.

              <ParaText id="7546687">Finally, after so many years of struggle, we have a national child care legislation that accompanies a system of national child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546688"> Let me begin by acknowledging the people who made this system and the bill we are debating today possible. There are too many names to mention, but let me say this. Generations of feminists, trade unionists, child care workers and advocates made this victory possible. They never, ever gave up the fight. They did not give up after the 1970 Royal Commission on the Status of Women's recommendation for a national child care program was ignored by the government of the day. They did not give up after the 1993 Liberal red book promised national child care, only for that government to pursue deep cuts to social programs instead. They did not give up during the 10 years of a Harper government that viewed child care as a dirty word. It has been 30 years since the Liberals promised a national child care program and, as a result of their relentless advocacy, we finally find ourselves here today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546690">Our party prides itself on standing alongside organizations, advocates and unions in their demonstration of courage and commitment even when the possibility of national child care seemed so unlikely. It is because of their tenacity and their refusal to quit even when the odds were against them that we are here today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546692">I also want to acknowledge the role that our party and particularly women in the NDP have played in getting us to this point. Olivia Chow, the former MP for Trinity—Spadina is a child care champion. Her private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="4328036" Type="4">C-373</Document>, laid out a foundation for an affordable, accessible and high-quality national child care system. More recently, my colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>, built on these efforts with her Bill <Document DbId="11415498" Type="4">C-311</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546693">I am grateful to them both for their work in moving this issue forward and demonstrating what a positive role for the federal government in ensuring that families can have access to child care they need when they need it looks like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546694">Finally, I wish to thank the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation>, the member of Parliament for Burlington, and her team for the collaborative approach they have taken with this legislation. The minister sought out our feedback and was receptive to many of our suggestions about what should be included in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546695">Although there are still areas where the bill can and should be strengthened, I am delighted that several of our key recommendations did find their way into the current version of the bill. I will address some of these key recommendations in more detail later, but I wanted to take this opportunity to acknowledge how I appreciated, very much, the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s openness to our feedback.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546696">By establishing a long-term commitment for federal funding to provinces and indigenous peoples and enshrining the principles of a national system of early learning and child care, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would help ensure that parents across Canada can access affordable, accessible and high-quality child care now and into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546697">In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, where the price of almost everything has increased, child care is a rare exception. Parents in many cities across the country are seeing child care savings as significant as 50%, providing real relief to thousands of families. It is vital that the target of $10-a-day child care by 2026 is not only achieved, but sustained for the long term.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546698">I will note, however, that not all cities and provinces have met their fee reduction targets. One province in particular is Manitoba, which has conspicuously lagged behind. This is a topic I will return to later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546699">Nevertheless, the child care agreements are delivering significant fee reductions for parents from coast to coast. It is important this continues indefinitely, not just for five years until the agreements need to be renewed. Much like our system of universal health care, child care must be a permanent feature of our social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546700">The commitment to long-term funding is also crucial for advancing gender equality in our country. Child care is a feminist issue. It gives working women the ability to choose when and how they wish to re-enter the workforce after having a child. The Quebec model of low-cost child care offers a powerful example of this. Indeed, Quebec's investment in a universal child care have resulted in women's participation in the workforce increasing by between 8% and 12%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546701">Not only has this boosted Quebec's economy, it has improved the financial security of women. It means a greater portion of household income is now under the control of women, which gives them more security in the case of separation, including in cases where they need to leave an abusive relationship. This is what feminist public policy looks like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546702"> I often hear members of Parliament sharing stories about the struggling single parent mother trying to make ends meet. In fact, the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation>, now the Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, often invokes the experiences of single moms in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546703">I can be certain that he has never been a single mother. If he had been, maybe he would not be so quick to oppose a national health care program, which will help thousands of single moms and children across the country have a better life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546704">I, in fact, was a single mom. I was very fortunate at the time to have stable employment teaching in post-secondary education. However, even on an academic salary, I often had difficulty making ends meet, paying up to $650 a month in child care expenses. This resulted in me having to take on more employment, which resulted in my having less time with my precious son. I have lasting mother's guilt about having to leave him so I could provide for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546705"> I am lucky to have such a wonderful son, whom I adore. Looking back, maybe if there had been a national child care program at the time, our life might have looked much different. I was exhausted, and my son missed his mother.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546706">More affordable child care, let alone $10-a-day child care, would have changed my life and my son's life. Therefore, for any member of the House who uses the story of struggling single mothers for political gain without having been one themselves, they should vote in favour of the bill and support a system of national child care now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546707">Returning to the bill, beyond the long-term funding commitment, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> contains other important provisions we pushed for and managed to have incorporated into the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546708"> First is the inclusion of international human rights conventions and declarations that enshrine access to child care as a human right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546709">Preambular paragraph 3 affirms a commitment to further realization of the right to child care as recognized in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is something for which child care advocates have long demanded and for which the NDP have fought. Preambular paragraph 3 also affirms the commitment to furthering the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and contains important references to other international conventions, including the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546710">An other inclusion for which the NDP fought for was that rights-based language be included in the bill. I am pleased that this has been included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546711">Second and highly significant is that Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would explicit priority to child care programs and services offered by public and not-for-profit providers as one of the principles guiding federal funding. This is a provision fought for and won by the NDP. It is is a win for parents because public and non-profit child care means affordable, quality and accessible day care for families that need it rather than day cares that make a profit off of the backs of parents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546712">We also know that an emphasis on public and non-profit child care means better wages and working conditions for staff in the system. Study after study, union after union have heeded these calls for a public not-for-profit child care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546713">Those in the House who say they stand with workers then they need to stand with a public, non-profit child care system. Taking care of our kids should not be on the backs of parents. Kids are not a business. The focus should be on providing the best possible care at a price that parents can afford, not delivering a profit for shareholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546714">While all of what I describe represents an important step forward, as I mentioned previously, there are areas where this bill can and should be improved. One of the improvements required is adding an explicit commitment to decent work for child care staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546715"> At this point, I will digress briefly to say that I was once, as many people know in the House, an early childhood educator. If someone had told me all those years ago that I would be in this place debating national child care legislation, I would not have believed that person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546716">Workers are at the heart and soul of a national child care system. For far too long, child care workers have been grossly underpaid and undervalued in spite of the fact that they perform some of society's most critical work. That is why I left the profession even though I loved the kids who I was teaching everyday. I loved the work but I could not afford to continue in a profession that did not pay a living wage or provide good benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546717">A national child care program will only be successful and sustainable if the workers who make it possible are treated with dignity and paid fairly for their labour. That is why I support the Canadian Labour Congress' call for the legislation to include a clear commitment to decent work for child care staff. All child care workers deserve to earn a living wage with benefits with which they can support their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546718">As an aside, it is also vital for the federal government to develop a workforce strategy to address staffing shortages in the sector. When we talk about creating new spaces, the building is not the most important element. It is having trained staff to look after the kids in these new child care spaces, a workforce strategy that can help ensure we are continuously expanding child care options where the demand is greatest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546719">The bill can also be strengthened with respect to the accountability and transparency it provides. While the creation of a national advisory council is welcome in terms of the expert advice that it will provide, it does not have the enforcement power to ensure that the provisions set out in Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> are followed. It is important for the bill to include strong accountability mechanisms so that the commitments it contains are upheld. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546720">The reporting requirements on the progress being made in establishing national child care and federal investments in this sector lack detail, stating only that the minister is required to make an annual report. This is too vague and the bill should specify the specific metrics, including new spaces being built, new child care workers being hired and other quantitative details. It is vital that members of the public and Parliament have access to this crucial information.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7546721">It should also establish conditions on federal child care funding, real accountability for when provinces fail to deliver on fee reductions or expanding public, not-for-profit care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546722">I am deeply concerned that Manitoba is the only province where we have not seen an average reduction in fees. Instead, the government has made changes to who is eligible for the subsidy. This is unacceptable. Also concerning is the Ontario government's decision to remove profit caps, paving the way for an expansion of for-profit care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546723">I know the government has said there are accountability mechanisms built into the bilateral agreements, but they are either inadequate, not being properly enforced, or both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546724">I am also aware that Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> does not supersede the bilateral agreements, which are legally binding, so we cannot impose new terms on top of these existing agreements. However, I am hoping the bill could be amended to provide stronger conditions that would apply on an ongoing basis, or on a going forward basis, to future agreements after the current ones expire, five years from when they are concluded. Right now, the bill says nothing about how future agreements would be enforced to ensure accountability for the funding. This is a notable gap that we should address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546725">While there are more opportunities to weigh in on the bill at committee and in the chamber, I want to conclude by again acknowledging the gravity of what we are discussing today. We have progressed from being a country where child care was seen as the sole responsibility of mothers, unpaid labour with which our society could not function, to a country where child care is not just an individual responsibility but a collective one. We have progressed to being a country where we will finally have national legislation underpinning a national system of child care in every province and territory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546726">After years of false starts and broken promises, that is something we can all take pride in. To the women, the workers and the advocates who have helped make this dream a reality, I say their tenacious efforts have made our country fairer, more just and more inclusive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7546768">A nurse by career, Jean has dedicated her time and energy to the service to others. On countless medical mission trips, Jean has provided care to so many in need around the globe. She also founded the Stratford Mission Depot to help coordinate the donation and delivery of medical supplies and equipment. Just this past year, Jean and her team of volunteers saw the need for medical supplies for Ukrainian refugees and sprang into action, quickly amassing 14 cubic metres of medical supplies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546769">Jean is quick to deflect praise away from herself and toward her team of volunteers, and it is that modesty that underscores why she is so deserving of this special recognition. I congratulate Jean Aitcheson.</ParaText>

Dwight was a successful fisherman and a proud owner of his family business, DMC Enterprises, which he operated side by side with his son Matthew.

The government has made life easier for violent criminals by providing easy access to bail and repealing mandatory minimum sentences for serious crimes. As a result, violent crime has gone up 32% in the past year, and gang-related killings have gone up by 92% since 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7546779">Furthermore, Liberals have failed to stop the flow of illegal firearms across the border. As a consequence, five police officers have tragically lost their lives this past fall in the line of duty. Our communities feel less safe, and the government is making it worse. Despite their dismal record, Liberals recently initiated a ban on hunting rifles and shotguns, making thousands of these firearms illegal. Hunters, farmers and target shooters are not the problem; Liberals are the problem. This Liberal made-in-Canada crime wave must stop. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547010">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to table the Conservative Party's dissenting report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547011">While there have been some benefits from some aspects of hybrid Parliament, we have undoubtedly witnessed first-hand a lot of shortcomings with it: ministers having an easier job deflecting accountability and an unacceptable burden being place on our interpreters, to name two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547012">It is important to bear in mind that our experience with hybrid Parliament was forged as a pandemic necessity, and we have only now started to experience it in the postpandemic context. That is why Conservatives believe the majority's report goes too far and too fast in recommending a permanent extension of a hybrid Parliament practically as it exists today. Conservatives have long believed that permanent changes to procedural arrangements ought to be the result of multi-party consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547013">In the interests of a consensus, Conservatives recommend that the renewal of hybrid proceedings be sunset one year into the next Parliament to allow us time to assess the ongoing implications. We also recommend other changes in the meantime to improve accountability and to reduce the burden on interpreters, such as reverting to entirely in-person chamber proceedings while maintaining the remote voting app and requiring ministers and senior officials to be physically present at committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547014">The committee's majority chose not to lay out any details to its vision or to suggest how the new standing orders would read. That has placed the ball in the government House leader's court to craft the way forward. A consensus is within reach. We challenge the government House leader to accept it and to turn his back on the divisive and confrontational approach he has preferred to take on the House's hybrid arrangements.</ParaText>

Russian armed forces have repeatedly engaged in violent, indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, including hospitals, schools, residential buildings and shelters. Starting in October, Russia intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy system to shut down the power grid and to cause a humanitarian disaster during the winter. In fact, it has launched more than 5,000 missiles at Ukraine since the beginning of this war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547032"> The PACE and NATO Parliamentary Assemblies have labelled Russia a terrorist regime. More so, the European Parliament has similarly declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. All members of the House unanimously recognized Russian aggression in Ukraine as an act of genocide. Now Canadians who have signed this petition are calling on the government to immediately designate the Russian Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</ParaText>

Millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been arbitrarily detained. Family members of Canadians have gone missing. Extrajudicial imprisonment, forced labour, torture, rape, killing, forced abortion and these kinds of things have happened to Falun Gong practitioners in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547056">The petitioners note the 2016 report by the late David Kilgour. They also note that the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Parliament have passed resolutions recognizing the terrible treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, they call on Canada to take every opportunity to call for the end of the persecution of Falun Gong and to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party's mass murder of innocent people for their organs is not allowed here in Canada.</ParaText>

Security and intelligence agencies are continuously monitoring entities that could pose such a threat and are taking appropriate action. The government cannot comment specifically on the activities of individual groups or what groups are being assessed or considered for listing.</ParaText>

Assessing entities for possible listing under the Criminal Code is continuous. The process is rigorous, thorough and involves interdepartmental consultations. Pursuant to subsection 83.05(1) of the Criminal Code, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that an entity “has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity” or “has knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with an entity” involved in a terrorist activity, then the Minister of Public Safety may recommend to the Governor in Council that it be added to the list.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547064">Mr. Speaker, insofar as Indigenous Services Canada, or ISC, is concerned, the response to part (a) is as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547065">The Mental Wellness program of ISC does not have targeted funding specific to recreational activities; as such, recreational activities are not part of the reporting requirement for Mental Wellness program funding recipients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547066">ISC’s Mental Wellness Program provides annual funding to support First Nations and Inuit access to mental wellness services to reduce risk factors, promote protective factors, and improve associated health outcomes. This includes mental wellness promotion; substance use prevention and treatment; life promotion and suicide prevention; crisis response services; harm reduction; and emotional and cultural support services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547067">ISC funds mental wellness services that include: a network of 45 treatment centres, as well as drug and alcohol prevention services in the majority of Indigenous communities across Canada, which began in 1975-76. Many treatment centres have reopened with reduced occupancy due to local public health measures. However, many centres are finding alternate ways of delivering services, including virtual approaches; a network of 71 Mental Wellness Teams began serving 359 First Nations and Inuit communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Atlantic, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon in 2013-14; access to mental health counselling, emotional, and cultural support services to former students of Indian Residential Schools began in 2007-08, and to former students of Federal Indian Day Schools began in 2020-21, and their families and those affected by the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls began in 2018-19. Services include access to cultural and emotional supports, professional counselling services – individual and family – and assistance with the cost of transportation services to access counselling services and/or cultural supports; the Hope for Wellness Help Line began in 2016-17 and offers immediate help to all Indigenous peoples across Canada. It is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to offer counselling and crisis intervention; access to harm reduction measures including naloxone, and funding wraparound services at 72 opioids agonist therapy sites began in 2017-18. Opioid Agonist Therapy involves taking opioid agonists such as methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone to prevent withdrawal and reduce cravings for opioids. Wraparound services work to address underlying or associated issues through counselling and traditional practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547068">With respect to part (b) of the question, funding for the Mental Wellness Program has increased from an approximate annual amount of $325 million in 2015-2016 to $580 million in 2021-22. An off-cycle amount of $107 million in 2021-22 to expand trauma-informed supports to all forms of trauma increases this investment to approximately $687 million in 2021-22. Funding is allocated to communities based on priorities and needs established through regional partnership structures and decision-making processes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547070">Mr. Speaker, Canada is working with allies around the world to develop secure critical minerals value chains. Collaboration with the United States on critical minerals has been driven by the Canada-U.S. joint action plan on critical minerals, finalized in January 2020 and renewed in 2021. Collaboration between Canada and the United States on mineral and metal supply chains extends beyond this given integrated supply chains. For example, in 2021 alone, there was over $94 billion U.S. in two-way minerals and metals trade between the two countries. It is in this context that the government shares information on Canada’s mining sector with allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547071">Canada has long been a trusted defence and security partner of the United States. Since its reactivation in 1985, the Defence Production Act, or DPA, Title III program recognizes this partnership, enables investments in Canadian projects and includes Canada as a domestic source for the purposes of the DPA Title III program. Information on company meetings that are being held with the DPA Title III program may involve sensitive commercial, scientific or technical information and represent potential contractual negotiations between third parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547072">The development of critical mineral projects and supply chains is a key priority for Canada. This is reflected through the announcement of $3.8 billion in budget 2022 to implement Canada’s first critical minerals strategy. For more information on Canada’s critical minerals projects, visit the interactive map on NRCan’s website at https://atlas.gc.ca/critical-minerals/en/. Released on December 9, Canada’s critical minerals strategy, which can be found at https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/canadian-critical-minerals-strategy.html, will advance the development of critical minerals value chains at home and abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547080">Mr. Speaker, with regard to the 2022-2023 departmental plan for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario, or FedNor, the response is as follows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547081">With respect to part (a) of the question, FedNor has not set a target for the indicator “percentage of companies engaged in collaborations with higher education institutions in Northern Ontario”. The regional development agencies, or RDAs, adopted a common Departmental Results Framework, or DRF, in 2018-19 and, as part of Innovation Science and Economic Development’s portfolio at the time, were directed to select indicators that aligned with the Innovation and Skills Plan. The RDAs continue to work with Statistics Canada to obtain the percentage of companies engaged in collaborations with higher education institutions in each RDA’s region. Statistics Canada has informed the RDAs that distribution by RDA is not available for this indicator and has provided the outcomes for the following geographies: Canada, Atlantic Region, Quebec, Ontario, and Rest of Canada. For 2017-19, the most recent years for which data is available, 14% of companies in Ontario engaged in collaborations with higher education institutions. FedNor has not set a target for this indicator, as the Agency has not been able to obtain historical data for the region. FedNor does not report on or use the result for all of Ontario given that the majority of companies and higher education institutions are located in southern Ontario, and it is not known if the data for Northern Ontario is in line with the province’s result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547082">With respect to part (b) of the question, FedNor has not set a target for indicator “Dollar value of exports of clean technologies from Northern Ontario” because baseline data from Statistics Canada is not currently available. This indicator is part of the common RDA DRF structure implemented in 2018-19. The RDAs, particularly FedNor and Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, or FedDev, continue to work with Statistics Canada to obtain this data at the sub-provincial level. This indicator tracks the Innovation and Skills Plan Charter commitment to double Canada’s exports of clean tech by 2025, and supports commitments to the growth of Clean tech market share as a percentage of global exports in the Clean Growth and Climate Change Charter. Clean technology export value is based on customs data using specific Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, or HS, codes and weights associated with clean tech. This value will be provided directly from Statistics Canada through its Clean Technology Satellite Account when it is released publicly. Clean tech is understood as any process, product or service that reduces environmental impacts through environmental protection activities; the sustainable use of natural resources; the use of goods that have been specifically modified or adapted to be significantly less energy or resource intensive than the industry standard. In future, data will be developed and provided through Statistics Canada Clean Technology Satellite Account through customs data requests. Data is not currently available for Northern Ontario. FedNor will work with Statistics Canada to obtain the necessary data.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547098">Mr. Speaker, the 2021-22 Public Accounts include a net profit of $2.8 billion for the Bank of Canada. This amount is reflected in the line “Other Revenues – Enterprise Crown corporations and other government business enterprises” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Deficit on page 57 of Volume I of the Public Accounts of Canada 2022, and includes the $1-billion constructive loss on the Bank’s 2021-22 purchases of Government of Canada bonds discussed on page 16 of Volume I.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547099">Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem stated at the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance on November 23rd, 2022, that: “After a period of above-average income, our net interest income is now turning negative. Following a period of losses, the Bank of Canada will return to positive net earnings. The size and duration of the losses will ultimately depend on a number of factors, which include, in particular, the path for interest rates, the evolution of the economy and the balance sheet. The losses do not affect our ability to conduct monetary policy. I would also stress that our policy decisions are driven by our price and financial stability mandates. We don't make policy to maximize our income. […] I want to stress that whatever solution is chosen, it's not going to affect how we run monetary policy. As a central bank, we are a going concern. We have liquidity. We will continue to run monetary policy guided by our mandate. We do not run monetary policy to maximize our income. Low inflation is a public good. We run monetary policy to deliver low, stable inflation.”</ParaText>

This isn't a problem that's unique to the Bank of Canada. All of our peer central banks in G7 countries are experiencing the same thing.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547107">Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a) of the question, through its existing COVID-19 advance purchase agreements (APAs), Canada has access to up to 93.5 million mRNA doses in 2023. This includes 30 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Comirnaty® vaccine and 18.5 million doses of Moderna’s Spikevax® vaccine with options to access up to an additional 45 million mRNA doses, should urgent or emergent needs arise. Canada’s APAs provide flexibility to obtain the latest formulations from suppliers, including bivalent, infant and pediatric vaccines. In addition, Canada has access to a number of non-mRNA doses. Together, these doses will ensure the COVID-19 vaccine needs of all Canadians will continue to be met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547108">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the Government of Canada is working in close collaboration with provinces and territories to better understand their 2023 vaccine supply needs. The government is also actively working with suppliers to manage supply and schedule deliveries to ensure the most optimal product availability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547109">With respect to part (b)(i) of the question, immunization is a shared responsibility among federal, provincial and territorial governments. The provinces and territories administer vaccines within their jurisdictions, which includes all policy and program decision-making, design and implementation required to determine which public programs to offer, which vaccines to buy, where to administer vaccines, and priority populations and eligibility criteria for vaccination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547110">The Public Health Agency of Canada supports provinces and territories in delivering their immunization programs in many ways, including: bulk purchasing vaccines for all jurisdictions; conducting vaccine confidence research, policy, and programming; managing vaccine coverage, effectiveness and safety surveillance; facilitating immunization research; enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity; and supporting the delivery of the Vaccine Injury Support Program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547111">As of December 8, 2022, 94,981,582 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Canada (since December 14, 2020).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547112">With respect to part (b)(ii) of the question, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of a global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and supports efforts to promote global access to vaccines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547113">In 2023, Canada will continue to work closely with its key partners to identify doses surplus to Canada’s domestic needs and ensure these doses are made available for donation. This involves actively coordinating with provinces and territories to manage domestic vaccine supply, forecast demand, and track product shelf-life. This also includes working closely with Global Affairs Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada, or PSPC, to ensure that surplus doses held in federal, provincial and manufacturer inventories can be offered for international donation in a timely manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547114">Lastly, with respect to part (b)(iii) of the question, as vaccination campaigns are ongoing, Canada is unable to determine at this time how many vaccines will be disposed in 2023 due to expiration. We continue to work with provinces, territories and federal partners on demand planning and forecasting, based on evolving scientific evidence and the National Advisory Committee on Immunizations’ recommendations, to determine supply requirements for future campaigns. Additionally, we are working closely with PSPC and vaccine suppliers to ensure that delivery schedules meet the needs of Canadians and to monitor vaccine shelf-life/expiry date extensions to maximize the use of doses delivered in Canada. The Government of Canada continues to urge Canadians to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines.</ParaText>

The Department conducts this analysis using a wide variety of analytical modelling techniques reflecting international best practices and current academic standards. However, all economic models are subject to uncertainty and generating precise estimates of the effects of specific policies poses considerable challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547117">In processing Parliamentary Returns, the Department of Finance applies the Privacy Act and the principles set out in the Access to Information Act.

              <ParaText id="7547119">Mr. Speaker, the spectrum licence deployment requirements of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, or ISED, are based on the provision of wireless services to a percentage of the population in a given service area, known as tiers, at specific times throughout the term of the licence. These graduated deployment requirements facilitate timely deployment of services across the country and include a number of milestones that must be reached during the licence term to remain compliant with the licence conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547120">Deployment requirements are established by ISED following public consultation and take input from stakeholders into account as the Department pursues its objective of maximizing the economic and social benefits of this valuable and finite public resource. Deployment milestones are set up to allow licensees the opportunity to plan and deploy their network. Licensees may put the spectrum to use as the primary licensee or through alternative arrangements such as subordinate licensing and the transferring or subdivision of licences to secondary providers. This use by secondary providers is encouraged by ISED as it promotes the deployment of services to rural areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547121">When a milestone is reached, ISED verifies that the deployment requirement has been met according to the deployment schedule. ISED’s approximately 15,000 spectrum licences are currently 100 percent compliant with their respective deployment conditions. If a licensee is not compliant with its deployment conditions, ISED may invoke various compliance and enforcement measures. These measures may include warnings, administrative monetary penalties, legal action, licence amendments, suspensions, or other measures. However, in non-compliance cases, ISED first works with licensees to attain compliance to ensure that Canadians do not lose access to existing services that the licensee may have deployed. In the very rare instance that a licensee cannot be brought into compliance, ISED may determine that the most appropriate course of action is to not renew or even revoke the licence. Since 2015, ISED did not renew 69 licences and revoked 3 others for non-compliance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547133">For example, I will lead roundtables and bilateral meetings with community and industry representatives, and  there will be funding announcements and site visits to businesses and organizations that are leading FedDev Ontario funded projects. These engagements provide deeper insight into regional priorities and community-driven initiatives, allow for the development and strengthening of partnerships at the local level, and enhance awareness and access to Agency programs and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547134">There are executive and staff-led bilateral engagements with clients and prospective clients to promote Agency programs and services to identify and catalyze opportunities for investment; provide feedback on proposals; notify applicants of funding decisions; monitor funded projects and conduct site visits; and serve as a single point of contact for clients allowing for consistent support across projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547135">Businesses and organizations that are interested in learning more about Agency and federal programs also have access to executive and staff-led technical briefings to promote FedDev Ontario programming and help ensure all eligible organizations are aware of the program parameters and how to apply. For example, the Agency provided five technical briefings over the month of November 2022, to walk over 400 participants through the Tourism Relief Fund and answer questions they had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547136">There is also FedDev Ontario’s contact centre and Small Business Services team. These engagements by phone, email, or in person help entrepreneurs to better understand, and improve access to the Agency’s programming and government programming more broadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547137">Additional pathfinding and convening services to a wide range of federal and provincial resources and partnerships are provided across the region. This includes referrals under the Canada’s Accelerated Growth Strategy, Global Skills Strategy, and Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) policy, among other programs and initiatives. With respect to ITB, Agency officials engage with defence contractors at conferences, bilateral meetings and site visits, with the ultimate goal of showcasing industrial, innovative and research capabilities of southern Ontario and facilitating connections with local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547138">There are executive and staff-led bilateral engagements with community and industry leaders, including those with whom the Agency does not have a funding relationship, to gather intelligence on economic growth opportunities and challenges across the region, as well as insight into the strategies and initiatives of different communities and industries. These engagements provide valuable feedback and insights that can inform Agency and federal policies and programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547139">There are executive and staff-led bilateral engagements with provincial and municipal officials to foster a culture of continued information sharing and collaboration on economic growth in southern Ontario. These engagements support alignment on strategic policy and program files, inform project development, identify areas for co-investments, and enhance services to businesses and entrepreneurs through more coordinated, informed pathfinding services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547140">There are executive-led roundtables to gather on-the-ground intelligence from a broad cross-section of stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities facing a particular industry or community. These roundtables can provide direct feedback on program efficacy, as well facilitate information-sharing and collaboration amongst participants. For example, in spring 2019, FedDev Ontario executives led a series of 20 roundtable events in urban and rural communities across southern Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547141">Executives and staff attend events to help promote the work of the Agency by participating on panels, delivering remarks, and networking at conferences. These engagements provide opportunities to develop new partnerships, as well as gather intelligence on issues, trends and promising initiatives across the region that can inform policy/program development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547142">Beyond publicly available information and the high level information provided, FedDev Ontario concluded that producing and validating a comprehensive response to this question would require a manual collection of information that is not possible in the time allotted and could lead to the disclosure of incomplete and misleading information – particularly given the high volume and complexity of engagement by the Agency, as described above.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547152">With respect to part (a) of the question ISC continues to support the Okanagan Indian Band with the Addition to Reserve of the former Canadian National Rail corridor lands bisecting Duck Lake Indian Reserve No. 7. Canadian National Rail is currently the registered owner of the lands in fee simple and Canada has previously provided Canadian National Rail with a draft Agreement of Purchase and Sale to support the transfer of lands to Canada for the use and benefit of the band. Negotiations around the Purchase and Sale Agreement are ongoing between Canadian National Rail, Okanagan Indian Band and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547153">With respect to part (b)(i) of the question, since the parties are in confidential negotiations on terms of land instruments such as permits under the Indian Act, it is not appropriate for the department to comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547154">With respect to part (b)(ii) of the question, Okanagan Indian Band continues to work to resolve third-party interests including property rights required by telecommunications providers, electrical transmission and distribution services, sewer utility interests, and access agreements for on-reserve developments. Okanagan Indian Band has taken the lead on these negotiations and has the support of legal and technical experts working to satisfy Additions to Reserve requirements. Canada has offered to support the Band with their negotiations and has assisted with providing template documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547155">With respect to part (c) of the question, there have been no meetings or briefings on this project with the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations or the Minister of ISC since November 1, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547156">With respect to part (d) of the question, the last communication between ISC and Okanagan Indian Band regarding the Addition to Reserve was sent on November 15, 2022. The email communication was regarding the City of Kelowna replacement sewer permit which is currently being reviewed by respective legal counsels of City of Kelowna, Canada and Okanagan Indian Band as a requirement of the Additions to Reserve process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547157">With respect to part (e) of the question, it is difficult to estimate timelines for completion as completion of the Addition to Reserve is subject to the readiness and willingness of third-party interest holders to terminate or negotiate and execute federal replacement interests with Okanagan Indian Band. This is an ISC British Columbia Region priority file and the department continues to work in collaboration with Okanagan Indian Band to complete the Additions to Reserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547163">Mr. Speaker, the 2022 Fall Economic Statement proposes to automatically issue advance payments of the Canada Workers Benefit, or CWB, to people who qualified for the benefit in the previous year, starting in July 2023 for the 2023 taxation year. These advance payments would represent a new minimum entitlement to the program for a year based on their income in the previous year. Changes to individuals’ incomes in the year relative to the previous year would not affect their entitlement to advance payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547164">Some individuals would be entitled to more support with the implementation of this minimum entitlement than they would without it. This could include cases that are due to couple formation, such as marrying someone with a higher income, for example. This may also include individuals who received minor pay increases during the year, potentially from moving into a marginally more senior role in their workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547165">Eligibility to receive advance payments during the course of a year would cease in cases where an individual is incarcerated for a period of 90 days or more; moves out of the country; or dies before the start of the benefit year. Individuals are encouraged to notify the Canada Revenue Agency promptly where any of these changes in circumstance occurs to ensure that payments cease, and it is anticipated that overpayments due to payments made after one of these changes in circumstance would be rare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547166">If an individual were to receive advance payments that exceed the advance payments to which they are legally entitled, either due to one of the changes in circumstance noted above not being reported on a timely basis or due to a reassessment of their tax return for the previous year, any resulting overpayment would be recovered in the same manner as for other benefits based on prior-year income, such as the GST Credit. In particular, the Canada Revenue Agency may keep all or a portion of any future payments due to the individual until the amount is repaid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547167">Overall disbursements of the Canada Workers Benefit to low- and middle-income Canadians will exceed $4 billion in 2023-24. These incremental entitlements are estimated to cost $750 million for the 2023-24 fiscal year. In a typical year, the Canada Workers Benefit supports over 3 million Canadians. Given the changes in employment that Canadians face – whether it is a change in the number of hours worked or in the role in which they are working – the advance payments would support up to 1.2 million additional individuals in a year. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547181">As per the Treasury Board Directive on the Management of Real Property, a property identified for disposal is circulated through a formal process, granting priority to stakeholders to determine if they have interest in acquisition. During the circulation process, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) expressed interest in these units on behalf of local Indigenous groups, including the Liidlii Kue First Nation. PSPC is continuing to provide support to CIRNAC as it determines next steps for the release of the properties.  Planning for the future of these assets, in collaboration with stakeholders, is ongoing and therefore Public Services and Procurement Canada is unable to respond to parts (b), (c) and (d) of the question.</ParaText>

In addition, the latest available data on poverty is for the 2020 calendar year.

              <ParaText id="7547188">Canada’s northern, remote and isolated communities face unique housing needs because of the challenges presented by geography, climate change, infrastructure and remoteness. Partners of the Arctic and northern policy framework identified the need to address housing in the north as part of the goal of supporting resilient and healthy northern and indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547189">In response to these challenges, the Government of Canada, through budget 2022, is providing $150 million over two years, starting in 2022-23, to support affordable housing and related infrastructure in the north, of which $60 million will be provided to the Government of Nunavut; $60 million to the Government of the Northwest Territories; and $30 million to the Government of Yukon. Of this funding, recipients must use a minimum of 60% for housing, and the remaining amount for housing-related infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547190">The first $75 million of budget 2022 funding, with $30 million for Nunavut, $30 million for the Northwest Territories and $15 million for the Yukon government, has been allocated to recipients, and the remaining $75 million in funding is to be allocated in fiscal year 2023-24. The funding provided through budget 2022 to territorial governments is through a flexible grant, allowing for the territorial governments to advance their most pressing housing and infrastructure needs immediately. Through this budget 2022 investment and ongoing partnerships with Canada’s territorial governments, the Government of Canada is empowering its territorial partners to ensure that all northerners, both indigenous and non-indigenous, have access to sustainable and safe housing and is supporting the health and welfare of northerners using made-in-the-north solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547191">A large percentage of northerners live in social public housing, and it is the territorial governments, through their respective housing corporations, that are responsible for overseeing and maintaining the social housing stock. This budget 2022 funding allows for Canada’s territorial governments to continue to support housing and infrastructure projects in their respective territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547192">The funding allocated to these territorial initiatives is determined on a priority basis based on need, as determined by the territorial governments’ housing corporations. This budget 2022 funding is provided via grant, and as such, there are no reporting mechanisms associated with the granting mechanism. This approach of using grant funding is consistent with the principles of self-determination, where it is the recipients of this funding who are best positioned to determine how it should be used.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547226">Mr. Speaker, with respect to the question above, what follows is the response from the CRA as of December 6, 2022. Regarding Canada emergency response benefit payments, please note the following.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547227">The CRA blocked any federally incarcerated individuals from applying at the time of launch, which was April 6, 2020. The CRA is notified of federal incarcerations by Correctional Service Canada. Since this information is only provided on a periodic basis, timing can be a factor with respect to when the block is placed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547228">With respect to provincial incarceration, this segment of the population may have been eligible due to various provincial programs that allow for weekend-only incarceration, in order to allow for continued participation in the workplace, and day programs for inmates. The CRA is not notified of these incarcerations. However, individuals who had a mailing address located at a provincial institution were blocked beginning on May 11, 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547229">With regard to parts (a), (b) and (c), the CRA has identified recipients whose federal incarceration dates cover the entire benefit periods. As part of the CRA's ongoing post-payment verifications, which began in January 2022 and are ongoing, these individuals will be contacted to validate their eligibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547230">Following a CRA manual review to verify an application for COVID-19 individual benefits, if an applicant is determined to be ineligible, they will receive a decision letter informing them that they were not eligible for benefit payments received, with the reason for the ineligibility, and that they will need to repay ineligible amounts. The decision letter also provides recourse options if the individual disagrees with the CRA’s decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547231">Following a decision letter, the applicant will receive a notice of redetermination. Notices of redetermination inform applicants of debts or credits that have been established on their CRA accounts related to COVID-19 individual benefits. Once these debts have been established, only then may collection activities begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547232">For these reasons, the CRA is unable to respond in the manner requested. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547235">With regard to part (a)(ii), Lacolle Route 223 has returned to its prepandemic operating hours. Prepandemic, Clarenceville border crossing operated from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. This port of entry has since returned to operating from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547236">With regard to part (b), in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CBSA temporarily reduced service hours at certain Canadian border crossings, including the ports of entry at Chartierville, Frelighsburg, Hemmingford, Highwater, Lacolle Route 221, Lacolle Route 223, Stanstead Route 143, Morses Line and Trout River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547237">The CBSA is taking a phased and measured approach to restoring border operations. The key consideration was to ensure the CBSA was positioned to deal with a return of volumes at major ports of entry as COVID measures were incrementally lifted, including in the land environment. The CBSA has restored services to pre-COVID levels in the air and maritime environments and is currently preparing for the highway land environment as the final area to adjust.</ParaText>

The project is being undertaken with consideration of the community and seeks to maintain broad social acceptability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547243">Canadian Pacific, with the support of Transport Canada, is currently completing the application to the Canadian Transportation Agency to secure regulatory approval. Concurrently, Transport Canada is working with Public Services and Procurement Canada to complete the land acquisition required for the project. Finally, Transport Canada and Canadian Pacific are currently negotiating the construction contribution agreement for the project. These steps must be completed before construction of the rail bypass can commence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547244">Prior to construction, Canadian Pacific will launch a request for proposals, which will be undertaken for four months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547245">Once regulatory approvals have been secured and all necessary lands acquired and transferred to Canadian Pacific, construction will begin and is anticipated to take approximately 36 months to complete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547246">Following the commissioning of the bypass, the existing track will be dismantled, which is expected to take 12-18 months.</ParaText>

However, VAC is aware that some veterans have died as a result of using the legislated process for MAID since the practice became legal on June 17, 2016. This remains a conversation between a veteran and their primary care provider. VAC cannot determine, definitively, how many veterans have used MAID.

This includes but is not limited to amounts subject to negotiation, like contracts or litigation, as well as anticipated pressures that were expected to materialize in the near term, when developing the fall economic statement 2022, such as funding for the Indo-Pacific strategy and the national adaptation strategy, and biodiversity funding announced during COP15.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547274">The $14.2-billion figure that the Parliamentary Budget Officer is referring to is the sum of two items in the 2022 fall economic statement, which can be found at https://www.budget.canada.ca/fes-eea/2022/report-rapport/FES-EEA-2022-en.pdf. An $8.5-billion provision, over six years, for anticipated near-term pressures is shown on page 17 of the statement, and the total net fiscal impact of non-announced measures, which is $5.7 billion over six years, is reported on page 66 of the statement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547278">Mr. Speaker, customs duties and taxes are assessed based on the time of importation of goods, as opposed to the date of when they are purchased. The government does not have information on when purchase orders were made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547279">Since the general tariff of 35% took effect on virtually all goods imported from Russia on March 2, 2022, fertilizer importations with a value for duty of $95.8 million resulted in a total value of customs duties collected of $33.5 million. There have been no commercial importations of fertilizer from Russia into Canada since May 2022.</ParaText>

This includes drug treatment and harm reduction services, procurement of prescription drugs, and drug plan formularies. Provinces and territories are best placed to plan and deliver safer supply services that are responsive to the needs of their populations. As of December 2022, Health Canada has supported 28 safer supply pilot projects across Canada through the substance use and addictions program, SUAP, representing total funding commitments of over $77 million. Our government is supporting them as a partner in the delivery of such services and is constantly engaging with them to see how it can better assist them. That is why a national safer supply program led by the federal government is not being developed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547300">With regard to part (i), since January 1, 2018, only one linkage rate study has been undertaken in 2022 by Statistics Canada since there was only one census during this period, the 2021 census. This study linked individual tax data for the 2020 tax year to 2021 census data. The first results of this study were provided to the CRA by Statistics Canada in October 2022. The initial review is focused on indigenous peoples’ participation in Canada’s tax and benefit system. The focus of the linkage rate study is being expanded to include linked data from other population segments that comprise vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547301">With regard to part (ii), the methodology is as follows. Statistics Canada links census data to individual tax data for the population aged 15 and over, using social insurance number and census subdivision to determine participation in the tax and benefit system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547302">Only people in both databases are linked. The Canadian population who participated in the tax system are those who were enumerated in the 2021 census and completed the T1 income tax form in 2020, and non-filers are identified as those who received a T4 form or other tax slips but did not complete their T1 income tax form in 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547303">The results for participation in benefits are expected by spring 2023. This methodology for participation in the Canada child benefit, or the CCB, is based on the percentage of families who received CCB benefits out of the total number of families with children under the age of 18 and who meet the other eligibility requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547304">With regard to part (iii), for the participation in the tax system, the population linked who participated in the tax system is defined as persons aged 15 and over in the 2021 census and who filed a T1 form in 2020. The total population of T1 filers was 25,776,480 people. Of them, 869,755 people were indigenous, with 179,970 people from the indigenous population living on reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547305">The total population linked is persons aged 15 and over in the 2021 census linked to CRA datasets, for example, T4, T5007 or T2202. The total population of linked individuals was 28,877,725 people. Of them, 1,055,695 people were indigenous, with 235,280 people from tht indigenous population living on reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547306">With regard to part (iv), the study will provide the participation rate in the tax system for indigenous peoples at the national, provincial, city and reserve level compared to non-indigenous; the CCB take-up rate for indigenous peoples at the national, provincial, city and reserve level compared to non-indigenous peoples; and the participation rate by indigenous group, that is, first nations, Métis and Inuit, and other important demographic variables such as age and income group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547307">With regard to part (v), the findings are as follows. First results show a participation gap in the tax system between the non-indigenous and indigenous population at the national and provincial level. The participation rate at the national level in the tax system was estimated at 89.3% for all Canadians, 82.4% for indigenous peoples and 76.5% on reserves. The first results for CCB benefit take-up are expected in spring 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547308">With regard to part (vi), the study was conducted by Statistics Canada on behalf of the CRA.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547319">Mr. Speaker, with regard to the Canada Infrastructure Bank, or CIB, and part (a) of the question, the CIB incurred costs in the amount of $875,332.62 in professional fees to conduct due diligence on the Lake Erie connector project. These costs are comprised of legal expenses and technical advisory expenses. Total due diligence costs incurred represent less than 0.1% of the CIB’s previously announced investment commitment in the Lake Erie connector project and are aligned with reasonable costs and expenses incurred by other private sector and institutional investors to support technical and legal due diligence activities related to financial transactions in infrastructure projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547320">With respect to part (b), commercial negotiations relating to the Lake Erie connector project have been suspended at this time. The CIB did not conclude a definitive project agreement with ITC Holding Corporation, the project proponent of the Lake Erie connector project, for the project to reach the financial close milestone, and no CIB financing has been provided in respect of the project. The CIB had previously announced an investment commitment in the amount of up to $650 million to the Lake Erie connector project. The CIB makes investment commitments to support proponents advancing their projects toward a final investment decision and to secure additional financing to enable the project to achieve financial close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547321">With respect to part (c), as reported in Fortis Inc.’s press release regarding its second-quarter earnings dated July 28, 2022, ITC Holding Corporation suspended development activities and commercial negotiations due to recent macroeconomic conditions that have impacted the proponent’s ability to secure a viable transmission service agreement within the required timeline. As such, the CIB has removed this project from its total of CIB investment commitments, given that the conditions that are required for an investment commitment are not presently being met. The CIB remains committed to the project’s positive outcomes in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the reliability and security of Ontario’s electricity grid. The CIB remains available to the project proponent as necessary to continue discussions should project development activities resume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547322">With respect to part (d), representatives from ITC Holding Corporation notified the CIB after the close of business on Wednesday, July 27, 2022, that a press release would be issued the next day to provide an update on the Lake Erie connector project and inform market participants that ITC Holding Corporation suspended all project development activities and commercial negotiations on the project due to recent macroeconomic conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547323">With respect to part (e), a press release announcing the Lake Erie connector project’s suspension was issued on July 28, 2022. The CIB communicated this information to Infrastructure Canada officials in August as part of the CIB’s regular engagement with Infrastructure Canada officials to provide an update on the CIB’s results and information included in the CIB’s quarterly financial reporting. The CIB’s quarterly financial report for Q1 fiscal 2022-23, which was published on the CIB’s website on August 29, 2022, includes subsequent events note disclosure regarding the announcement of the suspension of the Lake Erie connector project in late July 2022.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547325">Mr. Speaker, the following is with regard to the Canada Infrastructure Bank, or CIB, and the five-year review of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547326">With respect to part (a), the first legislative review of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act, or CIB Act, was started in June 2022 and is being led by Infrastructure Canada. The review will culminate in a report tabled in Parliament by the designated minister in June 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547327">With respect to part (b), as per the legislation, the legislative review will examine the provisions and operations of the CIB Act and is an opportunity to recognize the progress made to date and the evolution of the bank over the last five years. The review will look to assess whether the policy premises and context that underpinned the creation of the CIB are still sound and pertinent, whether the CIB’s legislated mandate and authorities to support its operations remain relevant in the context of the evolving policy and infrastructure landscape and whether any changes or clarifications are warranted to position the CIB for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547328">Additional records requested would be subject to the provisions of the Access to Information Act, namely subsection 21(1) on advice, recommendations, deliberations and/or plans; subsection 20(1) on third party information; and potentially section 69 on cabinet confidences. This is because the legislative review is in process and includes developing advice and recommendations for the designated minister and could contain confidences of the King’s Privy Council for Canada that are not releasable at this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547329">With respect to part (c), Infrastructure Canada officials are conducting targeted engagement with key stakeholders to inform the review. These include provincial, territorial, municipal and indigenous partners; key market participants; and other relevant organizations. As per the act, a report on the findings of the review must be tabled by the designated minister before each House of Parliament in June 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547330">With respect to part (d), the government’s response to the third report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities was tabled on September 15, 2022. The government disagreed with the committee’s recommendation to abolish the CIB. The response can be found on the House of Commons website. The government response highlights the progress made by the Canada Infrastructure Bank to date in getting more infrastructure financed and built for Canadians, and notes its importance as a key tool in the government’s tool kit to close Canada’s infrastructure gap and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547333">Global Affairs Canada tracks and publishes predefined service standards annually for the delivery of grants and contributions, precisely for funding under the international development assistance program. This can be found at https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/funding-financement/service_standards_pilot_project-projet_pilote_normes_service.aspx?lang=eng. The service standard is to inform applicants of funding decisions within 10 business days. This service standard represents the time the department takes to communicate a funding decision to successful applicants following an approval. For fiscal year 2021-22, the department reached an 87% compliance rate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547335">Mr. Speaker, with regard to the government’s remote work policy, as it relates to the data requested, the information is not systematically tracked in a centralized database.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547336">It should be noted that the federal public service is adopting a common hybrid work model that will see employees work on site at least two to three days each week, or 40% to 60% of their regular schedule. This new model will apply to all of the core public administration, and it is strongly recommended that separate agencies adopt a similar strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547337">While many public servants are already working on site at least two to three days a week, this new approach will represent a change for others. To allow departments and employees to smoothly transition to a common hybrid model, a phased introduction will begin on January 16, 2023, with full implementation by March 31, 2023.</ParaText>

However, this comes at a time when a number of Conservative premiers are putting forward plans to privatize our health care system with for-profit private health care investments, which is deeply troubling given that the outcome would be less care, higher costs and a worsening of the current crisis. If we do not make decisions this year, the current crisis will determine not just the following years but the following decade of care that Canadians receive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547606">Since the government took office, we know that violent crime has increased by 32%. In the last 10 days, there have been reports daily of violence on the TTC, including random stabbings and shootings. Premiers, police unions and chiefs across the country have called for bail reform to put an end to repeat offenders who threaten the public safety of our country's largest city with impunity. That is a direct result of the federal government's catch-and-release version of public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547607">Millions of people use transit daily in Toronto, and over 10,000 people are employed by the TTC. All of them have no choice but to use public transit, and it is at their own risk. Every Canadian has the right to safe streets, safe neighbourhoods and safe communities, and it is our job as leaders and parliamentarians to provide them with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547608">With that, I believe an emergency debate is necessary to provide justice to the victims of these attacks and to ensure that every Canadian feels safe to go out in public and ride public transit.

              <ParaText id="7547612">Today, I would like to raise a point of order regarding an amendment to Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21, an act to amend certain acts and to make certain consequential amendments (firearms)</Document>. As stated on page 770 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, “An amendment to a bill that was referred to a committee <I>after</I> second reading is out of order if it is beyond the scope and principle of the bill.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547613">The amendment in question, G-4, would amend clause 1 of Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>, and the New Democrats have been clear in expressing our opposition to this amendment. The amendment seems to target those who use guns for hunting, for protecting farm animals from predators and for supporting safety in the backcountry. What is more, we have all heard from indigenous people that the amendments would not respect treaty rights nor the duty to consult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547614">Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> was originally intended to limit the number of handguns on our streets. Before the amendment was introduced, there was every reason to believe that Bill C-21 was on track to passing through this House before Christmas, but instead, the amendment was introduced at the eleventh hour with no ability to question witnesses about its impacts. It is a more than 200-page amendment to what was originally a 44-page bill. In our view, that constitutes an abuse of process. We are not asking the Speaker to judge the merits of the amendment. Instead, we are bringing forward a very important procedural point.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547615">We believe, contrary to the committee's findings, that this amendment seeks to expand the scope of the bill as established at second reading since it addresses a new idea that was not considered at second reading.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547616">The amendment is out of scope because the original Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> was meant to implement a handgun freeze. This amendment would drastically expand the definition of “prohibited firearm” in the Criminal Code to cover all sorts of long guns, including those commonly used for hunting and farming and by indigenous communities. This House never had a chance to debate this measure at second reading.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547617">When the amendment was moved on November 22, 2022, the committee chair deemed that it was not beyond the scope of the bill. This decision was appealed, and the committee voted in favour of the committee chair's decision.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547618">However, as we saw in the very clear Speaker's ruling on November 16, 2022, regarding amendments to Bill <Document DbId="11527631" Type="4">C-228</Document>, the ultimate decision on the scope of a bill rests with the House itself: “The Chair would like to remind members that the scope of a bill is not determined by its sponsor, by the government or even by the committee considering it, but by the House itself when it adopts the bill at second reading.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547619">In this situation, the committee adopted amendments that the Chair ultimately struck from the bill during consideration at report stage, because you, Mr. Speaker, ruled that the amendments were beyond the scope of Bill <Document DbId="11527631" Type="4">C‑228</Document> as passed by the House at second reading. Although we realize that the Speaker usually does not rule on a matter that is still being debated in committee, we believe that in this particular situation your opinion is necessary and important.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7547620">The committee has been stuck for weeks debating this amendment, which is, in our opinion, out of the scope of the bill. It is possible that you would rule the amendment out of order at report stage, which would make the hours of debate at committee completely unnecessary. It would be in the interest of all parliamentarians to avoid the waste of time and energy spent debating an amendment that would ultimately be removed from the bill.</ParaText>

Only because of the use of the strategy that the first-past-the-post system would eventually deliver a majority government with a minority of votes, did we see the loss of those things that could have provided child care back in 2005.</ParaText>

As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, it gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in support of this proposed legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547650">Simply put, affordable and inclusive child care is good for parents, good for children, good for women, good for families and good for the economy. It would reinforce the federal government’s long-term commitment to families from coast to coast to coast. We are working to build a system that will remain in place long into the future, so generations of children in Canada can get the best possible start in life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547651">Affordable child care is yet another way our government is demonstrating that we are here to support Canadians. We understand how hard life is for Canadians now and has been through the pandemic. That is why we have put forward significant benefits to help Canadians beyond affordable child care. Whether it is through the Canada child benefit, the Canada dental benefit, the doubling of the GST tax credit, the Canada housing benefit or an increase to the Canada workers benefit, we are there for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547652">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is to enshrine the principles of a Canada-wide child care system into law. It is a system that will ensure families in Canada have access to high-quality, affordable and inclusive early learning and child care, and it is critical in supporting the goals of the early learning and child care agreements between the Government of Canada and provincial and territorial Governments that have been signed from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>

In addition to the principles set out in the co-developed indigenous early learning and child care framework, it would continue to guide federal action with respect to early learning and child care programs and services for indigenous children, regardless of where they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547654">I would like to focus for a moment on the development of the indigenous early learning and child care framework, which was first introduced in 2018, after being co-developed through an extensive nationwide engagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547655">We know that culturally appropriate early learning and child care, designed by and with indigenous peoples, gives indigenous children the best start in life. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> has worked closely with us to ensure that those principles remain in place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547656">The indigenous early learning and child care framework, and the collaborative work to implement it over time, responds to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s call to action number 12, which calls for all levels of government to work together “to develop culturally appropriate early childhood education programs for [indigenous] families.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547657">Guided by the indigenous early learning and child care framework, we made it clear that this legislation will respect and uphold indigenous rights, including treaty rights and the right to self-determination, as well as the Government of Canada’s commitment to reconciliation. The goal is to support indigenous nations, communities, organizations and governments in meeting the unique needs of their communities, families and children now, and seven generations forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547658">We are investing an additional $2.5 billion over five years and $542 million annually ongoing in federal funding to get this work done. This funding will increase access to high-quality, culturally appropriate ELCC programs and services for indigenous children through indigenous-led governance. Indigenous governments are also working alongside provinces and territories to ensure ELCC is comprehensive and coordinated so all children are benefiting, regardless of where they live. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547659">Since 2019, a total of 32 quality-improvement projects have been funded. These will continue to advance the implementation of the indigenous ELCC framework through best practices and innovation. These improvements will strengthen indigenous-centred knowledge and expertise to support all partners working toward a strong, culturally appropriate system of early learning and child care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547660">We have said many times that high-quality, affordable, and inclusive child care is not a luxury for families. It is a necessity. All caregivers should have the opportunity to build both a family and a career, and all children should have the best possible start in life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547661">As I mentioned previously, this legislation would not impose any conditions or requirements on provincial and territorial governments, or indigenous peoples. </ParaText>

However, the federal government has a role to play in setting federal principles and supporting provinces, territories and indigenous peoples in their efforts to establish and maintain a Canada-wide system. Indigenous peoples will benefit from a federal commitment to sustained and ongoing funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547663">As a government, we will invest up to $30 billion over five years to make early learning and child care affordable, accessible and nationwide. Combined with previous investments announced since 2015, a minimum of $9.2 billion per year ongoing will be invested in child care, including indigenous early learning and child care, starting in 2025-26.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547664">Thanks to these investment, fees for regulated child care have been reduced in every jurisdiction in Canada. Quebec and Yukon were already providing regulated child care for $10 a day or less before our Canada-wide investments. In December 2022, Nunavut joined them by being the first jurisdiction to lower fees for regulated child care to $10 a day under the Canada-wide system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547665">By 2025-26, the average fee for all regulated spaces across Canada will be $10 a day, and that is great news for families. Child care fees in Newfoundland and Labrador have already been reduced to $15 a day, down from $25 a day in 2021. These are not just numbers. These are families saving hundreds of dollars each month across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547666">Regardless of political stripe, governments across Canada believe in giving all children in Canada the best possible start in life, and that we can agree on. The relief this offers parents and caregivers of young children cannot be overstated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547667">I will conclude by offering some outside assessments of nation-wide ELCC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547668">Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said, “Women feel more confident going back into the workforce because they won’t be spending their whole paycheque on child care”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547669">Martha Friendly, a board member at Child Care Now, said, “Some women had to stay home because either they couldn’t find a space or they couldn’t afford it. Now, people are getting child care at 50 per cent reduced fees on average and that means [they] can go back to work.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547670">The Financial Post, on December 5, noted that our child care policy has been a success. It said, “government policy has played a role in getting women back in the workforce...especially when it comes to child care.” Again, St-Arnaud said, “Women feel more confident going back into the workforce because they won't be spending their whole paycheque on child care”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547687">Making the Canada-wide early learning and child care system a reality is a momentous accomplishment. Too many families, for too long, have lacked access to affordable, high-quality and inclusive early learning and child care. Child care is a necessity and there is no question that it helps children in the long term. Early childhood educators set children up for success. They educate and build confidence in children, setting them on a path to success in school and life. This helps families thrive. That is why building a Canada-wide system matters. Most of us know that child care is expensive. Child care fees have placed a massive strain on the budgets of many families. </ParaText>

We negotiated bilateral agreements with the provinces and territories to increase access to child care across the country. We co-developed an indigenous ELCC framework that reflects the unique cultures, aspirations and needs of first nations, Inuit and Métis children and families across Canada, which was endorsed by and jointly released with the Assembly of First Nations, ITK, and the Métis National Council in 2018.</ParaText>

The national advisory council, which would be enshrined in the legislation, would provide advice to the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation> on this important work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547698"> Combined with other commitments, we are investing up to $30 billion over five years to make first-class early learning and child care affordable and accessible, and we are committed to continuing to work with our partners as the system matures and evolves. Our goal is simple and clear: We want to give children across the country, wherever they live, the best possible start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547699">From the beginning of the process, the Government of Canada has maintained that early childhood educators are key to the success of a high-quality early learning and child care system and deserve to have their work valued. We know our early childhood educators are dedicated and professional people. It is in all our best interest that we give early childhood educators and those contemplating a career in early childhood education the necessary incentives to support their growth and professional development. Early childhood educators are a pivotal part of the Canada-wide system. They deserve more for the critical work that they do with our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547700">This legislation is not just about making life more affordable. All parents should have the opportunity to build both a family and a career. Parents, and especially mothers, have too often been denied the support they need to finish their education, participate in training, open businesses and maintain good jobs to provide for their families. Now parents would not have to choose between raising a family and having a career. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547701">It is not simply a matter of being able to go out to work. It is also about the impact it has on women's careers and their ability to be entrepreneurs, as well as on their long-term earning capability. The longer that parents, especially moms, are out of the workforce, the harder it is for them to get back in and advance in a career with all the social and economic benefits that that brings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547702">Affordable high-quality child care is a feminist economic policy and a smart economic policy that would increase Canada's GDP by 1.2%, allowing for more women to return to the workforce. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that boosting women's participation in the workforce could add $150 billion to Canada's economy by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547703">I remember crying tears of joy when the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced a national child care plan in budget 2021 because I knew how transformational it would be. I remembered the financial challenges of child care 33 years ago and the challenging decision of whether to return to work being based solely on finances. As I knocked on doors in the 2021 election, I was concerned that the Conservative Party members had said that, if they were elected, they would scrap universal child care, which would have been absolutely devastating for families in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547704">I am now a proud grandmother of the most perfect little boy. He started day care in November and is thriving there. His parents waited anxiously for a deal with the Province of Ontario to ensure their child care costs would be affordable for them. Needless to say, our family was overjoyed when the deal was signed and their child care costs have already been reduced by 50%, which means that wee Cameron is able to grow and learn at his day care, and his mom and dad can both work in meaningful employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547705">With this bill, all of us in the House have the chance to do something that is going to make a difference for generations to come. It is my hope that we can swiftly pass this bill to ensure the longevity of the Canada-wide system, which would help all of Canada access high-quality, affordable and inclusive early learning and child care.</ParaText>

That is why we are making investments and working with the provinces and territories to find ways that we can expand child care to make it affordable and accessible for people, regardless of the career that they have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547709">Certainly, for those who are working in a lot of emergency services where there is a lack of child care options for women, or in careers that require people to work late into the night or to travel, it can be a challenge.

              <ParaText id="7547711">Quebec is a trailblazer. Members spoke about atypical working hours and that CPEs in Quebec already offer services outside of the usual hours of day care centres. These centres offer services to women who do not necessarily work during the day. Quebec is already providing these services. This is a system proper to Quebec and it is unique.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547720">I recall when the national child care strategy was first discussed in 1993 because at that time I was pregnant with my first child. He is now the father of four children, so obviously we are still having this discussion. I recall back in 1994 putting my child on a wait-list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547721">Back in 1994 was the first time that I put my child on a wait-list for a child care space, which was not necessarily publicly funded, in the city of London. I was a brand new mother, 23 years old, with a job, and I was probably making between eight and nine dollars an hour working as a dental assistant. I knew that child care was going to be very critical for me to go back to work because my spouse and I were not making a lot of money and we did want to get ahead. We had student loans. We had bills we wanted to pay, and we did have a car. Therefore, it was very important, even back then, that we were both working at that, although not necessarily full time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547722">Now, in 2023, we are continuing to have the conversation on child care and what it looks like. As the government is putting forward this piece of legislation, I will reflect on the work I have done in Parliament as we have discussed child care and the discussions I have had with parents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547723">During my role from 2015 to 2019, I had the honour to work with families, children and social development, and look at the different things that we are discussing, especially child care. I recall, I believe it was in the 2016 budget, when the Canada child benefit was increased quite a bit so that it could include child care. However, we all know that today, with the exorbitant cost for families, the new child benefit does not even touch what this country is going through with inflationary costs. Although it was a program that was very important to do, I do not think the government was actually going in the right direction when it comes to the fact that it cannot keep its spending under control. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547724">When we get to where we are today, we are talking about child care, and we need to talk about those spaces. I just had a young woman call me last week who could not return to work because she could not find a child care space. Her question to me was, “Can I get my employment insurance expanded?” She said that she needed to go to back to work. She cannot afford what is going on right now. She cannot afford her home. She cannot afford the price of groceries. She cannot afford life at this time, and she needs to go back to work because her EI maternity and parental benefits have run out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547725">I could not believe that I had to say to her, “I am really sorry.” I know that she has been trying for the last year to find a child care space as her child was just born, but there is not a space for that child. This is where we talk about looking at these programs and making sure that we have enough spaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547726">I also recall back in 2018 one of the greatest challenges they were having in Langley, B.C. I was doing a tour there and I was at the YMCA, which was paying its child care providers $22 an hour. Now, I see in this piece of legislation talk about averages that people must make, but we have to also understand that $22 an hour in Langley, B.C. cannot keep a child care provider because of the cost of living is so outrageous. This is where we really need to focus on the labour market. We really need to focus on the cost of living. We really need to ask what is going on here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547727">This occupation is heavily oriented towards women. Many women choose to be child care providers. Many women also choose to educate small children, those in kindergarten through to grade eight, because of their love of children and wanting to be part of that. However, we are not getting to where we need to be because these child care spaces are not available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547728">In Langley, B.C. when a person making $22 an hour cannot afford to work in that profession, they are going to find another profession, which is what we have seen. We have seen an exodus from professions that may be lower paying. It is good that we are seeing a bit of an increase, but at the same time I am wondering what we are going to do to sustain this type of program, because the business model does not work when we look at this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547729">That is why I want to bring in the discussion of entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547730">I like to have kids, it seems. Between my second and third child, I decided to stay home and bring in three other children. I did my very best because I am the type of person who wants to make sure that we are having the right food, that we are having the right playtimes and that we are doing some educational pieces. That was very important to me. I was able to offer child care to mothers who did not have regular work schedules, people who were working in restaurants, people who were not working a regular nine-to-five job. That is why I believe it is so important that we not only look at the public and not-for-profit but that we look at these women-led businesses that are providing child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547731">The whole idea of not-for-profit seems to be the problem here. It is a business, and we should be supporting this, because even CUPE has come out and said that there will not be enough spaces if we are putting all of our eggs into one basket and expecting it to be not-for-profit or publicly funded. There needs to be space for this private care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547732">I also bring this up because I am a girl from Sparta, population 300. If my parents, or any family in Sparta, needed to take their child to child care, it would be a 25-minute drive. That is why we need flexibility for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547733">For instance, a young woman, or a new mom, which was my case, may choose to become a child care provider within her own home. That would be seen, perhaps, as private. That is a job. The way I look at it is that it is a job and it is a way for the woman and the family to have more flexibility. She is helping out other women and helping out herself in the meantime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547734">When we are looking at a program that is really focused at a national scale, we need to recognize that we live in Canada. We live in a country where it is hard for us to get to Ottawa some days. It is hard for us to get to the grocery store on certain days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547735">When we are talking about that, I live in a very populated place, St. Thomas. I live with about 45,000 other people in my community. If we are talking about smaller populations, how are we going to ensure that they are having the same accessible, quality child care that people in urban centres are going to have? How are we ensuring that this is going to happen? How are we ensuring that every family has access to $10-a-day child care?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547736">Let us be real and say that this is not the way it is going to work out perfectly. Yes, we need to ensure that there is child care, because child care helps our economy. It puts families and women back to work and it gives them that opportunity. For me, child care was very important, but I did not do it with public child care. It was not an option. There were no spaces. I did it through not-for-profit and through women entrepreneur-based businesses, where women were able to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547737">I am really hoping that when the government looks at this legislation, it is very focused on these types of businesses. I really hope that it recognizes that we need to be looking at all types of child care when we are looking at this. There are approximately five different types of child care that we have here in Ontario. We need to make sure that all of those are on the plate and that all of those are part of that basket, if we really want to have something available for families and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547738">Before I finish, I want to switch to labour, because, as we have said, labour is an issue. I have talked about the cost of living. I have talked about how it was $22 an hour, in 2018, to be a child care provider out in Langley, B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547739">We are at a critical issue. Just as we are seeing in our health care professions and just as we are seeing with many of our frontline workers, we are seeing burnout. I must say that the people who are working in child care are doing an exceptional job, but there is burnout as well. We need to ensure that there are supports for them and that there is education for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547740">However, there is a labour market issue here right now that is not going to help fulfill what the government is putting forward, and that is why we need to look at everything else. We need to look at things. PSWs, labour force issues, this is what we are seeing from the government, because people cannot afford to have certain types of jobs so people are leaving those types of jobs, which are really important. They are leaving those jobs to try to find higher-earning jobs because the government does not really have that love for jobs. Many people who are working in ECE are doing it because they love children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547741">I do not think the government recognizes that it should not just be one way. We should make sure that child care is accessible for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547743">My deep concern is this. What I have heard from the Conservatives, both the Doug Ford provincial Conservatives and those here in this chamber, is that they want to put public funds into what should be non-profit supports. When it comes to child care, we know that the Ontario Conservative government has quietly removed profit caps and is expanding for-profit child care. This is very concerning to me.

While, yes, there are caps on private, there is private child care that has been grandfathered in Ontario, but the idea is to create more spaces, because the market demand for spaces is there. Each province gave us a list of how many spaces it needs, and the partnership with the federal government is to commit the funds to build those spaces.

              <ParaText id="7547750">Madam Speaker, I think the member hit the nail on the head when talking about needing agreements with the provinces, because at the end of the day the people who are providing child care are the provinces. The federal government is supposed to be there trying to create a strategy, an approach to this. I think as we are talking about this we are so keyed in on “This is what we are trying to do.” It does not work. One type of thing just does not work for everybody. We need to make these agreements, but 67% of child care in the province of Alberta is done by entrepreneurs. It is not public and it is not not-for-profit, because that is what works in that area. Therefore, when we are talking about this, I am really hoping the government understands that spaces and private can still work together very well.</ParaText>

I also want to thank our shadow minister for families, children and social development, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278557" Type="2">Peterborough—Kawartha</Affiliation>, for the excellent and extremely important work she has done on this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547755">Over the next few minutes, I will have the chance to talk about the reality facing Canadian families. I wanted to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> because my wife has been working in child care centres in Quebec for many years now, so she is very familiar with the system. She witnessed its creation. Unfortunately, she has also witnessed the deterioration in services over the last few years. I think it is important to share her experience of this public system, which has existed in Quebec for over 20 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547756">It is important to identify the flaws in the system, to recognize that there are still problems and look at how this Parliament can work to improve the child care situation across the country and in every province. It is also important not to put all our eggs in one basket, as Quebec has done in recent years. This would allow more families, more single mothers and fathers, more people to have access to appropriate child care across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547757">Let us talk about the current reality for Canadian families. The cost of living has skyrocketed. We are facing interest rates that are making it harder and harder for young families to access home ownership. Food prices went up nearly 12% in just a year. That far outstrips the rise in inflation. We hear that many women would like to go back to work, especially young women who just had their first child. Young women who still do not have access to a child care system could be on a waiting list for several months, even a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547758">In Quebec, in particular, when a person no longer has access to parental benefits, they may have to wait another year before they get a child care spot. It is unacceptable. This prevents many women from going back to work and thriving. More importantly, it also denies children the opportunity to access a public system that could help in their development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547759">At first, I was against a public child care system like the one that was implemented in Quebec in recent years. However, I must now admit that such a system improves the living conditions of many children. An educational child care system helps children be better prepared for school. Sometimes, these children come from disadvantaged backgrounds and their families do not necessarily have all the tools to help them develop before they go to preschool and kindergarten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547760">These services are good for children who manage to get into the system. Unfortunately, there are still many children who are unable to do so. Eight years after the Liberals made their promises, they are now introducing a bill that proposes access to that kind of system in the future. Unfortunately, based on what we have seen from the Liberals over the past eight years, we are worried that this bill is all about good intentions and that the results may not be up to par.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547761">The Liberals want to move too quickly. They are grandstanding and trying to win political points. They are implementing a fine program to help families, but once again, they are realizing a little too late that they may not have done their homework properly and that, unfortunately, thousands of children will not have access to child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547762">Why will they not have access to child care spaces? First, there is already a shortage of spaces in the system, especially in Quebec, and second, there is a dire shortage of specialized educators, so the centres cannot provide services to these children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547763">Day cares lack money for food. I was surprised to learn that in some day cares in Quebec, they no longer give meat to young children under the age of five because they cannot afford it. Non-profit centres can no longer afford to buy meat to feed the children. Instead, they serve plant-based proteins in the morning.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547764">All sorts of other products are being used to try to adequately meet people's needs, but meat has been banned in the day care centres because there is not enough money, because everything costs more. There is also a glaring lack of choice. Families would have had the opportunity to access child care services, but unfortunately, Quebec has favoured subsidized non-profit day cares as currently proposed by the federal program. As a result, we find ourselves in a situation where, 25 years later, needs are still not being met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547765">I have some stats here about children on the waiting list. These numbers are from the Government of Quebec's ministry of families. There are 286,817 spaces in the system according to data from May 31, 2022. Quebec currently has 101,244 children in early learning centres, or facilities. There are 50,444 children in subsidized child care. There are 68,431 children in non-subsidized care, the so-called private day cares. Lastly, there are 66,698 children in home-based child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547766">These child care services are offered by women, entrepreneurs who decide to open their own home-based child care service but are part of the network subsidized by the Government of Quebec. These female entrepreneurs are subsidized by Quebec to provide services to children. Unfortunately, this approach will not be allowed in all provinces, which do not all have the same agreement. This means more choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547767">The big problem, despite all this and after 25 years, is that there are still 33,829 children waiting for a child care space. Some 30,295 spaces are being created, so there is already a shortfall. There are 2,500 subsidized spaces to be allocated. The facilities have not yet been developed to ensure that young people can access these child care centres or spaces. The number of children with “pending” status is 50,000. After more than 20 years of the public subsidized system, there are still 50,000 children who do not have a child care space. If you multiply that number by one for the number of mothers and by two for the number of parents, it is quite clear that there is a problem with putting all your eggs in one basket and taking just one path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547768">Fortunately, the Quebec government is providing subsidies to stay-at-home mothers who decide to open their own home-based child care. This is a way out. However, we deplore certain aspects of this bill, which is why we have some requests. We will be proposing amendments in committee to allow for more choice and to achieve the ultimate goal of accessible child care for children, and particularly for mothers who need access to a child care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547769">We also have concerns about cost. If we cannot even create the number of spaces promised, will the government be able to keep its promise of creating $10-a-day spaces? That is the second big question. Based on past experience and different programs presented and adopted by the Liberal government in the last eight years, there is reason to have doubts and to ask questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547770">The government does have an area of expertise that could help Quebec. Quebec is currently trying to fill 18,000 educator positions and the Quebec government would like to recruit abroad to fill these 18,000 positions. I believe that the federal government has a very specific role to play to help address the shortage of child care staff. It must work with the Quebec government and the governments of all the other provinces to expedite the arrival of these educators so that an increasing number of children, families and single parents can access quality child care services.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7547791">Madam Speaker, it is such a pleasure to rise and speak to legislation that is very historic in nature. It is not too often that we see a national government taking an initiative as significant as the one we see today. What we are talking about are the core principles of what a national child care program will look like. It is the type of thing that I hope all members of this House will get behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547792">Over the summer, I had a wonderful opportunity to visit Stanley Knowles School in the north end of Winnipeg. It has been providing child care and day care for the past 30 years, since its creation. What was special about this particular visit was that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was with me. We had the opportunity first-hand to engage with child care workers and parents, and I think he personally enjoyed being with the children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547793">We saw creativity around the tables as children would come up and start playing. We saw the interaction taking place between the children and staff. When we are in a child care facility and see it at work, we see a very caring attitude, one that is nurtured by love. They are not the biological parents; they are workers, but we can tell that their heart is in what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547794">I could also see that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was thoroughly enjoying the visit. I say that because I know, as we all should, that shortly after the Prime Minister was elected, he made a strong indication as a feminist that he wanted to move forward on important issues for women and others, and child care is an important issue. It does so much to ensure that we get fuller participation in every aspect of our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547795">When we think about what kind of principles there are in child care, we are talking about access, affordability and inclusivity. We are talking about high-quality child care, and that is within this legislation. It is a framework of principles. I believe it does not matter where we go in Canada; we will find support for those principles, and for the first time, we have legislation that is putting them in place. It is setting out that framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547796">We have seen the degree to which Canadians have fallen in love with the Canada Health Act and the many benefits that this legislation has brought to every citizen from coast to coast to coast. It was a true, national program, and we can look at the results it has delivered to people today. We love our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547797">Let me suggest that the principles we are talking about today, even though we are debating them, have been talked about a great deal over the last number of years, virtually from day one when the leader of the Liberal Party became the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We have had a number of ministers raise the issues and have dialogue with provinces, territories, indigenous leaders, child care workers and all forms of stakeholders. They have a vested interest in a topic that all of us should be concerned about.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547798">It is the future. It is for our young ones, the children, that we are enabling, as much as possible, that quality, accessibility, affordability and inclusivity for everyone. It is interesting. When I hear comments coming from across the way, they like to plant the seeds the doubt or to be critical. Let us think in terms of the volume of dollars that are being contributed to this program. It is $30 billion over five years. That is a serious commitment to ensure that not only are we bringing in legislation, but we are also supporting that legislation with tangible dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547799">The legislation we have before us today is not the starting point. Ministers and civil servants have had what I suspect are hundreds of collective meetings in every region of our country, and working with indigenous leaders, to ensure that we are able to accomplish something that has never been done before, and that is an agreement on the principles we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547800">It does not matter what province or territory or community Canadians live in, those principles of child care and early learning are going to be there. That is something I know and am absolutely confident of, because I have had discussions with colleagues in our Liberal caucus who are very passionate about this, and for good reason. We understand and appreciate the true value of the legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547801">There is a place we could go to see the degree to which it has been successful, and that is the province of Quebec. For over two decades, Quebec has been dealing with early learning and child care in a far more progressive fashion or manner than any other jurisdiction in Canada. I have even heard some members say in North America, and I suspect that could be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547802">The national Liberal Party and the government of the day has said that this is something we believe in, and it is not our first attempt. We attempted to do this prior to Stephen Harper's government. We came very close. This time we believe we can cross the finish line. Once again, we have achieved something that no other government has done. We have the agreement in writing from the provinces, territories and indigenous leaders who have signed off, saying that they support the principles I am talking about. They support what the national government is doing on the issue of early learning and child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547803">Even though we have accumulated a great deal of support, there is a number of us who have some concerns, if I could put it that way, in terms of where the Conservative Party of Canada really is on the issue. They are fair concerns. Let us think about the last federal election. In the last federal election, the former leader of the Conservative Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278509" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation>, made it very clear that he would scrap the Liberal plan. That was the past leader. The current leader boasted about how his former government cancelled Liberal child care plans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547805">I posed a question earlier today to the critic. It would be nice to believe the Conservatives will change their opinions or flip-flop. Some of my colleagues say, no, that will not happen, but I am an optimistic person. A glass half full of water means there is water in the glass to drink. At the end of the day, I am hopeful the Conservatives will see the light on this issue and change their position.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547810">Madam Speaker, I think that was a legitimate question. The member from across the floor asked if I know the Conservatives' position. I actually have a sense of what they oppose because they have said that publicly, and I have made reference to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547811">The member's <Affiliation DbId="278509" Type="2">former leader</Affiliation>, just so he knows, told him that, when he knocks on the door, he should tell his constituents that he does not like the Liberal plan. That was the former leader of the Conservative Party. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">current leader</Affiliation> has gone around boasting, as I indicated, that the former Harper government cancelled Liberal child care plans in the past. Do I know what the Conservative Party's position is on this, on child care? No, but in fairness, I do not think anyone knows what its policy is on child care. I suspect it has something to do with the trickle-down private sector. I do not know that, but it is my suspicion as they are quick to criticize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547812">The implementation of what we saw in Quebec has achieved wonders. Think of it in terms of single parents, 90% of whom are women. That is why this is a very strong feminist policy. Think about a single mom who is not able to get into the workforce because of her inability to afford child care. That is a reality. No matter what the Conservative Party may want us to believe, that is an actual reality. There are people who have a difficult time being able to afford child care. With the Province of Quebec coming in with a program that made it affordable, at the end of the day thousands, not hundreds, of women were able to get into the workforce. That is because they were prepared to take a chance in that province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547813">When I say thousands of women in Quebec, that is a very low estimate on my part. It could go into the tens of thousands, especially when factoring in the number of years. One could ultimately ask what the benefit to the mother or, on the odd occasion, the father, has been of being able to get out of the house, whether to volunteer, work or get additional educational opportunities, all of which could, in all likelihood, create better outcomes in terms of household income. There are tremendous opportunities created for the individual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547814">Collectively, I would suggest, it is even greater for society. The benefits to the individual are many, but the benefits to society are even greater. With more people participating in the workforce, especially one that continues to grow, that helps all of us in society. There are more resources generating GDP. In other words, the economy benefits. There are literally tens of thousands of jobs out there. We are very dependent on, for example, immigration policies and international workers, because there are so many jobs out there. In many ways there are people in Canada who would like to be able to work, but for a number of reasons, and the financial affordability of child care is one of the primary ones, they are not able to do that. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547815">Let us imagine other families that have one parent working during the day and one working at night because they cannot afford child care. They are losing out on the opportunity of having more quality family time, if I can put it that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547816">There are many things in society that would benefit from recognizing the principles we are trying to put in place through this legislation. Having a Canada-wide system with a federal vision would benefit all Canadians. We need to recognize that there is a long-term funding component to the legislation. There is a national advisory council on early learning and child care that would be created. We need to recognize that we would have reporting from the minister to the public with regard to ongoing progress in this area. That shows an ongoing commitment to financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547817">Putting this into legislation would make taking it apart even more difficult, in particular for the Conservative Party. At the end of the day, we believe, as the New Democrats, the Bloc members and I believe the Greens do, that providing access, affordability, inclusivity and high-quality child care is in the nation's best interest, the parents' best interest and the child's best interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547818">By having this legislation, taking up the framework and continuing to work with provinces, territories and indigenous communities, we would ensure that child care and early learning become a reality for more people. To me, that is what this is all about. We want to ensure accessibility and that we have these opportunities, because by doing that, whether it is the child, the parent or society as a whole, we all collectively and individually benefit.</ParaText>

For the first time, they can now look at maybe not having as much work, where one parent has to work in the evening and the other in the daytime and they are not necessarily able to make the connection they would like with their family unit. </ParaText>

That is the point that needs to be emphasized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547854"> Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>, an act respecting early learning and child care in Canada, sets a vision for a Canada-wide early learning and child care system committed to ongoing collaboration with provinces and indigenous people to support efforts to “establish and maintain”. Just over 52% of Canadian children younger than six years were in licensed or unlicensed child care in 2022. This bill proposes to cut day care fees by an average of 50% by the end of 2022 and down to an average of $10 per day by 2026. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547855">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is a step in the right direction. However, it is too generic and does not consider or address many obstacles that parents face when accessing child care. Affordable, quality child care is critical, but if it cannot be accessed, it does not help families. Bill C-35 is beneficial for families that already have a child care space, but it does not help the thousands of families on child care wait-lists or the operators who do not have the staff or infrastructure to offer more spaces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547856">I forgot to mention that I will be sharing my time with the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278203" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547857">In Ontario alone, the Financial Accountability Office says that demand for the program will exceed the number of available spaces. The FAO estimates that by 2026, approximately 600,000 children under the age of six will have potential access to $10-a-day child care, but only 375,000 licensed child care spaces will be available. Therefore, approximately 227,000 children under the age of six will be left behind, not able to access the $10-a-day child care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547858">Canada needs far more child care spaces than it has, and Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would not address the need for increased child care infrastructure. The Liberal government simply offering up grants and subsidies through Bill C-35 does neither initiate nor promote operators to step up and start up centres where they are needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547859">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> also fails to address the child care labour shortage. There is currently not enough qualified staff to keep all existing child care centres running at full capacity. Child care workers in Canada continue to leave the sector due to the low pay and poor working conditions. The majority of child care professionals are overworked and suffer burnout. The shortage of workers means that in many communities there is only one child care space available for every three children who need it and wait-lists are long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547860">According to the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> fails to address the shortage of early childhood educators and child care workers. Until the child care staffing crisis is resolved, the promise of affordable and high-quality child care for every family in Canada that needs it will remain unfulfilled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547861">One of Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>'s commitments is to provide more accessible child care to indigenous people and contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous early learning and child care programs that focus on the languages and culture identities of first nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been found to contribute to better educational outcomes for indigenous children and help to build their language ability and sense of cultural pride. However, there is a shortage of indigenous workers trained in early childhood education in Canada, particularly because of challenges they face in acquiring training, such as cost, entrance requirements and residence in remote areas with restricted technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547862">According to Statistics Canada, indigenous childhood educators and assistants and child care providers are less likely to have post-secondary education compared to their non-indigenous counterparts. Although claiming to support indigenous child care, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> would do nothing to address the shortage in indigenous child care workers or the disparity of education between indigenous and non-indigenous child care workers.</ParaText>

This piece of the bill opens the door to a two-tier framework of child care across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547864">Quality child care comes in all shapes and sizes. In Canada, options for child care range from nannies and home day care to day care centres, preschool programs, and before- and after-school programs. By giving preferential treatment to public and not-for-profit child care, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> discriminates against women. The majority of child care operators are women, and the language and intent of this bill prevent any growth and opportunities for private female operators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547865">How would Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> assist single parents who do not have regularly scheduled nine-to-five jobs? This issue is not addressed in the bill. How does Bill C-35 address child care for children with disabilities? In British Columbia, children with disabilities are continuously left behind when it comes to child care. There is no official count on how many child care sites are accessible for kids with disabilities, because there is no provincial definition of what makes a child care site inclusive. How about grandparents who have stepped up and put their retirement on hold for their grandchildren? </ParaText>

The government is supporting Ontario's efforts to grow its child care system by providing $10.2 billion over five years as part of our agreement with the Province of Ontario. In turn, Ontario has promised to create 86,000 spaces. Premier Doug Ford called it “a great deal for Ontario”. That is exactly what he said on March 31 when we announced that deal. I would like to ask if the member opposite agrees with the Premier of Ontario.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547876">In several studies that the committee has conducted since I joined it, we have observed that Quebec has a really wonderful model that was put in place by a feminist. Pauline Marois created a unique model. The economic impact of early childhood centres in Quebec was clear in the study on the impacts of COVID-19 during the pandemic and how women were disproportionately affected, as well as in the study on invisible work, where this issue of child care also came up. Many economists will say it: This has allowed thousands of women to return to the labour market. This is crucial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547877">It was interesting to hear the member talk about jurisdiction. In my view, this falls under Quebec's jurisdiction. It is a model. If the rest of Canada wants to emulate it, that is fine, but Quebec has jurisdiction over this issue. Furthermore, any tax credit that might be put in place, as some Conservatives want, will never happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547878">Let us remember why early childhood centres were created. It was to provide equal opportunities for young children and all women. Quebec's child care system is perfect. The rest of Canada should use it as a model, but the government needs to sign an agreement giving us the right to opt out with full compensation and giving us the money to manage the system we have in place.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7547886">Mr. Speaker, for young families across this country, child care is a principle concern. When a child is in their care or with another, parents want to feel confident that their child is being well cared for, and that they are safe and in a healthy environment that supports their development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547887">Canadian families across the country should have access to affordable and quality child care. Parents should also be able to choose a child care solution that best suits them and works with their family's own unique needs. The reality is there is no one-size-fits-all child care solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547888">Not only is the issue of child care important for families, but it is also a significant consideration in workforce participation. Access to child care continues to be a large barrier to workforce participation, and it cannot be overlooked as we look into addressing the labour shortages we are experiencing across industries in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547889">While there is presumably a consensus on the viewpoint that there should be accessible, affordable and flexible child care for parents throughout our country, this legislation offers no real assurances to Canadian families that there will be. The families that will benefit from this legislation are those families who have already secured a child care space in a public or not-for-profit program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547890">However, this legislation does nothing to help the thousands of families on child care wait-lists and those whose child care needs require more flexibility. It does nothing to help those families whose child care needs fall outside the standard hours of operation. In fact, the primary problem with this legislation is that it fails to ensure that demand can be met and that supports are flexible enough to meet the needs of all Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547891">Affordable, quality child care is a great concept. It is a wonderful concept, but if a parent cannot access it, then it is ultimately worthless. In laying out a vision for a Canada-wide, early learning and child care system, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> offers Canadian families a single, just one, child care solution, and by its own design, the access is limited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547892">This legislation intentionally ignores an entire section of the child care landscape, which is critical to meeting demand. The Liberal-NDP government is shutting private operators, who tend to be women-owned small businesses, out of its plan. It fails to even ensure them a seat at the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547893">There is no representation for these women-owned small businesses in the makeup of the proposed national advisory council on early learning and child care. In addition to public child care programs, these women-owned small business operators are critical to meeting the growing demand for child care spaces, not to mention that, by limiting supports to public and not-for-profit child care programs, this will drive up the demand for child care spaces in these programs where the wait-lists already exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547894">We know that wait-lists already exist because there is not necessarily the staff or infrastructure put in place to offer more child care spaces. This legislation does not solve the issue of recruitment or that of retention in the early learning and child care sector. It does not answer the pressing question of who will staff these programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547895">Report after report indicates that early childhood educators are overwhelmed and burnt out, and that there is a steady stream of early childhood educators leaving the profession. There have been operators who have had to close their doors at times because there was not necessarily enough staff to operate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547896">To ensure that the government is delivering more than just announcements to Canadians, the government needs to deliver a tangible plan, in partnership with our provinces, to recruit and retain labour. That plan should engage all child care providers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547897">With limited resources, it does not make sense to shut out these women-owned small businesses from this solution, nor should the government be putting these entrepreneurs at a disadvantage. These child care providers should be able to operate in a fair market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547898">Without a real plan to address the existing challenges in child care, access to child care will never really be achieved. If the goal is truly to deliver universal access to child care, child care policy also needs to be comprehensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547899">However, the government's vision for child care policy is limited. For one, it fails to acknowledge that not all parents have a standard work schedule. The reality is that standard child care operating hours do not meet the needs of most shift workers. Parents who work early mornings, evenings, nights, weekends, statutory holidays, casual shifts or any other irregular shifts are largely being left behind. By focusing child care supports on programs that do not offer any real kind of child care solution to families with non-standard work schedules, there is a massive gap in the NDP-Liberal government's child care policy. It is not a universal solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547900">The NDP-Liberal government also purports to be addressing affordability through the creation of a $10-a-day child care program, but that is not entirely accurate either. As I have mentioned, the only families who are benefiting from the cuts to child care costs are those who already have child care spaces in eligible public and not-for-profit programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547901">We are now hearing reports of operators who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of living in the country. These operators, like all Canadians, are seeing the cost of everything climb. Many who offer food programs are now having to consider whether they are going to cut these programs entirely or charge parents additional costs to keep them running.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547902">Either these parents are getting fewer services from their child care providers or some of those savings will ultimately be lost. Of course, for those parents who cannot access a child care space, they are not benefiting from these savings, but are still struggling under the pressures of the rising costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547903">In fact, I was listening to the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation>'s speech earlier in the debate today. She highlighted that she had heard from parents who could now afford their mortgage payment because their child care fees were reduced and other parents who could afford groceries for their family because of the reduction in child care fees. Well, she was quite proud of that achievement, and it really points to a bigger problem, a problem that is her own government's doing. Canadians are paying the price for this costly coalition's tax-and-spend agenda. The NDP-Liberal government needs to take affordability seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547904">Canada's food price report has reported that the average family of four is expected to spend $1000 more than it did last year on groceries. Meanwhile, surveys are already reporting that 52% of Canadian families are concerned that they do not have enough money to feed their families. We are now seeing record usage of food banks across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547905">The cost of basic necessities is becoming out of reach for more and more Canadians, and the Liberal government's addition of half a trillion dollars in federal debt has led to the 40-year-high inflation rates that we are seeing now. Its continued deficit spending is fuelling inflation and Canadians are paying more in taxes than ever before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547906">We know that parents are stretching their dollars as far as they can go, but that is becoming less and less fruitful. Those parents who are shut out of the child care program because they cannot access it or because it does not meet their needs do not share the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s elation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547907">The driving force behind the skyrocketing cost of living crisis needs to be addressed to really help Canadian families who are struggling to make ends meet and, ultimately, if we want to help Canadian families with the cost of child care, we need to ensure that child care is first available. Child care is unique to each family, and a federal child care policy should reflect that.</ParaText>

We have been anxiously trying to get a position from the Conservative Party on whether it supports this or not.

He literally referred to the child care money as a slush fund.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7547933">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address this House on Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>, what we hope will become the act respecting early learning and child care in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547934">As the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation> indicated in her remarks earlier, we now have in place a Canada-wide early learning and child care system that aims to ensure access to affordable, high-quality and inclusive child care for families across the country. The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is to strengthen and protect that system by enshrining its principles into law. This is a commitment from the Government of Canada to support access to affordable child care for families in Canada, no matter where in Canada they live. In fact, the new Canada-wide system is already benefiting tens of thousands of people from coast to coast to coast with fees for regulated child care having been reduced in all jurisdictions across Canada, outside of Quebec and Yukon, which already had affordable child care systems, and we are just getting started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547935">Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is the result of engagement between the Government of Canada, provinces, territories, indigenous governments, and organizations and stakeholders. It builds on our collaborative work with provinces, territories and indigenous peoples. It also builds on the agreements negotiated with every province and territory to establish a Canada-wide system. The collaboration that delivered this remarkable system was detailed, and sometimes challenging, but held in an atmosphere of respect, commitment and a willingness to succeed. For sure there are similarities in the agreements, but we never expected a one-size-fits-all model that conveniently served all of our partners. We succeeded because we agreed on one fundamental principle, the thing all Canadians care about most deeply, giving children in Canada the best possible start in life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547936">This legislation respects provincial and territorial jurisdiction and upholds indigenous rights. All our partners in this Canada-wide effort can look forward to benefiting from the long-term federal financial commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547937">Let us talk about funding. In budget 2021, the Government of Canada made a transformative investment of more than $27 billion over five years. If we include related investments, including in indigenous early learning and child care, we have committed nearly $30 billion over five years to make quality early learning and child care affordable and accessible. Combined with previous investments announced since 2015, a minimum of $9.2 billion a year ongoing will be invested in child care, including indigenous early learning and child care, starting in 2025 to 2026. These investments are already having an impact. To date, fees have been reduced in every jurisdiction across Canada. Further, Quebec, Yukon and Nunavut are providing regulated child care for $10 a day or less. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547938">Let us take our agreement with Saskatchewan. The province has been one of the early leaders in fee reductions. Over a year ago, Saskatchewan announced a 50% reduction that it made retroactive to July 2021. That was a year and a half in advance of our December 2022 target. Saskatchewan followed with another fee reduction, effective September 1 of last year, where fees were lowered by a total of 70% compared to March 2021 levels. This is a huge saving for families across the province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547939">While the province is lowering fees, it is continuing to ensure that early childhood educators are kept at the heart of the system. Last September, Saskatchewan announced that federal funding from its Canada-wide agreement is being used to establish an ECE wage enhancement grant, which will result in increased wages for the workforce that is critical to the success of the Canada-wide system, and there is more.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547940">In early 2022, Saskatchewan announced the creation of over 1,200 new licensed child care spaces on top of the over 600 spaces the province announced in December 2021. That is more than 1,800 new child care spaces providing more children with a better start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547941">This is the Canada-wide early learning and child care system in action: lowered fees, a supported ECE workforce, more child care spaces and real results for making life more affordable. For all these families across Saskatchewan, and the thousands of others like them across Canada, this system means hundreds of dollars more each month to put healthy food on the table and to sign up kids for music, sports or after-school activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547942">The federal investment not only benefits families and young children, it also benefits the economy as a whole, which means it benefits all Canadians, and here is how: It will grow Canada’s economy. Economic studies show that, with each dollar invested in early childhood education, the broader economy receives between $1.50 and $2.80 in return. The federal government's estimates predict that the Canada-wide early learning and child care system could raise the GDP by as much as 1.2% over the next two decades. It will grow Canada’s labour force. As we have seen in Quebec, at the time the Quebec Educational Childcare Act was instituted in 1997, the women’s labour force participation rate in Quebec was four percentage points lower than the rest of Canada. In 2021, it is four points higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547943">The figures are telling us that investing in increased access to high-quality, affordable and inclusive early learning and child care is not only the right thing to do for families, but it is also the smart thing to do for Canada and our economy. It is a win for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547944">Our colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation>, has many times said, “access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive [learning and] child care is not a luxury—it is a necessity.” As the <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> put it, “child care...is as much a piece of critical infrastructure...as a bridge or a road”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547945">It boils down to this: All parents and caregivers have an opportunity to build both a family and a career, and all children should have the best possible start in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547946">This legislation comes with the twin federal commitments of respect of jurisdiction and a reliable funding partner. We are creating a great system together, a system we can all be justifiably proud of, and I respectfully ask that my colleagues give rapid passage to Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> so we can put this last piece in place. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7547963">Mr. Speaker, as I rise today, one day after the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attack at the Quebec City mosque, I just want to acknowledge the loss that occurred on that day six years ago, the other five lives that have been taken by Islamophobic attacks in this country and the work that we all need to do as parliamentarians and as Canadians to fight against hatred and intolerance, in particular Islamophobia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547964">I rise today to participate in today's debate, not just because it is the first day of the session, not just because I am glad to be back in the chamber and glad to be back surrounded by parliamentarians seeking to advance the interests of our country and of our individual ridings, but because it actually reminded me of a conversation I had in 2019. That conversation was on a street in my riding in Roncesvalles Village and I remember encountering a family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547965">It was election time. It was the 2019 election. I was going door to door, as so many of us do every election period. I was confronted with a family. I had a very blunt conversation with the female lead of that family, the mother of that family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547966">She said to me that we have done so much work and that we continue to do so much work putting women at the forefront of things like international development assistance, women's reproductive rights and so many different initiatives, including a gender-equal cabinet. She said to me, quite candidly, that if we were really sincere about women and women's empowerment, we need to resolve child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547967">I said to her that this was fair. I appreciated that criticism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547968">She elaborated. She said that we cannot really empower women's full participation in the workforce, whether as an entrepreneur, as a salaried employee in a public or private sector setting, unless we alleviate the disproportionate burden on women that relates to raising children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547969">My riding has a lot of families, a lot of young families and a lot of young kids, and there is a lot of financial burden that goes along with raising those kids. When I was raising my kids, who are now eight-and-a-half and 12, the fees ranged, per child, between $1,500 and $1,800. It is quite common in Toronto to hear of fees that are $2,000 a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547970">What I am pleased about today's debate and the subject of what we are discussing is that, yes, after many decades of discussions, thoughts about it, and hearing about agreements that were scuttled at the last minute, etc., finally, this nation and this Parliament are moving past the obstacles in implementing positive change. I think that is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547971">I also want to acknowledge that it was not just individual constituents like mine who had spoken to me in 2019 that provided an impetus, but there was another impetus, an impetus that has become all too familiar to all of us and that is the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me remind us, there were literally families around the country who were dealing with the difficulties of, all of a sudden, shifting their workplace and their educational place for their children and, effectively, substitute day care, all within the confines of their own home, in a matter of weeks, in March and April of 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547972">That is what faced Canadians. I am being very candid here. I think, all of a sudden, it penetrated the brains, particularly, of men in the country, in terms of what a challenge it is to try to have any sort of career or profession, in a virtual setting or otherwise, and have kids running around at all hours of the day, asking about their math homework, where their history homework was, a geography lesson, name it. It was a struggle. That struggle became manifest, I think, for men like me in this country. All of sudden, the level of people's awareness, including my gender's awareness, about the pressing need for a national child care program became that much more acute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547973">What I like about what we are doing is that we are creating a system where one does not have to choose between building a career and raising a family. That is a false choice. No one should ever be confronted with that. Thankfully, we are now moving toward a stage where one is not. I think that is really important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547974">It comes with a large price tag. A massive social change and a massive social program are not inexpensive. We readily acknowledge that. When we prioritize families, children and the women who disproportionately share the burden of raising those children, we need to invest. I think that is exactly what we did when we announced this program in our 2021 budget and the $30-billion price tag that would go along with it over the course of the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547975">What it is going to achieve is to basically take child care that used to cost hundreds of dollars a day and project it to cost $10 a day, on average, across the country by 2026.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7547976">Some provinces were very early adopters of this program. It is staggering in terms of its magnitude, in terms of what it could achieve. Some were a bit late to the game and maybe manipulated the electoral cycle for their own purposes, but I do not want to wade into that. We are now at a stage where, of 13 provinces and territories in this country, literally every square kilometre of this country is covered by a child care agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547977"> In my own province of Ontario, which I am proud to call home, fees have been reduced, on average, by 50%. Something that might have cost people, doing simple math, if they had their child in child care for 10 months of the year, $17,000 to $20,000 has been cut in half. Thousands of dollars are being saved by Ontarian families in my own riding of Parkdale—High Park. That is staggering, given the number one issue that we all hear when we go door to door now, which is about the cost of living and the crisis of affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547978"> If we could return thousands of dollars to families in this country in one single fell swoop, that is reason enough on its own to get behind this kind of legislative initiative. What we are doing is reducing fees in every province and territory. British Columbia, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, P.E.I., New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and NWT have all reduced their fees by an average of 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547979">Saskatchewan, and there were some speakers from Saskatchewan earlier in today's debate, has gone beyond that target, and it has already reached, on average, a 70% reduction of the fees. I was chatting earlier with the member from Winnipeg, the <Affiliation DbId="293762" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation>. In his province of Manitoba, the fees are currently reduced by 30%, and they are on track to achieve a $10-a-day child care early in the new year. This year, Manitobans will reach $10 a day on average for their child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547980">In Yukon and in the province of Quebec, which is really at the forefront of all this in terms of an initiative, regionally, many decades ago, they have had $10-a-day child care. Nunavut joined them in November 2022, three years ahead of schedule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547981">These are truly incredible results, and they point to what we are doing. I will give one statistic that I am perhaps most proud of. In the speech by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278698" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, he talked about labour force participation. He talked about what Quebec had done, where they were about three decades ago, about 4% below the national average for women's participation in the workforce, and that now they are 4% above the Canadian average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547982">What we know as of right now, in the nascent days of this fledgling program, for women aged 25 to 54, is that 85% of those women are in the workforce right now, and that is 9% ahead of our southern counterparts in the United States of America. That number is only going to grow, which puts proof to the point that was made by my constituent in Parkdale—High Park, when she said to me that if we want to fully believe and allow for women's participation and their economic potential to be increased, we need to implement this kind of program. That is what we are working towards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547983">It is not just about the women. It is about the children who are going to benefit from earlier formative education. Again, when I struggled with that grade 4 math class, such as it was, I realized my own limitations as an instructor. As great as parents are in this country, we do not have that formalized training and certification that early childhood educators have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547984">What are we doing to remedy this? As part of that funding that I articulated, nearly half a billion dollars is dedicated to the training of early childhood educators, to their certification so they are providing more, better, higher-qualified training to our young people. That is a win-win. It is great for the children's development, and it is great for the early childhood instructors, who have a better certification and higher wages as a result. Most importantly, it is better for the women, who can now make not a false choice but a real choice. Some may choose to stay at home, and that is their choice. Some may choose to start that business. Some may choose to return to work. Some may choose to stay at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547985">What we are doing in this one fell swoop is empowering and unlocking incredible economic potential on the part of literally half of our country. That is to the benefit of this country. That is to the benefit of our economic output. That is to the benefit of Canadians. That is why I hope that, by legislating this initiative, we concretize it, we solidify it and, I dare say, we make it permanent in this country on a go-forward basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547986">That is what Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document> is about. That is why I am happy to stand in support of it.</ParaText>

This point was made earlier by one of his colleagues. In each province, the provincial government has the ability to dictate the terms of how the money will be spent in that given province. In my province of Ontario, it can make a determination that a certain portion of the billions of dollars we have put on the table should be made available for off hours or irregular hours for the child care that might be made available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7547993">What we want is for people to be joining the workforce or rejoining the workforce. If that work takes them to different hours, including night shifts, day care and child care should be made available to them. The response to that type of question really rests with the particular nature of the arrangement between the B.C. provincial government and Canada in terms of signing its bilateral agreement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7548005">I want to start today by thanking child care workers for the important work they do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548006">In reading the government's new legislation, Bill <Document DbId="12138647" Type="3">C-35</Document>, I have to say that I am disappointed. Once again, we are seeing the Liberal government choosing to put forward buzzwords and campaign slogans rather than crafting the substantive solutions parents in my community of Kelowna—Lake Country are asking for when it comes to serving their child care needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548007">To be clear, this is not a national child care strategy and not a national child care program. It is strictly to subsidize, through the provinces, some families already in the child care system using certain types of child care deemed a priority by the Liberals. It is not universal. This bill in its current form is another missed opportunity for Parliament to work toward creating and staffing actual child care spaces where families could place their children. This bill does not seek to shorten long waiting lists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548008">What is particularly disappointing is that it is hand-picking the types of child care that are acceptable to the government. While I am disappointed, unfortunately I cannot say that I am surprised. The promise of universal child care has long been an over-promised and never-delivered commitment of the Liberal Party. How do we know? It is because it has promised it since most members of this House were children themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548009">In 1984, the former Liberal prime minister John Turner ordered a national task force to study and implement a federal child care program. It was never created. In 1993, the then future Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien promised in the Liberal red book a national child care program, and no program was ever delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548010">In 2004, after 10 years of doing nothing on child care, the then new Liberal prime minister Paul Martin promised to spend $5 billion on a national child care program in a last-ditch effort to save his government. Despite winning the 2004 election, no program was ever created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548011">Canadians are not fooled by the Liberals' over-promised yet under-delivered way they manage. We will continue to hear from the government that it has lowered the cost of child care in Canada, and it has for some, but there needs to be a number of updates made to this legislation to make child care accessible and inclusive, allow parents the freedom to do what works for their family, and to actually make a difference for many. The Conservatives will be working on these.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548012">Just as the Liberals have allowed Canada's once ample supply of children's cold and cough medicine to dwindle to levels so low that parents must now make supply runs to American pharmacies, so too have they allowed a chronic shortage of child care spaces across Canada over the past eight years of their time in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548013">The Canadian Union of Public Employees studied the shortage and found that, “in many communities there is only one child care space available for every three children who need it, and waitlists are long.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548014">The Quebec child care system, the model from their provincial cousins that the federal Liberals have long said they wish to copy, at last count had a wait-list of 51,000 spaces. We know, listening to those operating private child care centres, that many have the resources and space to take more children, but they are continually hampered by the same labour shortage issues repeatedly ignored by the current government in many sectors of our economy and social support networks. Looking again at British Columbia, we see stories of day cares of all structures reducing their hours and turning away new children because of staff shortages.</ParaText>

It is important to note the date because of the minister's response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548017">My question cited the Liberal platform in the election of 2021, in which they promised to, “Establish and fully fund a Canada Water Agency in 2022”. It was also promised that they would, “Modernize the 50-year-old Canada Water Act”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548018"> The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> responded with, “we are, in fact, working to create an independent water agency for Canada.” He said we needed to pursue this and then at the end of his response, he said, “we will have good news to announce to this House in the coming weeks.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548019">That was October 20, 2022, and of course, it is true that the last week of January 2023 does fall within weeks after the answer that we received in October, but the nature of the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s answer, I think it is fair to say, suggested something a bit sooner than some time next year and we are still waiting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548020">We are now in a period of pre-budget work, and I think it is important to focus now on what the government must include in the budget if it is at all serious about creating a Canada water agency. I note particularly, and it was encouraging to me at the time, that the hon. <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> used the word “independent” to refer to this agency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548021">I want to cite that we have quite a lot of good, solid work being done in the NGO community by groups like Flow and others across Canada that work on water policy. There is a strong consensus that the Canada water agency must be independent of the Department of Environment and Climate Change, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, as well as the Department of Natural Resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548022">There is a strong call to have an officer of chief water security to work through interjurisdictional blockages and ensure that this country has strong water policy. We know we need to ensure that we have what we used to have in Canada, which was co-operation and shared work between provinces and the federal government, with the federal government in the lead, on programs to avoid flooding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548023">Flood plain work was shared, anticipating the vulnerabilities of our water system to floods and making sure that we pay attention to water policy, particularly around our freshwater systems, like the Great Lakes or Lake Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548024">It is extraordinarily important that we rebuild the scientific capacity we once had in this country, which is now down to precious little compared to what was there when I worked in the Minister of Environment's office back in the eighties. We had a robust program, an inland waters directorate, near Hamilton. We had a very strong department with hundreds of people working. It has virtually disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548025">What happened to the “coming weeks”? What happened to the “good news”? When are we going to see an independent Canada water agency that is fully funded to at least $1 billion a year as promised in the platform?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7548026">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question and I appreciated as well the question she put to the minister on October 20 and I appreciated his response. I think the hon. member will agree that a clean and safe freshwater supply in Canada and freshwater systems from coast to coast to coast are essential to the well-being of Canadians and to the health and sustainability of the environment and the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548027"> Fresh water sustains life on earth. It supplies drinking water, grows food and supports ecosystems. From droughts to floods to deteriorating water quality, freshwater challenges are intensifying in this country due, in large part, to climate change. There are serious and costly impacts for Canadians and the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548028">As part of the Government of Canada's commitment to protecting fresh water, budget 2022 provided $88.1 million over five years in new funding for Environment and Climate Change Canada, which includes $19.6 million in the 2022-23 budget to sustain the freshwater action plan and this is up for renewal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548029"> However, our funding efforts will now include cleanup efforts in the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence River, Lake Winnipeg, Lake of the Woods, the Fraser River in my colleague's home province, the Saint John River, the Mackenzie River and Lake Simcoe; $43.5 million, starting in 2022-23, to create the new Canada water agency, which I will advise the hon. member, will be stood up soon, in the coming weeks; and $25 million over five years starting in 2022-23 for the Experimental Lakes Area in northern Ontario, to support freshwater science and research. Members will recall the Harper government tried to shutter that incredible global water resource, but our government is now funding it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548030">Also, to the hon. member's point, we will be modernizing the Canada Water Act. As she mentioned, for 51 years it has been in place, almost unchanged, and indigenous communities and climate change will be front and centre in our considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548031">In June 2021, Environment and Climate Change Canada published a “what we heard” report. We consulted from coast to coast to coast, we received some 2,700 submissions. We heard strong support for the enhanced availability of data to support decision-making at all levels and cutting-edge science to tackle freshwater challenges, including climate change impacts. In addition to public engagement, the Government of Canada has also engaged with the provinces, territories and indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548032"> The Canada water agency is an institution for our time. It will bring people together on the watershed and the landscapes of this country to better protect and manage our fresh water, which we are so blessed to have. Twenty per cent of the world's fresh water is in this beautiful country of ours.</ParaText>

I want to correct the record when I said “near Hamilton”. I cannot believe I forgot that the Inland Waters Directorate, when it was strong, was in Burlington, Ontario and did wonderful work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548034">I am not comforted by what I have heard so far. Yes, we have the Experimental Lakes Area and it does great work and, yes, I am glad we stopped the Harper government from destroying it. However, the Canada water agency needs to be independent of other departments of government. It needs to be properly funded. We need to understand what is happening to our water. Even if we were not looking at a climate crisis, our approach to fresh water in this country has been pathetic for decades. We now are in a climate crisis, which is a water crisis, and the Canada water agency is urgently needed and must be properly funded.</ParaText>

Again, I take many of her points and ultimately we will see much of that reflected when the Canada water agency is established.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548036">Just in closing, creating the Canada water agency presents a unique opportunity for Canada to work with provinces, territories, indigenous peoples, local authorities, scientists and others to strengthen collaboration and find the best ways to keep our water safe, clean and well managed. As I have said already, in my intervention today, we will be seeing some good news in the coming weeks.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7548037">Mr. Speaker, over the course of the parliamentary break, we have all had an opportunity to talk to people in our communities and across the country, and it is clear that, after eight years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> economic and social policies, many people are hurting. There are many people who are struggling in various ways, especially under the profound weight of inflation, and they are asking for all of us to look for solutions that empower them to have jobs and opportunity, and to see their tax dollars respected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548038">At the same time, we are seeing continuing outrageous extravagance in spending from this government. While Canadians are struggling, the government has been spending so much more, not on helping Canadians, but on things that serve the government's interest, and enrich and empower its friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548039">I am asking a follow-up tonight on a question I asked earlier about spending $6,000 a night for a single hotel room. The government spent $6,000 a night on a single hotel room. We asked who stayed in that hotel room. There was some implication that it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but we do not know that for sure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548040">I also mentioned in my question the $54 million spent on the development of an app, the ArriveCAN app, which did not work very well and did more to impede Canadians in their travel than actually facilitate the effective prevention of the transmission of COVID. In any event, if that was the piece of technology the situation called for, which I do not think it was, but if it was, it could have been developed much more quickly at a much lower price and probably be much more effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548041">However, we are seeing this trend in outrageous government spending on friends of the government, on external contractors, at a time when Canadians are suffering, which was the question I had asked earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548042">Today, of course, what is big in the news is the fact that the government spent over $100 million in outsourced contracts to McKinsey and Company. I would remind members that McKinsey is managed by Dominic Barton, a close friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and someone who is simultaneously chairing the Prime Minister's economic growth council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548043">Effectively, Dominic Barton, as the head of McKinsey, is both an adviser to the government and a vendor for the government. With great fanfare, the Prime Minister said that he was only paid a dollar a year for his position leading the economic growth council. Only a dollar a year, but meanwhile we have over $100 million in outsourced contracts over the life of this government so far to McKinsey. We asked today what the exact amount of it was. The government would not provide that number, and it keeps going up every time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548044">After eight years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canadians are struggling economically. They are struggling under the weight of inflation, which the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the former Governor of the Bank of Canada all say is domestically caused. They are struggling under the weight of those policies. Meanwhile, we are seeing outrageous profligate spending on contracts to friends of the government going out to the McKinsey, $54 million for the ArriveCAN app and $6,000 a night for a hotel room.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548045">Therefore, I want to ask the parliamentary secretary this: How does he and other members of the government face their constituents, who are facing these challenges, and justify this kind of outrageous, unaccountable, nonsensical spending?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7548046">Mr. Speaker, happy new year to you and to my friend from Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548047">As was stated by the <Affiliation DbId="293797" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, our government makes every effort to ensure that spending on official trips is both responsible and transparent. The official Canadian delegation included former prime ministers and the Governor General. All members of this delegation stayed at the same hotel, which was uniquely able to accommodate the size of the delegation during levels of extremely high demand, as members can imagine. Literally the entire world was heading to England for the Queen's funeral at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548048">I have not prepared exactitudes on any McKinsey things today, but I do know that there was at least one contract that was issued where McKinsey was tasked to find some savings in a government program and it found $350 million in savings and $178 million of that has been implemented to date. I can get more details. I was not prepared to discuss McKinsey tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548049">I personally had the opportunity as well to connect with my own constituents over the holidays and know that household budgets are being stretched by increases in interest rates, higher rents and higher food prices. Many of these challenges are global challenges created by external stressors, which include lingering effects of the COVID pandemic and, of course, Putin's illegal war in Ukraine. Impacts on the cost of food and energy have been especially significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548050">We do have some good news, however. While inflation is high, it has started to go down in Canada. Inflation was 8.1% in June and now is 6.3%. It is still high but it is heading in the right direction and it is lower than what we see in many of our peer economies. The United States still has inflation of 6.5%, the euro area of 9.2%, the United Kingdom of 10.5% and the OECD is also above 10% on average. While increased interest rates present their own burden, especially after rising from historic lows, private sector economists expect inflation to ease toward the 2% inflation target over the next two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548051">Canada's underlying economy is still very strong and that gives us the ability to help those who were most impacted by these challenges. In fact, Canada has created more than 659,000 jobs since the start of the pandemic and we have retained our AAA credit rating. We also have the lowest deficit and the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. However, inflation in Canada is still too high and Canadians need help to make ends meet. This is why we have provided targeted relief while ensuring that our measures do not further increase inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548052">For example, we doubled the GST credit for 11 million Canadians who need it the most. This is a great example to start with, of course, because my friend opposite also voted and supported that particular measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548053">In addition, we launched the Canada dental benefit for children under 12 with family incomes below $90,000. This will allow up to 500,000 kids to get their teeth fixed. I am pleased to report tonight that 153,000 families have already utilized the program. This is in addition to our child care investments that were just being debated in this House. I am happy to report that just today it was announced that 12,700 $10-a-day child care spaces are now available in British Columbia with more spaces opening up every day across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548054">Despite these supports, our government is continuing to run a tight fiscal ship. As I stated previously, we are able to make these investments because we have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratios in the G7. At the same time, we have committed to saving $9 billion from government spending through budget 2022. As Canadians are cutting back in their costs, it is prudent that our government do the same. We will do that. We will make life more affordable for all Canadians right across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7548055">Mr. Speaker, here are the facts. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has more than doubled the national debt in his eight years in office. The Prime Minister has run up more debt in these eight years than all of the previous prime ministers had up until that point. That is the reality of the legacy of the Prime Minister. That is causing inflation. It is causing Canadians to suffer. Of course, some other countries have pursued similar kinds of policies and they are experiencing the same challenges as a result. However, there is a better way. That is to control spending and focus on what is truly important to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548056">Much of the growth in spending we have seen, as I talked about, has been to outside consultants. We have dramatic growth in the core public service but, at the same time, we have a government contracting out to consulting firms like McKinsey that it is personally close with for services that are supposed to be done in the core public service. That is driving inflation and driving paying Canadians' experience.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7548059">Mr. Speaker, I know Groundhog Day is not until Thursday, but it sure feels like it, because I keep having to drag the government in here at the end of the day to answer to Canadians on why it has not delivered on its mental health transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548060">We have a system that is overburdened and stretched to the max. I just had the leader of the NDP in my riding. We went to a round table on seniors' health. We listened to the stresses on the system in long-term care, in the health care system, but we also heard from physicians, and members know that in their ridings physicians are saying that they do not have the supports when it comes to mental health and when it comes to social workers and psychotherapy, and this is causing a huge unnecessary burden on the health care system. It is backing up our ERs. We heard that directly from physicians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548061">I met with the Nuu-Chah-Nulth Tribal Council, with the Huu-ay-aht First Nation, the Hupacasath and the Sechelt. At Sechelt they hosted a meeting, and they said their top priority is ensuring there are mental health supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548062">The New Democrats will kick and scream and drag the government back here every night, if we have to, until the transfer is delivered. We will use every tool in the tool box. The Liberals promised $4.5 billion of new money over five years to help support those with mental health issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548063">I not only heard from first nations, but I actually went into my own doctor's office and asked my doctor how it is impacting him in serving his clients and the overall community. He said that over 50% of the people who were coming to his office were having a health-related issue related to either mental health or substance use. He said that he cannot be a social worker. He said that people are leaving the field. He said nurses are leaving the field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548064">Right now, in a health crisis, we need to do everything we can to take the pressure off those who need supports that are physical-related and ensure those who have mental health issues are getting supports that are mental health-related. Meanwhile, people are dying. I got a message from a good friend of mine who lost her son this week. She said we need treatment centres, not more police. We need investments in mental health supports. The government keeps promising it is going to deliver that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548065">There was a joint report by the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction. They found that almost 35% of residents reported moderate to severe mental health concerns. Fewer than one in three people experiencing mental health issues were accessing services, and they said that financial constraints were a big part of that. As we know, we are potentially heading into a recession. People are struggling. Mental health issues are getting worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548066">Establishing the Canada mental health transfer was a key election promise. It was the second thing on the list in the mandate letter for the <Affiliation DbId="278900" Type="4">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions</Affiliation>. The government promised that $875 million would be transferred by 2023. There has not been a dollar of new money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548067">What are we going to hear from the government members? They are going to pat themselves on the back from old money. They are not going to have delivered on the new money they promised. It has not happened. It is costing lives. People are dying, and it is unnecessary. The government needs to do the right thing. The Liberals are wastefully spending money instead of prioritizing the health of Canadians, taking pressure off our health care system and investing in mental health when Canadians need it the most.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7548081">Mr. Speaker, like I said, we know Thursday is Groundhog Day, but the government decided today is Groundhog Day. We heard the same response and the same old thing. Liberals are patting themselves on the backs about money they promised from before and are spending, but look at the results. The results speak for themselves with overcrowded ERs and doctors having to do social work who need help. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548082">People are dying as a result of the government's inaction. It failed to deliver a dollar of the promised new money. I actually do not believe it is going to do it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has directed his ministers to spend less money, and I think he is going to cut. The government has no intention of delivering on this transfer. It has been over a year and a half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548083">The U.K. and France spend about 12% on mental health. We spend between 5% and 7%. It is time for the government to respond. It needs to answer to Canadians on why it has not delivered on this promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7548084">I will be back. I will be back at every opportunity to hold them to account until they deliver the mental health supports people desperately need.</ParaText>
