              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-370. Introduction and first reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText>He said: Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278564" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> for seconding my bill today. I am honoured to rise to introduce the bringing home justice for victims of serious crimes act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are few things more frustrating to law enforcement than to have the legal right to access potential evidence but the inability to get that evidence. That evidence is often locked behind a virtual locked door of encryption. This can impede the investigation of critical files, such as for child sexual exploitation and human trafficking. It denies justice to the victims of these serious crimes, many of whom are children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This bill would allow a judge to make an order to compel a person to unlock their device in a narrow range of specific serious offences where law enforcement has already received a warrant to access the information on that device. As technology continues to progress, Parliament must ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This legislation would give law enforcement a previously unavailable tool to ensure critical evidence for serious crimes by unlocking electronic devices. When I have spoken to members of law enforcement and child protection organizations, they have made it clear that this tool would be a game-changer when it comes to securing justice for child victims of serious crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to thank the individuals from both the justice community and child advocacy community who have helped draft this bill. The work they do every day is so important. Let us bring home justice for victims of serious crimes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Farmers' markets are a key tool for COVID–19 recovery as small business incubators, domestic system and food security builders and local economy community builders. These coupon programs are a key support for new market development and for existing markets and their provincial associations. In B.C., the Association of Farmers' Markets, with its 135 member markets and 4,000-plus vendors, helps 16,000 vulnerable families, seniors and pregnant women to access weekly coupons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call for a national matching program that would support all provincial market coupon programs and would match provinces that already have contributing programs. This would help tackle poverty, support local farmers and help provide healthy food to the most vulnerable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The petitioners bring to the government's attention the new Statistics Canada data from 2022 that indicates one in four children in Canada lives in a food insecure household. They remind us that Canada is the only G7 country without a national school food program and that school food programs are recognized around the world as essential to the health, well-being and education of students, with over 388 million children in at least 161 countries receiving food or subsidized school meals at their school.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, Canadians are hungry for Parliament to pass today's common-sense Conservative motion that the House call on the government to immediately repeal the carbon tax on farmers, first nations and families. When I say they are hungry for us to pass this motion, I mean it literally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here are the facts: Two million Canadians used a food bank in a single month in Canada. Since 2016, there has been an 82% increase in the number of workers in Ontario using food banks. A single mother of two in Sydney, Nova Scotia, said this: “Well, this month, I had to choose between eating and having heat. My kids are getting fed, but my house is freezing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For the first time in 60 years, according to the Bank of Montreal, rents in Canada are outpacing income. Halifax now has 35 homeless encampments. Ironically, this is in the province of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> own <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to an article, Dalhousie University's Agri-Food Analytics Lab says that buying holiday foods this year will be “an expensive proposition”. A growing number of Canadians are forced to work two jobs. Rafid Khan is a full-time student who works full-time for a not-for-profit and has a second job at a car rental company. He said, “You can just hear your body scream for more rest”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I travel this country, I see the young, emaciated working-class people who clearly have lost weight and have black bags under their eyes from fatigue. I bump into them in airport lobbies at 11 p.m.; they tell me they are entering their 16th or 17th hour of work that day. It is not because they are squirrelling away for a down payment on a home; they have long given up on that. It is because they must work non-stop just to feed themselves and to pay their rent to avoid becoming homeless. In the meantime, they are hopeless; they see no light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Trevor Moss, CEO of the Central Okanagan Food Bank, talked about food bank usage in his community. He said that they are projecting another 100% increase in the next three or four months because of inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Cynthia Boulter, chief operating officer of the Greater Vancouver Food Bank, said, “We see parents who are skipping meals so that their children can eat. We see people who haven't eaten in days. We see seniors who haven't had produce in months”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Christine MacCallum, a resident of Marshfield, P.E.I., said that they do not buy orange juice as often as they used to; that is a luxury after eight years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Patrick Gallagher is a part-time worker living in a homeless shelter. He said, “‘I lived in my car six, seven months and then came here,’ adding that he is not sure how he will ever afford his own place.” He said, “The rents are really high. It’s hard to find places”. This is someone who still works part time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have met carpenters who live in parking lots. When we have an economy where the people who build our homes cannot afford to live in them, it is a fundamentally unjust system; something must change. Indeed, Canadians are literally hungering for that change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is life after eight years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government. This is the misery that Canadians are living. This is eight years after he promised he would help the middle class and those working hard to join them. Do members remember those people? We do not hear about them anymore. Now that he has their votes, he does not need to worry about them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The reason he would never mention the middle class and those working hard to join it is, obviously, that the whole nation would break down into simultaneous laughter and tears. The irony that this man would talk about the middle class after he robbed people of their birthright in Canada, to own a home if they worked hard and nourish their family with good food, would be both hilarious and tragic. These are things we took for granted eight years ago. Now, Canadians are forced to desperately cling to these things. What is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise now? It is to quadruple the carbon tax on the farmers who feed our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us talk about the impact this is having. Just today, we have a new report from Canada's “food professor”. Professor Charlebois of Dalhousie University produced a report indicating that, next year, Canadians will spend 701 more dollars to feed their families. This is on top of the 20% food price inflation we have had just in the last couple of years. Next year, the average family of four will need to spend $16,297 to feed their children and themselves. Projections from this report indicate that, for the coming year, food inflation will be between 2.5% and 4.5%, on top of the pre-existing food price increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Liberals will say inflation is coming down. Prices are going up. The 20% increase in the cost of food is not going away. The 2% to 4% increase that will come this year will be compounded on top of the previous increases. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he might be quadrupling the carbon tax on farmers and truckers who bring us our food, but we should not worry. He is having meetings with CEOs of grocery chains. That clearly has not worked, because food prices continue to go up again after the dozens of promises that he would make food more affordable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the answer is approximately 133 first nations. That is the number taking the government to court because the carbon tax violates their constitutional rights. Now first nations are fighting the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in court again. They are forced to spend their limited resources hiring lawyers, not because they want to but because they know their people will not be able to heat their homes in their cold, and often remote, communities. They will not be able to fill up their pickup trucks to go to work, which they need if they are going to work in rural and remote areas in logging, fisheries, mining and agriculture. Naturally, these first nations are fighting for their constitutional rights to heat their homes, feed their families and travel to work.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to speak in this place, and of course to follow the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton, and his wise words. He did end on the issue of first nations, which are now taking the government to court, at least 133 of them, bands represented by the Ontario chiefs, to fight what they are calling the discriminatory carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First and foremost, I think we can all agree it is crucial to recognize the undeniable commitment of indigenous peoples to environmental stewardship and sustainability. Of course, many communities have deep connections to the land, and have for generations practised a harmonious relationship with nature. It comes to that, which is supposed to be the allegedly most important relationship for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the one with indigenous peoples, but there are now 133 Ontario chiefs taking the government to court. It is not necessarily something they want to do; it is something they are forced to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The following is a headline from APTN: “Chiefs of Ontario ask for judicial review of a carbon price regime.” I will read the first paragraph, because it highlights quite perfectly exactly what I want to speak to: “First Nations leaders in Ontario say Canada needs to fix what they call a ‘discriminatory’ carbon price system, arguing the federal government failed to address their repeated concerns and blocked their exemption request only to then issue a carveout [to other parts of] Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is quite clear. The next quote builds on what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was just saying about the fact that first nations leaders are not consulted despite the repeated comments of the government. It reads, “A First Nation leader called the move ‘completely avoidable’ if the federal government had only ‘showed up to the table.’” That is a quote from Abram Benedict, Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne and the head of the Chiefs of Ontario's environmental portfolio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are Ontario groups saying that they are disproportionately hurt by the carbon price tax. They are saying that they are willing to work with the government to come to a solution, yet the government does not even want to have that conversation. It will call anyone else “colonial”, but that is peak colonialism right there. The government refuses to show up at the table and negotiate with first nations communities, which have to pay the carbon tax that is causing the price of heating, eating and travelling to go up unnecessarily. However, they are not getting the break if they live on reserve. They do not get the rebate, so they are paying more and getting less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is even worse with the government is that its department of Indigenous Services Canada has actually doubled in bureaucrats. There are almost 9,000 people working in the department, yet according to its own departmental data, it is hitting only 18% of its stated goals. In what other place on this planet can one get away with hitting 18% of one's goals? We have asked the <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> many times to answer that question. There is no clear answer, but I can tell members what happens: The targets are actually moved down the road, so if it is not completed this year, it is just moved to next year and the year after that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The lives of indigenous peoples, under the current government, are not getting any better. The move by the Ontario chiefs proves that. The claim by the government that people are better off, with more money in their pockets because the rebates give them more, is not true. The Parliamentary Budget Officer confirmed that. The Ontario chiefs lawsuit proves the example yet again. The government's plan to continue to increase the carbon tax year after year is not making people better. Emissions are going up. The government does not have an environmental plan; it has a tax plan, one that is making the lives of Canadians, whether indigenous or non-indigenous, miserable. It is spreading the misery around. It is probably easy for the government. Under its policies, it cannot seem to encourage more people to start businesses because, under this tax system, the more one makes, the more the government takes, so it will just keep spreading the misery and bringing people down. Those people are the middle class. Those are the people who are hurting the most.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> decided to take a nice trip to the UAE to talk about reducing emissions. It is interesting that he can sit and lecture others about trying to live their lives, pointing his finger at others who are trying to maybe take a vacation if they work all year around, and trying to feed their families, for crying out loud. Nowadays, food bank usage is through the roof. Expenses are through the roof. Rent and mortgages are through the roof. The minister has the audacity to look at others and say, “How dare you get on that plane?” He bemoans the wealth of others for maybe creating a job through a small business or two, creating opportunity in their community, then tells them they cannot see the fruits of their labour. He will take all that life has to offer. I bet that the environment minister ate at the best restaurants and stayed at the finest hotels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now, there are 133 Ontario chiefs taking the government to court because it would not sit at the table and negotiate on a way forward, something that should be common sense to the government. It had to get to the point where these communities have to use money that would be better spent on providing services for their people. They now have to use it to go to court just to try to stop the misery the government is inflicting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In April 2022, the Auditor General, in what is called by many a scathing report on carbon pricing, found that indigenous groups were disproportionately burdened by the Liberal carbon tax. In section 5.60, the report states:</ParaText>

The Fuel Charge cost to First Nations citizens amounts to another cash grab for Canada, removing several million dollars a year from those [people who are] least responsible for the climate crisis.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That pretty much says it all. The hurt is real for first nations communities. There is not more money in their pockets because of the current government. The housing crisis has not gone away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government leaves opportunities and passes them by. Leaders from Germany and Japan came to the government, saying that they would like to buy our energy. Who would benefit from that energy, in a lot of cases? First nations communities would, through jobs, opportunity, investment and equity stake. The government just fluffed off the Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Minister of Japan, saying, “No, you can buy your energy somewhere else.” Selling our energy would have provided some much-needed relief for indigenous communities, but the government, like the carbon tax, ignores the needs, wishes and desires of first nations communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The member, in his election platform, indicated to his voters that he supported a price on pollution. How does he justify the 180° flip-flop on that issue?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the carbon tax regime that the Liberal member opposite seems to keep promoting is not working. The fact that emissions keep going up is the problem. If the stated goal is to impose the carbon tax but emissions keep going up and people are suffering as a result, maybe it is time to rethink the position and the fact that it is not working. Maybe we should be investing more or opening up the free market to more technology and more rapid innovation to get to the world of more clean energy, but we can do that only if there is an equal playing field that allows the market to provide. This is something the government is not doing; it is taking, and redistributing only to ideas that match what the Liberal ideology is. That is the problem.</ParaText>

I will tell members what it is like in my riding, where the Nuu-chah-nulth went to court to actually exercise their constitutionally protected rights to fish so they could feed their kids. What did the Conservatives do when in power? They fought them; they spent millions of dollars fighting them in court. When the Nuu-chah-nulth won in court, what did the Conservatives do? They appealed. Not once but twice did the courts side with the Nuu-chah-nulth. All that the people wanted to do was get back on the water and fish to feed their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The MP who sat in the House before me did not say “Nuu-chah-nulth” once in 15 years. The Nuu-chah-nulth felt unheard and invisible in this place. I have said “Nuu-chah-nulth" 94 times. Will the Conservatives support the Nuu-chah-nulth? Will they support nations that have won in court to defend their constitutionally protected rights to feed their kids, or will they continue supporting litigation against indigenous people?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I always appreciate the opportunity to provide some thoughts with respect to Conservative opposition day motions. One thing I have recognized is that nothing has really changed. Time and time again, the Conservatives want to push the issue of what they classify as a tax. They say “cut the tax”, that bumper sticker about which I have talked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In fact, in looking through social media, we see the big blue signs. We see how the Conservatives have tried to amplify and simplify that message. This is a message of deception. It is often the type of thing I would hear when I listened to Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, the messaging and types of speeches he would deliver. It is like a flashback.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I see the Conservative Party catering more and more to the far right, the MAGA right, if I can put it that way. I have made reference to how that right has virtually taken over the leadership of the Conservative Party today and the office of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. Other that the Canada-Ukraine issue, it is difficult to imagine many other issues on which the Conservative Party is so out of tune and prepared to mislead Canadians on public policy than its “axe the tax” slogan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For people who are following the debate, I would encourage them to listen to what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> actually has said. When he was trying to appeal to people, he was using examples. He talked about this individual or that individual. He gave the impression that if we axed the tax, if we took away the price on pollution, we would be so much better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Yep.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Madam Speaker, one member from the Conservative Party has confirmed exactly what I have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is just not true, yet the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> travels the country to spread that kind of information. I thought that style of politics was just south of the border, in the United States, where it was amplified by Donald Trump. Now we have the leader of the Conservative Party trying to out do Donald Trump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us think about his comments. He says that it is more affordable for people if we get rid of the price on pollution, if we axe the tax. I represent roughly 95,000 people in Winnipeg North, although it may be starting to grow a bit more and is getting closer to that 100,000 mark. Over 80% of the residents I represent get a net benefit because of the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says he will get rid of the price on pollution, that also means he will get rid of the environmental rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer is an independent, non-partisan office, with professional civil servants. It has made it very clear that over 80% of people have a net benefit because of the rebates. That is the reality and that is what we hear from the independent budget officer of the House of Commons. In Winnipeg North, it is even a little greater.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, when the member tries to give examples, when he says what about this person or that person, most of the people he is referencing get a net benefit because of the rebate. If we take away the price on pollution, or axe the tax, as the Conservatives call it, we take money out of the pockets and purses of 80% of the constituents I represent.</ParaText>

That is a nice way of saying they are spreading misinformation for those who might ask me the question.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is misinformation. Many would say it is misleading. Let me put it this way. A constituent of mine is told that 80% of Canadians will receive more money back than they pay for the price on pollution, and that has been affirmed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer. However, the Conservatives, including the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party, who is leading the Donald Trump charge, are saying that getting rid of the price on pollution is going to put more money in the pockets of Canadians, and that is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How would members classify that? I cannot be bold and blunt about what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> is saying, because it would be unparliamentary. However, if we look at the information the leader is talking about, it is misleading Canadians. At the end of the day, everything the Conservative Party is doing today seems to be focused on that one issue. It is completely ignoring the environment. We are waiting to see any form of a climate plan from the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The last time I can recall the Conservatives standing in the chamber talking about their environmental plan was when Erin O'Toole was their leader, and they said they supported a price on pollution. A Conservative member just asked where he is. The Conservatives kicked him out and he is no longer around. There have been a few Conservative leaders, but they really like the current one. Maybe it is because of the far-right element. Most, if not all, Conservatives seem to be onside with moving to the far right, and it is at great cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I pointed out, all Conservatives who campaigned in the election two years ago made it very clear that they supported a price on pollution. It was in their election platform. However, that has changed. That is a fact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the ways that the Conservative Party is offside and maybe do bit of contrast for members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we look at the emissions graph, over the last number of years we have witnessed a shift. The curve is now starting to bend in a direction that I believe Canadians would be very supportive. Had there not been a change in government back in 2015, and under Stephen Harper's leadership, the curve would have continued up by an estimated nine points. Over the last number of years, the line has gone down by seven points under this administration. We are going in the right direction when it comes to greenhouse emissions, which is an important issue to Canadians. In real numbers, I am told it is like 53 megatonnes. For my constituents who are like me, I try to better understand what that means. That is the equivalent of 11 million cars being taken off the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The population of Manitoba is about 1.3 million people. The population of Saskatchewan, I would guesstimate, is probably somewhere around 1.15 million. The population of the province of Alberta is well over three million, from what I can recall. We could take away every vehicle in the Prairies. Over the last number of years that is 53 megatonnes of GHG, or 11 million vehicles. To me, that speaks volumes about what the government has been able to achieve in a relatively short time span. We were able to achieve that through providing different forms of incentives and programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to highlight the fact that we know Canadians want to participate. I have heard this for many years. I remember being in the Manitoba legislature and we were talking about banning plastic bags. We can look at the banning of single-use plastics, on which this government has moved forward, or our budget measures on financial incentives to support people. Our constituents would like to do more on the environmental front. We have programs like the greener homes grant. The uptake has been fantastic. A number of people in all regions of the country are participating in a program that will ultimately reduces greenhouse gas emissions, again, a budgetary measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another program is about electric vehicles. It is interesting when we look at the numbers. Canadians are choosing electric vehicles faster than expected, with 10% of new vehicles being ZEVs in the first half of 2023. These types of vehicles are a dependable form of transportation, with lower operating costs and reducing the environmental footprint. In its budget measures, the federal government has provided incentives. Some of the provinces have done likewise. Canadians are taking advantage of those programs. We have seen a high demand for those vehicles. I would suggest that it has been very successful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>When I think of how industry has benefited, two companies that come to mind right away are Stellantis, with the benefits that are being created there, and Volkswagen. Volkswagen is a substantial investment of a private company and both federal and provincial governments. Today, we have the Conservative Party opposing the agreement that we achieved with Volkswagen, contrary to even Doug Ford, but there is a difference, I guess, as the provincial party is a little more progressive than the federal Conservative Party. However, at the end of the day, we can think of the results and the potential that is there when we get companies around the world recognizing that Canada is on the right track when it comes to dealing with emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Volkswagen, in many ways, is one of the leaders in the world moving forward in the electrification of vehicles. It made a decision not to go to the United States but to come to Canada and make a serious investment. Once that investment is complete, it will be the largest manufacturing processing facility in Canada and, I am told, even in North America. I think it will be something like 200 football fields. It is going to be a huge plant. We can think of the types of green jobs that are going to be there as a direct result of Volkswagen making that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Where is the Conservative Party? It actually opposed what the federal government has done with Volkswagen. Its members do not like the fact that the federal government made a decision to make a financial contribution, even though the Progressive Conservative provincial government of Ontario has done likewise, not to mention the community of St. Thomas itself, which has also come to the table because of infrastructure. This brings real life to an industry that has the potential to grow, and the Conservatives and the climate deniers are completely offside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is not just the province of Ontario that would benefit. We can think of the minerals involved and the other components. It is not just Ontario or the St. Thomas community that is going to benefit from this. All of Canada, if not directly, will indirectly benefit from this, and it does not stop there. I think of Stellantis and how, in Canada, the industry of electrification of vehicles continues to grow, and those two companies are not alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is it any wonder that today we lead the G7 in foreign investment coming into Canada? As a political entity, the Government of Canada recognizes that green jobs are golden jobs going forward, and we need to see those types of investments. As a government, from day one, we have supported Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. We want an economy that is going to work for everyone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As the Conservative Party's single focus seems to be on spreading misinformation, filibustering and ultimately playing a destructive force on the floor of the House of Commons, we will continue to be solely focused on having the backs of Canadians and providing the jobs that are going to be there for the future to ensure that life remains affordable and to deal with the issues that we know are important to Canadians. That means, in good part, dealing with the environment in a very real and tangible way.</ParaText>

On the other hand, every time the Liberals rise to speak about climate change, they make it seem like everything is hunky-dory, like it is all a bed of roses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada is one the worst countries at fighting climate change. It is the only G7 country whose emissions have not dropped since 1990. According to a study by the International Monetary Fund, which can hardly be described as a far left environmental group, in 2022, Canada directly or indirectly invested $50 billion in the oil industry. I would like to ask my colleague how many social housing units he thinks $50 billion could have built.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, regarding the first aspect of the member's question, that is why I reinforced at the beginning of my comments that the real objective for the Conservative Party is to have a bumper sticker that reads, “Axe the tax”. That is really what the Conservatives are hoping to achieve. On getting rid of the price on pollution, the related facts are completely irrelevant to the Conservative Party. That is unfortunate because there is so much misinformation being spread throughout the country regarding what the Conservative Party is actually doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, here is what the Liberal government is actually doing. This morning, after a two-year wait, it finally unveiled its plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector, the emissions cap it has been touting. However, it is worse than anything we could have imagined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two years ago, the government said that Canadian society as a whole would have to cut its GHG emissions by 40% to 45%, but that the oil and gas sector would only have to cut its emissions by 31%. Today, we learn that that figure is no longer 31% but 16% to 20%, that the industry has no obligations to meet until 2030, and that it is free to increase oil and gas production in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would not necessarily say that is fully accurate. I was very encouraged about today's announcement, and if I had had more time, I would have really gone into it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government is looking at a regulated cap-and-trade system to be established under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It would apply to all upstream oil and gas production, including offshore development as well as liquefied gas operations. Together, this represents approximately 85% of the sector's total emissions. The proposed system would include two limits: an emissions cap and a higher legal upper bound. Facilities can emit more than the emissions cap, up to the legal upper bound, by using offsets or contributing to a new decarbonization fund that would support additional reductions in the sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a lot more information available on what the government has announced today. It is a good day. It is also part of what I said earlier, which is that the government is focused on dealing with the environment. We do have a plan on the environment, unlike the official opposition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I wanted to go back to the piece my hon. colleague mentioned about the carbon price tax not being a tax. The carbon pricing regime on fuel charge is not a tax in constitutional terms, according to the Supreme Court of Canada. It is revenue neutral due to the rebate program and climate action incentive funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What this looks like in my home province is Eel Ground first nation, or Natoaganeg, a Mi'kmaq community, receiving funding to complete energy efficiency upgrades and retrofitting its band office. Also, five schools in New Brunswick have seen the Government of Canada investing carbon pricing proceeds into improve energy efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is what is at stake, so I would like to bring the facts back to the conversation. Could the hon. colleague comment on that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam. Speaker, the Conservative Party of Canada is so focused on getting rid of the price on pollution that its members are actually voting against the Canada-Ukraine trade agreement. The excuse they are using is that it is because they do not believe there should be a price on pollution in Ukraine. Ukraine has had a price on pollution since 2011. That is how ridiculously reckless the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party is. He is prepared to vote against, for the first time ever, a trade agreement between Ukraine and Canada at a time of war in Europe because they have a price on pollution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The price on pollution is something the world is moving toward. Only the leader of the Conservative Party cannot conceptualize the negative impact his reckless policy and irresponsible approach to the Canada-Ukraine trade agreement are having, not only here in Canada, but also abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, where to start? I would like to make a little detour before addressing my Conservative colleagues' motion. I would like to provide a bit of context for the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In my opinion, if we want to understand the context, we need to look at the current situation. We are in a climate crisis. There are two possibilities. Either the Conservatives recognize that we are in a climate crisis and commit to taking action to mitigate it, or they do not recognize that we are in a climate crisis. Our main problem is that, ever since the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> became leader of the Conservative Party, the official opposition has been using disinformation as their preferred political tool. As a result, we cannot have conversations about global warming with our Conservative colleagues. Whenever we try to, they become irrational. My colleagues will understand why I say this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In my former life, I taught political science. The introductory course for first-year political science students teaches a simple concept. It teaches them what democracy is. To explain what democracy is, I would tell them that one of the key principles is that it is better to use reason rather than force. That is what democracy is. Democracy means people deliberating together. It means people having a dialogue to determine what is best for the common good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For several years now, we have been witnessing the Americanization of Canadian politics. Dialogue no longer takes precedence over threats or over the imposition of ideas. Whoever is the strongest tries to impose their law using intimidation. That is how the United States currently operates. I do not want to compare the leader of the official opposition to Donald Trump right now. Let us set that aside. I do not want to compare the leader of the official opposition to Marine Le Pen or any of those other politicians in the western world whose questionable tactics involve taking liberties with the truth to avoid entering into discussions with counterparts who often think differently. I say this because dialogue is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reason I am bringing up this topic is that we reached the bottom of the barrel yesterday. When I was younger, my mother often used to say that all things pass, meaning even a person's stupidity eventually comes to an end. I hope that we reached the bottom of the barrel yesterday. Yesterday, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources was carrying out its clause-by-clause study of Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C-50</Document>. I have been involved in Quebec and Canadian politics since the early 1990s and, although I have always kept a close eye on parliamentary proceedings, I have never in my life seen anything as sophomoric as what I saw yesterday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a key principle. We can raise questions of privilege in the House because we feel that members have the right to be heard. Letting members speak, letting members vote, is a key principle of democracy. However, even this key principle, which is fundamental to democracy, was not respected yesterday. I heard Conservative members yelling to ensure that no committee member would be able to cast a vote during clause-by-clause consideration. Worse than that, I saw some highly questionable actions on the part of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation>—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I do not even have to show the House what I am talking about, because the Conservatives are doing it for me. They use this same tactic day after day at the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Earlier, I heard a Conservative say that he was just having a nice, quiet discussion with one of his colleagues. If members want to know what Conservatives think is a quiet discussion, they should have a look at the video of our meeting yesterday at the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. They will see what my Conservative colleagues consider a nice, quiet discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I was saying before I was interrupted, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation> behaved in a highly questionable way. He tried to intimidate the Bloc Québécois whip and the members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to prevent them from speaking to a bill. As I was saying earlier, we have been dealing with this type of behaviour in the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for more than a month now. We are never sure whose turn it is to speak, which is frankly ridiculous. When I put all that together, I see what I call the “Carleton method”. It is the approach used by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, and it is based on two major but very simple strategies: on the one hand, we have intimidation and, on the other, disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I said in my introduction, we are now at a turning point. In the face of climate change, the actions that we should take immediately will have an irreversible impact on future generations. When political parties use intimidation and disinformation in this kind of context, the only outcome is disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What I am trying to do this morning is to appeal to the sense of responsibility of each and every parliamentarian. Every parliamentarian should perhaps look beyond the end of their nose and beyond the next election. They should think about their children and future generations. Unfortunately, more and more members have become extremely short-sighted, behaving like lobbyists for the oil and gas sector and refusing to listen to science, which is clearly showing us that climate change will have harmful effects on us. There are members who behave that way, who do not have the will or the integrity to tackle the problem before us head on, and who prefer to use intimidation and disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I can think of a number of examples. One of the focuses of today's debate is Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C‑234</Document>. We saw an intimidation campaign by Conservative senators against two of their colleagues, Bernadette Clement and Chantal Petitclerc. Worse yet, I can say that I saw on the Conservatives' monitor in the lobby a photo of the two senators as if on wanted posters. We sometimes see wanted posters for criminals. The goal was of course to post these images on social media to instigate an intimidation campaign against the senators in question. We all know how social media works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I was saying earlier, that is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s method. Not so long ago, we were alerted to what the member for Carleton was capable of. The people who warned us about how the member for Carleton operates were also members from Quebec, in particular the member for <Affiliation DbId="278236" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation>. He indicated a number of times that he had never seen a more hateful campaign than the one he was the victim of in his own riding. People took it upon themselves to incite the public to call him and intimidate him. As we know, the member for Richmond—Arthabaska is a former Conservative member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="278452" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> also warned us. I will quote him, and it is a quote that applies perfectly to what I witnessed yesterday in committee. Here is what he said about the last Conservative leadership race: “I have never seen such an aggressive race or such vicious personal attacks”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Well, to borrow the member for <Affiliation DbId="278452" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation>'s own words, I have never seen such aggressive and vicious discussions and such savage personal attacks as I witnessed yesterday in committee.</ParaText>

Upon closer inspection, however, through all the rhetoric, what the Conservatives really mean is “Axe the facts”. What they are trying to do is gloss over all the scientific data that show that we need to adopt robust measures to fight climate change to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. I have never seen a Conservative proposal to introduce carbon pricing. I have never seen the Conservative Party recognize that carbon pricing is necessary if we want to transition to a low-carbon economy. The only one who ever defended that was the former leader of the Conservative Party. Unfortunately, a few members, probably from his own party, managed to get their way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is something else I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention. I said earlier that, in my opinion, responsible elected members use reason rather than force. That is a guiding principle of democracy, which the Conservatives do not appear to respect, preferring intimidation and disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is another principle that is quite important. I believe that we were elected to defend our constituents' interests. That is critical. Every one of us must defend our constituents' interests in this House. Here is where my bewilderment stems from. I have a colleague in this House who comes from my region. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278521" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation> is a Conservative member from the Saguenay—Lac‑Saint‑Jean region. He rose in the House to ask the government to expedite the legislative process in the Senate regarding Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which is about reducing the tax on the fuels used for grain drying. It is linked to the carbon tax. Once again, as all members from my party keep saying, the carbon tax does not apply in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Yet, the president of the federation Les Producteurs de lait du Québec is in the riding of the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. He has been working tirelessly for three years with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> to have a bill passed that would stop any further breaches in supply management. This bill was passed here, in the House. It is now before the Senate. I do not want to impute motives to anyone, but we are told that Conservative senators are delaying the passage of the bill. I cannot believe that a member from the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area who counts the president of Les Producteurs de lait du Québec among his constituents would rise in the House to defend a bill that will have no effect on his fellow citizens or on Quebec politics, but remains silent what it comes to supply management. That is a fundamental violation. Today I challenge the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord to stand up in the House and ask a question or make a statement in support of the supply management bill. That is another issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We heard the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> tell us at length that in the next election campaign, the “ballot box issue” will be carbon pricing, that is the carbon tax. We will say it again: That tax does not apply in Quebec. Clean fuel pricing already exists in Quebec; it was implemented by the Quebec government itself. I cannot understand how Conservative MPs from Quebec can support such far-fetched initiatives. These initiatives will have no impact in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, I have a request for my colleagues from Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, <Affiliation DbId="278426" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>, also a Quebecker, and <Affiliation DbId="278428" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation>. I have always held the latter in high esteem. He had a career in the media and was also, at one time, a distinguished politician. I ask them to become responsible again, to set aside the Carleton method that is becoming increasingly common and to take an interest in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The people of Quebec will repay them in kind. Federal MPs from Quebec have to advance the interests of Quebec society here in the House. My sense is that, somewhere along the way, my Conservative colleagues from Quebec clearly lost their political bearings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will close by saying that the motion before us today is very similar to many of the motions we have seen in recent months. To me, this proves that the Conservative members from Quebec have no influence over their leader right now. The Conservative Party's messaging is solely focused on fossil fuels and defending the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In my opinion, the Conservative members from Quebec have very little influence. Nevertheless, I encourage them to grow a spine and stand up for the interests of Quebeckers, as my leader often says.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I do not agree with Bill <Document DbId="12525473" Type="3">C‑50</Document> as it is currently worded. The work I was trying to do yesterday was to bring forward amendments that were proposed to me by environmental groups and unions.

Over the past two years, the Liberal Party met with oil and gas lobbies 2,000 times. That is 1,000 times a year. That is over three meetings a day, without a break.

It seems like we want to give those in the oil and gas sector one last chance to line their pockets by supporting them, telling them that we will try to reduce their emissions.

              <ParaText>This holiday season comes at a very difficult time in Canada. People are struggling to get by. Food bank use is at an all-time high, and many families are unable to pay the cost of their heating bills. The Liberals are failing everyday people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>About a month ago, I was proud that the NDP presented a motion that called on the government to provide heat pumps to low and middle-income households in Canada, to remove the GST on all home heating and to implement a windfall profit tax on oil and gas companies, which are making record-breaking profits. It is shameful that there are oil and gas executives making record profits and getting millions in bonuses this holiday while Canadian workers are barely scraping by. Our NDP team is fighting to make life more affordable for everyday Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unsurprisingly, the Liberals teamed up with the Conservatives to vote against our motion. I guess this makes sense; this year, the Liberal government met with oil and gas lobbyists over 1,000 times, which is nearly three times every single day. Not only did it meet with them, but it also invited oil and gas executives to help craft its climate plan. These are the same CEOs who are fuelling the climate crisis to maximize their own profits. It is like inviting the fox to help us design our henhouse. Therefore, it is not surprising that, when it comes to fighting the climate crisis, Liberals continue to drag their feet and disappoint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians voted for a strong emissions cap on oil and gas. Now that it is finally being announced, we find out that it is full of loopholes and gaps that let oil and gas companies carry on polluting. Industry will not be asked to cut emissions in line with the government's own emissions reduction plan. There is compliance flexibility, but what this actually means is that the Liberals are making everyday Canadians and every other sector of the economy pick up the slack. The Liberals are throwing young people's future under the bus to make life easier for oil and gas CEOs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are in a climate emergency. After the worst wildfire season in this country's history, forced evacuations across the country and droughts leading to crop failures, the fact is that we are already breaking the 2°C threshold. We cannot wait any longer, and farmers are on the front lines of the fight against climate change. Few feel the impact of our changing climate more than they do. We need to ensure that they have the tools they need to keep doing their jobs. This is why I am proud to support the work of my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>, who has been working on the national soil health strategy bill. When we support farmers, the benefits in healthy food and a safer, greener environment are for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is also important to note the disproportionate impact of the increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters, such as floods, droughts and forest fires, on indigenous communities. In the last 13 years, indigenous communities have faced over 580 evacuation orders, and extreme weather events and climate-related disasters are only expected to get worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What do the Conservatives propose to do to deal with these climate-related disasters? How do they plan to support first nations, Inuit and Métis communities that are impacted by the climate crisis? The reality is that the Conservatives do not have a plan. They cannot even agree about whether climate change is real, let alone how we fight it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While indigenous communities are often on the front lines of the climate crisis, they are also facing the cost of living crisis more intensely than many other communities are. The price of groceries in remote communities is through the roof. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278704" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation> has highlighted the housing crisis in her riding as well, and her constituents are not alone. The indigenous housing crisis is a serious problem across our country. That is why we forced the Liberals to include by indigenous, for indigenous housing in budget 2023. However, so much more needs to be done. In my community, urban indigenous folks are facing a variety of unique challenges in accessing safe, affordable and culturally supportive housing. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>This is why I am so grateful that we have organizations such as the Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness. They are doing incredible work. However, without stable, ongoing funding and adequate federal funding for their projects, indigenous people in my community have been hit hard. This is an environment where inflation has been high, interest rates are skyrocketing, the cost of living keeps going up and housing is unaffordable even for people with full-time jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Victorian Native Friendship Centre is another incredible organization doing important work. Their executive director, Ron Rice, talks about how they provide housing for grandparents raising their grandchildren, youth attending post-secondary and youth transitioning out of care. He has spoken about how many of the people who stay in their shelter have at least one full-time job. The federal government needs to provide more funding and resources to these organizations, and we need a federal acquisitions fund for the community housing sector to acquire rental housing properties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is disappointing that the Liberals always drag their feet and need to be pushed into doing the right thing. At the same time, it seems that the Conservatives only listen to indigenous communities when it serves their interest. Why did the Harper government refuse to launch an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls? Why are the current Conservatives not using today to bring forward a motion about the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people or about the water crisis in indigenous communities? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why are they not calling for a solution to the indigenous housing crisis in Nunavut or the housing crisis impacting Métis communities? Inuit and Métis people are not even mentioned in their motion. There are intergenerational cycles of homelessness and colonial violence that pushed Inuit, Métis and first nations people off their lands. Why do the Conservatives only advocate for indigenous people when it is related to the carbon tax?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, I asked the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> how he responds not only to the people who are hurt by his comments from 15 years ago, to the effect that residential school survivors “need a stronger work ethic” rather than compensation, but also to first nations, Inuit and Métis people who would like him to apologize for this year, when he chose to speak to residential school deniers at a luncheon in Winnipeg. He responded by saying that he addressed those comments 15 years ago. What about his actions this year?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is clear that he is not who he says he is. These are not the actions of someone who understands or respects the needs of indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have responded adequately to the concerns of indigenous people. Neither party has responded to the Assembly of First Nations' call for an additional $30 billion in climate adaptation funding for their communities, nor has it met Métis and Inuit needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals are spending more money to help communities evacuate than they are spending to help them prevent a crisis in the first place. This is clearly unacceptable. Canada deserves better than the delay-and-disappoint Liberals or the corporate-controlled Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our New Democrat team has been calling for a rollback to the carbon tax loopholes that the Liberals gave to the biggest polluters. Instead of having loopholes, they should be made to pay their fair share. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are taking on grocery store executives. Canadians know that New Democrats are the only party that will stand up to the rich CEOs who are gouging Canadians while raking in record profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also believe that Canadians across the country deserve a break on their heating bills, which is why we are calling to remove the GST on home heating and for programs to deliver heat pumps to low and middle-income families. We are calling on the Liberals to finally implement a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies to pay for it. We are also pushing the government to engage in true reconciliation, to properly fund indigenous organizations who are doing for indigenous, by indigenous housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are pushing them to make it easier for farmers to burn cleaner fuels, which would help reduce carbon emissions, as well as to create a red dress alert to save the lives of indigenous women who are at risk. We will keep fighting for people from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

One of the problems with the national strategy is that too much money is being sent to private developers for housing that is not at all affordable, for example housing at $2,000 a month in Montreal.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> for her very interesting speech. I also thank her for all her hard work and her passion for the environmental and climate emergency files, as well as for housing and first nations issues, both in British Columbia and across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives are still pathologically obsessed with the carbon tax, which is really a price on pollution. When we talk about a price on pollution, we are clearly talking about the environment, climate emergencies and the climate crisis. Speaking of the environment, I cannot help but mention the Liberal government's announcement this morning about a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two years ago, at COP26 in Glasgow, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said we had to implement a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in the oil and gas sector. We waited two years. What we are seeing today is worse than anything we feared, worse than anything we imagined. I am sure my colleagues will believe me when I say that we have quite a rich imagination. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is appalling to ask society as a whole to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45%. In fact we could have a discussion about the proportionality and burden of responsibility of every Canadian and the Canadian economy with respect to the targets we need to reach to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees. We are heading more for 2 degrees. We should be prepared to reduce our emissions by 50% to 60%, because, per capita, Quebeckers and Canadians create a lot of pollution and produce huge amounts of greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us consider a 45% decrease. Two years ago, we were told that the oil and gas sector would probably have to reduce its emissions by 31%. That means 10% to 15% are now gone; that is a gift from the government, thank you very much. This morning we learned that the oil and gas sector no longer has to reduce its emissions by 31%, but that the Liberals would be happy with a 16% to 20% decrease. That is ridiculous. It is irresponsible for our children and for future generations. Given the climate emergency, that is a joke. Why is it a joke? Because this government listens only to lobbyists from big oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We said it yesterday, and again today: In the past two years, there have been 2,000 meetings with lobbyists and representatives from oil and gas companies. Considering there are 365 days in a year, that amounts to more than three meetings a day between oil lobbyists and the ministerial offices of a government that calls itself pro-environment. That includes Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas Day, Easter, Hanukkah and more. Then we wonder who the Liberals are listening to. There were three times more meetings between oil company representatives and the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council, Treasury Board and Finance than there were meetings with environmental groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is the root cause of what we are seeing this morning. This joke they call a “cap” is nothing but rubbish. There is nothing in it except a blank cheque to the oil companies so they can continue to do business as usual. Not only has the reduction dropped to 16% to 20%, but these corporations have no obligations until 2030. They have carte blanche for the next seven years and after that a bit of flexibility. That means they will be allowed to continue increasing production. I do not know how they are going to achieve a 16% to 20% reduction while continuing to increase production. There is so much flexibility in the document presented by the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> that it reminds me of a yoga class with people able to perform the most absolutely incredible contortions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is totally irresponsible on the part of a government that claims to care about the climate and the environment, but then puts this kind of nonsense forward this morning, even though oil and gas is the economic sector that emits the most greenhouse gases. I believe it is responsible for 24% of total emissions. That is huge, even more than transportation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The increase in Canada's greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 is mainly due to an 88% increase in emissions from the oil and gas sector. It emitted 100 million tonnes in 1990, 168 million tonnes in 2005, and 189 million tonnes in 2021. Now the government is telling the oil and gas sector that it will not have to worry for the next seven years. The government is giving it carte blanche, or should I say “carte noire”. The oil and gas sector can carry on polluting as much as it wants. There might be a target sometime around 2050, maybe. We will see. Sadly, this is consistent with the Liberals' vision and proposals since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We learned just this week that the government plans to subsidize oil companies to the tune of $12.5 billion for carbon capture technology. That is a page out of the Conservatives' playbook. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, once an environmental activist, basically copied and pasted the Conservative Party leader's plan, a far-fetched fantasy in which a magic technological wand solves all our problems. This is public money paying for this, even though we know that carbon capture technology is not proven, has not been properly tested and is not producing the promised results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need to shift toward the centre and have a strong energy sector that focuses on renewable energy. That is what the science has been telling us for years, but the Conservatives and the Liberals are going in the completely opposite direction. That is not surprising from a government that bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, which has so little future that no private sector player wanted to buy it. It was also the Liberals who saw to it that everyone here, along with the people we represent in our ridings, is paying for it. At first they were talking about $7 billion. Then it was $12 billion, then $16 billion. Now we are at $30 billion for a pipeline that, in 20 or 30 years, will no longer be used, because it will transport the dirtiest oil in the world, the most expensive to extract, and no one will want it anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is not surprising that the Liberal government is also authorizing projects like Bay du Nord, which once again means an increase in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It is not surprising that the Liberals and the Minister of the Environment, in February, issued oil and gas exploration permits off the coast of Newfoundland for 12,000 square kilometres of delicate marine ecosystems. They also issued exploration permits to ExxonMobil and to British Petroleum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is the Liberals' record: a government incapable of meeting its targets, as we learned in the environment commissioner's latest report, a government that authorizes oil and gas projects and has just given Canadian oil companies a leg up to continue to do what they do while asking all citizens and companies in our economy to make an extra effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The situation is disastrous. Do we remember the forest fires last summer? Do we remember the consequences of increasing natural disasters, as we call them? These disasters are in fact less and less natural: The science and all the reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC prove that they are becoming more frequent and intense, and have greater consequences on our economy, populations, and health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a very interesting article today on Maria Neira, director of public health and the environment at the World Health Organization. She says that the air pollution that is causing respiratory problems and an increased incidence of asthma in young children is directly linked to the burning of fossil fuels. This is not a hypothesis. This is what is happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Both the Conservatives and the Liberals are being irresponsible and not taking measures to reduce the consequences of pollution and climate change on human life and health, but also on our economy and the future of our society and our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>People can count on the NDP. We will fight and take climate change seriously.</ParaText>

In the House, the ones who are doing the most to lower the cost of groceries are members of the NDP. We are the only ones saying that big companies should have to pay a special tax on excess profits.

              <ParaText>Grocery bosses should not be the ones writing the code of conduct for the major grocery chains. The code should not be voluntary. It should not allow them to manage and discipline themselves. We need an independent body. That is important to the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A price on transportation-related pollution, for example, could certainly have an impact. However, food prices have risen faster than inflation for 24 months now. Corporate greed must have something to do with it. Corporations are lining their pockets and making record profits, and their executives are getting exorbitant paycheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must not blame everything on the carbon tax. It does not even exist in some provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, where it literally has no impact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I want to congratulate my colleague from Nunavut for all the work she is doing, especially on indigenous housing and on having a housing program for and by indigenous peoples.

              <ParaText>It is very simple. We want to cancel the carbon tax for farmers, first nations and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know that mortgages and rent have doubled and that it is basically impossible to buy food for a family. Unfortunately, a new report indicates that groceries will cost an extra $700 per family next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want this NDP-Liberal government to be honest with Canadians. The carbon tax is raising the cost of living. When the carbon tax drives up costs for farmers and truckers, the cost of living increases for all Canadians. I like bologna, but I do not like it when the Liberals feed Canadians baloney.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Sadly, after eight years, we know that Canadians are experiencing the greatest financial difficulty since perhaps the Great Depression. As the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of His Majesty's loyal opposition has taken to saying many times, if pictures of the lines outside a food bank were in black and white, everybody would believe that we were back in the so-called dirty thirties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The NDP-Liberal government has shattered the dreams of many Canadians. It was interesting to hear the response from my hon. colleague when I asked a question just a minute ago with respect to the emails, phone calls and visits that every member of this House receives in their office every day. I cannot understand why they choose to ignore the folks who put them there. We know very clearly, because everybody wants to look at a poll now and then, that it is at their own peril. I suggest that Canadians, as I said in French, are not foolish. They recognize very clearly the peril that their financial situation is in. We know that many Canadians are $200 away from being broke at the end of the month. That is a situation nobody wants to be in. Many Canadians are way beyond that. There are two million Canadians visiting food banks. That is 5% of the population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I had the opportunity to visit the food bank in my hometown of Truro, Nova Scotia. Sadly, we know its client roster has ballooned to 1,800 folks. In a small town of around 12,000 people, there are 1,800 clients. We know from an incredible study done from my alma mater at Dalhousie University that groceries will cost a family of four an extra $700 next year. This is an incredibly sad state of affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In that report, there was an interesting quote that talks about food bank use. It says, “This is the highest level of food bank use in Canada on record,” and, “In 2024, it is probable that Canadians will continue to experience the strain of food inflation, compounded by increasing costs of housing, energy, and various other expenditures.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I said in French, we all know that when we tax the farmer who grows the food and we tax the truck driver who ships the food, then ultimately the person at the end of the line paying for the food is going to have to pay more. We know that when we tax businesses more, they pass that cost onto consumers. That is a simple fact of business; it is not one that we like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do wish to highlight a couple of interesting stories, which are incredibly heart-wrenching, from my own riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the recent past, I had an opportunity to speak to a couple who would have been very close to retirement. They have been married in the 25-year range and told me, and this is hard to believe, that sadly they had to sell their house. They were very close to paying off their house and could not pay the mortgage. I am the parent of three kids and two grandkids. A parent would not want to do this, but they took the money they gained as a profit from selling their house, as meagre as it was, and are going to pay it to their daughter because they are going to live in her basement. It is absolutely mind-blowing. These are stories that, in generations, have not been heard. It is incredibly gut-wrenchingly sad to hear a story like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I heard another from an older lady who lives on her own. She made up a new term. I was going to say this in French but I did not know how to say it, and this is really not a word in English, but she called it “ungrocery”. She would do her grocery shopping and go around with her cart, as we all do, putting things in that she would like to have. Then at the end of her tour around the grocery store, she would add up the cost of those items. She knew she could not afford it all, so she would go back around the grocery store taking things out of her cart, doing the math in her head and then realizing what a meagre amount of groceries she was actually able to afford. That is what “ungrocery” is. It would be exceedingly sad, of course, if that made it into common language in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also know this carbon tax needs to be removed not just from families but from farmers and first nations. First nations have filed a judicial review over the federal carbon tax, noting very clearly that the climate cannot be healed at the expense of communities. We know very clearly the burden that is being placed on the backs of Canadians every single day. The debt the NDP-Liberal government has inflated over its eight years of ridiculousness has debt service charges now that would be equal to the Canada health transfer. It is incredible the burden of payments that will be required by generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The great thing is that Canadians are paying attention. They are understanding this message. The know the fiscal irresponsibility of the NDP-Liberal coalition is something that has to change. We know the hundreds of emails we are receiving every day are a reflection of the sad reality and the fiscally irresponsible position the NDP-Liberal government has put Canada in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Its members can go on and talk about their machinations with debt-to-GDP ratio and those kinds of things, but what Canadians know is they cannot afford to heat their homes and to put food on their tables every single day, if they are fortunate enough to have a place to live. That is what we know and the message is resonating with Canadians that the NDP-Liberal government has to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Right now, its members could easily vote for the opposition motion today to axe the carbon tax to make life more affordable for everyday Canadians who call our offices and who will gladly put the NDP-Liberal coalition out of business. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the Conservatives speak to the motion, and have have been listening to previous speeches, and the Conservative Party is spreading misinformation through social media and things of that nature. The member himself did it, to try to give the impression that the vast majority of constituents I represent would have more money in their pocket as a direct result of taking away the price on pollution. This is the “axe the tax” propaganda. He knows full well that, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this is not the case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to the mathematically challenged NDP-Liberals, and perhaps they are challenged in reading either of Canada's official languages, that the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report, which all of us on this side of the House have read, would say that Canadians are worse off. I guess the fact of the matter is that if the member is so excited about the great and rosy financial picture of Canadians, then it would only make sense that axing the tax would be very simple. That is because what that would mean, of course, is that there would be even more money in the pockets of Canadians with such a great and rosy financial picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How can the member make sense of the fact that two million Canadians, more than at any time in history, are actually visiting food banks? If the member, who, I believe, must be arithmetically challenged, does not understand that, then I do not know how better to explain it other than by the fact that, of course, constituents call, email and visit our office every day, making it very clear that their financial picture is that they are close to bankruptcy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, as the saying goes, one step forward, two steps back. That is the impression I am getting from this debate. We are concerned about people who are struggling with the cost of living, and we are concerned about the housing crisis that is affecting our constituents. However, the Conservatives' proposal would do nothing to correct these situations, just like the government's climate change policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is one thing that could be done. Canada is a petro-state, and climate change affects everything we are talking about: the price of groceries, agriculture, housing and food. In that context, how do the Conservatives aim to present a serious plan to address climate change?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, very clearly, there are two parts to the answer.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to take part in this very important and timely debate. I am very concerned about our country, and I hope all 338 of us take some time to talk to Canadians over Christmas. Let us knock on 100 doors, go and find out, straight from the people we work for, what life has now become after eight long years of Liberal government, the policies it has enacted and the living hell that Canadians are living through because of the Liberal policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, we are going to talk about the carbon tax. There are many terrible policies the Liberals have put forward, but this is just about the carbon tax and what it has done to Canada. It is with a heavy heart that I am reading the statistics of what Canadians are facing: 30-year high inflation challenges just to live. What does that mean? It means that Canadians are not keeping up with inflation. At the end of the month, there are more days left than there is money in the bank account. That means Canadians are skipping meals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are the breadbasket of the world. I come from a province that grows things that we sell to and that feed the world. We are put into this task by God; we are given this land by God, to feed the world and to feed Canadians. We grow so much that, as Canadians, we cannot eat all that we grow, so we trade. We are a trading nation, and that is a good thing. It is what actually sustains families on the other side of the world. The policies of the current government mean that there are families starving, not just in far-flung places around the world but also right here in Canada. Eleven million Canadians needed food stamps or their equivalent from the government last year. They could not provide enough for their family to eat. The government had to help one in four Canadians. This is not right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are very, very tough times for Canadians, and things are going to get tougher. That has more to do with the interest rate hikes and what they are going to cause with respect to mortgage renewals. They are going to skyrocket. Right now, families are holding on by their fingertips. The tipping point is going to come in a number of months and years as mortgages are renewed. The problem also occurs on rental properties, so we know that rents are going to go up. We know that the price of rent in Canada has doubled already. What happens when the owners of rental buildings have to renew their mortgages? Rents are going to continue to go up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What we are debating today is a terrible tax. It is a tax on movement. It is a tax on things we used to do very well in this country. We do things. We are known as a country that grows more canola and more wheat than anywhere else in the world. We build things. We rip it out of the ground. We refine. We value-add different God-given gifts to our country, and we sell because we cannot utilize as much as we can produce in this country. That is a good thing. That is how, for over 150 years, we have been so prosperous as a nation. What we have, from eight long years of the current Liberal government, is an attack on that, with the carbon tax on anything that moves. If it continues to move, the government taxes it harder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know that the Liberals are going to quadruple the tax. What is that going to mean? Academia's theory of the carbon tax is that if the Liberals keep increasing the price, people will stop using that item. The theory is faulty. All we have to do is look at the price per litre of gasoline in other parts of the world that are not as gifted with natural resources as we are. In Europe, it is roughly equivalent to around $5 to $6 Canadian per litre. Europeans are still driving; they have to drive. In Canada, we have to drive in order to get to work to provide for our family. We need to utilize oil and gas to produce the crops that feed the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The one disincentive that the government has decided on is to attack anything that moves. That is what the carbon tax does. It is a tax on being productive. Just look at what it has done in Atlantic Canada, where the government has carved out a special deal that exempts the region from tax on home heating oil. It has destroyed the argument of why we need the carbon tax. The government, supported by the NDP, has proposed that if home heating oil is to be exempt in Atlantic Canada, it is due to the cost of living. Wait a minute. Did it not just say that Canadians receive more money back than they pay? The rationale for Atlantic Canada is that people there are in a cost of living crisis, which they are. To make things better just in that region of the country, not all over Canada, the government removed the tax. The government's argument that people receive more back has just been blown to pieces, because if that were true, then the government has actually made the cost of living crisis worse in Atlantic Canada. Therefore, it is not believed to be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government has also argued in favour of making more expensive the dirtiest forms of energy with respect to emissions. The worst for emissions is home heating oil. It actually made that cheaper, the one source of energy that, if the government believed in its logic, should have been costing more. The government's arguments are blown out of the water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will get back to my conclusion of why this all wraps up into the motion. If we look at the troubles we are facing in Canada, we know that it is tough out there. Anything the Canadian government can do to make life more affordable is something we should act on today. We have a long list of things the government should have been doing for the last eight years, but it has decided to ignore those suggestions. Just with this motion today, we could remove the carbon tax on home heating for farmers, first nations and families, three groups that are hurting and that we could affect today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Take off the tax, and, instantaneously, food prices would drop, because the tax is baked into all of the actions of a farmer. If we remove the tax, instantaneously, food would become cheaper for first nations. There is a lot of neglect from the government on reserves, but I cannot think of a worse example than this: A lot of first nations and reserves use electricity to heat their homes. Right now, the government is jacking up the rate of carbon tax on those homes, homes of individuals who are barely holding on with the cost of living crisis that is taking place, and now, it is going to quadruple the carbon tax. The third group is families. We know that they are going to have to pay $700 more next year alone just on groceries because of the carbon tax. That is $700 in sports fees they will not have. Layered on top of the troubles with interest rates increasing, we know this is a recipe for disaster. There are Canadian families that are just struggling now but will be starving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am not putting blame on anyone, but this is a Liberal policy. It is not the families of the Liberal members of Parliament that are going to be suffering. It is going to be the other families throughout Canada that have a severe challenge with the cost of living. We can make that all better today. Increasing costs are not all going to be reduced because of the policies of the government, but this is one area in which, if we act as Parliament, we could act before Christmas to make food cheaper, to make life more affordable and to make Canada that much better. If I am true to the people I represent and the stories I hear, I cannot think of another group that has been so challenged under the Liberal policies and that we need to provide relief for. That is what the motion would do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I want to state some facts. This is not a Liberal policy. The carbon tax was first established in British Columbia by a right-leaning Conservative government under the mask of the B.C. Liberal Party. Therefore, I find it quite interesting when I hear B.C. Conservatives in this place talking about getting rid of the federal carbon tax, which does not apply in British Columbia. I state that fact on its own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another truth is that the New Democrats have asked for the removal of the GST on all home heating. The Conservatives had it in their election platform, but they voted against it. In their election platform, the Conservatives had a price on carbon, but today they do not want to talk about that. It is like they have amnesia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us talk about the need for a school food program. The advocacy for the need for a school food program started under the Harper government when inequality skyrocketed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Maybe the member could talk about why he voted yesterday against the implementation of a strategy for a national school food program. Perhaps he could also correct some of the facts of why the Conservatives ran on a platform to put a price on carbon, but today they do not support that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, this tax is bad. It makes everything more expensive, does nothing for the environment, because Canada has missed every emissions target since it was brought in. It is a terrible tax that does nothing for the environment and hurts Canadians, and the proof is in the last eight years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On food equality, I cannot think of a more hypocritical position as the NDP's. The New Democrats claim to be the party of the workers and the poor. The people this tax hurts the most are their supporters. People who have the least ability to pay increased costs on food and heat for their homes are the ones suffering the most. The most dire emails and phone calls I get at my office are not from people who are well off. They are from people who have the least ability to pay for these increased costs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about what will actually do something, it is scrapping the tax. It will make food and heat more affordable across Canada. That is an actual solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we want to talk about actual solutions for the environment, this tax, which is supposedly an environmental policy, has not hit a single emissions reduction target. The only year there was a reduction was the first year of the pandemic due to everything being locked down. If the position of the Liberals, supported by the NDP, is that we have to again lock down societies, where nothing moves, nothing grows and nothing flourishes, if this is the policy of the Liberal-NDP government, then I welcome the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know there are technological solutions. We have faced difficult environmental problems in the past. When I was growing up, the ozone hole was going to cause everybody to get skin cancer. I was paranoid and scared about it. However, it was not a tax that solved that problem; it was technology. With acid rain, it was the same thing. It was going to melt our buildings. Technology solved that problem.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>I would like to remind my hon. colleagues that, since 2015, our government has spared no effort to make life more affordable for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and, thanks to the guaranteed income supplement and the enhanced Canada pension plan, we are offering unprecedented support to our seniors. Indeed, 2.3 million fewer Canadians are living in poverty than before 2015. Whether we are talking about $10-a-day child care or the new Canada dental care plan, our government has made historic improvements to the country's social safety net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reality is that our economic plan is fiscally responsible and it is delivering results for Canadians. We have strengthened Canada's social safety net while ensuring that the country maintains the lowest deficit- and debt-to-GDP ratios in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I must say that our government has implemented several measures in the past year to support Canadians. For example, last summer, roughly 11 million low-income people and families received the grocery rebate.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>We are helping Canadians from coast to coast to coast deal with global inflation. We have their backs, and will continue to have their backs, as we go forward and as the economy turns and inflation continues to decline.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>That was a one-time payment that helped them deal with the rising cost of living and put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>I am splitting my time, Mr. Speaker, with my friend and colleague, the parliamentary secretary from the wonderful riding of <Affiliation DbId="278595" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>What we are talking about here is up to $467 more for eligible couples with two children, and up to $234 more for singles with no children, including single seniors. I have talked about the measure with constituents in my riding, and I can confirm that it has been very popular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To help Canadians with the cost of living, the government also issues Canada workers benefit payments automatically now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>This is the Canada workers benefit, which is transformational.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>This benefit has already helped lift thousands of Canadians out of poverty. We believe that these improvements will give low-income workers timely access to the funds they need to support themselves and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Since last July, eligible single workers have received up to $714, and families have received up to $1,231, spread over three advance payments.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>These are three payments during the year and then people files their taxes. The Canada workers benefit is a great way to lift low-income workers, hard-working Canadians, out of poverty and give them extra money during the year and at the end of the year to pay for necessities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As we also announced in the 2023 fall economic statement, we are going to amend the Competition Act to further modernize merger reviews, including by empowering the Competition Bureau to better detect and address “killer acquisitions” and other anti-competitive mergers. Our government is well aware of the fact that better competition means lower prices, more choices and more innovative products and services for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our goal is very clear. We want to make groceries more affordable for Canadians. However, our government understands that many Canadians are still struggling to pay their bills right now and are under considerable financial strain. Obviously, it is important for us to help them. That is why we decided to temporarily pause the fuel charge on home heating oil for three years. This temporary pause will enable households that heat their homes with oil to save an average of $250 a year at the current rate. Meanwhile, the federal government is working with the provinces to incentivize the switch to heat pumps and gradually eliminate oil heating in the longer term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To support Canadians in rural areas, we are going to double the rural top-up for pollution pricing rebates from 10% to 20% of the baseline amount starting in April 2024. Our government is well aware that people who live in rural communities face unique realities, and this measure will help put even more money back in the pockets of families dealing with higher energy costs because they live outside a large city.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, as I said moments ago, we want to do even more to fight climate change by helping Canadians install more energy-efficient heating systems. An up‐front $250 payment will be available to low- and median-income households that heat their homes with oil and sign up for a federal-provincial program to install a heat pump. We are also working with the provinces and territories to strengthen the oil to heat pump affordability program. The amount of federal funding that eligible homeowners can receive for installing a heat pump will increase from $10,000 to $15,000, adding up to an additional $5,000 in grant funding to match provincial and territorial contributions via co-delivery arrangements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a result, the cost of an average heat pump and its installation would be covered for low- and median-income households as we continue to minimize upfront costs and make federal programs even easier to access for all households.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Obviously, this is a very important measure to help households in the long term. Homeowners who switch from oil to cold-climate heat pumps to heat and cool their homes save an average of up to $2,500 a year on their energy bills.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>These are substantial savings for Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In conclusion, since 2015, we have done a great deal to support Canadians in need.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>That is always done in a fiscally responsible fashion. We are maintaining our AAA credit rating and the lowest deficit and net debt-to-GDP ratio. We are bringing that down and continuing to lower it so it is alway below 1%.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>The grocery rebate, the advance payment of the Canada workers benefit and our support for the purchase and installation of heat pumps are excellent examples of measures taken over the past year to help Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I was reflecting, as I believe this is the 18th time we are debating a motion similar to this in this Parliament, back to the last election. In our debates, I said it was refreshing that all of the main parties at that time, in 2021, were running on a price on pollution, including all the members of the Conservative Party who sit here right now. We were actually talking about how we fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unfortunately, we are back to a time where one of the parties in the House is debating whether we should fight climate change at all. Its members can see it with their own eyes. They represent ridings that have had severe drought, flooding, fires and hurricanes. Their silence is deafening. The only plank of their environmental plan that comes through, as this is the 18th time we are debating this, is recycling slogans. There are no facts behind anything they are coming forward with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They say that the price on pollution does not work. It is false: 30% of our reductions can be attributed to the price on pollution. That is 30% of our reductions; it is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>An hon. member:</B> That's not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>Mr. Chris Bittle:</B> Mr. Speaker, they are heckling me and saying it is not true. They will not stand up at any point and show any facts. They will yell, slam their desks and heckle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="278435" Type="2">Provencher</Affiliation>, who is heckling, represents a province that has suffered from the effects of climate with significant drought, and he is laughing. He thinks this is funny. He thinks his province going through severe drought is funny enough to laugh in the House of Commons. He will get up to talk about the price of food, but laugh when there are drought conditions on the Prairies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is driving that price? Conservatives are going to talk about the price on pollution, but the impact of food increases is happening the same in the United States, which does not have a price on pollution. They cannot explain that. They will not bring forward any facts on that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They will not talk about the rebate Canadians get. They will not talk about how eight out of 10 families get more money back. They will not talk about the report out of the University of Calgary that shows 94% of individuals and families who make less than $50,000 a year end up with more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>They want to get rid of the price on pollution. What would that do? It would go straight back to their friends the oil companies. It would go straight back to companies I believe last year made $120 billion in profit, and they claim this trickle-down approach would come back to us somehow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What it would mean is more stock buybacks and no spending on climate progress. It would not have any benefit to us Canadians across the board. Canadians who count on their climate action incentive would look to any government that cancels that and ask where the money is. They do not mention the rebate because they do not want to mention they would cut that rebate, which helps so many families across the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They want to take Canada out of international discussions. According to the World Bank, there are 73 carbon pricing initiatives currently in place or scheduled to be in place across the globe. These include in Norway, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Chile, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Germany and of course Ukraine. We cannot forget about Ukraine, which the members on the other side want to make a splash about. They say that they cannot afford a free trade agreement with Ukraine because it mentions a price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>At the end of the day, they are willing to throw Ukraine under the bus. They are willing to throw it under the bus at a time when its president wants this free trade agreement. They talk about lowering the price of food, but they are voting against a country that is one of the breadbaskets of the world. Ukraine needs Canada's support, and this is what it has asked for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservative Party members are so ideological on pricing pollution, when a huge part of the world is behind this, yet they are going to take Canada back. They are going to take Canada back to the benefit of oil companies. They do not care about defending allies such as Ukraine, and they do not care about being a leader on climate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I know that the member from Manitoba laughs that his province is under a drought, but what about the farmers in his community whose yields are down significantly? This is not because of a government policy, but because of the impacts of climate change. However, we do not hear that in any of their speeches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives, who do not want a price on pollution and claim that reducing pollution should be borne by industry, should be getting behind the government's latest announcement, which is an emissions reduction plan that would put a cap-and-trade system in place on the oil and gas sector to reduce 30% of emissions, but we are not going to hear that. We are not going to hear support for that plan because, fundamentally, I do not believe that they believe that climate change is real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is sad that we are back to a Conservative Party that does not believe in climate change. We have heard speech after speech in the House today, and I am not hearing individuals talk about the impacts in their community. However, they can see it with their own eyes. I remember debating a similar motion to this and the smoke was so bad in Ottawa that we could not see across the river in to Gatineau the impacts of climate change were so real. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Again, they are laughing. The hon. member from Saskatoon is making a joke. The forest fires in Quebec were so bad, but he stands here and makes a joke. The Conservatives are climate change deniers. This is a big joke to them. They do not care that grain yields are down on the Prairies. They do not care that forests the size of, I believe, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador burnt down this year, but that is a joke. First the member for <Affiliation DbId="278435" Type="2">Provencher</Affiliation> laughed at the fact that there is drought in his province, and the member from Saskatoon laughs at climate change. It is a joke to them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is an existential crisis facing Canadians. However, Conservatives are now claiming that there is no drought on the Prairies. The grain yields are down across the prairies, I guess, by magic—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is suggesting that I am not telling the truth, but all we hear is them axing the facts, which is truly unfortunate. The Conservatives are not even going to say that there are drought conditions across the Prairies, which is fact. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>
                <B>Mr. Chris Bittle:</B> Mr. Speaker, they are chirping. They are upset. They are angry, but the fact remains that this country has seen extreme weather time and time again, and that is what is impacting the price of food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the previous members brought up a study warning Canadians that the price of food is going to increase. However, the member did not mention the second part, which was that climate change is the main driver of that. What do they do? They want to get rid of one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce pollution. It is a system that works and puts more money back into the pockets of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Again, I call on the Conservatives to bring up some facts that support their arguments. Give us a better way to fight pollution. However, they are not going to. The only thing they have are slogans. I would like to see some facts. I would like to see a better way to fight pollution if they have it, but they do not. One Conservative member in committee said that environmentalists bring up all sorts of things, such as acid rain, but it went away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Do members know why it went away? It is because a price on pollution was brought in.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Chris Bittle:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. laughed again and said “Science”, but a price on pollution was brought in to limit pollution. It was brought in by a Conservative government under Brian Mulroney, by the way, who was a leader on that front. I hope that the Conservatives return back to even 2021, when they were talking about a price on pollution and climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Climate change is real. We need to act. It is unfortunate that the Conservatives will laugh and deny it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, grain yields are down. Maybe they are doing great in the hon. member's riding, but he does not cite any facts. He cites his slogans, and that is unfortunate because Manitobans are impacted by the effects of climate change, which is driving up the price of food. That is the main driver of the price of food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>No one on the other side mentions that the price of food here is growing at the same price as it is in the United States, which does not have a price on pollution.

              <ParaText>The Conservatives are getting away with this runaway train of a disinformation campaign that the carbon tax is the major factor when it comes to grocery store prices. We know it is corporate greed, because the big grocery stores are recording record profits. The reason the Conservatives are able to get away with convincing Canadians to buy into this campaign is that the government has failed to go after the CEOs of the big grocery stores.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share my time today with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278265" Type="2">Elgin—Middlesex—London</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our Conservative motion to axe the carbon tax, as we have heard so much from the Liberal government about today, is an opportunity for all members of Parliament, even those in the Liberal backbenches, including the my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, to stand up for their constituents. I know it will take courage, but I urge every one of them to do the right thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Like all MPs in this House, I am getting emails and calls from moms and dads across Canada who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on their tables. I am hearing from seniors who worked decades to save for retirement, only to see inflation eradicate their income and financial security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As someone who represents a large rural constituency, I know how the carbon tax disproportionately impacts the people who call Westman home. If we can pass this motion, it will send a strong signal to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that his government needs to get serious about the cost of living crisis in Canada. If the Liberals have not yet figured it out, the Conservative team will never back down from its mission to axe the carbon tax once and for all, no matter how long it takes. We will stand up for the families, seniors, farmers and indigenous Canadians who are being crushed by the drastic cost of living. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Nothing was more insulting to the millions of Canadians trying to heat their homes this winter than when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to temporarily pause his carbon tax on only 3% of households. It is no wonder that provincial governments are up in arms. Even the NDP government in Manitoba is explicitly asking the Prime Minister to exempt home heating from his carbon tax. As for the top-up for rural Canadians, it is not even enough money to pay for the gas to take their kids to hockey practice on the weekend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our common-sense Conservative motion today is simple. It is not a gimmick and there are no temporary measures. It is time to axe the inflationary carbon tax for good and bring home lower prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Every single member of Parliament knows constituents are hurting. It does not matter if people live in rural Newfoundland or North Bay, Ontario, inflation and rising Liberal taxes are taking their toll. People are struggling to stay afloat, and the carbon tax is a giant anvil dragging them down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We found out this week, as an example, that more than 50,000 Manitobans are now regularly using a food bank, the highest number ever recorded in the province, and while we can get bogged down in statistics, we must never forget that we are talking about people. These are seniors, students, children and indigenous Canadians who cannot afford to go the grocery store. When people do have money in their pockets, they are decreasing the quantity and sometimes the quality of the food they are buying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not normal and it weighs heavily on the minds of moms and dads trying to pack their kids’ school lunch boxes. It weighs heavily on the senior whose fixed income is not keeping up with the rate of inflation. It weighs heavily on the young person who is trying desperately to pay for their education or save for a home but can barely afford their daily necessities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know first-hand the challenges food banks are having. I have visited the Samaritan House in Brandon and it is struggling to keep up with demand. I cannot say enough about the good work that Barbara McNish and all the volunteers do for those in need, but we as policy-makers cannot just turn a blind eye to these startling numbers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As another example, I know the food bank in Killarney, Manitoba, is facing challenges. It recently contacted my office, as it now needs to hire a manager to run the operation as the demand on volunteers is too great. Under the Liberal government, small rural communities need to hire a manager to run a food bank. In all my years of living in Westman, I never thought in a million years that a very progressive community like Killarney would ever need to hire staff to run its food bank. It is a testament to the struggles that many are facing and it is undeniably heartbreaking. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>If this is not a warning sign of how bad things have gotten out there, I do not know what is. What will it take to finally wake the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> up and get him to change direction? The rising costs of food cannot be divorced from the Liberal government's tax-and-spend policies. The carbon tax is driving up the cost of everything. It is contributing to the costs of growing our food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let this sink in for a moment. While the cost of groceries has never been higher, Liberals have shown no compassion for those who cannot afford to put food on the table. The carbon tax is being applied all along the entire food supply system. It gets passed down until every Canadian gets stuck with the bill. It is no wonder the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that families are seeing a net loss under this measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Families and seniors are getting crushed, and it is time for action. They are tired of Liberal gaslighting about how much better off they are under the carbon tax rebate scheme. The good people of Westman are not falling for the Liberals' talking points; at the end of the day, they do not have more money in their wallets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just this morning, Canada's Food Price Report stated that the average family of four is expected to spend $16,297.20 on food in 2024. As we have heard my colleagues say in this House before, that is seven hundred and some dollars more than what they had to spend last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to finish my talk today by just saying that this is an outlandish tax that the government is trying to place on everyone in Canada and their cost of living today. The government could have passed Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which was a bill to take the carbon tax off heating barns and greenhouses in Canada and drying grain. The cost of food is directly proportional to the cost of the inputs that it takes to grow these products. We are talking about greenhouse produce that is extremely healthy and is exported all over the world, particularly to our neighbours in the United States to the south of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Maybe some of my colleagues are not aware of what really happens when farmers are drying grain. It is not just a luxury; it is an absolute necessity, because farmers need to be able to store that crop when they take it off. If they do not, that grain could spoil, costing the producers millions of dollars across the country. It could be billions. This is something that is very much a necessity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I was just saying that, with respect to the cost of drying this grain, the government is basically saying that it will take the risk of forcing farmers to, in some cases, not be able to afford to store their grain properly. That would lead to great devastation in regard to our ability to be a reliable nation in our export markets, as well as putting some of the best food in the world on the table.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, affordability is clearly a key concern. Keeping that in mind and having heard what the member opposite had to say, I wonder how he can fix everything that he has said and square that with the following fact: According to University of Calgary economists, if the carbon tax were axed tomorrow, the people who would actually benefit the most are people who earn $250,000 or more. More to the point, 94% of people who earn $50,000 or less receive more through carbon pricing rebates than they pay in carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How is it that the Conservative Party is supporting giving a benefit to people who earn $250,000 or more? Are they the ones who are having the greatest affordability challenges?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I really heard the enthusiasm of the colleague from Halifax sitting behind the member, who just had his carbon tax cut by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, starting in the new year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member's question is relevant, but it is interesting to see how the Liberals have changed their tune; it used to be that everybody was getting back more than they paid. Then it went to 80%. Let us face it: They would not be getting anything back if it were not for the pressure the Conservatives put on them to have a rebate on the carbon tax in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The difficulty with this whole process is that it is not true. The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself said that it costs the average family more than $1,000 more than they are getting back in the rebate. Some of the points that came out this morning in the food report showed that, in Ontario alone, there is a $2,600 cost, and $800 does not square that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, let us talk about who is changing their tune. This member ran on a platform putting a price on carbon. Today, here he is saying that we should get rid of the carbon tax. The Conservatives ran on a platform to remove the GST on all home heating, something the NDP just brought forward. What did they do? They voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My colleague before me just talked about how eight out of 10 families will get a rebate that is larger than what they will pay in carbon tax. In fact, if someone earns $250,000 or more, then they will not. They will pay more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The bottom line is that this is a diversion today. The Conservatives keep bringing this motion back. This is the 11th opposition day we have spent on it. It is a diversion from the fact that, as we know, the Conservatives are really fighting for those who earn over $250,000. They are not fighting for the eight in 10 families who are going to come out ahead. That is the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My colleague ran on a platform to put a price on carbon and to remove the GST on home heating. Could he say why he keeps voting against that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to speak to our opposition day motion. I want to start off with some basic facts, so I will read into the record this very important piece of information. This is the type of stuff we are actually discussing today:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, over 800,000 people in Ontario alone accessed a food bank. In total, there were 5.9 million visits to a food bank in this time period. Feed Ontario reported that “if the 800,822 people who visited Ontario’s food banks between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, became their own municipality, it would be the third largest city in the province ahead of Mississauga.”</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This tells us we have a problem, yet we are back to this debate. As the member from the NDP stated, Conservatives are bringing up this motion for the 11th time. We are trying to bring some common sense and understand why over 800,000 people in Ontario alone are using a food bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just this week, at the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, we heard it is forecasted that a food bank in Kelowna, B.C., is expecting its growth to be 100% in the next year. In addition, “More than one in six visitors say they are employed, which is an 82 percent increase over 2016-17 and a 37 percent increase over the previous year.” Now it is forecasted that, for 2024, there will be a hundred per cent increase in the use of food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why is this happening? It is very simple. It is because the cost of living is skyrocketing. Canadian mortgages have doubled, the costs of rents are increasing faster than the increase in wages and affordability is just absolutely out of control. We are in a broken economy right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We can try to paint a flowery picture, as we have heard from many parties here, and specifically the government's side. We can paint a pretty picture of all they have done. They can talk all they want about the Canada child tax benefit, refunds from the carbon tax and $10-a-day child care, but none of these policies are working to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is why I am bringing this forward. We can talk about the Canada child tax benefit that was reformed in 2016, but we have to take into consideration what people received back in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Yes, I recognize there was an escalator to that, but the cost of living has continued to increase. Therefore, at the end of the day, Canadians are actually finding that they have less money in their pockets because of the cost of living. The more one spends, the more taxes the government is bringing in. This is the bottom line, and that is why it is so important that we axe the tax for farmers, families and first nations. It is desperately needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am from the incredible riding of Elgin—Middlesex—London, where some of our key industry is farming and agribusiness. I will share a bit of information I received yesterday. When one starts receiving such things, one wonders if anybody from the government benches is doing any reading. Specifically, this comes from Dowler-Karn. I would really like to thank Dowler-Karn and the great people there who are servicing our farmers daily to try to make sure we get crops off and that grains are being dried and everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Dowler-Karn has seven locations from Windsor to Kitchener and services industry, agricultural producers, trucking companies and some residential home heating. It does not service gas stations or the mandatory residential home heating. I contacted Dowler-Karn in respect to its carbon tax expenses and was shocked to learn about the revenue that is leaving Elgin—Middlesex—London.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In a 12-month period, from November 30, $27.2 million in carbon tax was sent from Elgin—Middlesex—London to the federal government from Dowler-Karn alone, which is only one of the riding's providers. By April 1, 2024, rates will be going up 23%, so the carbon tax for 2024 is estimated by Dowler-Karn at $34 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Where does one think the $34 million comes from? It is added as one of the input costs to farmers. It is that simple. It is part of the business costs, so at the end of the day, when input costs go up, we are going to see the cost of food going up. It is really difficult for me to talk about food if we are not going to actually recognize that carbon tax plays a huge role in the production of food. It makes me very concerned that we are ignoring this. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Currently, the monthly average for Dowler-Karn is $2 million to $2.5 million in carbon tax. Recently, the Canadian Propane Association released a study that, on average, Canadian households are spending $300 to $350 monthly on home heating alone. Currently, the rate of carbon tax on diesel fuel is 17.4¢ per litre, with an estimate to 45.4¢ per litre by 2023. This is affecting all transportation of goods in Canada by truck or rail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I also want to read into the record an email that we received. We are talking about families. We are talking about how people are being impacted. We recognize that there is absolutely an urban and rural divide on this, but people in the cities may pay less when it comes to the carbon tax because maybe their driving distance is shorter, or their homes may be different, like they might not being living in century-old farm homes.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With several years of country wide tax contribution income now in place and recognizing rebates extended back to taxpayers, my personal question...[to you] Has there ever been a public release of an accountability statement to the current summary of the carbon tax ledger dollar amount to share with taxpayers. Information such as the current balance along with income generated from interest and details as to the disbursement of this carbon tax income ledger detailing the direction of funds for environmental improvement areas would be of great value and interest to review for a majority of Canadians.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why do I bring this up? It is because when we talk about all of this money that is coming from the carbon tax, this psychological program that they are playing with Canadians, we are seeing that Canadians are paying a lot of money and they are absolutely desperate. They are asking where the government is taking the money it is receiving from the carbon tax, and are asking where it is investing it to ensure that we actually have climate solutions. That is what we see. The government continues to put its money into the general coffers so it has more revenue. This is a tax plan. It is all about bringing more money in, but we are not seeing the investments in technologies that we need to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, let us turn to something that is really disgusting. I have an email here from some farmers in my riding. Currently, one livestock farmer has already spent approximately $38,000 in carbon tax alone to heat his barns, and will be spending approximately $12,000 in carbon tax to dry his grain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another large farming corporation that does some incredible work in the grain and oilseeds industry has already paid $80,000 in carbon tax. Where do people think this money comes from? It will come from the consumer at the end of the day because the input costs continue to go up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know I do not have a lot of time left. We have talked about the families, we have talked about the farmers and now we need to talk about our first nations. I think one of the greatest challenges I have seen here is the fact that the first nations have been left out of this. We saw Atlantic Canada get a break on the carbon tax. Why? It was not working and it was making people poor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are hearing the same things from our indigenous leaders. I want to read from a CBC article by Olivia Stefanovich. It states, “Ontario First Nations leaders are asking the Federal Court to exempt their communities from the federal carbon tax, a policy”—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I was asked a very important question. Instead of questioning whether farmers are going to put money in their own pockets, we should ask the government why it keeps putting it in its pockets. The question that keeps being asked is what will happen if the carbon tax is not taken off and it is added on. We will be throwing our money to the government that continues to just waste it. Perhaps we should trust farmers way before we trust the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on March 17, Canada is set to go down a very dangerous road when MAID will become available for persons suffering solely from mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Last year, the government delayed this expansion after leading medical professionals, including the chairs of psychiatry from all 17 medical schools, said that Canada was not ready. That is because it is impossible to predict whether someone with a mental illness will not get better. In other words, persons who could get better would have their lives prematurely ended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Recently, the Special Joint Committee on MAID wrapped up its hearings and heard loud and clear from experts that Canada still is not ready.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I urge the government to follow the evidence, stop the madness and immediately introduce legislation to permanently scrap this dangerous expansion of MAID.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the number of Canadians who use food banks has reached a record high, but the Bloc-Liberal coalition is doing nothing to lower the price of food.

The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ordered his Liberal senators to vote against the bill in the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This morning, an annual report confirms that, in 2024, the average family will pay $700 more for groceries. Canadians are lowering their grocery bill and reducing the quantity and quality of the food they buy by replacing it with less nutritious alternatives. Children and seniors, who are the most vulnerable, deserve to eat healthy and nutritious food, but the government is keeping its carbon tax, which is making Canadians poorer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>After eight years, the price of food is not the only increase Canadians are dealing with. The cost of housing is skyrocketing. Conservatives will continue to fight against the Bloc-Liberal coalition to lower prices for all Canadians so that they can enjoy the holidays, unlike the coalition, that wants to ruin Christmas for everyone. </ParaText>

Specifically, the panel will advise on how to identify the needs of workers in transitioning sectors, help skilled workers in changing industries access training for in-demand jobs and promote continuous skill development for workers, ensuring that these programs are accessible to a diverse and inclusive workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know that the efforts of the table will help workers across Canada, including in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie. Workers and labour movements have helped shape Canada into the great country that it is, and will continue to do so for the ambitious future forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>While I am a proud Albertan, I am very concerned about our uncertain future. Albertans need a sustainable future with a healthy environment and a diversified economy, but in order to achieve this, we need federal leadership and support, because Danielle Smith and the Conservatives are taking us backward. Alberta Conservatives have stopped renewable energy development, driving away billions in investment and thousands of good jobs. They have brought back coal, inviting foreign investments to decapitate our Rocky Mountains and poison our water. They are putting toxic tailings ponds on top of sensitive environments like the McClelland dam.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Do his remarks seem undiplomatic? I would argue that he has the courage to speak those truths that deserve repeating on December 8, World Climate Day. Countries that are increasing their fossil fuel production have been branded dangerous nations that are throwing fuel on the fire. Canada, I would add, does the same while disguised as a firefighter. Whether we are speaking of the COP28 president or Canada's multibillion-dollar oil companies, their interests keep feeding the beast of climate change by capturing regulatory authority through their lobbying efforts, using public funds, and hypnotizing decision-makers with their greenwashing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In six years, 2030 will be here. The Secretary-General says that we can prevent our planet from crashing and burning if we act now. Yes, but now is almost over. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inflationary spending has caused a cost of living crisis, forcing millions of hard-working Canadians to visit food banks so they can feed their families. In fact, this is the highest level of food bank use that this country has ever seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A new report released today shows that a family of four will pay $700 dollars more next year on groceries, with meat up 7%, vegetables up 7% and bread up 7% in price. Rising production costs have contributed to these price increases, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> refuses to remove the carbon tax from farmers. This means the tax trickles down to the consumer, leaving Canadians struggling to put food on the table. The solution is simple: Take the carbon tax off farmers and families.</ParaText>

What is more, it is at the discretion of the oil companies, because no cap will be imposed on them before 2030.

It is a catastrophe for Quebec culture and democracy, and of course it is a catastrophe for Radio-Canada creatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Catherine Tait's chosen approach is like water torture: Waves of layoffs stretching out over months, leaving everyone feeling like they could get the boot at any second.

What it shows is that we are well beyond the initial target we had when we were elected, which is 30% reduction; we will more than achieve the 2026 interim milestone, and we are on track to achieve our 40% reduction by 2030.</ParaText>

If he really has questions as to why that amendment passed, he should ask the one-third of Conservative senators who sit in his caucus and did not show up for the vote.

              <ParaText>I would also remind the member that, when it comes to the price on pollution, we learned this week, in fact, that 94% of low- and middle-income Canadians are better off with the rebate than without it. Again, in typical Conservative fashion, they are looking to take from the poor and give to the rich; the only folks who would benefit are the highest income earners, but that is typical Conservative policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I would be delighted to answer the usual Thursday question, because that was slightly out of character. Normally, this is not something we debate. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I have 16 minutes left because, when I started at 10 minutes to two o'clock, I should have only had 10 minutes left, but Conservatives continued to rise on points of order during my speech. It veered into a place of actually trying to prohibit me from speaking. As you sit there and listen, if they attempt to engage in that same tactic again, perhaps you will have to call them into order. I would greatly appreciate your doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Prior to question period, I was trying to explain to this House, and indeed Canadians, that there are way more people who get more back than they put into the carbon tax. That is a fact. What I was saying just before question period is that one of the persons who gets way more back than he puts in is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. We have an individual here who has a government-paid house and a government-paid car. He literally pays none of the expenses that go into the carbon tax, but he gets that rebate. So my question is, in fairness, when we are having a discussion about the price on pollution and how much people are getting back, does the Leader of the Opposition cash his rebate every three or four months when he gets it? I would really like to know the answer to that question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My guess is that he is like the vast majority of Canadians who check that box on page 1 when filing their income tax to receive the rebate on behalf of the family, and that he is receiving it directly deposited into his bank account. Meanwhile, he literally pays nothing into it, if we consider the fact that he has government-funded everything when it comes to expenses. However, I do not know that for a fact. I would encourage the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> to table his bank statements here so that we can properly see whether he is receiving that rebate. I am willing to put money on the fact that he or somebody in his family is receiving that rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am willing to put a lot of money on that because the reality is that, despite the fact that Conservative after Conservative get up to criticize the price on pollution, the carbon tax, they never once mention how much people get back. They do not want to be shown as being glaringly hypocritical. They certainly would be if people actually realized that while Conservatives go on, purporting to be in it for the low-income Canadians and people who are struggling, those are the exact people who actually end up with more than they put in. It is not me who is saying this. This is from our Parliamentary Budget Officer, who Conservatives like to quote so often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to Statistics Canada, and the data it has, when overlaid with this program, 94% of households with incomes below $50,000 receive rebates that exceed their carbon tax costs in 2023. Roughly half of households in this income category see a net gain between $20 and $40 per month, and about 4% see a net gain of $70 per month or more. As a matter of fact, 55% of those who are making at least $250,000 a year still receive more than they put in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Will Conservatives say this? No, of course not. That does not feed properly into their narrative. Conservatives get up in this House and try to suggest they are in it for the folks in our country who are struggling while they completely neglect to tell them this and while they vote against a national food strategy for schools, which they did yesterday. Meanwhile, on the other side, they are trying to suggest that they are the only ones who can help people who are struggling. They are trying to deceive people into thinking that they have the solutions when we know that they do not have the solutions. That is the reality of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I get really concerned when I hear Conservative after Conservative come in here and talk about the price on pollution and how it is impacting people. They talk about farmers as well. Effectively, for 97% of farmers, it nets out to them not paying the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>How can they get up in here time after time and continue to mislead Canadians in this regard? They do it relentlessly. They do it without any consideration for the fact that they are not even telling Canadians the reality of the situation. That is what we see and it is absolutely shameful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Welcome to the show, Madam Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Speaker should know, because she is sitting in the chair now for the first time, that this is the eighth point of order Conservatives have brought up on my speech trying to shut me down. We are going to see more of it. My 20-minute speech is probably going to be about 45 minutes. I take pleasure in knowing at least one Conservative will not be able to speak as a result of them continually cutting into my time like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To that point, let me read to the member the facts from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Some 55% of households with incomes above $250,000 actually end up receiving more in rebates than they pay. That is the fact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Conservatives stand up in here and routinely, day after day, tell Canadians they are paying a carbon tax and it is contributing to all of the problems they have in their lives without even bothering to suggest they get more back than they put into it. This is unless of course someone is one of their rich friends, and probably somebody going to the $1,700 per person fundraiser that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> will be at tonight while all his MPs have to be in here voting. Those are the people they are actually talking to. Those are the people they are actually catering to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is really important to reflect, and this is where I was going a few moments ago, on what is going on in the Conservative Party of Canada. Its members seem to be hung up on this narrative of using information and distorting the information in order to suggest to Canadians that what is happening to them is all at the hands of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, all at the feet of this Prime Minister, without actually reflecting on the reality. They use people's anxieties and fears to people's disadvantage. It is straight out of the alt-right Republican playbook of the MAGA Republicans. This is what we are seeing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With what went on at the Standing Committee on Natural Resources yesterday and the way Conservatives acted, one would have thought it was Matt Gaetz who was the conductor of that ludicrous show of Conservative filibustering and Conservative antics. At one point, multiple Conservative MPs started filling up the room in an attempt to bully, intimidate, yell, heckle and scream in a committee meeting. This is literally the kind of material we see coming out of the U.S. Congress led by people like Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene and others on the right flank of the Republican Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is what we are seeing coming from the other side of the House. We are seeing MAGA politics, the politics of Donald Trump. We are seeing the politics of division, misinformation and the politics of profiting off anxieties and fears. That is what we see coming from the Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Nowhere is that more clearly laid out than the manner in which Conservatives conducted themselves when it came to the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement. In that regard, the Conservatives intentionally voted against that deal, and for what reason? Nobody can really put their finger on it. Everything they seem to come out with is always about four weeks or five weeks after the fact. They never seem to be able to coherently explain to anybody, including the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, the President of Ukraine and Canadians, for that matter, why they voted against it. Instead, they linked it to what they have in today's opposition day motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>They link it to a price on pollution, to a carbon tax, and say they can never support this Ukraine free trade deal, even though the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Canadian Congress want it, because it has a reference to a carbon tax in it. This is notwithstanding the fact that the agreement says environmental policy cannot be imposed in the other jurisdiction. They do not even worry about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What about the fact that Ukraine has had a price on pollution since 2011? It has had a carbon tax since 2011. Ukraine is more progressive than the Conservative Party of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am very concerned when I continually hear the narrative and the misinformation coming from the other side of the House that is led with an objective of dividing Canadians based on misinformation and information that is factually not true. They will do it routinely time after time after time. We see it with Conservatives on just about every issue.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Yesterday, there was a very important private member's bill, for the House to establish a national food policy in schools across Canada and to develop the framework for it so we could work with provinces to implement it. We are the only G7 country without one. There are something like 338 million children in developed countries throughout the world who have access to food in schools. We are pretty much the only country in the developed world that does not, yet Conservatives are even against that. They stand up in the House, complain and go on at great lengths about how people are suffering throughout our country, but then routinely, as every opportunity comes before them to do something for people, they have more interest in trying to put a division through the government and into the minds of Canadians to try to influence them into giving it power. I think it is disgraceful that we have seen this time and again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, there is another opposition day motion before the House. I think this is the 18th or 19th since the last election, when the Conservatives ran on pricing pollution, and here they are, for the 17th, 18th or 19th time, I cannot keep track anymore, bringing in a motion against it. It is ridiculous, when all of them ran on pricing pollution under Erin O'Toole's scheme in the last election, some of whom were even around in 2008 to run under Stephen Harper's government on implementing a price on pollution through a cap-and-trade model that other provinces and U.S. states had adopted. I think it is crazy that they are still coming at it from this perspective. At the end of the day, I think Canadians will hold them to this. Canadians will agree that it is not in the best interests of Canada or of our people to literally turn our back on the environment, on future generations and on what we can do now to make life less dramatic with respect to weather events and the changes that climate change will bring into the future. That is our responsibility. It is something we need to take seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I certainly hope all members of the House will reject the motion, for the 18th or 19th time, so we can finally put to bed the issue of a price on pollution. We have already been through three elections where we have run on this platform and committed to this policy. I do not think that we need any more discussion on it. Canadians have made it very clear where they stand on pricing pollution, especially when we consider that the vast majority of people get back more than they put in. Someone has to be fairly wealthy; have some luxurious goods, a large house and multiple fancy vehicles; and buy a lot of gas and fossil fuels in order to put themself in a position where they are paying more than they are putting in. It is time for Conservatives to start being honest about that and start telling Canadians the truth about the real impact the price of pollution will have on them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, we heard another one of the member's colleagues earlier today say that he had asked the grocery store retailers who would end up paying the carbon tax that farmers and the grocery stores pay. According to one of the member's colleagues, and he can look it up in Hansard, it would be paid by consumers, as the costs would be transferred to them. All I have been trying to say for 20 minutes is that it is the consumer who ends up getting the rebate. The consumer gets the money back because, by the admission of his own colleague, those costs get passed on to the consumer. That is why what I am saying, and it comes from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, is correct; 94% of households get back more back than they put in. Yes, some people are paying directly through a line item on a utility bill. Other people are paying it through the manner in which it is passed on, like the member's colleague said. At the end of the day, we know it is the consumer who pays it and it is the consumer who gets the money back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have just joined the debate for the last few minutes, listening to my colleague speak, and I heard my friend from southern Alberta, the province I am from, speaking about irrigation and the need for it. I have to say that the carbon levy is supposed to be part of a more comprehensive climate change strategy. I, like the member from Medicine Hat, will question whether this has been enough from the current Liberal government, because we have not seen from the government real action on climate change that has reduced emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member brought up the idea that we need to deal with irrigation. Alberta has just had the driest November in a century because of the impacts of climate change. This is the same province that now has a Conservative government trying to coal mine the Rocky Mountains, which would destroy the irrigation from the Oldman River for southern Alberta. The Conservatives do not want to deal with the climate change aspect, which we have to deal with if we are going to be working with farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like my colleague from the Liberal Party to perhaps comment on the fact that the Liberals have not been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at all, and the fact that the Conservatives will not even admit there is a problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, there is a provincial Conservative government in Alberta that also put a moratorium on renewable energy projects. Can people imagine, in the year 2023, when the entire world is moving toward renewable energy, that a provincial government would put a moratorium on the innovation and the progress of where the world is moving to? That is not going to benefit Alberta in the long run. It might help a bit in the short run for a little political gain, but it is not going to help anybody in the long run.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With respect to the member's question about meeting targets, I would much rather have very ambitious targets and not quite achieve them than have some lofty goals that are not realistic or that are overly easy to achieve. It is extremely important that when we do set these goals, we set them in a way that allows us to actually strive for something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I recognize that we are on target to meet our 2026 goals, and we are certainly on target to meet the 2030 goals, but I know that the member knows, because she cares about the environment so much, that this is not the kind of thing we accomplish overnight. We are talking about societal and cultural changes in the way that people behave in terms of everyday life. It is extremely difficult to encourage people to change behaviour when there is a political party in here, the Conservative Party of Canada, the opposition, that is actively doing the other thing and telling people, “No, no, what you are doing by burning fossil fuels is totally fine; keep doing this because, do not worry, we will get rid of this if we get elected.”</ParaText>

The carve-out for home heating with oil is across the entire country. In my province of Ontario, there are twice as many people who use oil as in Atlantic Canada. I will say, though, that I believe that this is not the case in Quebec, because Quebec actually has a very ambitious program to get off fossil fuels; one will not be not allowed to build a new house there, as of the end of this year, or even to renovate and replace one's heating system, with a fossil-fuel-based appliance.</ParaText>

Even if one makes $250,000 a year, 55% of Canadian households that make $250,000 a year still get more back than they put in. Why will he not say that when he stands up?

              <ParaText>I am very grateful to have an opportunity to speak to today's opposition day motion, because it is an issue that has been affecting the constituents in Souris—Moose Mountain significantly since the Liberal government came into power. Time and time again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made it clear that he does not support Canadian agriculture producers or care about their livelihoods. Nothing has made this more obvious than his refusal to remove the carbon tax from farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Since the Liberals do not seem to have any understanding whatsoever of the importance of agriculture, not just for Saskatchewan but for all of Canada, I would like to paint a little picture for them. Saskatchewan farms account for the biggest share of Canada's total farm area, at 39.2%, to be precise. It is among the world's largest exporters of various field crops, such as canola, and it leads the country in the cultivation of cereal grains, oilseeds and pulses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This means that, in many instances, when people put food on the table for themselves and their families, they can thank a farmer from Saskatchewan for producing it. In fact, I was speaking with the French ambassador to Canada on Tuesday. He told me that France, which happens to be a world leader in mustard, is extremely dependent on Saskatchewan's mustard seed crop, especially when we have droughts and the crop is poor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With 66.9% of Saskatchewan's total farm area being made up of cropland, which is more than two-fifths of Canada's total cropland, it is commonly called the breadbasket of Canada. Even the Statistics Canada website uses this phrase, so the federal government must be aware of what our farmers do to feed Canada and the world, as well as the benefits they bring to our country's economy. Why the government chooses to punish the very same farmers who work tirelessly, day in and day out, to bring the highest-quality produce from the farm to the table, I personally cannot understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Farming is not an easy lifestyle. The days are long, with farmers getting up before sunrise and finishing their workday in the dark. They are at the mercy of nature, and as we all know in the House, the weather in Canada does not always co-operate with our wants and needs. Still, our farmers persevere, because they are dedicated to their work; they are willing to make sacrifices in order to get the job done. The least we can do is support them, yet the Liberals choose instead to tax them at every turn and make their lives harder by quadrupling the carbon tax on their input costs. This will only increase the cost of food for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Food insecurity is a real issue in Canada right now, and it is something that I have been concerned about for a number of years under the mismanagement of the Liberal government. According to Food Banks Canada, there were nearly two million visits to food banks in one month back in March 2023, an increase of 79% from 2019. This is an alarming statistic, especially when we factor in the Liberals' inability to control inflation and the cost of living crisis that so many Canadians are currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>From 2021 to 2022, the number of families who were food insecure increased by more than 12%, yet the Liberals are still forcing these very same families to pay a carbon tax on just about everything they buy. In fact, a new report that came out today shows that a family of four will pay $700 more next year on groceries; that is on top of the $1,065 extra that they paid this year. For many families, that amount of money is the difference between being able to pay the rent or keep the heat on for the winter and not being able to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Projections show that, in 2024, there will be a 2.5% to 4.5% increase in food prices, with meat, vegetables and bakery items rising from 5% to 7%. Because of these rapidly rising prices, Canadians across the country are reducing their expenditures on groceries, either by reducing the quantity or quality of food they are buying or by substituting less-expensive alternatives. We are now seeing the highest level of food bank usage in Canada on record, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must answer for this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>What I just read did not come from a partisan Conservative source, as the Liberals would probably like everyone to believe. It came from a reputable and well-established organization with the goal of seeing a Canada where no one goes hungry. What is a simple and straightforward way of doing this? It is to stop taxing the very farmers who produce the food, so the costs do not get passed on to the consumer. If we tax the farmer who grows the food and the trucker who ships the food, it is ultimately the consumer who pays that tax. The Liberals either do not understand this or do not care, and hard-working, average Canadians are paying the price for their apathy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Since the inception of the Liberal carbon tax, my office has been inundated with emails and letters from constituents who call on the government to axe the tax so they can make ends meet. People are so upset and frustrated that they are actually sending me copies of their power bills, something that has never happened before in my eight years as an MP. They want me to see just how much the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is hurting them, especially those who live on a fixed income, such as seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am going to share a few quotes from these letters, with the hope they resonate with members across the floor the same way they did with me. One email that was sent to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300009" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> and copied to my office says, “You can't be serious with your comment that the carbon tax is minimal in your interview with CTV. The prices of everything we are paying for have been affected! We, as Canadians, are suffering directly from the carbon tax! I'm asking you to please stop with the carbon tax if you really care about the citizens of Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another email, one that was accompanied by a copy of a power bill, reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>“I'd like to bring to the attention of the Prime Minister what it is like to live in rural Canada. We are so tired of hearing how easy it should be to use public transportation and not rely on natural gas. All those things that are available to large city dwellers. We do live in a town of 1500 people. My husband needed cancer surgery in July and we had to drive 3 hours one way to the hospital. In rural areas, there is no public transportation like taxis or buses that would take us to these appointments, let alone directly from our home to the hospital door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>“Our vehicle gas bill is quite hefty.... Gas in our area runs around $1.40 per litre. We drive an SUV, but it still costs $500.00 approximately for the three trips needed every two weeks for my husband's medical condition.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do not know how much clearer we can possibly be that the carbon tax is hurting Canadians and disproportionately hurting those who are already struggling to afford the necessities of life. To add insult to injury, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has chosen to provide an unfair carbon tax carve-out to those living on the east coast, while those living in the prairie provinces are given no relief whatsoever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>According to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278915" Type="4">Minister for Rural Economic Development</Affiliation>, if the Prairies want to be adequately represented in the House of Commons, they should have elected more Liberals. Apparently, the people of southeast Saskatchewan are not important enough in the Liberals' electoral math to get the same deal as those in Atlantic Canada. Furthermore, this came from the minister who is meant to represent all rural Canadians, not just those who vote Liberal. This kind of divisive statement continues to cement the fact that the government cares only about those who might be valuable to them when the next election rolls around. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has created two classes of Canadians: those who pay the carbon tax and those who do not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians deserve a government that does the work for the people who do the work in this country, and that includes our farmers, their families and all those who pay taxes and contribute to our economy. Canadians do not want gimmicks or temporary measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>With that said, it is time for a change. It is time to stop taking money out of Canadians' pockets in the midst of an unprecedented cost of living crisis. It is time for a new Conservative government to bring it home for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the basic problem we face, a problem that has been going on for months, is that some political parties are unreasonable and put different misleading labels on all the others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here is a prime example of this situation. Today's opposition day was triggered by Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C‑234</Document>, which is currently in the Senate, and by the amendment that was passed in the Senate. Last week, we voted against a motion because some senators had been bullied, which is unacceptable in a G7 country. As a matter of principle, the Bloc Québécois opposed a motion, even though it was in favour of Bill C‑234. I rarely hear the Conservatives talk about that. All that I hear them say is that the Bloc-Liberal coalition is imposing a carbon tax. I wish we could be a little more conscientious and stick to the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to ask my colleague the following. Does he acknowledge that some politicians here are trying to act reasonably for the common good and make compromises? That is what the Bloc Québécois did with Bill C‑234, which does not apply to Quebec. I would remind everyone that this bill does not apply to Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have it on good authority that the <Affiliation DbId="278617" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite Christmas movie is <I>The Grinch</I>. In fact, it may be where the Prime Minister came up with the idea for his carbon tax. Just like the Grinch took the food off the plates of the Whos in Whoville, the Prime Minister is also a fan of taking food off the plates of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Grinch took more of a hands-on approach to ruining Christmas by personally going into their homes and stealing the food. That may have seemed too much like real work for our ivory-tower <Affiliation DbId="278617" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He simply used the CRA to collect his carbon tax, but the effect is still the same. He has removed the presents out from under the Christmas trees of Canadians and left the pantries of Canadian families empty. Here is a twist: Even the Grinch came to realize that what he had done was wrong and he remedied his ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is what we are doing here today. We are giving the <Affiliation DbId="278617" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the NDP-Liberal coalition the opportunity to prove to Canadians before Christmas that their hearts are not two sizes too small and to remedy their ways. We all know that the next election will be a carbon tax election. Even this grinch of a Prime Minister knows that most Canadians will no longer vote for him and are rejecting the inflationary carbon tax, which really does nothing for the environment. Maybe, just maybe, the <Affiliation DbId="278617" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in the Christmas spirit and all, will allow Canadian farmers, first nations and families to afford to eat and heat their homes this Christmas and will provide some relief from his Christmas-killing tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Maybe he does not understand. We know that he refuses to listen to common sense, but maybe one of his ministers will be able to relay a message. Here is the message, so they should get their pens ready: A tax on farmers is a tax on food, period. It is pretty simple. However, it is worse than that. It is a tax on healthy, locally grown food. Annoyingly, it costs the consumer more to buy food, but that generally seems to sum up the Liberal approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The carbon tax on healthy food is where this tax becomes even more nonsensical, but that is also not unlike the Liberals. Take, for example, the produce grown at Big Marble Farms, a large greenhouse operation just outside the city of Medicine Hat. Do members know that carbon dioxide is used to feed greenhouse horticultural crops? Big Marble, and all greenhouses, use CO2 generated from heating and operating their facilities to feed their crops. Just think about how nonsensical the carbon tax really is when considering that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals tax the very CO2 that enriches greenhouse crops to utilize their full photosynthetic potential. This environmentally friendly process of using the CO2 generated from greenhouse operations using natural gas helps grow plants. However, the Liberals claim that for environmental reasons, they need to tax the carbon that produces fresh vegetables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just to illustrate this further, Big Marble Farms will pay over $500,000 in carbon tax this year alone. It will pay $500,000 for feeding the crops and produce that it grows in its greenhouses. Agricultural producers across my riding will each spend tens of thousands of dollars annually on the carbon tax. In order to remain in the business of supplying Canadians with fresh produce, grains, meat and other food, in most cases these costs are passed on to the consumer. It is a tax that disproportionately affects those in my riding trying to grow food and those wanting to eat healthy and local food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us take that same greenhouse-grown produce and compare it to the food we see in our grocery stores from other countries, which is not subject to a ridiculous tax. They grow it, ship it thousands of kilometres to Canada and sell it in our groceries stores cheaper than we do. Why? It is because they are not subject to the carbon tax on production or transportation. It makes absolutely no sense, none whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In fact, “Canadians are reducing their expenditures on groceries, either by reducing the quantity or quality of food they are buying or by substituting less expensive alternatives.” What does this lead to? For starters, projections for 2024 show a 2.5% to 4.5% increase in food prices. Notably, meat is projected to rise another 5% to 7%, vegetables will be up another 5% to 7% and bakery items will be up another 5% to 7%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Why are food prices rising? Rising production costs are contributing to these price increases, all because of the carbon tax. It hurts Canadian farmers, it hurts Canadian families and it hurts our first nations. In fact, a new food price report shows that a family of four will now pay $700 more on their groceries in the coming year. That is on top of the price increases we have already experienced in 2023 and 2022</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Do members want to know why we should care at all about this? Let us start with the fact that we are experiencing the highest level of food bank use in Canadian history. In Medicine Hat, the Root Cellar Food and Wellness Hub is our food bank. It is currently feeding 4% of Medicine Hat and the area, which has a population of well over 75,000 constituents. It is a heartwarming level of generosity by the Root Cellar team and the community that contributes, but it is an agonizing statistic when we let it sink in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The decisions that were made in this chamber by the NDP-Liberal coalition government have led to hungry families in my riding and across this great country. I hope that if there are any members in this House, or in the Senate for that matter, who lack the self-awareness required to vote against farmers, first nations and families, they are reminded of this by their own families, by their own neighbours and by their own constituents while they celebrate this Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Food Banks Canada's 2023 hunger count revealed there were nearly two million visits to food banks in a single month, a 78.5% increase over March 2019. It is unbelievable. With that many community members relying on food banks to eat, the NDP-Liberal members must know that some of these visits were made by their own constituents and by their own neighbours. They are going to have to face these people. I do not know how they are going to do that and justify their decisions in those moments they meet them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am thankful that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> put forward a motion to help them. I have the ability to speak to that motion today, thankfully, and will vote in favour of helping those in my community and across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How could the Liberal-NDP coalition government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ever vote against the farmers, first nations and families growing our food, heating their homes and eating? To try to understand how they could even consider voting this way, I may have to look back to Dr. Seuss's book about the Grinch for the answer:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I was tempted to ask whether this is about carbon pricing itself or the fact that we have to get more countries on board and have it built into a carbon border adjustment mechanism like we are seeing in Europe. However, he mentioned that carbon pricing is forming higher input costs, and he did not talk about anything else, no other factors. There was nothing about climate change and nothing about supply chains. He never talked about the war in Ukraine. There are a lot of Ukrainians in Red Deer, a large proportion of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We had a bill before this House that talked about supporting Ukraine through a free trade agreement. There is already a carbon price in Ukraine, as we have a carbon price here in Canada, yet the member voted against a simple, straightforward bill that would have supported economic efficiency in that country and could perhaps help Ukraine win the war and get food prices down.

              <ParaText>I want to focus back on my riding. I want to focus back on Canadians. What is driving their costs up is the high cost of production. The carbon tax is exactly part of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reality is that we have greenhouses that produce huge amounts of food and have to pay $500,000 in a carbon tax. The Liberals always talk about getting money back, but this is what the net cost is for the carbon tax. It is impossible for them to not pass that on to the consumer and still remain in business. Maybe what we should do is focus on the carbon tax and what it is doing to Canadians right here in our own country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>To follow up on what my Liberal colleague was saying, let us talk about climate change. What is going to be really costly to taxpayers? It certainly has to do with agriculture, but not with the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What farmers are telling us is that the lack of water is going to be costly. Crops lost to pests are going to be costly. Heat is having a real impact on livestock, productivity and reproduction. There is less snow, which protects the earth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a result of all of that, yes, it will be more costly. Climate change is here and it will be here for good if we do nothing to control it or reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. What does my colleague think of that analysis?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I hope that you are doing well. I wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278702" Type="2">West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country</Affiliation>, British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I rise today to speak to a motion moved by the opposition. I like having the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with the members of the opposition about their thoughts, their policies and their feelings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First, I feel the need to explain the motion we are discussing. It is the reality. The House is calling on the government to repeal the carbon tax on farmers, first nations and families. I will speak to those three points.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>I will bring a level of moderation to this conversation. I have heard a whole bunch of stuff here today, and I will give my perspective on the motion and on the question, writ large, about where Canada goes in the days ahead in relation to environmental progress and how we get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I come into this conversation as someone who believes in the principle of carbon pricing. There is merit to it. Inherently, it is a mechanism that actually allows the private sector to make those decisions. My hon. colleagues across the way in opposition often talk about big government or the idea that they do not like big government, but it seems that, if they do have a climate plan, it would be predicated on big government programs as opposed to letting the private sector decide how to innovate and how to drive emissions down. Of course, that is what we are focused on: driving GHG emissions down. We know the science is clear and that work has to be done. Canada is in a global effort on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I want to address each of the elements of the motion because the motion, to the Conservatives' credit, is somewhat reasonably put forward in that it is straightforward in what it is asking for. It does not have too much inflammatory language, but it also does not talk about the other types of arguments or the other elements that are at play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For example, let me start with families. We have heard in the House, and we have heard from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, that under the federal backstop, eight out of 10 Canadian families are receiving more money back than what they pay in. The House has heard a number of times this week of a column that was talking about Trevor Tombe, a Calgary economist, who talked about this relating not only to direct but also to indirect costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is largely void from the conversation I am hearing from the official opposition about the fact that there even are rebates. I heard a couple of people in the House say that they are taking the money and they do not know what they are doing with it. With all due respect, that is a bit disingenuous. We know exactly what the money is doing. It is revenue neutral to the government and it is being put back. I take no issue if the Conservative Party does not believe in the way that is happening and would like to see adjustments and changes. Very often, we hear the Conservatives just lambasting the idea of any form of carbon pricing, and that is important for us to weigh in on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are business operators making decisions all across the world right now, including here in Canada, who are relying on the idea that there will be a form of carbon pricing, and they are building their industrial strategies in that way. We have not heard from the Conservatives as to whether they support any form of carbon pricing, nor have we heard what their plan is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Do I think that every member on the opposition bench is a climate denier? No, I do not, but I do worry that the party is not genuine in its interest of tackling the questions of affordability and environment at the same time and the progress we need to make in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With respect to families, when the Conservatives are saying they want to cut the federal backstop, they are saying they want to cut money that goes back to lower- and middle-income families at a higher rate than what people pay out, both directly and indirectly. The Conservatives should start becoming clear about what exactly they are saying. They want to take money away from lower- and middle-income Canadians, full stop.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives often talked about the indirect costs of the carbon price. Yes, there are some indirect costs, and we have to weigh those versus the price signal, which will drive innovation and the economy in this country, the clean tech economy that is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have talked about families, so in my time remaining, let me talk about first nations and farmers. There is a mechanism right now under the federal backstop that returns money back to first nations. The Conservatives will quote a judicial decision that some first nations in Ontario have brought forward. They are trying to push for changes and adjustments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We can have that conversation. I have talked to members on our side in the indigenous caucus, and they support a carbon price. They know environmental progress is important. Again, we do not hear the Conservatives stepping up to offer tangible solutions about how they would adjust or change the policies. They are just saying they would scrap everything to do with it without providing any guidance to Canadians about what their actual climate plan is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have seen the government make adjustments. There are existing reasonable exemptions within the carbon pricing plan across the country. I was pleased to see, just over a month ago, the government make changes that will really matter to rural Canadians across the country. We increased the rural rebate to 20%. This is something that was driven by members in this caucus, who did not come in with the opening premise of saying that we should kill carbon pricing all together, but of letting us adjust it to make sure Canadians in every corner of this country can feel like they are part of the solution on climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We never heard a single word from the Conservative benches about what that means for their constituents. I again take notice that maybe they do not support this, but what do they support? If they want to be the government in waiting, they better start actually talking about what it is they do support and what they stand for, which I have not heard much of lately other than, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> has mentioned, 19 straight opposition day motions that are largely on this topic alone. I do not know what else they have in the tool kit. I guess we will see, but this seems to be a favourite one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On farmers, what the opposition day motion does not mention is that there are existing exemptions for on farm fuels for gasoline and diesel already. They referenced often Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>. This is a bill I supported at second reading and at third reading, and we saw it off to the Senate. I do believe the work the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food did at the House level to examine the question and to have a sunset clause that would reasonably allow some period of time, particularly on the question of grain and vegetable drying, is a reasonable one. It is an extension of the existing exemption that actually makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Some in the House would not agree with me on that principle, and that is fine. We have heard consistently question after question in the House somehow lambasting the government for blocking this in the Senate. Senators would know the government position on it. The government position was to support farmers in different ways, to be able to put different mechanisms back and still keep the price signal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is not being talked about, or not very often, is that the Senate record shows at least five of the 15 Conservative senators were not in the chamber on the day that amendment was put forward. It was ultimately voted on by 40 to 39. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> stood in the House for weeks talking about this bill. I am sure the Conservative fundraising emails will not mention that a third of his Senate caucus did not even bother to show up on the day, on their own legislation. That matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>An hon. member:</B> That's not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <B>Mr. Kody Blois:</B> Is it not true? Senator Michael MacDonald was not there. Senator Boisvenu was not there. Senator Manning was not in the Senate. I could go on. I have them all listed on my phone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I hear my Conservative colleague saying that is not true. Well, it is true. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> is the only party leader in the House of Commons who is still a leader for certain senators in the Senate, and if he cannot get his members to show up to get their legislation through, maybe they have to be looking in the mirror a little. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will remind members that I do support this legislation. When it comes back in the House, I will be supporting it unamended. However, some blame needs to be put on the Conservative Party members themselves about their procedural tactics, including in the Senate, where Senator Don Plett had to apologize for his tactics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> was quite distasteful about how he went about putting a wanted poster with a senator's picture up on social media. That is a style of politics that does not belong in Canada. We have a tradition of having a better decorum and respect. At the end of the day, that has to be called out in the same way as the issue that is before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs right now. We should maybe move a motion to bring the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, for his actions, before PROC, because they are equally as concerning to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I see my time is coming to an end, and I wish I had more of it, but I know my Conservative colleagues and all members of the House will give me an opportunity to continue to build on my thoughts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>As to the question around barn heating and cooling, are there other methods to turn to? I think, yes, more so than grain and vegetable drying, which is either natural gas or propane. There are other alternatives for barn heating and cooling, but the committee weighed that and felt that, at this time, the affordability costs and the ability to make the transition were difficult, so it should also be included. The bill has come back to the House, and we will have that debate. At least the grain and vegetable drying portion should absolutely become law, and I would support a more expansive piece on barn heating and cooling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am not surprised that the Conservatives want to kill carbon pricing. They have wanted to kill it since the moment this government introduced it back in 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to explain something to my hon. colleague. Keeping a price signal on heating oil would have been strictly for politics and not for public policy. Let me explain that the 1.1 million households that use heating oil in this country, including almost 400,000 in Quebec, are paying the highest cost to heat their homes in the country, and it is the worst from an environmental perspective. If people are asking themselves why they are paying the highest cost to heat their homes, it is probably because they cannot pay the cost for the transition toward a better source, whether it is natural gas, propane or even an electric source.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government recognized this in 2022. It put $250 million on the table to help people in Quebec and all across Canada make a transition. However, it would not matter if the price was $3,000 a tonne. People in some parts of my riding cannot afford to make the transition, and that is why the government put a pause on the carbon tax for three years with a direct tie to an enhanced heat pump program to help people make a transition. It was the responsible thing to do. It applies across the country, and it does not undermine the climate program. In fact, the heat pump program is going to make a difference on affordability and for the environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is an honour again to join the debate in the House on the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>By my count, this is the 13th time Conservatives have brought forward some sort of motion on eliminating carbon pricing since the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> became their leader, but it could very well be more than that. I have heard today that it is the 19th time some permutation of this motion has been brought forward. It is ironic, because Conservatives ran in the last election on bringing in carbon pricing. It did not make a lot of sense, but at least it was something. In fact, it was not the only time they ran on bringing in a carbon price. Under Stephen Harper in 2008, they ran on, get this, the green plan, but then, just like now, they flip-flopped. Now they say they want to cut it, and they are masquerading the motion as some measure in support of affordability in Canada, as if carbon pricing were the reason the cost of living challenges in Canada right now are significant.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, a recent study has been brought up today in the debate by a well-respected University of Calgary economist, Trevor Tombe. Utilizing Statistics Canada data has shown that when considering both the direct and the indirect cost of the price on pollution, 94% of households with incomes below $50,000 receive rebates that exceed the carbon tax cost. Most of them see a net benefit of $20 to $40 a month, while 4% of them actually see a net gain of $70 per month. Even 55% of households with incomes above $250,000 a year receive more in rebates than they pay in the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, getting rid of the price on pollution would disproportionally benefit the ultrarich, and eliminating it would not only undermine a policy that is responsible for, according to the Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development, one-third of our carbon emissions reductions; it would also be a true reverse Robin Hood, which would steal from the poor to give to the rich, and that is not in the Christmas spirit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is actually boosting the price of fossil fuels in Canada? It is important to look at the facts. Since 2020, the carbon price on heating oil has increased by only 12¢ a litre, while the average price for heating oil is now 75¢ higher. What is driving up the other 63¢, or what is five times more responsible for the increase in cost? Canadians are overwhelmingly feeling the impacts of geopolitics, and fossil fuel inflation is caused by a rise in the global price of oil and gas. This includes the illegal and unjustified Russian war of aggression in Ukraine and the global disruption that has caused to the energy market. It is sad that the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> says nothing about this. He is quiet on support for Ukraine and has in fact abandoned it in its time of need by voting against updating a free trade agreement with Ukraine, which President Zelenskyy specifically asked for. As well, since Ukraine is one of the world's breadbaskets, we need to do everything we can to support it to win the war and end the disruption it has had on global food prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What else has caused fossil fuel prices to increase? It is the measure that OPEC is taking to squeeze the supply of oil. While the Conservatives will rail against so-called dictator oil as a reason why we should massively increase emissions in Canada, Canada imported double the amount of foreign oil when the Conservatives were last in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What happens when the global price of oil and gas rises? Of course, the oil and gas industry benefits. The oil and gas industry in Canada is making record profits by gobbling up the extra 63¢ a litre at the expense of Canadians. Since 2022, the oil and gas sector in Canada has had a $30-billion increase in profits, or a 1,000% increase since 2019. Where are these profits going? There has been $29 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Where are these shareholders? Overwhelmingly, they are not even in Canada. Do we ever hear the Conservatives talk about this? Of course not. They would rather peddle alternative facts that would make even Donald Trump blush, with their factory discourse on the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is bad enough that the Conservative MPs from where the federal system applies rail on these baseless claims, but many of the Conservative MPs from my province of British Columbia are making the claim as well. The hypocrisy is no more evident than with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278707" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation>, who was part of the B.C. Liberal government that brought in the carbon tax in British Columbia. In 2017, he said in the B.C. legislature:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Of course, what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278707" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation> said in 2017 is the truth. A price on pollution is one-third of the reason Canada has reduced emissions by more than any other G7 country since 2019. However, not only is the argument they make on carbon pricing factually incorrect; Conservatives will say that we have not met a climate target, which is disingenuous, because our targets have always been for 2030 and 2050, and we are making major progress in getting there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Today's update of our emissions reduction plan shows that we are on track to meet our emissions objective for 2026 and also on track to meet our 2030 targets to reduce emissions by at least 40%. Just this week, we have built on our progress to date by announcing two new measures, draft regulations that would reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by 75% by 2030, and, as announced just today, a groundbreaking framework that would cap and reduce emissions from the oil and gas sector and have them steadily reduce over time to ensure we meet our emissions reduction goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know what the saying is: If someone repeats a falsehood enough times, even they will eventually believe it. If someone can convince themself so much that they internalize it, they can confidently spread those mistruths to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the challenging times the world is going through, people are looking for simple solutions. Enter the Conservatives, who will throw the complexity and the facts to the side and just want to talk about “common sense”. We saw what this jettisoning of the facts has done under the Conservatives before. During the Harper era, they completely gutted science in Canada, specifically anything related to the environment and to climate change. They also eliminated the long-form census because they do not actually believe in making policy based on evidence. We cannot go back to that. They do not actually want people to have lower heating bills; they want them to be stuck and strapped into the roller coaster of global fossil fuel prices. If they truly believed in saving Canadians money on energy, they would support our policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Switching from home heating oil to a heat pump will save families between $1,500 and $3,500 a year. That is why we are working with the provinces and territories to roll out programs to speed up the adoption of heat pumps in Canada. Together with switching to an EV, this can save families as much as $10,000 a year. The government is intent on making that happen with a series of incentives and programs. It is working. As I mentioned, emissions are going down. Over 18% of new vehicle sales were electric last year, and 26% of new vehicle sales in B.C. in the last quarter were zero-emission vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is not only the future; it is also the present. We cannot let the Conservatives bring us back to the Stone Age. This motion, along with the last 12 or 18 or whatever it may, is simply a distraction from the real reason the cost of energy is high, which is, of course, the windfall profits from the oil and gas sector. The Conservatives would rather keep Canadians strapped into this roller coaster while the majority of foreign-owned fossil fuel companies are hosing Canadians, sending tens of billions of dollars from Canadians outside of the country while handing out massive bonuses to CEOs and cutting thousands of Canadian jobs. Instead, we are showing how we can deliver a cleaner and more prosperous economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague kind of missed the whole point of the motion being brought forward. It is that Canadians right now are suffering. They are having a hard time putting food on the table and a roof over their head.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just in the last hour or so, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston</Affiliation> mentioned how difficult it is going to be for his constituents to transition.

              <ParaText>I am just wondering whether the member could be transparent and let Canadians know what other policies are in the pipe and what Liberal members of Parliament know that Canadians do not know that will cause more pain and make it more difficult to meet standards?

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, as I mentioned in my speech earlier, the vast majority of Canadians actually receive more in rebates than they pay in the price on pollution. In fact, this is not just a climate measure; it is actually an affordability measure at the same time. We know that it is important to support Canadians so they can transition into cleaner forms of transportation and home heating. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> just talked about our program on supporting Canadians to adopt heat pumps. This is absolutely essential, because it will save Canadians a ton of money, especially low-income Canadians. It is important that we provide a lot of those supports up front, so it is important that we work with provinces and territories to do that. When we are talking about transitioning to electric vehicles, it is why it is important that we have those incentives there to support Canadians to adopt them until the price comes down. The price is starting to come down as the technology gets more and more mature and as we reach economies of scale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a very important role for the government to assist in the rollout of a lot of these measures, and that is precisely what the government is committed to doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the premise of her question is incorrect; I actually voted in favour of the NDP motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many countries around the world have brought in windfall taxes on the oil and gas sector, at this time of especially high prices, to be able to provide that support to their residents. I think there is merit in that, because it does target the reason for the increased cost that Canadians are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I also want to mention that, today, when we are seeing these record profits in this sector, it is not actually being invested into decarbonizing operations. That is why our announcement today that we are capping emissions from the oil and gas sector is so key: We want those record profits to be invested in reducing emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This cap that we are bringing in is actually going to lead to a tremendous amount of new investment in Canada and new jobs, while also making sure that we can meet our emissions reduction targets. It is a very important measure that will be a key plank of our climate action.</ParaText>

While I will be sharing my views here and sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278432" Type="2">Red Deer—Mountain View</Affiliation>, I want to tell members something I heard earlier that struck me as funny.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Members from the government have said that the Conservatives are taking the country back to the Stone Age. I just ate off a wooden fork. The wooden fork was created by the Byzantine Empire, by the Romans during the Roman period of the fourth century. It may have even been created much earlier, by the Greeks in the ancient world. Do members know how unpleasant that was? The thing that is interesting enough, and I know the member from Manitoba is going to love what I have to say, is that the government is putting Canadians back to the Ice Age, which came before the Stone Age, back when everything was freezing cold. That is what the Liberals have done to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In this speech today, I will cover the negative impact of the carbon tax on farmers, first nations and families. Let us start with first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am proud to represent four first nations in Miramichi—Grand Lake: Metepenagiag, Eel Ground, Esgenoôpetitj and Elsipogtog. One of the proudest moments of my career was to be named the first-ever stand-alone aboriginal affairs minister for the great province of New Brunswick. It was an honour and a privilege to work with the 15 first nations chiefs, many of whom are here in Ottawa for the election of the new AFN chief. I congratulate Ms. Cindy Woodhouse on her election today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have gotten to spend time with many indigenous leaders this week, who have told me how frustrated they are after eight years of failed Liberal policies. One of the greatest myths in our country and in our time is that the Liberal Party of Canada is a friend to indigenous peoples. I will explain that mythology to members now and to the people watching. If the Liberals cannot get adequate drinking water for indigenous peoples, then let us not call them their friends; that is a necessity of life, and they have failed at that endeavour in every single element of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As another example, the Ontario first nations and the Attawapiskat First Nation are taking the Liberal government to court over the unfair carbon tax. They argue that the Liberal government's failed policy unjustly and disproportionately burdens their communities, which already face hardships because of a lack of basic infrastructure and severe poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The chiefs of Ontario and Attawapiskat have tried to engage and negotiate with the Liberal government, but to no avail. Now, unnecessarily, they must spend money on lawyers to take the Liberal government to court. These residents do not have the money to install retrofits such as heat pumps. Many first nations are remote and lack basic infrastructure, such as clean drinking water, as aforementioned; moreover, they do not have access to viable alternatives, such as cleaner-burning fuels or public transportation, as is also true of many residents in Miramichi—Grand Lake. The claim that the carbon tax is revenue neutral was always a claim about what the government would take in, not what consumers would actually be paying. The Liberal government members want people to believe they can keep increasing taxes and people will still end up with more money in their pockets; but this is not true for farmers, first nations or the families who are heating their homes in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am blessed to have four children who are very active. We need all hands on deck on the weekends, taking them to events that can occur across the province. My mother assists my wife on most days when I am here; sometimes, my dad assists as well. They are both 66 years old. There was a weekend when my daughter was in Saint John for a gymnastics championship. That is a six-hour round trip from Blackville, where I reside. My son's high school hockey team won a provincial tournament played in Saint-Léonard, New Brunswick, the home of my good friend Senator Percy Mockler. It was an exciting final game, but it took an eight-hour round-trip drive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>If someone lives in a rural area, such as Miramichi—Grand Lake, and they need to drive the kids to sporting, arts or cultural events, then they know the painful impact the carbon tax is having. They are paying more every single time they fill up their car or truck.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Unfortunately, some children who played sports prior to the carbon tax are now not playing those sports, because the parents cannot keep up with the costs. It is very real. It is happening in my community and in first nations communities. Most people in my area have at least two vehicles; one is usually a truck. Let me be clear: They are not electric, but that is a story for another day. People are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I attended the finance committee's pre-budget consultation in Fredericton not long ago, this fall. The head of the largest food bank in Fredericton told us that they saw a 35.7% increase in use last year. Across Canada, there were nearly two million food bank visits in 2023, the highest food bank use in Canadian history. Canadians are being forced to use food banks because of the Liberal government's out-of-control inflationary spending. It is driving up the cost of everything. On top of this, it is driving up the cost of food even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada's Food Price Report 2023 predicts that food costs for a typical family of four will rise by $700 in 2024. This is on top of an increase of $1,065 in 2023. We can think about that. The typical family of four is going to pay $1,700 or more for groceries in just two years than they were already paying. The carbon price's negative impact on food inflation is real. Meat, vegetables and baked goods are up 5% to 7%. That is why we are calling on the Liberal government to take the tax off farmers, first nations and home heating for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Farmers are being left out in the cold by the NDP-Liberal coalition, which is desperate to prevent them from getting a carbon tax carve-out for grain drying, barn heating and other farm operations. The Liberal carbon tax will continue to go up every year, increasing the pain felt by farmers, first nations and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For my Miramichi—Grand Lake constituents, the upcoming choice will be clear. The NDP and Liberals take their money, tax their food, punish their work and double their housing costs. It is a choice between the costly NDP-Liberal coalition and a common-sense Conservative government that will axe the tax. It is the only choice for Canadians, for farmers, for families and for first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On the topic of farmers, I spent a lot of time on a file recently with the National Capital Commission. There was a group that had to tear down an old stable, and they replaced it with an $8-million barn. It was laced with the best fibre optics on Planet Earth, an elevator that goes down under the ground and solar panels. It has all these luxury features. It is a barn. Farmers right now need a carve-out on the carbon tax so they can grow us the food that we need to stay healthy in this country, and we have a government that approved a budget for a corporation to build an $8-million barn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I can tell everyone today that there is a choice. Miramichi—Grand Lake constituents have a choice too in the upcoming election, and I am proud to give it to them. The costly NDP-Liberal coalition takes Canadians' money, takes their food, taxes their food, punishes their work and doubles their housing costs. A common-sense Conservative government is the only choice, because we will bring it home and axe the tax.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise today, especially to speak on behalf of farmers, first nations and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The members of the Liberal-NDP government are completely out of touch with the real needs of Canadians. Their blind, ideological obsession has increased the price of groceries for a family of four by over $700, bringing the total family cost to over $16,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Ontario first nations are seeking a judicial review of the federal government's carbon pricing regime, arguing that Ottawa's pollution pricing policy unjustly and disproportionately burdens their communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Farmers continue to be handcuffed by an embedded carbon tax on farm inputs that unfairly affects their bottom line and affects their competitiveness within the global agricultural market. Farming and farmers across this country have unique obstacles through which they must navigate. Those farmers who do not face competition from foreign food suppliers tend to be able to pass some of the added expenses onto the consumer but costs like fuel, fertilizer, herbicides, seed, labour, transportation, capital costs, interest and property taxes cause many sleepless nights for farmers. Another item that many businesses would factor in is profit; however, that is never guaranteed in farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While we are discussing competitiveness, if we look to our friends in Australia, who have axed the tax in favour of a direct action policy, where investment dollars are available, the competitiveness is creating new technology and achieving targets without taxing citizens and businesses. Canadian farmers, first nations, and small and medium-sized businesses in Canada are grappling with a competitiveness problem because of these restrictive and harmful Liberal-NDP coalition policies. We see this competitive disadvantage compared to our international allies that do not have a carbon tax, like the United States. We see Canadian companies that have developed clean technology or telecommunications achievements leaving Canada because they cannot gain funding to scale business for American investors who are backed by more flexible government policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadian competitiveness is also hampered by the government's lack of cohesive policies to counter China and the supply chain issue. We have heard over and over how the Liberal-NDP coalition believes Canada needs to produce domestic critical minerals, but the action lags behind their desire in this area. We are ever more reliant on China and its network of critical mineral mines around the world to produce things like EV batteries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are seeing the highest level of food bank use. We are seeing food report after food report showing grocery prices on the rise. The increasing input costs for products, global events and rising production costs have contributed to these price increases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Something that I want to come back to is the fact that first nations in Ontario are seeking a judicial review of the Liberal-NDP carbon pricing regime. They disclosed in court documents the adverse effect that carbon taxes had on their communities. In a Globe and Mail article, they noted that the carbon price violates the principles of reconciliation and their constitutional rights. They also disclosed that they tried to negotiate with the coalition government. Why were they not able to reach an agreement? It is no secret that the carbon price rebate is tied to one's income. As the Ontario chiefs noted, “many First Nations members living on reserves do not pay income tax and cannot access the rebates”. That is another example of the coalition government developing policy that is restrictive and built in a box, instead of something that is adaptive and that would consider the challenges that first nations face on reserve.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>There is a pan-Canadian ripple effect of the carbon pricing regime the Liberal-NDP coalition is pushing. The cost is downloaded onto consumers, products and services, but now the government wants Canadians to dig a little deeper and really give up their last red cent. These destructive policies are having a profound impact on Canadians' ability to balance their budget, make ends meet and put food on their tables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Coming back to the food price report released today, it paints a bleak picture of struggling Canadians. Food costs will rise anywhere from 2.5% to 4.5% this year. The average family of four is expected to spend $16,297 on groceries in 2024. Canadians are reducing the amount they are spending on groceries. Between 2022 and 2023, Canadians reduced the amount they spent in food and beverage retail by 3.26%. The reason is they have a lot of other bills they have to pay. Canadians are being forced to supplement or totally use food banks, and the government has failed to realize that its destructive policies directly impact the struggles of Canadians, first nations and farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Speaking of farmers, right now I am farmer and have a lot experience in this regard. I am very concerned about what happened in the Senate, as we know that farmers feed communities and provide the commodities we need to advance our food security at times when they are needed. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know we are not supposed to reflect on the vote that just took place, and the House generally does not take the same question twice, but if the government does want to avoid a marathon voting session, all it has to do is take the carbon tax off of farmers, families and first nations.</ParaText>
