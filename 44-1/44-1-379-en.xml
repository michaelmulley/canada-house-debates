            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8741912"> I would like to make a brief statement concerning some events that transpired yesterday at the end of the sitting. Those present in person witnessed behaviours that went against the normal expectations in terms of decorum. The last vote, in particular, was characterized by disturbances; some members shouted and others made gestures, with the presumed objective of eliciting reactions. Some members were particularly unruly, and the Chair was obligated to intervene during the taking of the division to remind members to remain calm so that we could allow the clerks at the table to continue with the roll call.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8741913"> As stated in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, at page 643, “During the taking of a vote, no Member is permitted to enter, leave or walk across the Chamber or to make any noise or disturbance from the time the Speaker begins to put the question until the results of the vote are announced.” </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8741914">The Chair hopes this will serve as a good reminder to all members of the expectations in regard to decorum during divisions. I understand that some votes are the subject of strong disagreements, but it is still expected that all members comport themselves appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741915">Finally, I also wish to take a few moments to address another situation that occurred after the vote. After the result was announced and Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document> was adopted, I recognized the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation>, who caught my eye on a point of order. I understand that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> was also on her feet on a point of order, presumably in relation to the division that had just taken place. The government House Leader then moved that the House be adjourned. The motion was deemed adopted, with the result that our proceedings for the day ended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741916">Obviously, this prevented the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> from raising her concerns in a timely manner, and I apologize for this situation as I should have recognized her. That said, I am ready to hear her or one of her colleagues now, if she still wishes. Others might also want to intervene. I thank all members for their attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741917"> I see the hon. member for London—Fanshawe is rising on a point of order.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8741918"> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the apology. However, I will be taking this back and reflecting upon your words. I cannot say that I find your words satisfactory, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the requirements or the repercussions that need to come from them, and I will reserve the right to speak to this further.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8741920">I witnessed the situation. It was not just the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> who tried to take the floor. Another member from the same party also wanted to do so. Obviously, everyone knows that it is not over until it is over. Nothing was finished. Everyone had already risen. The <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> wanted to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741921">However, I would like to talk about the fact that we are unable to hear what is being said in the House. Once again, I will speak on behalf of the francophones, because it is always more difficult for us when there is heckling. Because we are listening to the interpretation, it takes longer for us to hear what is being said, and that is to be expected. However, we often do not even get to hear the end of sentences. We do not even get to hear the speeches because people are yelling and heckling so much. We are looking at each other and wondering what was said. We have no idea. That happened yesterday, but it also happens during question period and on many other occasions. We are missing out on some of the content of what is being said because people are heckling. That is the first thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741922">The second thing is that we have to be careful for the interpreters' sake. If the heckling bothers me, then it must be really hard for them to do their work. I would not want them to feel pressured and think that they have to try to work faster to make sure the francophone members can understand. I would like members to pay attention to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741923">I understand that people can be happy or upset about the results of a vote or during question period, but out of respect and collegiality, there needs to be some consideration for those who do not necessarily speak English or who do not listen to the debates in English. They too would like to have access to quality debates and get all the necessary information to be able to participate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8741924">I thank the two members for their interventions. I especially want to thank the member for Manicouagan for raising this point. It is very important, especially for those who use the interpretation services to understand what is happening in the House of Commons. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to listen when there is a lot of heckling in the House. That is a very important point for the Chair to consider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741925">I encourage members to behave respectfully toward one another so that everyone can fully participate in the business of the House of Commons.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8741927">Mr. Speaker, we are two months into the longest privilege debate in House of Commons history and Canadian history. It has been two months of Liberals running from accountability after the Speaker's ruling, in agreement with the opposition parties, that the government must produce the documents. Of course, it is a constitutional power that we have in the House: The House can compel the order of documents, persons or papers. This was ruled, but the Liberals have been working very hard for two months to avoid their real obligation to the House. They are working to circumvent their constitutional obligation after a ruling in the House to bring forward documents on a $400-million green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741928">Of course, we know that it was 400 million taxpayer dollars that Liberal-appointed board members used to enrich themselves. In fact, there were 186 conflicts of interest over a number of years by those Liberal-appointed board members. This was happening every other day at this board; members would vote on how this money would be spent for their own financial benefit. The Liberals are withholding all the documents from this. They have provided some that have been redacted, but they have not released all of them. They have not provided them unredacted. We are saying that they need to provide them to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741929"> This is such a significant scandal: $400 million. Far less has brought down Liberal governments before for their scandals and corruption, but $400 million is not nothing. The last time I spoke in the House, I talked about how 400 million taxpayer dollars, which individuals voted to enrich themselves with, represents about 22,000 Canadian families working an entire year and paying federal income tax. They did this just to afford $400 million going to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741930">We have ordered the documents. The Liberals refuse to give them. For two months, the House has largely been at a standstill. Again, it is the longest privilege debate in Canadian history, so that just raises the question of what they are hiding in there. It must be really bad for them to forgo anything else, and I will talk about some of the things that the NDP has allowed the government to get away with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741931">For two whole months, no government bills have been passed or really debated. This is a minority parliament; we could be in an election at any time. Time is of the essence if the Liberal government wants to accomplish anything in its dying days. However, for two months of that waning time, the government has been running from this accountability. It is very obvious. It is very clear that there is something serious in those documents, as we suspect. I think the Liberal corruption in this likely runs far, far deeper. Why else would they allow two months of none of their initiatives going forward? There is no other logical explanation for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741932"> I think what we are looking at is quite serious. Of course, we have seen a lot of this kind of behaviour over the last number of years: The Liberals prorogued Parliament to avoid scandals and called an election to avoid production of the Winnipeg lab documents. Members will remember that. In the middle of a pandemic, the Liberals called the most divisive election in recent memory, in which the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pitted vaccinated Canadian against unvaccinated Canadian. They called that election to avoid releasing the Winnipeg lab documents, which involved two scientists connected to the People's Liberation Army in China. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741933">In fact, for the first time in a century, an individual was brought to the bar to get the documents. However, the government fought hard to make sure they did not come to light. The Liberals called an election to avoid what was in them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741934">Of course the prorogation was in the midst of the WE Charity scandal, when they were looking to provide a billion dollars to what really amounted to quite a slimy organization: the WE Charity. It was also a sycophant for the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. The government was promoting them and paying them to be in various speaking engagements and podcasts. It was really something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741935">We have seen this before: proroguing to avoid accountability and calling an election to avoid production of documents. Maybe one of those two things is coming. How far will the Liberals go to avoid having the RCMP look at these documents? Again, these are just the ones that we know about, which is not to say there are not many more conflicts of interest. However, after looking over just a portion of the billion-dollar green slush fund, the Auditor General was able to find conflicts 186 times. Every other day, Liberal-appointed board members were voting for taxpayer dollars to further enrich themselves. It is actually unbelievable how many people in this country had to work all year away from their families and had to pay federal income tax for $400 million to be used to enrich Liberal insiders in conflicts of interest. It is quite shocking, and I just think that spending two whole months avoiding this, sacrificing their own agenda in the Liberals' waning days of government, means it must be really bad. There is no other explanation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8741936"> If we look at the Liberals' green initiatives over nine years, it is quite something. If we really peel back the layers, we find that they claim to have spent $100 billion on climate change, but there are no meaningful results whatsoever. It is a shocking number. In fact, a news article on the environment commissioner's 2023 fall report said, “The report painted a grim picture of emission reductions in Canada over the past 20 years, saying that the only significant drops in emissions came during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which had little to do with emissions reduction policy.” Therefore, in the midst of the pandemic, when we were all forced to stay home for weeks, not drive, not travel, not do anything, not really leave our houses or see anybody, was when emissions dropped. There was no other meaningful emissions drop in this country since the Liberals have been in office. In fact, the environment commissioner said, “Canada is the only G7 country that has not achieved any emissions reductions since 1990”. Wow, we have spend $100 billion and had no results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741937">The Office of the Auditor General reported that “Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the Paris Agreement was signed, making it the worst performing of all G7 nations since the 2015 Conference of the Parties in Paris, France.” That was in 2021. Therefore, we are seeing all this money just flying out the door. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741938">In fact, the Liberals brought forward something called the net-zero accelerator fund, but what I found interesting about this is that they proposed $8 billion, and billions are just nothing to Liberals. It does not matter how long and how hard Canadians had to work to produce all those federal income taxes; whatever, they are going to spend billions as though it were chump change in the bottom of their pockets. Therefore, there was $8 billion put towards this net-zero accelerator fund, and what is really interesting about this is that they found there was no accountability for the money to reduce emissions. They are just throwing billions of dollars to various companies with no measurables. There is nothing to show the public, such as that the government gave companies money, they committed to help lower emissions in one regard and the government is holding them accountable to that commitment for giving their companies billions of dollars from the taxpayer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741939">The same lack of accountability is seen across government departments. In fact, the Liberal government makes all of these big financial announcements, and it does not matter that we have doubled the national debt from half a trillion to well over a trillion dollars in nine years. The debt of almost 150 years of prime ministers combined was done in less than nine years by the Liberal government. The Liberals talk about all these billions, yet there do not seem to be any measurables. It is like a ribbon cutting in announcing all these billions, and then that is all they have to do. It is not really about what the actual impact of those dollars is. It is as if they think success is measured by how much money they spend, not by the outcome it produces. That is what we are seeing with a lot of this so-called green spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741940">In some cases, the government did not know whether the accelerator fund would lead to any emissions reduction. In fact, at the environment committee, the environment commissioner gave the following testimony: “We also found that the department did not always know to what extent GHG emissions had been reduced by those companies that took part in the [net-zero accelerator] initiative, or whether the funding provided would lead to reduced emissions.” Again, how could the Liberals disregard the hard work it took for Canadians to provide that money to the federal government and just throw it out the window with no follow-through, over and over again? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741941">It is not just on the greenhouse gas emissions that we are not seeing any meaningful action, despite nearly $100 billion spent, according to the Liberals; it is also in all different departments. In fact, we can look at the economics of this country, and all the billions. Again, the Liberals measure success by how much money they are spending and not on the outcome. If we look at the outcomes, what have we seen? We have one in five children in Canada living in poverty. The Salvation Army reported that one in four parents is cutting back on their own food intake because they cannot afford enough for all of their family. They are eating less so that their children can eat. This is supposed to be a G7 country, one of the wealthiest countries on earth. We are the second-largest geography on earth. We are blessed with natural resources that almost every other country would envy. We have an educated, hard-working, kind population, yet we have one in four parents cutting back on their own food intake, one in five children living in poverty and two million people visiting a food bank every month. Actual breadlines have returned after nine years of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8741942"> It is just unbelievable what we are seeing, yet the government has spent so much money, with the promise at every single announcement that it was going to make the difference. It has just made things worse. What has the government spent on housing? Was it $80 billion? Housing prices and rental prices have doubled in the nine years that the Liberals have been in power, despite $80 billion spent on housing. All that taxpayer hard work was spent on housing, only for housing to double in cost. Actually, rent has more than doubled now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741943"> What is it, two-thirds, of millennials who will never be able to afford a home? The hallmark of Canadian freedom and prosperity was the promise that somebody could work hard, get married, have a family, buy a house and retire in dignity, things that were true for generations because of the hard work of the earlier generations in this country, built on their blood, sweat and tears. It was the promise of Canada to provide prosperity. Now, two-thirds of our young people, despite the fact that they are the most educated generation in history and are hard-working, with big dreams, will never be able to afford a piece of property.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741944">Canada's geography is the second-largest on earth. We have trees that abound. We have all the materials we need and all the space required to build homes, and there has been $80 billion of so-called investment from the Liberals, yet housing prices have doubled. The dream of home ownership has evaporated for two-thirds of my generation after nine years of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741945">All this says nothing of the crime and the dysfunction in our criminal justice system. There has been a 50% increase in violent crime, a 116% increase in gun crime and a 75% increase in sexual assault, of which we know the vast majority affects women. At every opportunity, the government pats itself on the back for its feminist policy, yet in nine years there has been a 75% increase in sexual assaults in this country and a 120% increase in sexual violations against children in this country. The government has brought forward subsequent pieces of justice legislation that have had a serious influence and have resulted in a lot of the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741946"> We have heard from police associations across the country and from premiers of every political stripe, who are saying that bail reform is needed in this country. That is what we hear time and time again, yet nothing happens. The government brought forward a measly seven-page bill that received royal assent over year ago now. It obviously had zero effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741947">People are still being shot and killed by people who are out on bail and who have been out on bail, probation and parole their whole life. Somehow they were just let out on bail again with a promise that they would obey the rules for the first time in their life, and yet they have proven to be a danger to society over and over again. It is madness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741948">People deserve to feel safe in this country. They deserve to ride public transit without the threat of being stabbed by someone who is out on bail. They deserve to have their car in their own driveway and know that it is going to be there in the morning. It used to be like that in Canada. There used to be a time when we were not concerned about things like this. It just seems to be getting worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741949">Thousands of homeless encampments have popped up all across the country, which is of course a clear indicator of the poverty and the economic vandalism that are a result of bad government decisions from the Liberals for nine years. There is a lot of dysfunction, and the crime is a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741950">In the last 13 months, there has been protest after protest, certainly as a result of the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023 in Israel, when hundreds of people were taken hostage; well over a thousand people were brutally and barbarically murdered; women were viciously and violently raped, tortured and killed; children were burned alive and shot; and elderly people were abused, beaten up and killed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741951">I remember seeing some of the videos. I will never in my life get the images out of my head of the barbaric nature of the attack. I have seen what has happened in our streets subsequently and I have heard the words that have been spoken about our Jewish community. There has been mayhem and a targeting of Jewish businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741952"> It has escalated to such a point now that there were riots in Montreal the other day, where someone was caught on camera yelling that “the final solution” for the Jewish people “is coming”. This was in Canada in 2024. That is what is happening in this country. That is what has been permitted to transpire over the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741953">Jewish Canadians do not feel safe in their own country, in Canada, in 2024, they do not feel safe to identify themselves. They do not feel safe in their businesses. There have been protests at their seniors care homes. Their synagogues have been lit on fire and vandalized. Their children's schools have been shot up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8741954"> Jewish members of Parliament have to be under around-the-clock security. They are in fear of their lives just for standing up for Jewish Canadians and their principles on Israel. Threats to their lives have happened. What has there been from Parliament? There has not been any action on it. There have not been any firm stances taken by the Liberal government in the 13 months since the attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741955">The Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security of Canada is tasked with dealing with public safety and national security issues. Jewish Canadians, representing less than 1% of the population, are the most-targeted population in this country, particularly in the last 13 months, and nothing has transpired at the public safety and national security committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741956">Liberals have stopped motions or tried to water them down every single step of the way. We can watch the footage. Conservatives have repeatedly tried to bring the issue forward at the public safety committee. What has been happening to Jewish Canadians in this country as a result of what happened on October 7, 2023 is obviously an issue of national significance about public safety and national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741957">If we do not think that some of the most vile elements of the protesters have been emboldened by the fact that Hamas applauded a Liberal government decision to side with them, and that it has had an impact, we are deluding ourselves. There are serious problems in this country across the board. Jewish Canadians have been worse off by far in the last 13 months, and yet the Standing Committee of Public Safety and National Security of Canada refuses to have a concrete look at this issue specifically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741958">I have not even mentioned the multiple thwarted terrorist plots against the Jewish community. There have been two, maybe three, just in the past year, targeting one community just for being Jewish. In December 2023, there was a rally on Parliament Hill in support of releasing the hostages. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was there and the <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">deputy leader of the opposition</Affiliation>, who is Jewish, was there. A number of other members were there; in fact two Liberal members of Parliament were there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741959">Apparently unbeknownst to attendees, since no one found out about it publicly until 10 months after the fact, there were two terrorist-affiliated young people, teenagers, who had been deeply involved in plotting a bomb attack on the rally on Parliament Hill. A bomb attack was planned on the heart of our democracy, targeting Jewish Canadians for being Jewish, right here on Parliament Hill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741960">Does the public safety and national security committee of Canada really not think that is something we should be looking into? How is it acceptable that the committee tasked with the issue, out of all committees, does not think it is a priority to focus specifically on the threat of anti-Semitism, the terrorist plots and extreme violence that have been escalating toward the Jewish people? The public safety and national security committee is not doing its duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741961">Conservatives will continue to push, because we believe that what has been happening is completely and wholly unacceptable. We feel that the government has not taken it seriously and has not sent a very clear message to the vile people who are calling for “the final solution” for the Jewish people. Where is the robust response? Where is the solidarity with Jewish Canadians and their families in Israel, who obviously have the right to defend themselves in the face of the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741962">I recently spoke to CJPAC about the issues. Two women came to me afterward, and they were quite emotional. Again, it is 13 months after the attack happened. They were grown professional women, but I could tell they were having a tough time. They told me that since that day, they feel so alone. Jewish Canadians in Canada feel alone, as if the government had abandoned them, turned its back on their families in Israel, turned its back on their needs and on the fact that there are terrorist-affiliated people in this country trying to bomb them to smithereens and massacre them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8741963">I am vice-chair of the public safety committee, and the Liberals will not allow us to focus on the issue. What kind of signal does that send to people who want to do harm to Jewish Canadians? Shame on the Liberals at committee for doing that. We should be studying the issue and we should be studying it now. Conservatives are going to continue to stand up for Jewish Canadians at the committee, and we are not going to stop.</ParaText>

We need to axe the tax to give long-term relief, because if the Liberal government is going to stay in power until April and continue to raise these taxes, and it has committed to raising the carbon tax, we are going to see it go up to 61¢ a litre.

For years, our party's <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has repeatedly talked about the disparity between doing business in the United States and doing business now, the regulatory and tax burden Canadian businesses have to deal with, the carbon tax being one of the number one contributors to businesses and investment fleeing to the United States because it does not have that kind of tax on energy.

              <ParaText id="8742003">Fast-forward to where we are today. Why is the Parliament as dysfunctional as it is? It is not because of the NDP, the Liberals, the Greens and, to a certain degree, the Bloc. It is because of the Conservative Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742004">Here is the truth of the matter. Six or seven months ago, there was an order in which, yes, a majority of MPs voted that unredacted documents would be sent directly from the House to the RCMP. The government opposed that. We only have a minority of MPs. We opposed it. Yes, we did, and it is because we did not think it was appropriate to give unredacted documents to the RCMP. The RCMP commissioner has said he does not want those documents. The Auditor General of Canada has said she does not support the documents being given to the RCMP. Other legal experts have said likewise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742005">What happened? The Speaker ruled that the matter should go over to the procedure and House affairs committee. What does the Conservative Party do? Conservatives move a motion that says we are going to have this issue go to the procedure and House affairs committee. It is a Conservative motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742006">We have now had over 200 speeches from the Conservative Party of Canada on its own motion because Conservatives refuse to allow it to come to a vote. As a direct result of that, which I would suggest is borderline contempt of the House, the Parliament has not been able to do the things it needs to do to support Canadians, to pass substantial legislation, legislation in part that they support. I could focus on the word “hypocrisy” but I will refrain from that because of the limitations on my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742007">We have a Conservative Party, through its leadership, that is more interested in its self-interest than it is in Canadians. Canadians are paying the price. We have anti-harm legislation to protect children from predators on the Internet, and the Conservatives do not want to debate it. We have legislation converting sexual allegations and charges from military courts to civilian courts. Everyone supports it. Even the Conservative Party supports that one. Conservatives do not want anything to do with it because they want to continue their filibuster.</ParaText>

We have the leader of the Bloc, the leader of the Greens and the leader of New Democrats all saying foreign interference is a very serious issue in Canada. Individuals have been murdered. There has been extortion. There has been political interference. In fact, there has been political foreign interference in the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada, which ultimately saw him elected as the leader. </ParaText>

If one wants to be an intern for the Conservative Party, they are required to get a security clearance, but if one is the leader, forget that. The bogus excuses the Conservatives give as to why he is not getting the security clearance are a bunch of garbage. It begs the question why the leader of the Conservative Party will not get his security clearance. I will tell members why. It is because there is something in his past that he is hiding and does not want Canadians to know about. Canadians have a right to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742020">What is interesting about foreign interference is this. Do members remember last year at this time? If we think about what the Conservatives were yipping about 12 months ago, they were standing up and talking about foreign interference. However, they piped down awfully quick when they found out that there were Conservatives involved who are directly connected to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s office. Let us stop here on that issue. We have to change the channel awfully quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742021">Instead of dealing with issues of consequence to Canadians, whether it is the economy or good, substantial policy, the Conservatives continuously vote against them. They try to tell Canadians they care. Here are just some of the things that we have done. We brought in the disability program, the pharmacare program, the child care program, the dental care program and the national school food program. We can talk about the cuts to Canada's middle-class tax brackets. We can talk about the substantial increases to the GIS. We can talk about the 10% increase to those age 75-plus. There has been a litany of things, including the infrastructure dollars we are spending. This is a government that understands that a healthy economy is good for all Canadians. It builds our middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. Consistently, the Conservatives are voting against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742022"> In 2023, Canada had more direct foreign investment per capita than any other G7 country. In fact, if we compared Canada to the rest of the world, we were number three. People outside of Canada recognize how wonderful Canada is, whether with respect to going through the pandemic or the worldwide recession. They recognize that our interest rates are going down and that the inflation rate is under control, and are better than the United States. However, we would never know it listening to the Conservatives. Instead, they want to proclaim to the world that Canada is broken. In fact, the biggest cheerleader for the United States supporting its efforts on a trade agreement is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader </Affiliation>of the Conservative Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742023">Before I move on to that trade agreement, members will remember that the last trade agreement we had was with Ukraine. The Conservative Party is the only political party that voted against that trade agreement with Ukraine. By the way, Russia is one of the foreign influencers that is spending millions to prop up the Conservative Party of Canada, if not directly, indirectly. Is it any wonder that the Conservatives voted against the Canada-Ukraine trade deal? Was it for suspicious reasons, and I am trying to be nice, or was it a red herring? Do we think the Conservative Party is in a good position to negotiate with Donald Trump? Forget that. We have a great team. We have done it before. We have the expertise. </ParaText>

They said, “It does not matter what we have to cave on; cave and just sign an agreement.” That is all the Conservatives wanted. We held back and we got a good agreement, and that is one of the reasons that Donald Trump wants to renegotiate. We will go to the table, but we are going to put Canadians first and foremost as we have done for the last nine years. Consistently, what we have witnessed from the opposition is no, no, no.</ParaText>

Canada recently voted in favour of two UN resolutions to signal our deep concerns over the expansion of Israeli settlements into the occupied Palestinian territories and to express our unwavering support for Palestinian refugees, who are in urgent need of assistance. UNRWA is critical in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742046"> Canada remains committed to the pursuit of lasting peace in the Middle East. A two-state solution is critical to that endeavour, which includes the creation of a Palestinian state where Palestinians and Israelis live side-by-side in peace, security and dignity. The Netanyahu government has made it clear, with its words and actions, that it rejects a two-state solution, while illegal settlements and violence in the West Bank are on the rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742047"> Canada does not recognize permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, East Jerusalem or Gaza. We must see progress toward Palestinian self-determination. We need a ceasefire and sustained humanitarian aid. All hostages must be released. Peace in the Middle East is possible, and the recognition of a Palestinian state is an important step toward it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742084">Madam Speaker, last month, National Bank said, “GDP per capita has fallen by around 4.0% cumulatively since 2022, which is unprecedented outside a recession.” Now the economy is threatened with 25% tariffs, which the Canadian Chamber of Commerce says could shrink Canada's GDP by another 2.6%. The bigger decline in GDP would come from the government's policies, not from potential tariffs. That is because of the tax hikes on investment and income.</ParaText>

I know that member to be a strong advocate for small businesses in this country. I know that because she herself is a small business owner. In the past seven days, we have had the Canada carbon rebate apply to small businesses in the terms of thousands of dollars, which is tremendous. Last night, we had a vote in this chamber about axing a tax that reduces the GST on the small businesses that member defends constantly in this chamber. I just do not understand the duplicity when she cannot find her conscience and vote in favour of a tax that will help businesses in B.C. and right around the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742256"> Madam Speaker, I am rising on a matter of privilege as it relates to last night's proceedings. The appropriate letter was submitted to your office earlier this morning pursuant to Standing Order 48(2). I am rising at the earliest opportunity, having had a chance to review the statement the Speaker made earlier today, as well as to do the necessary procedural research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742257">We appreciate the ruling and the guidance provided earlier today, but I believe this matter rises to the threshold to be considered a breach of privilege and a contempt of the House. As was noted this morning, <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> states in Chapter 13, page 643, “During the taking of a vote, no Member is permitted to...make any noise or disturbance from the time the Speaker begins to put the question until the results of the vote are announced.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742258"> The Standing Orders are also clear. Standing Order 16(1) states, under “Decorum”, “When the Speaker is putting a question, no member shall enter, walk out of or across the House, or make any noise or disturbance.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742259">This is more than a point of order. What happened last night clearly amounted to contempt. Even leading up to yesterday evening, there has been an escalation in the opposition lobby and in this chamber in terms of the levels of toxicity and unacceptable behaviour. On multiple occasions, this behaviour has been raised and has gone unaddressed. Even yesterday, earlier in the day, there were times during the votes when members had to scream in the lobby in order to be heard by their colleagues and staff as a result of generally disruptive behaviour from the Conservatives. As the final vote approached, we knew this behaviour would be intentionally escalated in order to disrupt the vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742260">We identified this expectation directly to the Speaker and to the table. Nothing was done. When the vote did take place, even with an earpiece, I was unable to hear my name and the names of my colleagues as they were called for the vote. Being able to hear the proceedings is critical to my job as deputy House leader and to the functioning of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742261"> Why were all of these actions taken? It was because there was a deliberate and concerted attempt to intimidate members on the basis of their vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742262"> As you know, Madam Speaker, the reference books clearly state that intimidation of members could rise to a contempt of the House. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> states in Chapter 3, page 107: </ParaText>

My caucus mates were yelling for me to be heard, and members of the table were visibly bringing to your attention the fact that I was on my feet. As an officer of an official party, it is completely unacceptable that I was not accorded this fundamental right to intervene, and it did not end there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742268"> After we adjourned, I approached the Chair to ask how this could have been allowed. As I tried to address this with the Speaker, Conservative members of Parliament continued to call me names, harass me and attempt to bully me. </ParaText>

Gentle pleas and reminders are not enough. Members need to be protected in this place. What happened last night amounts to contempt of the House.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8742276">Mr. Speaker, on this point of privilege, I have several points to make for your consideration in response to some of the items just raised by my colleague from the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742277">First of all, she stated that she was not afforded the right to intervene. I was here. What I saw happen was that the Speaker saw the<Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4"> government House leader</Affiliation>, who adjourned debate. The Speaker chose to adjourn debate and debate was adjourned. Let us start with that. From what I saw, the Speaker followed procedure in that point. Now, if my colleague had wanted to tell the Speaker there was an issue, she had plenty of time to send a page over or talk to somebody and say, “Hey, we would like to have a point of order.” From what I saw, that did not happen. I do believe procedure was followed last evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742278">Second of all, as you are considering this point of privilege, Mr. Speaker, there is a bit of the story that was not told. My colleague was talking about harassment. What I watched unfold after the House was adjourned was that my colleague who has just raised the point of privilege walked very aggressively and assertively toward the Speaker's chair and took a very aggressive posture at the chair. Another one of her colleagues followed. Then she and two of her colleagues approached, in a very aggressive posture, two of my colleagues who were seated. There is video evidence of this, which was legally obtained because the House was adjourned. We are prepared to share that, post that or table it with the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742279">What I saw, since my colleague raised harassment, was three NDP members standing with a very aggressive posture, almost with hands in the faces of my colleagues, who then had to de-escalate the situation. Mr. Speaker, if you are going to consider harassment in this case, then you also must consider what happened after the House adjourned with the member who just raised this. It was completely inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742280">I also want to say that this colleague was feted in The Hill Times for raising a pledge on decorum and asking parliamentarians to take the heat down. In that situation, she had the ability to show leadership, but instead, what we saw was an aggressive march up to the Speaker's chair. We could see the body language of the Speaker kind of holding back and then NDP members stood over two of my colleagues in a highly aggressive, highly conflated way. Please take that into consideration, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742281">Third, I fundamentally disagree with the characterization of what happened in the House last night. The reality is that there were, I believe, close to 100 members of my caucus, the Conservative Party, who changed their travel plans to stay here to express the displeasure of their constituents, many of them small business owners, who understand that what we were voting on last night is going to have a detrimental impact on their small businesses. Many of our constituents vehemently oppose what the government did last night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742282"> If my colleague wanted to bring the light and not the heat in this point of privilege, she would not have ascribed a motive to us at the end. I want you to note, Mr. Speaker, that she closed her point of privilege with a very partisan remark: that Conservatives were only here to harass and intimidate because we “had a bad week”, because we were voting against an atrociously bad policy that, as the government has heard, has been derided by virtually every group of every political stripe as an act of desperation. The fact that she, in her point of privilege, closed with a partisan argument in and of itself belies that this is a point of privilege at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742283">What I saw last night, which you need to consider, Mr. Speaker, is that there were 100 members of the Conservative caucus here who were standing in force, in terms of standing up for our constituents. Our expressing the frustration that people across the country are feeling right now should not be allowed to be whitewashed by a member saying her feelings were hurt. That is a breach of my privilege and my ability to stand here in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742284"> I have a lot of respect for all colleagues in this place. I try to—</ParaText>

                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>

                <B>Hon. Michelle Rempel Garner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am being heckled by them right now as I am making this point. They just said, “That's right you are.” Again, what the NDP members are doing is proving their hypocrisy on this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742287">The last point I want to make is this. If you are going to consider this a breach of privilege, Mr. Speaker, then I need you to go through every instance that the NDP members have mercilessly heckled other members of the House. I understand, Mr. Speaker, it might be difficult for you to sometimes hear this. They are at the far end of the House. However, I sit over here and I hear it every day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742288">I usually let it go because I understand this Parliament is now at a point where it is extremely dysfunctional because we have the Liberal government refusing for weeks to reflect the will of Parliament and hand documents over. I understand everybody's frustration in this place, but that does not mean we do not have the right to respect our constituents' wishes and explain it as such. That is not a breach of privilege; that is exercising our privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742289">The NDP only had three or four members in the chamber last night on such a critical motion and they chose to support the government yet again, instead of fighting against disastrous policy after corruption scandal. Canadians want an election. If the New Democrats are feeling the heat because of their choices to keep propping up the corrupt government, then that is something they have to live with. That is not a breach of privilege; that is a choice for which they are facing consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742290">I will not stand here and have my motive and my ability to speak be questioned by the NDP because of its questionable choices. No precedent has ever been made by the Chair that suggests this is something I have to experience. I would just ask all members in this place, out of respect for everyone, to bring the light and not the heat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742291">So many matters in front of this place right now have material impact on the lives of Canadians. To suggest it is a breach of privilege to have to listen to others in this place express displeasure on behalf of their constituents about what the government did is wrong. That is not in the spirit of the place. If there is a ruling that suggests otherwise, I suggest that is a breach of my privilege and the 120,000 Calgarians I represent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742292">Mr. Speaker, with respect to the same question of privilege, since the matter has been brought forth, I would like to express what I saw and experienced last night.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742293">As my hon. colleague said, we had just ended. I witnessed that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s eye went to the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>, and then we adjourned. That is what I saw. I also did see and hear the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> come literally storming up to the Speaker's chair in a very physically and verbally aggressive way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742294">After that, when members were telling the member to calm down because her actions were obviously very inappropriate and unprofessional, she lashed out and attacked many members, in fact saying that they were intoxicated; this was to members who do not drink at all, for many reasons. It was very inappropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742295">The member then proceeded to come over to my desk. I felt physically intimidated. I hardly said anything because I was so in shock from what was going on. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278718" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation> came into my space, yelling at a colleague of mine, telling them to stand back, even though the colleague had not moved and even though the other members were actually in the space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742296">I feel that my privileges were infringed on. I have never in my professional career experienced anything like that with respect to the level of aggression and unprofessional behaviour that was occurring. I was quite shaken last night, actually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742297">Further to that, with respect to votes, I have been in this place listening, in particular to the NDP members, during many votes, being very aggressive, heckling and yelling “shame” very loudly and aggressively. We take it in this place. Now they are bringing a matter forth from what was a confidence vote last night. I have heard many of the members, for hours on end sometimes, saying comments that are completely meant to provoke and to make members feel like they are not representing their constituents. We hear it all the time from the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742298">I am not sure whether it is because the New Democrats are just frustrated by the fact that they were in an agreement that was then ripped up. They do not have the same level of control anymore, yet now they are still continuing to support the government in confidence votes. They are in a situation that maybe they are frustrated with. Maybe they cannot conceptualize how they are dealing with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742299">I just want to make clear that what occurred last night after we rose, from the NDP, was very intimidating. I was packing up. I got up and I stepped back because I actually felt so physically threatened. Having people rushing at a colleague, right in my space, coming right over to my desk and touching the desk that I sit at, was something I had never experienced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742300"> Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I hope that you take that into consideration as you are working on the issue, and I also hope that you will really think about it. I feel that my privilege last night was taken. I should be able to work in a safe place. I should be able to come and represent my constituents, vote the way that I believe my constituents want me to vote, without having the level of intimidation that occurred last night.</ParaText>

That is why I highlighted the fact that what we are witnessing is borderline contempt of Parliament. I do not say that lightly. I have been a parliamentarian for close to 35 years; I am not sure as I do not know the actual number.

He posed the other question in regard to why it is that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the official opposition has not agreed to get the security clearance.

              <ParaText id="8742374">Madam Speaker, once again, I rise in the House to speak to the privilege motion. In case anyone at home is confused about this, it is all about why we are debating this motion. Back in June, members of Parliament passed a motion demanding that all documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada be transferred to the RCMP for investigation within 30 days. The government did not do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742375">On our first day back in the fall, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege. The Speaker of the House agreed that the government ignored an order of the House, and it has since ignored the Speaker's ruling. The government will argue that it did not ignore the ruling and did, in fact, table the requested documents. However, what it tabled was 29,000 pages of black ink. The documents were almost completely redacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742376">What have they redacted? What are they hiding? My colleagues and I have asked every day in the House for the Liberals to adhere to the orders of the House and turn over all the reports unredacted for the RCMP to investigate. To date, they still refuse. Why? Of course, the government is going to say that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the Privy Council Office, has the right to redact documents. However, the act actually says that if a body such as Parliament were to order the production of documents, the Privy Act cannot be used as an excuse to redact information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742377">Let us go back a bit. Why did the House demand that the SDTC documents be handed over to the RCMP in the first place? The Auditor General did an audit for five years of SDTC. She sampled only about half of the transactions, 226 transactions, the board approved, and the Auditor General found that 186 of the 226 transactions were conflicted. In other words, 82% of those transactions. This means that only 18% were in good faith. If our kids came home from school with a score of 18%, they would need to do some explaining.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742378">What do these conflicts of interest really mean? They mean the Liberal board members in charge of distributing funds that were meant to help Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies were funnelling money into their own pockets. Why do I say Liberal board members? It is because the chair of the board was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, ignoring any kind of fair hiring process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742379">Let us start with her. She approved $390 million in funding for projects that had extremely disturbing conflicts. According to the Auditor General, the Liberals' green slush fund handed out $58 million to projects without a promise that the contribution agreement terms were met. Another $58 million went to 10 projects deemed ineligible, as they could not prove an environmental benefit or were not developing green technologies. Finally, there was $334 million in over 186 cases where SDTC board members held a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742380">Here is an interesting piece of information that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> shared previously. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s far-left radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is profiting from Sustainable Development Technology Canada. One may ask how this is possible. Prior to his election, he was a paid lobbyist for a green technology investment firm called Cycle Capital. Cycle Capital is a venture capital firm that has received investments of over $200 million from the Liberal green slush fund since it was created. Remember that these funds were approved by the Prime Minister's hand-picked board members, including the environment minister's long-time personal friend Andrée-Lise Méthot. Interestingly, Andrée-Lise Méthot was not only hand-picked by the Prime Minister to sit on the board of SDTC but is also the founder and owner of Cycle Capital. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742381">However, it gets even better. During her time on the board, companies in which Cycle Capital was invested received more than $100 million of taxpayer money. These taxpayer dollars inflated the value of Cycle Capital. Since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his corrupt band of merry men took office, Cycle Capital has grown from $200 million to over $600 million. Let us connect the dots. Who benefits from a company whose value is inflated by taxpayer dollars? It is shareholders, of course. Guess who continues to hold shares in Cycle Capital. It is the far-left, radical, orange suit-wearing <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. This is the very definition of a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742382">As we all know, the tone of any organization starts at the top, and at the top of the Liberal-NDP government, the tone is corruption. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278254" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation> stated the other day during her intervention, “The government has a pattern of giving its friends hundreds of millions of dollars, taxpayer dollars, while shirking responsibility for all it has done to destroy Canadians' livelihoods.” She took us all on a walk down scandal lane and revealed 68 of the Liberal scandals. In my previous intervention, I listed some of them and this morning I will mention a few more. I cannot possibly list all of them, as I only have 20 minutes, but here are a few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742383">There was the pressure put on the first indigenous justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to get Liberal donor SNC-Lavalin off the hook. He fired her when she refused to the help with the cover-up. There was the “people experience things differently” response by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to groping allegations. There was the WE Charity scandal, for which the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament to escape scrutiny. There was the Prime Minister's assault on an NDP member of Parliament on the floor of the House of Commons. The was export of personal protective equipment to China during a pandemic and giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in ventilator contracts to Liberal Party insider Frank Baylis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742384"> There were the fake charges against Mark Norman, the illegal invocation of the Emergencies Act and the fabrication of reasons to justify its illegal use. The was also the trampling of Canadians with horses and the seizing of Canadians' bank accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742385">There was the Winnipeg lab scandal and the Public Health Agency tracking scandal. There was the rampant abuse of staff in the office of the former governor general, who was appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. There was the Governor General's $100,000 private jet parties and the Liberals' connection to an illegal casino magnate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742386">There were the vaccine delays, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s racist costumes on an official trip to India, his racist blackface costumes and the mass airport delays and cancellations. The was the decriminalization of hard drugs. There were the over 72 secret orders in council. There was the Liberals' diplomats attending a party at the Russian embassy during the Ukrainian war and the minister who gave a $17,000 contract to a Liberal-aligned media firm. There were also efforts to obtain unwarranted border searches of electronics and restrictions on online free speech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742387">There was the $11 million in renovations to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s cottage, the $8 million barn built at Harrington Lake and a Jamaican vacation that cost taxpayers at least $162,000. There was the increase of the carbon tax during an energy crisis and the misinformation to Canadians about electoral reform. There was the skipping of the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation so that the Prime Minister could go surfing in Tofino. There was the elimination of mandatory minimums for gun offences while going after law-abiding firearms owners and the Prime Minister's party in Scotland while Canadians were under lockdown. There were the failed reforms of the ATIP system and the contracts awarded to government employees without proper bids, such as those for GC Strategies for the ArriveCAN app, or, should I say, the arrive scam app. There were also the Liberal cover-ups of foreign interference and the compromised Liberal MPs who continue to sit in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742388">There was the Bernardo and Magnotta prisoner transfer, which is a huge one since there has been a 75% increase in violence against women in this country due to the Liberals' misguided laws. There was the former Nazi scandal invitation and his recognition in the House of Commons, and the delay in recognizing the IRGC as a terrorist organization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742389">We have skyrocketing debt, skyrocketing inflation, skyrocketing addictions and skyrocketing overdose deaths. After nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, everything is broken. He has skyrocketed the debt to the point where we are spending more on the interest of the debt than we do on health care. He has also skyrocketed the cost of groceries, sending more than two million people per month to food banks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742390"> He has skyrocketed crime with his catch-and-release bail and the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences for major crimes. Auto theft is up 200%, violence against women is up 75%, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s legalization of hard drugs has seen the pop-up of drug dens near children's schools and playgrounds and has caused a massive number of overdose deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742391"> Now we have the Liberals' attempt to bribe us with our own money in the form of a $250 cheque to those who earn $150,000 net income. I repeat, that is net income, meaning after-tax dollars, but there is nothing for those who truly need supports. Here is what the Liberals forgot to tell us: They will borrow more cash and print more money, which by their own admission will lead to higher inflation and devalue our dollar. More borrowing means interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer. We are already seeing evidence of this in the bond market. Borrowing more means our kids and grandkids will foot the bill. This is simply short-term gain for long-term pain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742392"> If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is so confident in his economic policies, why does he not let the people decide and call an election? He can run on his failed economic ideology, while common-sense Conservatives would run on our common-sense plan to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742393"> Axing the tax would permanently lower the price of gas, groceries and home heating. We would build the homes by axing the sales tax on new homes, sparking 30,000 extra homes built each year and effectively lowering prices. This week the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> asked why we should listen to “the self-serving <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>". I really hope the member would take some time to reflect on his own party and the actions of his <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation>. He may come to realize it is the Liberal leader, the Prime Minister, who is self-serving, as evidenced by the list of growing scandals designed to line his pockets and those of his friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742394"> It is the Conservative Party that cares about Canadians, all Canadians, not just powerful insiders. Perhaps he and all members on the other side of the House will eventually realize the words coming out of their mouths do not match the actions of their party. They have spent millions and millions of taxpayer dollars on their friends, while Canadians struggle to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742395">I imagine the good that $400 million could have done, the deserving lives it could have changed, and I ask this: Is it not the very definition of self-serving to ignore the ruling of the House to provide documents that could self-incriminate? Once again, the members on that side of the House like to project their character flaws onto us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742396"> As the Liberals' popularity plummets in the polls, they continue to gaslight Canadians. What they do not seem to realize is that Canadians have had enough. Canadians need a common-sense plan that puts Canadians first. Common-sense Conservatives would put Canada first. We would build our military and secure our borders. Canadians want a prime minister with the brains and backbone to stand up for this country, a leader who knows how to play chess, not checkers. In the words of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, “Canada first...and Canada always.” It is time to stop the corruption, axe the tax to help all Canadians and call a carbon tax election today.</ParaText>

The government is going to go further into debt to send cheques to these people, and yet it is excluding people with no employment income, who are often the most vulnerable.

              <ParaText id="8742405">Madam Speaker, that is an excellent point. I want to say a few things. First of all, we have a food bank in my riding called the Sai Dham Food Bank that I happen to assist in many different ways. It serves 4,000 seniors every single month by delivering food baskets. In one month alone, it delivered 5.42 million meals. That is unheard of in this country. We need to ensure we help the most vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742406">Let me ask another question. Do the members of Parliament need that $250? No. The government is bribing us with our own tax dollars. It is going to shoot up inflation and we are all going to have to pay for it, including the most vulnerable. We need to get back to the basics. For instance, we need to stick to a budget. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that “the budget will balance itself”. He needs a lesson. The budget does not balance itself; it is our responsibility to ensure that we budget.</ParaText>

I think the Conservatives have forgotten that, although it is not perfect, the measure that was passed yesterday will still eliminate the tax on babies' diapers, car seats, children's clothing and shoes, and food that is processed and prepared in grocery stores, like sandwiches or chickens that have been roasted in store. This will really help the average person. It seems that the only tax cuts the Conservatives want are those for CEOs and big companies that make millions of dollars in profit.</ParaText>

Tonnes of rock have been blasted out of the Canadian Shield. Some 40,000 truckloads of rock have been removed to create a pit 75 feet deep for a new underground structure. The leaded windows in the building have been taken out and are being restored. The copper roof has been replaced. The stonework is being repointed. The woodwork is being restored, and the mechanicals in the building are being completely overhauled.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742468"> I want to emphasize what the order said: “the House hereby orders that these documents be produced in their original and uncensored form forthwith.” In other words, the documents about the Afghan detainees were to be released to the House and to the public immediately, without redactions, for the entire world to see, including the armed combatants fighting Canadian Forces in Afghanistan. The order required the government to immediately and publicly, without any redactions and without any consideration to the injury that could result in the ongoing Canadian Armed Forces military operations in Afghanistan, release the documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742469">Understandably, the Harper government was reluctant to release the information publicly. Speaker Milliken ruled that the House had an unfettered right to these documents, but he also sympathized with the government's concerns about publicly releasing information that could be injurious to ongoing Canadian military operations. Therefore, he encouraged the parties to work together to resolve it. The government did exactly that, and six months later, an ad hoc committee was struck. The government handed over all the documents to that committee in the summer of 2010, without redactions, and the committee began its work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742470">There are two things to note about the Afghan detainee document order that made it different and distinct from the Winnipeg lab document order. First, there were no measures in the Afghan detainee order to prevent the release of information injurious to national security or to the conduct of Canadian military operations. The order mandated that all the documents be released forthwith, publicly, without redactions. Second, the government understood its obligations to Parliament and worked with the opposition parties to produce the documents to the ad hoc committee in six months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742471">In comparison, the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund documents contain no information injurious to national security. The government's explanation for defying an order of the House for those documents is that it could be a violation of charter rights. This argument is weak and thin. One suspects that this is because it was the only argument the government could come up with in response to the order. One suspects that, if the reference to the RCMP was not in the order for the documents, the government would find another flimsy excuse not to hand them over. One suspects that the real reason the government will not hand over the documents is not that it would be injurious to the rule of law or to charter rights but that it would be injurious to the government's political fortunes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742472">There are several ways to end this debate, but there are only two ways to end it in the right way. One is for the government to hand over the documents, and the other is for Parliament to be dissolved and for the matter to be taken to the Canadian people for their decision at the ballot box.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742480">I do not know whether my colleague is aware of this, but that act was actually born of an alliance between Cartier's Conservatives and the Liberals and Conservatives of Upper Canada. Les Rouges of Lower Canada, or Quebec, were strongly opposed to it. Nova Scotia was also strongly opposed. It even voted unanimously against this infamous British North America Act, but that was never taken into consideration by London.

              <ParaText id="8742493"> The key word in that phrase is the word “appears”. It is not absolute. That is number one.

I think it may have been for his refusal to appear before the committee. Maybe the member can clarify.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742496">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to address a matter of critical importance to the health and future of our democracy: the dangers posed by corruption. A democratic government is founded on the principles of accountability, transparency and trust. When these principles are eroded by corruption, the very fabric of democracy is eroded as well, and public confidence in institutions is undermined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742497">History offers numerous examples of how corruption has tested long-standing democracies and the strength of democratic institutions. History has a lot to teach us about this very real problem. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742498">One of the most iconic symbols of corruption in modern-day governance has to be the administration of former U.S. president Richard Nixon and his infamous Watergate scandal. The Watergate scandal consisted of Richard Nixon's staff hiring burglars to break into the Democratic Party's headquarters to plant listening devices in their phones. When the burglars got caught, Nixon's re-election campaign paid them to stay quiet. Eventually, a Senate committee was established to investigate the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742499">When the Senate committee requested that Nixon hand over audio tapes of his White House meetings, Nixon initially refused. He then ordered his attorney general to fire the special prosecutor who was requesting the tapes. Only after a Supreme Court ruling did Nixon eventually relent and hand over all of the tapes unedited and unredacted. Shortly after, former president Nixon resigned in disgrace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742500">While it is good that, in this instance, the corruption was stopped and the bad actor resigned, the effects were long-lasting in democracies all around the globe, including Canada. Ever since, people have become very cynical and distrustful of politicians and assume those in power prioritize personal or partisan gain over the public interest. People assume politicians routinely engage in bribery, embezzlement and influence peddling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742501">These actions, whether they are real or merely perceived, erode public trust, distort policy-making and diminish the legitimacy of government. In democratic systems, citizens must entrust their elected representatives with the authority to make decisions on their behalf. When this trust is violated, the repercussions are severe: voter apathy increases, polarization deepens and public cynicism grows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742502">Canada, like any democracy, has experienced its share of corruption scandals. While no political party and no government is immune to such scandals, the current Liberal government has taken these scandals to another level. The SNC-Lavalin affair brought renewed scrutiny to the Liberal Party under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742503">This controversy involved allegations that senior officials in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office attempted to interfere with the judicial process to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, a major engineering firm facing criminal charges. When former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould refused to go along with the deferred prosecution agreement, the Prime Minister removed her from the position of attorney general in a move reminiscent of when Richard Nixon ordered his attorney general to fire the special prosecutor who was requesting the White House tapes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742504">Fortunately, Jody Wilson-Raybould blew the whistle and went public with allegations that she had faced undue pressure to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. While the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> denied any wrongdoing, the Ethics Commissioner ultimately found his actions violated ethics rules. The affair raised serious questions about the independence of Canada's judiciary, the accountability of elected officials and the influence of corporate interests on public policy. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister chose to violate the fundamental democratic principles of accountability, transparency and trust, instead of simply coming clean with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742505"> Another recent example is the WE Charity scandal, in which the Liberal government awarded a sole-source contract worth $900 million to the WE Charity to administer a completely unnecessary grant program for students who did volunteer work. It later emerged that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the then finance minister, Bill Morneau, had personal ties to the charity, raising concerns about conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742506">Both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Bill Morneau faced investigations by the Ethics Commissioner, further damaging public trust. The scandal highlighted the dangers of conflicts of interest in government decision-making, the importance of rigorous ethical standards and the need for transparency in awarding public contracts. Without these safeguards in place, the trust Canadians place in their democratic institutions is further damaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742507">The ArriveCAN app is another one of the Liberal government's recent scandals, complete with money disappearing in amounts that far exceed what Richard Nixon paid to the Watergate burglars. The incident showed how covering up criminal activity and a lack of transparency in government operations can erode public trust. While the ArriveCAN app was initially developed as a tool to facilitate efficient border crossings, its rollout and associated costs raised serious concerns about government accountability and oversight, and about the effective use of taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742508">According to the Auditor General, the ArriveCAN app cost over $54 million, while other vendors estimated they could have done the work for about $200,000. When a relatively straightforward $200,000 app balloons in cost to over $54 million, it cannot be due to simple incompetence or mismanagement. The only explanation is criminal activity. The government should have called in the auditors immediately and should have called the police, but only after months of audits, committee meetings and investigations was the truth finally brought to light.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742509">The principles of accountability, transparency and trust have also been eroded by the most recent scandal, what I will call the “other Randy” scandal. The member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> owned and operated a medical supply company that bid on government contracts while he was a cabinet minister. The member's business partner in the two-person business informed a client he was providing updates to someone known as Randy. Then he said that he meant another Randy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742510">To date, despite having been asked repeatedly in question period, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> has never identified who the other Randy may be. Everyone knows that the member was violating ethics rules and was in a conflict of interest, but even this was not enough to warrant his dismissal from cabinet. It was only after it was discovered that the member's company was self-identifying as wholly indigenous-owned while bidding on government contracts that the member for Edmonton Centre was removed from cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742511">Just like Richard Nixon, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> was desperate to cling to power regardless of the harm he was causing to the public trust and to the reputation of our democratic institutions. Once again, the principles of accountability, transparency and trust were all broken under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742512"> The actions of the Liberal government over the last nine years have led to an erosion of public trust in our democratic institutions. More and more citizens perceive that their government prioritizes partisan or personal gain over the public good. The government's actions have led to a weakening of democratic institutions. Corruption undermines the independence and integrity of democratic institutions, such as the judiciary and the public service. The SNC-Lavalin affair in particular raised concerns about political interference in the judicial process, the absence of which is a cornerstone of democratic governance.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8742513"> The government's actions have led to an increase in voter apathy. Scandals contribute to voter disengagement by fostering a sense of futility and disillusionment. People see a few crooked politicians on the news and assume that they are just the tip of the iceberg and that all politicians must be corrupt. This is particularly dangerous in a democracy, in which active participation is essential to hold leaders accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742514">Robust mechanisms need to be in place to ensure transparency and accountability in government. Independent bodies, such as the offices of the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner, play a critical role in identifying and addressing corruption. However, when these institutions discover problems and ring alarm bells, the government cannot simply sweep the matter under the carpet or let reports sit on a shelf to collect dust. The rules must be followed, and wrongdoers must be held to account. This brings us to the Liberals' most recent scandal and the subject of this afternoon's debate: the documents pertaining to the Sustainable Development Technology Canada Fund that the Liberals refuse to hand over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742515">Earlier this year, the Auditor General released a scathing report on Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, and its mismanagement of public funds. Here are some of her findings: There was $334 million handed out to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest, with over 186 cases. A staggering $58 million was handed out to ineligible projects. What were these projects? Some of them did not develop a single new technology; others made outlandish claims about their environmental benefits that could not stand up to the slightest scrutiny. However, they were funded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742516">Let us not forget that the Auditor General looked at only a sample of SDTC transactions. She looked at roughly half of the transactions and found that 82% of them were conflicted. We can easily surmise that the remaining cases were just as conflicted and that the sums of money involved were hundreds of millions of dollars more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742517">In December 2023, a whistle-blower testified before the House of Commons Committee. In one particularly stark statement, the whistle-blower said, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742518">Enough is enough. In the same way as Richard Nixon finally relented and handed over the tapes related to the Watergate scandal, it is time for the Liberals to relent. It is time for the unredacted documents related to the SDTC scandal to be handed over to the RCMP so that it can do its job and get to the bottom of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742519">Democracy is fragile and vulnerable, and it is a system of government that requires constant vigilance to preserve. Corruption, whether it occurs in Canada or elsewhere, poses a grave threat to the principles of accountability, transparency and trust that underpin our democratic institutions. As members of Parliament and as citizens of a democratic country, we must demand accountability from our leaders, which is exactly what we are doing here today. Let us learn from history and ensure that Canada's democracy remains resilient and true to its founding principles. It is time for the Liberals to hand over the documents. </ParaText>

They are trying to get their pensions. Once again, last night, the NDP leader put his pension above Canadians and our country. It is another failure, but it is not surprising. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742561">I will continue on to what we could be debating on Monday, if the government, the Liberals, just handed over the documents. We could go to Bill <Document DbId="13188699" Type="3">C-73</Document>, the nature accountability act, which our environment committee is attempting to do a prestudy on to circumvent the fact they will not hand over the documents, to try to help pass legislation in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742562">Obviously I, as a proud member of the environment committee, have looked at the legislation and I will summarize it like this. It is a plan to make a plan, which is consistent with the current government. It is all about trying to build bureaucracy, help out friends of the Liberals and not actually accomplish anything. It is lazy environmentalism that is best summarized as all of the Liberal government's environmental policy. I asked the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who was before us on this bill this week, the radical environment minister, about additional spending and/or potential new hiring of bureaucracy that would be needed to enact this legislation should we pass it. He refused to say. He just would not admit there might be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742563">I asked if he could look for internal savings, given that there has been a 53% increase in the number of senior executives within that department, or maybe we could look internally and try to find some efficiencies, we will call it, within that department. Do we just need to go back to the piggy bank of Canadians and borrow more, increase our debt and increase inflation, just to pay for their reckless, bureaucratically bloated ideas?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742564">I have been here a little over a year now, and I think I have come to understand the Liberals' guiding principles in this place. I would say principle number one is this: When something does not work, just throw money at it. That must be the solution. It looks like we are doing something if we just throw more money at it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742565">Principle number two is this: When people do not work, hire more of them. Clearly that has been the track record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742566">Principle number three is this: When something actually is working well, bring in some Liberal insiders and break it. That is how we have ended up doubling the number of bureaucrats over the last nine years. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer is questioning whether Canadians are seeing an increase in service delivery after all of that new spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742567">I have talked to constituents. Anybody who deals with this behemoth of a federal government rightfully has complaints about service standards. Passports are not being returned to people faster. Our PAL, our firearm licensing application, for which many people are currently undertaking the courses to become trained and tested responsible firearms owners, is slowing down. It is not getting any faster. Nobody has said to me, “Oh, I called the CRA the other day and it answered like that. It was a great conversation. I really enjoyed that.” It is the exact opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742568">Nothing is working better under the federal government right now, despite more debt-fuelled spending to once again expand that bloated bureaucracy without outcomes. That is what we should measure, not how much money we throw at the problem. Are we improving the outcomes and delivery of what the federal government should be focused on for Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742569">Of course, we have the recent NDP-Liberal tax trick. It is another example of the failed philosophy. The reality is that we in this country, industry in this country, unfortunately, has faced regulatory strangulation, for lack of a better term. Perhaps it is the right term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742570">We will use one example of many terrible pieces of legislation that have continuously focused on driving out investment, driving away opportunities and just trying to add problematic elements for those entrepreneurs and investors, whether they be individuals or Canadian public pension plans, who want to invest in Canada, who want to build in Canada. Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the no-more-pipelines bill, or, maybe more appropriately named, the never-build-anything-ever-again-in-this-country bill, is a prime example of how we have made it so unattractive to invest in and do business in this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8742571"> This is evident by the fact of the massive outflow of foreign direct investment that has previously been in Canada but is now going to the United States. I would be surprised if any member of the House has not talked to a business owner in their community who has said that if the Conservatives do not win, they are leaving. It is a real problem, and the data shows it is happening already, because of the strangulation through regulation and legislation under the Liberal government. The Liberals treat the economy as if it were some sort of machine where we just pull some levers and press some buttons and everything will work out just fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742572">The Liberals are not even trying to hide their plans. They regularly say that we need to build the future economy and to transition our economy. What they mean when they say that is that they want a government-controlled, centrally planned and manipulated economy, entrepreneurs be damned. The Liberals claim to know what Canadians need and want, and they are going to try their best to make sure the economy matches their ideology. That is not the way the economy works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742573"> Instead of trying to drive economic growth through private sector investment, the Liberals choose to spend, which is why there has been a doubling of our national debt and drastic increases in the price of life. Whether it be through direct taxation on individuals or on companies, or, of course, through the hated carbon tax, it is not surprising that when a party focuses on changing the economy to something it believes it should be, taxing everybody to death, there is a doubling of the price of all homes in this country, a doubling of rent and record-breaking numbers of people lining up at food banks in what should be a prosperous, leading nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742574">The Liberals have doubled down as of late. They are trying to bribe Canadians with their own money with the government's $250-check proposal and a temporary tax cut, a pause. It has been called a “cut” a lot in the chamber over the last number of days, but to me a tax “cut” means actually cutting it, not hitting the pause button to give a break for two months on a couple of items deemed essential. The Liberals decided what is going to be listed for the temporary pause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742575">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742576">
                <B>Mr. Branden Leslie:</B> That is right; it is a tax trick. Madam Speaker, even my opposition colleagues know that it is simply a temporary tax trick.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742577">I suppose maybe the Liberals think that their hand is in people's pockets already, so they might as well just grab a little extra cash. What they have failed to realize, and it has been brought up by members of the opposition, is the havoc that it is going to wreak on small business owners. Again, I have received calls, and I assume all members from wherever they may be have as well, asking, “Do you know how a point-of-sale system works? Do you know how hard it is to get an overnight December 13 group of staff to come in and make all these changes? What if we collectively screw something up a little bit? Is CRA going to come and audit me right away?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742578">Small-business owners like the idea of actual tax reductions, permanent ones; those would help drive prosperity, but the tax trick is simply not appealing and is driving a whole bunch of extra work. We have all heard the same thing: People are going to return things now and then rebuy them at the busiest time of the year. These are legitimate grievances from our small-business community, which is the backbone of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742579"> I do not want say that business owners were ignored, because of course under the Liberal government they were probably just never listened to. Consulting is not something the Liberal government takes a lot of pride in. It announces something and everybody is upset at it, and then it decides to forge ahead. It does not matter if it is a terrible idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742580"> I think some of these examples illustrate what we have seen with the matter at hand, the Liberal green slush fund scandal. In my previous interventions in this place, I have detailed the history of the scandal, but I will provide a little bit of context for Canadians who are perhaps listening in for the first time and wondering why we are still debating the privilege motion and why the government will not just hand over the documents. Those are reasonable questions for Canadians to ask—</ParaText>

It is not a bad idea to invest in technology, not taxes. Where have I heard that before? I think it has been coming from this side of the House because it is a good idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742583">However, the Liberals applied one of the principles that I outlined earlier: When something works well, bring in some Liberal insiders and break it. That is exactly what the Liberals did. They hired Annette Verschuren in 2019 to chair the board of directors that oversaw payments from the fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8742584">She is an individual from an organization that had received SDTC funding in the past, so a couple of red flags went up across the bureaucracy, and I applaud it for that. However, despite being warned, the Liberal government went ahead and appointed her anyway. Under her watch, an environment rotten with conflicts of interest thrived. The Liberal-friendly board awarded funding to organizations that they individually had a financial interest in. The gravy train, unfortunately, could not go on forever for those board members—</ParaText>
