              <ParaText id="8681592">Mr. Speaker, on Monday, November 4, Murray Sinclair passed away. Most Canadians will remember Murray as the chairperson for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which launched in 2009, and so they should. The work of the commission was monumental and profound. The commission, through Murray Sinclair's leadership, shone a light on the racist, colonial residential school system and all of its devastating effects, which indigenous people are still suffering through today. However, more than that, the final report of the commission offered solutions, calls to action, and those calls to action will guide Canada's reconciliation efforts for generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681593">I remember Murray Sinclair from my time as a youth worker at the Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre in Winnipeg. Murray was the husband of Katherine, who played a leadership role in the management of the centre, and he would sometimes come around, mostly for social functions such as Christmas parties and other celebrations. He stood out. He was a first nations lawyer, and he was a damned good one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681594">I had a chance to connect with him on those occasions, and connect with people is what Murray Sinclair did, all people, especially young people. He connected with me on the importance of getting involved, of not being afraid to advocate for what one believes in and, most of all, of being proud of who one is and where one comes from. For a young, uneducated, poor Métis man in the mid-eighties, the example he set and the message he sent were extremely powerful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681595">Murray Sinclair would go on to serve as co-commissioner of the provincial aboriginal justice inquiry in the late eighties. The purpose of the inquiry was to examine the issues plaguing the relationship between the indigenous people of Manitoba and the justice system of Manitoba, including police services. It was there that Murray Sinclair really rose to the occasion. He played an incisive role, a crucial role, in shining a light on the racist policies of the Winnipeg Police Service and the Manitoba justice system. The inquiry shone an intense and powerful light on indigenous-police relations in the city of Winnipeg, and those issues are still around today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681596">Of course, Murray Sinclair played other very important roles in his legal career, which are too numerous to mention. He was also appointed a senator here in 2016 and served until 2021. It was during this period that we were able to connect again semi-regularly on the plane from Winnipeg to Ottawa or from Ottawa to Winnipeg, when I had the opportunity to sit beside him for a couple of hours. We had some intense, enlightening discussions on reconciliation, on Manitoba issues and on Canadian issues. It was a real privilege to walk to his office in East Block and consult with Senator Sinclair on a wide array of reconciliation issues. There was absolutely nobody more knowledgeable, kinder and wiser to chat with at that time. I will always cherish and always remember those times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681597">Finally, Murray Sinclair was my Facebook friend and my daughter's Facebook friend. It always warmed my heart when I read posts on my daughter's site encouraging her and telling her to be positive, whether it was on education issues, university issues or her days as an activist. Murray had the ability to connect with all people, not only on social media, of course, but in real life, and especially young people. He was positive. He encouraged people to get involved and try to make their communities a better place. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681598"> My absolute personal favourite is when Murray Sinclair would comment on my daughter's Facebook page about how precious and beautiful my granddaughter, Tennessee Bone, is. It warmed my heart because obviously it is true. He had an ability to connect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681599">Murray Sinclair, Mazina Giizhik, was an extraordinary leader. He was a teacher and a fighter for social justice, among many other things, which are too numerous to mention. He will be sorely missed.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278262" Type="2">Mr. Jamie Schmale (Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8681601">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of His Majesty's loyal opposition and the Conservative Party of Canada, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in celebration of the remarkable life and achievements of a true champion of justice and reconciliation, the Hon. Murray Sinclair. As a distinguished lawyer, senator and the first indigenous person to serve as chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, Murray Sinclair's journey is a testament to the power of resilience, advocacy and vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681602">Born in 1951 in a small community of St. Peter's, Manitoba, Murray Sinclair faced the challenges of growing up as a member of the Selkirk First Nation. His early experiences instilled in him a profound understanding of the injustices faced by indigenous peoples in Canada. Rather than being deterred, he channelled his experiences into a lifelong commitment to advocacy and change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681603">Murray Sinclair's educational path was nothing short of inspiring. He obtained his law degree from the University of Manitoba in 1979, becoming one of the first indigenous lawyers in Canada. His legal career quickly flourished, marked by significant roles that would shape his legacy. As a founding member of the aboriginal justice inquiry of Manitoba, he laid the groundwork for crucial discussions about justice reform and the need for a system that respects indigenous rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681604">However, it was his role as the chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that truly brought him to the forefront of the national consciousness. Appointed in 2009, he led the commission with grace and determination, guiding the nation through the painful history of residential schools. The TRC's report, released in 2015, provided not only a comprehensive account of the injustices faced by indigenous children, but also a road map for reconciliation, one that calls for understanding, respect and the restoration of relationships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681605"> Murray Sinclair's work has had a profound impact on countless lives. His tireless advocacy for education, justice, and health equality for indigenous peoples has inspired a new generation of leaders. As he stated, “Education is the key to reconciliation” and “Education got us into this mess and education will get us out of it.” He has challenged Canadians to confront their history, embrace the truth and work together toward a more inclusive future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681606">As a senator appointed in 2016, Justice Sinclair continued to champion indigenous rights and issues, ensuring that the voices of indigenous people were heard in the highest halls of power. His legislative efforts have sought to address systemic inequalities and promote the policies that foster genuine reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681607">Beyond his formal roles, Murray Sinclair has been a mentor, role model and beacon of hope to many. His words have resonated with many. He has encouraged all Canadians to engage in learning about indigenous cultures, history and rights, reminding us that understanding is the first step toward healing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681608">Today, as we reflect on Murray Sinclair's incredible contributions, let us not only honour his legacy, but also commit ourselves to the principles that he has championed over his lifetime. Let us strive for a Canada where respect, understanding and reconciliation are at the heart of the national identity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681609">Of course, the accolades have been flowing in. Here are just a few of the reflections on the life and contributions of Murray Sinclair as others saw him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681610">Governor General Mary Simon said, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of a friend and prominent leader in Canada who championed human rights, justice and truth”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681611">The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said that Murray Sinclair “broke barriers and inspired countless individuals to pursue reform and justice with courage and determination.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681612">Winnipeg's mayor, Scott Gillingham, called Sinclair a true “leader in justice, reconciliation, and education.” He also said, “His passing feels especially sad because the journey he started is still ongoing, with much work ahead.”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8681622">Mr. Speaker, we mourn the passing of the Hon. Murray Sinclair on Monday, November 4. This former lawyer, judge and senator was best known for his role as the chair of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681623">After graduating from law school in 1979, the Hon. Murray Sinclair was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1980 and went on to become Manitoba's first indigenous judge, appointed in 1988. He was then called to sit on the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, the province's highest trial court, in 2001.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681624">While law was at the heart of his professional career, it was his work defending the interests and values of the Anishinabe people, his people, that earned him a place in history. In 1988, he co-chaired the Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People in Manitoba. More importantly, in 2009, after initially refusing, he agreed to chair Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He was eventually called to serve in the Senate of Canada on April 2, 2016, until his retirement on January 31, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681625">On December 29, 2021, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in recognition of his expertise in indigenous rights and his efforts to foster reconciliation between Canada's indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681626">Murray Sinclair, whose Anishinaabe name was Mazina Giizhik, held a place of honour in the indigenous community. Tributes are pouring in from across the country, mourning his loss and praising his life. He is being called a mentor, a guide, a champion and a kind-hearted giant, but he also a person who would confront people and light our path through the darkness. He was clearly a man of significance. I did not have the privilege of knowing him, but had I had that chance, I would have found it an honour and a pleasure. The indigenous community and politicians of all stripes are paying tribute to him today, and a well-earned tribute at that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681627">Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the chief of the Assembly of First Nations, says that she has lost a guide and a mentor, adding that he was born at a time when first nations members did not have the right to vote. He rose to become one of the most decorated and influential figures in the field of justice and defence of the rights of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681628">Inuit Senator Michèle Audette said, “he was always present. Even when he was ill and not doing well, he made himself available to coach me. He was a mentor until his last breath, and that was so valuable to me.” Betsy Kennedy, acting grand chief of Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, said, “today, we mourn the loss of a hero whose vision and leadership continue to guide us forward. The Honourable Murray Sinclair’s tireless commitment to justice and truth has left a permanent mark on our nations and communities, and we carry his light as we strive for the betterment of our Nations.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681629">Lastly, former federal justice minister Jody Wilson‑Raybould mourned the passing of her “mentor, friend and colleague”, adding, “I will always cherish his wisdom and celebrate his distinct contributions to Indigenous peoples and to Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681630">Speaking for myself and the Bloc Québécois, today I salute this great man and offer our sincerest condolences to his family, to his friends and to all the peoples that comprise the great First Nations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681631"> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured today to speak on behalf of the NDP to honour a great human being, Murray Sinclair, a mentor and a hero who had a profoundly kind and wise ability to cut through colonial noise to shine the truth on Canada's colonial history. This was a daunting task at a time where there was growing denialism about the horrors and genocide that occurred at the residential schools. He listened to the stories and internalized and carried the pain of thousands of survivors, defending and honouring their truths, which he shared with the rest of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681632">He knew that reconciliation and the decolonization of Canada would be met with obstacles, yet he never quit moving forward to help everyone across Canada to develop a collective understanding of truth, calling out those in power to act and to reflect to ensure that truth would shine through the darkness. As he stated in an interview with Brett Forester in January 2021:</ParaText>

They’re going to fight against reconciliation. They’re the deniers of this story. They’re going to say this never happened. That the schools were all about education and the Indians should be thankful that they got an education.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681634"> He went on to say, “Schools were never about education, schools were always about forced assimilation and indoctrination, and we need to call it for what it is.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681635">He persisted in his calls for us to do better, to reflect on how our need to protect our own privilege and power impeded our ability to reconcile in this country. He did it in such a way as to help build a collective understanding of the colonization of Canada. I am truly grateful to him for his strength to share truth, especially for survivors who continue to suffer in silence as a result of the abuses they experienced in the schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681636">He gifted Canada with a path through 94 calls to action to lead towards reconciliation. We have that path forward, which he provided to us based on the gifts of stories provided by survivors. It is now up to us to honour his legacy by taking actions that will lead to reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681637">In addition to his role as the chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he served in many prominent roles, including sitting on the Canadian Senate and as the co-commissioner of the aboriginal justice inquiry, a public inquiry commissioned by the Manitoba government to explore the failure of the justice system regarding the murder of Helen Betty Osborne and the death of J. J. Harper. In his role as co-commissioner, he revealed, unapologetically, the systemic racism within the Manitoba justice system and provided a path forward to improve its relationship with indigenous peoples, something that has never been actualized and something he never stopped fighting for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681638">In 2021, after the killing of Eishia Hudson, a 17-year-old indigenous girl, at the hands of the Winnipeg city police, he called out the independent investigation unit on its lack of transparency regarding police misconduct, stating:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8681656"> Mr. Speaker, I move that the 20th report of the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, presented on Friday, November 1, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681657">The reason why I am proposing this motion today is in response to an interim report on a committee study that the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology is undertaking right now. The motion that precipitated this within the committee read, “Following testimony from banking executives” the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology encourages “the Competition Bureau...to investigate potential anti-competitive behaviour in Canada’s e-Transfer ecosystem, and if deemed necessary, the broader electronic payments industry in general.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681658">For members of the House, this report is encouraging the Competition Bureau to look into what we believe, and this was a unanimous report at committee, to be a flagrant abuse of Canada's anti-competition laws and, frankly, a flagrant abuse of any sort of spirit of wanting to see productivity in the Canadian economy, because this issue impacts the payments industry in such a broad way. This may be a technical topic for some, but I will try to summarize it briefly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681659"> Over 88% of Canadians use something called e-transfers. I guarantee that everybody in here has done this at some point in time. When we want to send money to, let us say, a pet sitter or if we are paying rent to our landlord, we would execute an e-transfer and that is where our money would go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681660">The key player in this space, the key facilitator of e-transfers in Canada, a dominant player as we heard from banking executives at the committee, is Interac. Interac is an association that is, for all intents and purposes, owned by the big banks in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681661"> This is how it works. Interac charges a fee to financial institutions, banks, for facilitating these e-transfers. What colleagues and I heard anecdotally was that there was a significant difference in the fees that were charged to big banks by Interac as opposed to smaller financial institutions. Smaller institutions were paying around the neighbourhood of 46¢ per transaction while big banks were paying 6¢.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681662"> What does that mean? It means that the big banks have a competitive advantage over smaller financial institutions. First, it is more difficult for smaller financial institutions to be competitive in this space. Second, it also allows bigger banks to make more profit off Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681663">Some Canadian consumers will say that they do not pay anything for e-transfers, but the reality is that anybody who is interacting with a bank in Canada is likely paying a significant annual fee or a hidden fee to have the privilege of banking in Canada, and there are situations where customers might go over even what is included in those plans. For e-transfers, the fees can range from $1 to $1.50, and there are billions of e-transers a year. If we start doing the math on how much big banks are making compared to smaller banks on the price differential in that volume-based pricing system, if we then start thinking about how much more those big banks are making off their customer fees than smaller institutions are and if we start thinking about how much fees customers are paying just in general, does it not look a little sketchy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681664">That is what we were concerned about in the committee. Our concerns were validated, and for me as a parliamentarian, by shocking testimony from a banking executive, who also sits on Interac's board. This person was clearly not prepared for these questions, but he did admit to the fact that this volume-based pricing system, which we had heard about anecdotally, did exist. That is highly problematic. The committee did pass a motion, an interim report, to encourage the Competition Bureau, which is an independent body, to look into this based on the testimony we heard.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681665"> I will be splitting, Mr. Speaker, my my time with a member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681666">Why is this important? This is not just important from the perspective of smaller financial institutions being unable to be competitive with larger banks, which I believe is the case. It is also a matter of new and potentially emerging technologies that could lower fees for customers and for financial institutions entering the market. That is because Interac is essentially owned by the big banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681667">If we look at Interact's website, we will see that the big banks nominate people to sit on their boards. They have essentially a controlling interest in Interac. Of course, they are going to ensure that new players, where they can within the competition law or the government refusing to act, they are going to try to squeeze profit out of this arrangement. They essentially have created a stranglehold on the e-transfer market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681668">I want to note something for colleagues, because this is kind of a niche topic. When we think about the ripple effect it has across the economy, it is pretty big. It is not just e-transfers; it is also the payments industry writ large. We know that, for example, the government did not regulate this, although it could have regulated it like other jurisdictions by putting a cap on what we call interchange fees for credit cards. Instead of doing that, it came up with a voluntary agreement with Visa and Mastercard. The fees are still much higher than other jurisdictions, like in the European Union. The government also did not ensure that those savings would be passed to small business. It actually did nothing. Now we have payment processors like Stripe, and Mark Carney, the Liberal's senior economic adviser, is on the board of directors, being accused of hoarding those savings. They basically admitted in testimony at our committee. There is a whole competitive issue in the payments industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681669">However, I want to highlight for colleagues why we should be encouraging the Competition Bureau to look into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681670">Across the world, there are more modern payment systems. I am looking at Swish in Sweden,; FPS in the U.K.; UPI in India; and Pix in Brazil. These are all processors that facilitate e-transfers, but they do it in a way that is much more efficient and probably at a lower cost than Interact. For example, with Interac, it takes minutes to hours for that transaction to complete. All of us have been in a situation where we have asked someone if a transfer went through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681671">For the competitors with new and modern technology, the transfers almost happen instantly or within seconds. Customer fees are also way lower. They are almost negligible with some of the competitors. Interac has relatively low limits on what can go through in an e-transfer, whereas competitors can facilitate much larger transfers. These competitors, which we are not allowing into our market, might have more modern security, and we know that they have more modern security protocols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681672">There are competitors around the world that can make our economy more competitive by producing a competitive landscape in which e-transfer fees could be lower. They could be lower for our financial institutions. We could perhaps have more competition in our financial institutions. However, because of the way Interac is structured and governed and because of this volume-based pricing scale that it has for e-transfers, it creates a non-competitive environment for innovation for our competitors to enter, and that is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681673">This is why this motion is here today. I hope the House, across all political stripes, will encourage and ensure that the Competition Bureau looks into this, given the massive economic impact. There is probably a lot more information that the industry committee needs to look into. This is a huge issue. The federal government committed to lowering bank fees for Canadians. It has not done that. When we are talking about productivity, this is a huge problem for the Canadian economy. It is also a problem for the fintech sector with regard to entering into rent-seeking, inflexible places that have pushed out innovation for many years. I also think the industry committee should be looking more into this, but I encourage colleagues to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681677">Mr. Speaker, first, I need to clarify that in the deal the government came up with for Visa and Mastercard, there was no requirement for payment processors like Stripe to pass the savings along to small businesses. Advocacy groups have pointed out that these payment processors are actually hoarding these fees. Therefore, the government probably should have some sort of formal regulation to ensure that this situation is not happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681678">Second, I need to point out and re-emphasize that Canadians do pay for e-transfer fees. They pay for it one way or the other, such as very high banking fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681679">Third, even though the government has had nine years, it has not moved on these junk fees or done anything materially to allow for more competition in the banking industry. We are behind other jurisdictions in allowing for innovation in financial services writ large.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681680">However, my colleague mentioned a company, and this is why the wording of the motion was broad. We are encouraging the competition commissioner to look at the payment system writ large. The spirit of the motion today is to say that there needs to be cross-partisan agreement that our banking system is outdated, that it is controlled by a few big players and that Canadians, be it individual consumers, companies or whatnot, are suffering because of it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681683">Mr. Speaker, much to the chagrin of my colleague, I have to point out that the way government pays for social programs is through taxes, and taxes are only created by the private sector and by Canadians who work and create revenue for the government. Money does not grow on trees. The socialist rhetoric that ignores that fact is magical fantasyland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681684">The government has put regulations in place that are perhaps out of date or just do not reflect modern reality. When those regulations, or lack thereof, stifle competition in a free market system, we end up with oligopolies or monopolies. That ends up subjugating people, or preventing innovation or making people pay more. That is why we need to ensure we have competition in these sectors, and there are a lot of sectors in Canada that do not have competition right now, be it the telecom sector or banks. I could go on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681685">There needs to be cross-political alignment on the fact that if we are to talk about increasing productivity and economic growth so that the government can have sustainable social programs, we need more competition. This motion today deals with one sector of it, but I hope that there is cross-partisan agreement in this place that if a monopoly is used to profiting off of rent-seeking policies that make life unaffordable for Canadians and prevent innovation, its time is up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681686"> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here today again to speak on behalf of the residents of Simcoe North and to represent their views, as well as to discuss a very important issue with respect to what we believe is potentially anti-competitive behaviour in Canada's e-transfer ecosystem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681687">These revelations became known to us at the industry committee a couple of weeks ago. It is clear that Interac uses what it calls and has confirmed is volume-based pricing. We just heard my very capable colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> outline how the system works, but here are the facts as I understand them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681688">The largest financial institutions in the country pay Interac six cents to send an e-transfer. The smallest financial institutions pay it 43 cents. That is a difference of seven times. In theory, volume-based discounts are not a bad thing. A lot of people, Canadians, shop at Costco. Because they get a volume discount, people walk out of there with five boxes of Cheerios when they really only need one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681689">There is nothing inherently wrong with volume discounts, but then one learns that Interac is owned by the banks. The financial institutions set the prices that Interac charges other financial institutions and, surprise, they favour themselves. There are governance issues at Interac. By the way, the ownership structure is completely secret, hidden from all in plain sight. We have no idea who owns what or what the compensation structure is for Interac executives or board members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681690">It gets worse. At the time that Interac developed its fee schedule, two financial institutions were co-chairs of the board. These two financial institutions were the largest in Canada at the time and the only two to meet the required volume threshold to get the lowest price. Is that a conflict of interest? It likely is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681691">Members of the government have a challenge understanding what a conflict of interest is, so I will explain it briefly. A conflict of interest can exist whether there is an actual or perceived conflict of interest. It does not have to be a bona fide conflict of interest. It can exist when a reasonable person perceives there to be a conflict. It would appear to me very clearly that a reasonable person walking down the street would say that it does not sound right that the big banks get to set the pricing that smaller banks pay to compete with the big banks to send an e-transfer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681692">It is true that many Canadians do not pay for e-transfers, but Canadians can pay up to $1.50 per transaction. If they bank at a big bank, it pays Interac only six cents. That is a heck of a gross profit margin. How much fraud is in the system when people pay six cents as the variable cost to send an e-transfer and make $1.50 in revenue? By the way, the receiving bank sometimes charges the person receiving the transfer for that transaction in their bank account; that can be up to $1.50. When the small institutions are trying to compete with the big ones, they offer free e-transfers, but they have to pay 43¢. Therefore, they have to make up that 43¢ of revenue somewhere else to offer the free banking service to their clients. In fact, I have a low- or no-cost banking account at one of these upstarts solely because it offers free cheques and free e-transfers. A lot of Canadians do not have the time, effort or means to shop around. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681693">The solution here is a lot more transparency, of course. However, perhaps we could even consider other possibilities. Let us be very clear: I am not talking about Interac itself, but its owners, the dark Sith overlord owners called the banks. They are the ones pulling the strings, such as those of the puppets at Interac. It is not Interac itself that is the problem but the undue influence of the owners. Maybe we should think about freeing Interac from the shackles of the big banks. It would then have to deal with the big banks on an arm's-length basis. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681694">We could also think about supporting a competitor to Interac, which would give people choice. That is a very radical position, but I think it would bring integrity back to the system. I am not saying we should absolutely do it, but the time has come to really consider all the options. We should be unburdened by the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681695"> We have to turn the page. We cannot go back to where these large oligopoly companies have undue influence and control. I swear, the banks must think some of us just fell out of a coconut tree with the practices they use. The answer to this problem is more competition. It is to give more choice to consumers, as well as choice to financial institutions on how to move money throughout the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681696"> Canadians, businesses and individuals spend about $3 billion to $5 billion a year in transaction fees to move money across the country. This is a significant profit pool for financial institutions, people and companies in the payment space. Competition will reduce the size of that profit pool so that consumers can benefit; this will leave more money in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681697"> I recognize that many people in this place have differing views on how we might achieve lower prices for Canadians. My own personal opinion is that lower prices will not be achieved by increasing the size of revenues for government. There is no correlation between increasing taxes on companies and lowering prices for Canadians. The idea is that we must attack these profit pools with competition. In fact, a Deloitte study suggested that up to 0.5% to 0.8% of GDP could be unlocked, of value for Canadians, if we moved forward with payments modernization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681698"> The Bank of Canada has a role to play too. They set up standards that prominent payment systems must comply with. Interac is in non-compliance with two of those standards; specifically, they use volume-based pricing, not risk-based pricing, and they do not make public how one becomes a member of Interac.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681699"> Now, the Department of Justice in the United States has gone after its prominent payment system, Visa, for its practices at Interac, which it uses in the United States. That entity controls 60% of the debit market in the U.S. Interac controls about 95% of the debit market and 100% of the e-transfer market in Canada. I would encourage regulators to look at that example. It is clear that the status quo will not work anymore.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681732">I will start by saying that I appreciated the last comment from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> about Bitcoin. I really hope he does not need to go anywhere and can stay in the House to get up when I finish my speech to ask me a question about Bitcoin. I would love to know more about his feelings on Bitcoin.

I would also love to hear more about the policies the Conservatives have to offer Canadians on Bitcoin and investing in Bitcoin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681733">Perhaps this means we will soon see the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> buy another shawarma with Bitcoin.

I would encourage the member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> to stay in his seat, bear with having to listen to me for nine more minutes and then get up so we can talk about Bitcoin.

              <ParaText id="8681734">We have to take the opportunity to understand why we are here right now talking about this particular issue. I am not saying it is not an important issue. I think that is an extremely important thing to ask the anti-competitive agencies to engage in looking at certain practices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681735">However, let us back up to about four weeks ago, when Conservatives started debating a privilege motion. I know the member who moved that motion likes to talk about procedure and how things happen. He makes sure those who are watching are properly informed, so I will do the same. The Conservatives moved a motion based on a ruling from the Speaker, and as a result, we have seen the Conservatives filibustering for the last four and a half weeks. They are filibustering their own motion, I should add. The motion is to send this particular question of privilege to PROC, yet they do not even want to vote on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681736">Conservatives moved a motion to send this somewhere, but they absolutely refuse to do that. What have they done in the process? They filibustered by putting up almost all, and I believe at last count it was about 106 Conservatives, to speak for 20 minutes. They then moved an amendment, which allowed some of them to speak twice or even three times. When that started to run out, they then started to move concurrence motions like the one we are debating today. After that, they allowed the debate on the subamendment to the privilege motion to collapse so they could reset their speaking roster and start from scratch to give everybody another 20-minute round. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681737">That is the game being played in the House of Commons right now. That is the game, which was referred to earlier as a multi-million dollar game, the Conservatives are playing. To the people watching, it is their tax dollars that are going toward that. It is their tax dollars being spent, in the millions of dollars right now, to keep the House operating in order to appease the Conservatives' desire for a filibuster. This is a filibuster on an issue that, by the way, the Speaker has ruled on. The Conservatives are the only ones who are speaking to it. At times, they are the only ones who are asking each other questions on the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681738">Conservatives are doing it for only one reason. They are doing it to support the concept and promote the idea that the House is dysfunctional and nothing can get done. This is because they benefit off of and see opportunity come from making things seem totally chaotic. Where have we witnessed that lately? It seems to happen a lot south of the border, so Conservatives have jumped on board and have said that this is how they are going to deal with things too. They are going to make things seem completely out of order. It is the only way to advance any of their personal political objectives, and this is where we have ended up.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681739"> The reason it is important for folks at home to know this is that we have an Order Paper and a projected order of business each day for the House of Commons. This is public. We can find it on the website and there is a printed copy provided every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681740">Just so folks at home know what we would have been debating and discussing, had the Conservatives not chosen to continue this filibuster and bring forward concurrence motions like the one we have today, I will list some of the things that are on the Order Paper. The next item to be debated is from the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation> and it is Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, an act to amend the Citizenship Act 2024, which would make amendments to our Citizenship Act. After that, there is a ways and means motion to bring in adjustments to the capital gains tax, which we had been talking about for a number of months. That is what we were going to debate after Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>. Following that, there is the <Affiliation DbId="300003" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> making changes to the military justice system. That is also listed on the Order Paper as one of the items the House would be debating. The Order Paper also lists an act to enact the Online Harms Act, to amend the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and an act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service and to make consequential and related amendments to other acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681741">These are the issues that the Canadian public should know we are trying to debate in the House of Commons while the Conservatives are talking to each other all the time. As the Conservatives are setting up these concurrence motions and their motions of privilege, they are filibustering. We cannot talk in the House of Commons right now about protecting children from online harm because the Conservatives have chosen to bring this place to an absolute halt and not let anything proceed for five weeks now. I will put 90% of the blame on Conservatives, and then I will assign 5% of the blame to both the Bloc and the NDP because the Bloc and the NDP know that there is a way through this.</ParaText>

                <B> Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc wants to take 10%. They can have the full 10% of the blame then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681744">The Bloc members need to understand, and I know that they do, that if they chose to end this filibustering, they have the power to do it. In a minority parliament like this, we obviously cannot do it alone, but the Bloc, or the NDP for that matter, could choose to say, “Enough is enough. We've now let this go on for five weeks. We've given them the opportunity to do it. We've allowed them to run their course and they have responded in the way that they have, but now it's time to get down to business, like adults.” The problem is that neither the Bloc nor the NDP has chosen to go that route. However, I want them both to know that the door is still open. That door will not close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681745"> If there is an interest, I would encourage their leaders in the House to contact our House <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">leader</Affiliation> so that we can have that discussion about moving things forward for Canadians. Things did operate much better, and I must say this to my NDP colleagues, who I really have not picked on in this debate, but they did operate much better prior to the NDP <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> choosing to not work with the government anymore. We accomplished a lot of great things, such as pharmacare and dental care. I send my kudos to the NDP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681746">I have said a number of times already in the House, as well as in my community, that we had a really good working relationship with the NDP, which gave us the ability to get things done on behalf of Canadians. The NDP knows that. I understand that, for political reasons, it may have had to make the decision to leave the supply and confidence agreement. I understand that, and I am not naive to that. However, NDP members still have the opportunity to look at what is going on in chamber and realize the amount of tax dollars that are being spent for this charade to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681747"> At some point, I genuinely hope that the NDP will come to its senses and say that five or six weeks is enough. Now it is time to move on so that we can talk about things such as the online harms bill, so that we can get down to doing business for Canadians, such as protecting children when they are online.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681760"> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand in the House today to talk about all of the measures with respect to banking regulations and fees that various organizations and companies charge consumers, and how the government is taking actions to reduce those fees and help Canadians through this challenging affordability crisis that so many people are experiencing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681761">I would like to congratulate the small businesses in Milton that I visited over the last couple of weeks to talk about the reductions in their credit card fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681762">Indeed, budget 2024 reduced credit card transaction fees for small businesses, which took effect on October 19. This has an impact on 90% of small businesses that accept credit cards, and we are lowering their fees by 27%. That is going to save the average small business, like BarBurrito in Milton, up to $3,000 or $4,000 a year. That is money that business owners can reinvest in their business, use to sponsor a local soccer team or use to hire a new employee or two. This is making a huge impact on small businesses and it is only because of the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who stood up to some of the largest companies in the world, Visa and Mastercard, and said they were charging too much for those transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681763">Everybody uses credit cards to pay for meals and goods every single day. On a small transaction, like $20 for lunch, it really does add up over the course of a year. Congratulations to all the small business owners across the country who will be seeing a 27% reduction in that very onerous cost from large credit card companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681764">This builds on the action we took with the tax cut for small businesses that we brought forward in budget 2022, which is also saving businesses across Canada $660 million. It is phenomenal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681765">Small businesses in Canada are the heart and the backbone of our economy. They employ local people and purchase local goods. I always encourage people to shop local. In fact, this year I was wondering if I could manage to buy all of my Christmas presents on Main Street in Milton. We have some amazing shops, opportunities to buy gift cards, a lot of great perishable items, but also great things for the shelf, just really nice items, and not just seasonal items either. I am thinking of The Barn Door Studio in Milton, which is a gift shop but also a coffee shop and craft studio. We also have a brand-new chocolate store in Milton that I am really excited to shop at over the holidays. Chudleigh’s Blossom Cafe is a great place to go for a hot chocolate or hot cider or coffee over the winter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681766">Milton is just chockablock with great local small businesses, and all of them are saving money with the government's new transaction fee reduction of 27%. It is good news for small businesses and it is great news for our economy. It is also good news for consumers, as when we lower those costs for small businesses, they can choose to pass on those savings to their customers. We are very hopeful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681767"> Our economy is rebounding from the COVID downturn in remarkable fashion; it is doing quite well. We added over 50,000 jobs in the last couple of months, and 183,000 jobs just in Ontario over the last four months. We know global inflation is a challenge for families in Canada, but we are meeting the moment and we are fighting every single day on affordability with real solutions that are having a very significant impact for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681768">I was here in adjournment debate last night talking about the impact that one of those, the Canada carbon rebate, is having for lower-income families. As we continue to fight the climate crisis and do our part in a global carbon market to reduce our footprint, we have to acknowledge that as an oil-producing nation, Canada is very wealthy and we have one of the largest, if not the largest, carbon footprints per capita in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681769">The Conservatives like to talk about accountability and responsibility. I want to be accountable to future generations in terms of the impact I have on the environment. As Canadians, we deal with a lot of extreme weather, even outside of the extreme weather that has been in the news lately. The summers can be very hot and the winters can be very cold in any given year. I heard on the radio this morning that there is absolutely no shadow of a doubt that 2024 will be the hottest year on record for Planet Earth. It will be the first year ever that we will have experienced more than 1.5°C of warming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681770">If I sound a bit emotional, it is because I love Planet Earth and because we are up against people who seem to ignore that we as Canadians have an obligation to protect it and to reduce, wherever possible, our impact on Planet Earth.</ParaText>

Just 10 years ago, their profits were around $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. Now they are in excess of $60 billion. That is great for Canada's economy, but those dollars need to be reinvested into innovation because, unfortunately, the intensity of a barrel of oil coming from the oil sands in Alberta has only gotten worse since the 1990s. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681783"> I was talking about the credit card transaction fees, the banking fees and the Interac charges that we all endure every single day. One of the things that budget 2024 aimed to do was cut down on those junk fees, like insufficient funds charges that are sometimes $35 or $50, which is just too much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681784">Recently announced measures to ensure that Canadians are treated fairly by their banks are all part of budget 2024. These measures include protecting Canadians from rising mortgage payments, and recent changes to our mortgage rules have allowed Canadians to extend the amortization on their mortgage as well as ensure that they get the most competitive interest rates. We have also enhanced banking options, lowering non-sufficient fund fees, and we have also ensured that Canadians have an impartial advocate when they have complaints about their bank. For a lot of Canadians, when they call the bank to challenge a fee or some cost that they have absorbed, it is hard to have that conversation with somebody who actually works at the bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681785">These newest measures to keep banking more affordable will continue to make sure that the government's action to bring down inflation and stabilize prices for Canadians has that impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681786"> We are also protecting Canadians from rising mortgage payments. The <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> recently met with CEOs from all of Canada's largest banks and outlined her expectations that they abide by the government's new mortgage guidelines and by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada's regulations. That is having a positive impact for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681787">The <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation> has also directed banks to proactively work with mortgage holders at risk of default on their principal residences to provide tailored mortgage relief. The Deputy Prime Minister emphasized to the bank CEOs that she will be closely monitoring that compliance, and she has been. We have also made banking more affordable for Canadians. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that the government is taking action to secure enhanced low-cost and no-cost options at Canadian banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681788">Next, we are also making progress in cracking down on those junk fees. We have started with the NSF charges that are applied by banks. Sometimes they are in excess of $35 and even $50, which is really challenging. If somebody is experiencing that time when they are getting an NSF charge, it means they need a little help, not another charge. We know that those are disproportionately impacting the financial well-being of Canadians who may be living paycheque to paycheque, so we are cracking down on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681789">Fourth, we are also supporting Canadians who believe they have been treated unfairly by their bank. When it comes to eliminating the transaction fees, reducing them by 27% and making sure that Canadians have options at their banks, the Liberal Party has their back.</ParaText>

In fact, at COP27 Canada ranked 58th out of 63 countries, and I believe we even fell further than that last year. Their carbon tax plan has driven up the cost of living for Canadians to the point that people are going to food banks, struggling to put food on their tables and struggling to fill their gas tanks or afford home heating as the cold winter months approach.

              <ParaText id="8681793"> It is because our government is taking action on lowering emissions, and instead of acknowledging that, the Conservative members want to suggest that we are failing. That is absolutely not true, and the food banks report, as my colleague referenced, came out recently. There were 108 pages, and not once did it mention the carbon tax or the carbon price, and that is because food banks know, just like we do, that climate change is impacting food prices, and the Canada carbon rebate supports families who need it most.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681800">Mr. Speaker, I listened very closely to my colleague and he said something that was factually wrong about decreasing emissions. Emissions are not decreasing in the oil patch. Under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, since he went to Paris, oil production in Canada has risen 41%. It will increase much higher thanks to TMX. Canada is now on track to be the world leader of increased oil production at a time when António Guterres is accusing the fossil fuel companies of being the godfathers of climate catastrophe. The government is subsidizing 52% of every barrel going down the TMX pipeline as a gift to the oil companies. We have had their executives at our committee; not only do they not believe in climate science, they do not care and they are not going to pay.</ParaText>

The emissions in the oil patch have gone up, the emissions from the oil and gas sector have gone up as has the production.

              <ParaText id="8681804">Mr. Speaker, with apologies to my colleagues, I am rising on a question of privilege that I raised with the table earlier this morning, in relation to the 14th report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, which was tabled by our chair this morning during routine proceedings. I am rising at the earliest opportunity to make the case for this question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681805"> This is concerning the refusal of a witness, Ms. Lauren Chen, who is one of the co-founders of Tenet Media. Ms. Chen appeared before our committee on Tuesday this week, and subsequently refused to answer any and all questions that were posed to her. In the committee's report, which was tabled this morning, it did cite the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, 2017, on pages 178 to 179. It states:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Witnesses must answer all questions which the committee puts to them. A witness may object to a question asked by an individual committee member. However, if the committee agrees that the question be put to the witness, the witness is obliged to reply. On the other hand, members have been urged to display the “appropriate courtesy and fairness” when questioning witnesses. The actions of a witness who refuses to answer questions may be reported to the House.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681807">That is what is being done today. I should note that the motion authorizing the tabling of this report was unanimous. Ms. Chen was given every single opportunity, and she was reminded of her obligations before the committee. She was also warned on a number of occasions that the process could escalate and could eventually find itself on the floor of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681808">To put this briefly in context, the study that the public safety committee is currently engaged in is with regard to Russian disinformation campaigns. We, as a House, know of the foreign interference by a number of countries; Russia, India and China are probably the top three. This is a very serious topic. We know this from multiple witnesses who have appeared before our committee. These are current and former national security experts, and people who work in academia. We know that Russia's overarching strategic goal with respect to Canada is to sow discord and discontent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681809">There is a very serious United States indictment that lists Ms. Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan, as the co-founders of Tenet Media, and accuses that company of having received almost $10 million directly from the Russian government through its subsidiary, Russia Today, with the express purpose of paying certain YouTube influencers and personalities to sow discord and discontent, and to spread disinformation and misinformation. The subject matter is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681810">I want to remind everyone, with respect to non-answers, it is important that we understand that under the Constitution Act, the House of Commons and its committees have an incredibly important role to play. I would put them on a level with our courts. Our standing committees are allocated certain subject studies, and they are allowed, by virtue of the Constitution, to conduct inquiries, to send for persons and papers, and to demand answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681811">Given the serious nature of disinformation and of foreign interference, I believe that Ms. Chen's refusal to comply with the questions that were posed to her represents a very serious breach of the privileges of this House, and particularly of the standing committee on public safety. It is not something that we can conveniently ignore. Indeed, in many parliaments, precedent has been set where this matter has been referred to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681812">I understand, given that Ms. Chen and her husband are referred to in a United States indictment, that certainly they do have some legitimate fears about testifying on a sensitive subject. I would argue that they put themselves in this position, but it is important to recognize that when a witness appears before a duly constructed standing committee of the House, the parliamentary privilege that the members enjoy, both in this House and at committee, to be able to speak freely, also extends to witnesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681825">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to say that the question of privilege just raised appears to be very worrisome. I am sure that once the Speaker has heard the views of each party, he will make a very enlightened decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681826">Today we are debating the 20th report of the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology. It deals with interchange fees, the fees that credit card companies charge businesses. This is a very important issue. As soon as I was elected to the House, businesses in my riding asked me about it. Convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores say it makes no sense. Their business model relies on a high volume of sales with small profit margins. The share of their costs that goes to credit cards is high, because every time a transaction is paid for with a credit card—whether it is a full tank of gas, some groceries or a chocolate bar—the fee charged is very high. The fee is much higher than elsewhere in the world, in many countries. I will be citing at least one case soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681827">This erodes the revenues of merchants. We know that grocers, convenience store owners and small businesses operate in a highly competitive environment, while credit card companies practically form a duopoly or oligopoly. Apart from Visa, Mastercard, and maybe American Express, there are practically no other cards in use. As a result, these credit card companies can band together and charge exorbitant rates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681828">The Standing Committee on Industry and Technology has started studying the issue. After hearing testimony from certain witnesses, and before even drafting a full report and getting to the bottom of the issue, it decided that the situation was serious enough to immediately send the House a report entitled “Potential anti-competitive behaviour in Canada's e-Transfer ecosystem”. The website of the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology states the following: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681829">

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681830">The report simply contains the following sentence, which reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681831">
                <CommitteeQuote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Following testimony from banking executives, your committee recommends that the Competition Bureau be encouraged to investigate potential anti-competitive behaviour in Canada’s e-Transfer ecosystem, and if deemed necessary, the broader electronic payments industry in general.</QuotePara>
                </CommitteeQuote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681832">The members of the committee realized how big of a problem this is and determined that the Competition Bureau needed to quickly address it while the committee continued its study. That is what we are debating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681833">Obviously, we are strongly in favour of this. I would be surprised if there were any member of this House who is not favour of it because, as I said, as soon as I was elected, many businesses in my riding and across Quebec began asking me about this and continue to do so. I am sure that all members of the House are being asked about the credit card fees being imposed on consumers and the fees that businesses have to pay. This is still happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681834">A little after 2015, Liberal member Linda Lapointe introduced a private member's bill. She received a rather choice spot in the order of precedence when her name was picked out of the hat. Ms. Lapointe ran a grocery store in her riding. She thought that this was so important that she used her round to raise the issue. The Liberal government ended up pushing back her turn to speak until it opted to make her a parliamentary secretary, the immediate effect of which was to strip her of her private member's bill. This was the first action the Liberal government took on the question of fees charged to merchants. The party had among its ranks a member who had a grocery store and who chose to use her parliamentary privilege to appeal to the House for changes to be made. I repeat, I do not see who could be against this, since it affects all businesses in our ridings. In the end, the government found a strategy to ensure that the question never came up for debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681835">At the same time, in the Bloc Québécois, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> introduced a bill on the same topic, with basically the same effects, but with the election and the minority government, it never came up for debate. It is time that that changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681836">In 2022 there was a ray of hope when the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> indicated in her budget that she was setting the situation right. We thought we had a nice victory to celebrate, and that at last the minister had gotten off her high horse and seen the light.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681837">She said that the matter of interchange fees on Visa and MasterCard transactions would be settled, but as we get more experience we are beginning to understand the way things work. They say all the right things and they say they are going to solve the problem. The fine print at the bottom of the page, however, says that the government will start by asking the credit card companies to fix the problem on their own. If they do not, the government will settle the matter and create a law. Thus, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the government are fine with the temporary, rather symbolic measures that the credit card companies have taken, which change nothing for grocery stores. In fact, grocers have appealed to us. I will return to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681838">There is a link between what the credit card companies are doing, the fees they charge merchants and the price for a basket of groceries. This is highly significant. We have been living with inflation for years now, and for years the government has said it would take action. Last year, shortly before Thanksgiving, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> said that he had spoken to grocery store representatives and that turkeys were on sale. The thing is, though, that every year on the eve of Thanksgiving, grocery stores offer a deal on turkeys, since Thanksgiving is right around the corner. The minister said it was thanks to his intervention, but we could see that his intervention did not fix the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681839">There is one specific thing the government can do to solve the problem: address interchange fees and the fees that credit card companies charge grocery stores. This how the government can intervene to bring grocery prices down. What is it actually doing? The Minister of Finance and the government are settling for the voluntary measures Visa and Mastercard chose for themselves. Grocery store owners reached out to us and told us that it is not working. They say credit card companies' voluntary measures are not doing anything for them, so the government needs to step in. I forwarded that letter along with a summary of their demands to the minister more than two months ago. As we can see, nothing has changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681840">What is the problem? In Australia, for example, the fees that merchants can be charged are set through regulations and laws. They are capped at 0.5%. Here, the average is 1.4%, three times higher. Why are our fees three times higher? Are credit card fees, transactions and administrative expenses higher in Canada and Quebec than in Australia? I do not think so. I think that Australians had the necessary political will to intervene and pass legislation. They saw an oligopoly, and they knew that the free market only works if there is competition. They saw that companies were using their oligopoly to get more value and decided that that was unacceptable, so they reduced the fees to 0.5%. Here, the fees are 1.4%, three times higher. Some credit card companies even charge merchants up to 4% in fees, while, in Australia, they pay eight times less, or 0.5%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681841">I studied economics. In economics 101, we are taught how companies react. Companies will do whatever it takes to maximize their profits. If they have an oligopoly, they will use their power to increase fees, get more value and earn more profits. I taught that every semester in the introduction to economics class I used to teach at CEGEP. The government knows this, so it is up to the government to intervene by making regulations or passing laws capping these fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681842">The government says that it is doing everything it can to lower the cost of groceries. However, there is one change it could make that it has known about for years. A Liberal member even tabled a bill on the subject. If, for example, fees were set at 0.5% instead of 1.4%, that would be almost a full percentage point lower. Grocery prices would fall by almost one percentage point. The major credit card companies would make normal profits rather than excessive profits. However, the government refuses to make that happen. What did the government do? As I was saying, in the 2022 budget, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said that the government was going to do something, but that the companies would have to tell the government what they wanted to do first. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681843">Here is what these credit card companies did. They crunched the numbers. Keep in mind that, just a few years earlier, we had been talking about the free market, duopolies and oligopolies. The retail sector has some really big players, starting with Walmart. Walmart decided to capitalize on its strong market position. The company was so dominant in its sector that it told the credit card companies that the days of 4% transaction fees on certain cards, or even 1%, 1.5% or 2%, were over. Walmart instructed them to do as it said, meaning that they would have to charge a reasonable rate or Walmart would refuse to accept their cards. Walmart's market position gave it the clout to make such a move. Walmart even refused to accept Visa for a few months, just to show that it was serious. Visa and Mastercard decided to lower the transaction fees they were charging Walmart. Walmart had pushed back hard, and it worked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681844">Following the minister's request to help out SMEs, the credit card companies crunched the numbers and said they were going to offer the same rate they give Walmart, but only to small businesses with low sales volumes. They crunched the numbers and said they did not want to include grocery stores because that is where they make their money. I do not want to misspeak, but I believe that Mastercard said that if a company's annual sales were lower than $175,000, it would charge it the same rates as Walmart. Visa set its limit at $300,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681845">If a company makes $175,000 or $300,000 in sales per year and takes in a 10% profit, that means it clears $17,000 or $30,000 in profit per year. That would not even pay the median wage. Obviously, this measure would only cover very small businesses. Grocery stores, like convenience stores and gas stations, have a low-margin business model. It is something like a 1% to 2% profit margin, but on a huge volume of sales. They are therefore excluded from the voluntary temporary measures Visa and Mastercard put in place at the minister's request. The minister and the government gleefully tooted their own horms, claiming they had won.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681846">They won all right, but only at the rhetoric game. All morning, they have been saying that they are protecting SMEs. However, these are temporary measures. What is more, businesses that rely heavily on credit card payments are excluded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681847">As I was saying, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>, who was the industry critic at the time, and I received a request late last summer that we immediately forwarded to the minister. It came from the Quebec Food Retailers Association. Founded in 1955, this association represents food retailers who support the development of the food industry. It reiterates exactly what I am saying, that in the 2021-22 federal budget, the government had promised to “[l]ower the average overall cost of interchange fees for merchants” and “[e]nsure that small businesses benefit from pricing that is similar to large businesses”, such as Walmart. This is what the association says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681848">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Unfortunately, the agreement that followed between the government and credit card issuers states that a merchant must have an annual Visa sales volume of $300,000 and an annual Mastercard sales volume of $175,000 to benefit from reduced rates, but this excludes almost every food retailer.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681849">The agreement is therefore useless. It does not reduce the price of groceries, which are a necessity. The association notes that its members have low profit margins, and it gives an example. I mentioned Australia, which has capped fees at 0.5%. Grocery stores there say they pay $155,000 per year on average in interchange fees to credit card companies, while a similar grocery store in Europe only pays $30,000, five times less. This $120,000 per grocery store could help lower the price of groceries, but the credit card duopoly keeps it for itself. Why? It is because these two companies are taking advantage of their dominant position and the government is refusing to act on the root cause, which is obviously unacceptable, hence the committee's report and our interventions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681850">When my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean presented his bill, we immediately received calls from the credit card companies saying that we did not know what we were talking about and that we were threatening the economy, the environment and, at the very least, the solar system, if not our galaxy, the Milky Way. Obviously, it is in these companies' interest to hire lobbyists to tell us not to do that. The thought that we could cut their profit margins, their revenues, by a third makes them nervous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681851">We know that they put a lot of pressure on the government, and we know that the government has given in to their demands. Rather than defending consumers and merchants, it decided to listen to the duopoly, which is highly organized and which told the government that it must not do that. I do not know whether the government believed that it would threaten the galactic balance of the Milky Way, but, in any case, it gave in. It asked the companies to submit a proposal, since it only wanted to save face. This way, everyone saves face, merchants pay, consumers pay, and groceries are more expensive. The government has leverage it could use to intervene, but it will not do it, and that is obviously unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681852">I have a few more points to raise. The number of credit card transactions is growing. As we know, the pandemic and the lockdown changed the way we consume. People are buying more online. Even groceries can be bought online now, and more and more people are doing it. The habit stuck, and now more and more purchases are being made online. According to the most recent figures, in 2022, there was a 17.5% increase in Canada, and an even larger increase in Quebec, 18.4%. Clearly, this is a problem that is getting worse. We are therefore joining the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology in asking the government to intervene. We are asking the government to intervene for the sake of grocery stores and retailers like convenience stores and gas stations, but it is not doing anything. My colleages can rest assured that the Bloc will continue to press this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681853">I would like to point out an interesting detail to my colleagues. Quebec has its Consumer Protection Act, but the rest of Canada does not have such a law. In the rest of Canada, when someone goes to the grocery store and pays with their credit card, the merchant can charge the customer, the consumer, the interchange fees. There is a line on the receipt indicating that the credit card fee is $2, for example. That is the way it is. In Quebec, the law prohibits businesses from passing those fees on to the consumer. The cost of these interchange fees is passed on to all consumers, even if the customer pays with cash, a debit card or a cheque. I do not know anyone still uses cheques. It was very common in Europe. People used to go to the grocery store and pay by cheque. In Quebec, the cost of interchange fees is spread out and passed on to all consumers. The government could intervene and do what Australia did. It could also set rates similar to those in the European Union. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve is looking into this right now. At the very least, this would reduce the cost of groceries and convenience store purchases by about one percentage point. In the current situation, that is not insignificant.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681854">I would also like to remind members of the technical details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681855">Visa and Mastercard are two U.S.-based multinational financial services companies. Originally, they were part of a co-operative of financial institutions. Visa and Mastercard became full-fledged companies in 2008 and 2006 respectively. These companies do not offer credit. They are tech companies that use transaction networks to act as intermediaries between financial institutions, merchants and customers. I could go into a lot more detail on this. I would remind members that these companies make a lot of profit because they are a duopoly, so they are able to make a lot of money on the market. What we are asking and what the committee is asking is for this to be regulated. We do not want rhetoric and mini-measures that will allow the government to save face. We want to see real changes to the situation, particularly when it comes to grocery prices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681864">I have a specific question for my colleague. The Interac situation evolved from the banks' coming together in the 1980s, which was 40 years ago. What innovation has really taken place since that time that would justify continuing to have incredible costs that are disproportionate to those in other countries? What innovation has taken place since the system was instituted and put on consumers? There has been no benefit to the consumer under it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681865">Madam Speaker, we can see how it has evolved over time. If we asked the credit card companies that question, they will say all sorts of things. They will say that everything is serious and that nothing must change. However, when we consider how the situation has evolved over time and compare ourselves to other countries, as the member pointed out, there is no rationale for this. The rationale, as we learned in economics 101, is that the credit card companies control the market via a duopoly, an oligopoly, a quasi-duopoly. This allows them to pad their bottom line a lot more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681866">The government has the power to step in and change that. I would remind the House that former Liberal MP Linda Lapointe introduced a bill on this subject.

              <ParaText id="8681870">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and friend, the member for Shefford, for her question. SMEs and merchants in Shefford, and in the rest of Quebec and Canada, are struggling with these excessive fees made possible by the credit card duopoly. These companies are using their power to rake in more money that does not end up back in merchants' or consumers' pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681871">The government's role is to notice this and take action, like Australia did with a law that caps the fees at 0.5%. Here, the fees are three times higher. If the government were willing to stand up to the duopoly and side with businesses and consumers instead, that would means 1% of sales volume that could produce a profit or help reduce the bill. That would make all the difference for retailers that rely on high sales volumes with very low profit margins. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681872">The government could do something. The minister told us that she would take measures in her 2022 budget. However, she merely outlined some voluntary half measures for the credit card companies to take, and those half measures do not apply to these businesses. That is deplorable. It is clear whose side this government is on. It is on the side of Visa and Mastercard, not on the side of grocery stores and consumers.</ParaText>

They are three times higher on average than in Australia and much higher than in the European Union. That needs to change. We are raising the alarm. Furthermore, my colleague from Mirabel and his colleagues on the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology are obviously free to study whatever topics they want.

I am a bit perplexed, though, because today at committee, the Liberals attacked me when I was questioning issues related to information being shared.

              <ParaText id="8681892">When we look at how much money there was in the system put in place then versus the so-called innovation now, what have we really gotten out of that? We can look at the fees. I am going to read a few of them out, and members will see why regulation is necessary. Sometimes the lack of competition does not even have to be done by collusion. It can be done basically by consent and by not competing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681893">Here are the general sending fees for up to $100: RBC, one dollar to $1.50 a charge; TD Bank, one dollar to $1.50 a charge; BMO, one dollar to $1.50 a charge; CIBC, one dollar to $1.50 a charge; Scotiabank, one dollar to $1.50 a charge; and the National Bank of Canada, one dollar to $1.50 a charge. Basically, everybody in the sandbox is using the same fee and implementation, and nobody is breaking out of that despite the fact that the technology and the way it works are 40 years old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681894">On top of that, there is what we did during the pandemic. That is part of what has been taking place at the industry committee with regard to the issues at stake. It is why I believe strongly in regulation, especially of interest rates. Because of the pandemic, of automation and of the use of systems in place for points cards, we are transitioning people into new purchasing habits at different interest rates that are harmful to them. If someone has a mortgage, they have a lower interest rate right now. It is one of the better borrowing practices, generally speaking. Hopefully rates will continue to go down, but the interest rate there is just above or below the Bank of Canada rate depending on the financial institution. If someone wants to get a line of credit, it bubbles a bit higher than that, but it is still in that range. As for students loans, as New Democrats, we believe there should not be interest on student loans, but sadly there is. I paid my student loan at 17% at one point. That policy was horrible back in the 1990s. At any rate, students still have a better rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681895">What we have been doing is transitioning people into purchasing the food and basics they need on credit cards that have 20% to 30% interest rates. Some are lower, but someone has to have a decent line of credit beforehand, has to pay for the card with a fee or has to be very affluent. Most people are stuck at around a 20% rate for credit cards. What is happening, as we have heard in testimony, is that charges on basics related to living have grown exponentially since the pandemic. That means people are putting groceries on credit, for example, just to get by, with a potential charge of 20%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681896"> We have also heard there is more of a culture of buy now, pay later, with systems in place. They are notoriously part of the furniture industry, which has that type of philosophy. They upsell, making sure people purchase certain amounts and sometimes more. Then if they do not pay by the end of the year or whenever the contract is up, rates could be up to 30%, even higher sometimes. In the meantime, people may lose their job, a loved one may get sick or they may get sick, and they cannot afford the payments anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681897">This motion brings to light the issue of financial management systems, their wealth, their activity in the Canadian economy and what they are really worth. One of the more interesting aspects that we learned is that banks are not even reporting their profit margins on credit cards, borrowing and lending, how much they are making. That is a policy that has been put in place. From a regulatory standpoint, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> could change it today and require reporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681898">Coincidentally, as I mentioned, all the different banks have the same policy that they do not report, because if they do not have to do it, they will not do it. At the same time, we do not know how much we are subsidizing their profit margins, even though we know for a fact that despite the costs of running the credit card system, their profits have skyrocketed, especially because we used public policies in this chamber to backstop the banks during the pandemic and before that when the financial system collapsed. We did all those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681899"> Maybe the Liberals are a bit shy on this because when I was here back in the day, John Manley tried to make our banks like the American banks. I will give the Bloc Québécois credit because the New Democrats and the Bloc were the only ones who fought off the nonsense of wanting to Americanize our banks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681900">We saw what took place with regard to the institutions in the U.S. I have all the presentation decks from every single year, which said that Canada's banks have to become like the American banks, that they cannot survive here anymore and that they ought to make sure they are different. They said many different things. I still have all the presentations they made to me during all those years. It was John Manley who tried to move the system to Canada, but we defeated them and stopped them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681901">I want to pay special tribute to Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the former New Democrat from Winnipeg, who fought tooth and nail on the issue constantly to stop Americanization from happening. Thank goodness we had that. It was funny because the banks came back later and said they survived the financial issues of the United States because they were different. They basically took credit for the fact that they lost their fight to become Americanized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681902">At any rate, let us go back to the particular issue at hand, especially coming from an economy like Windsor's, when we see value out of production. Workers have often said that our production value needs to keep going up and up in order for us to compete. We have to look at our financial measurement matters. Are they really contributing to the Canadian economy or are they a drag on the Canadian economy?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681903">Owners of some of the small businesses like convenience stores, retailers and all those different elements will tell us that the fees they have been paying are significant. On top of that, the reduction of fees, which is still modest compared to what is in Australia and the European Union and elsewhere, may not have been passed on; we have heard that from Stripe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681904"> We have heard specific testimony, and it was really kind of shocking that Stripe basically did not care what Canada did; it was not going to pass on the savings it had. Where are the savings going to go? They are going to go internationally to the people who actually have investment in the systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681905">The Liberals do not get credit for what they believe they should get by lowering the fees, because it has been exposed that what they have requested is very modest compared to what is taking place in other parts of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681906">Here we are, deciding what to do next with regard to the issue. I have done a lot of work on frauds, rip-offs and all the different stuff that can take place, especially on our phones. In industry committee, one of the things I was proud of was getting a study on fraud. We have seen, on our phone, how many times we get a text message or something to bait us into losing some of our money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681907">As I point out all the time, we pay for our phone or device. We also pay for the services and for all the maintenance on it. On top of getting charged for all of that, we get abused as a customer through fraud. It is the same thing with the fees that are being charged. We pay for our phone, for the data and for the system. We do all those things and we do the work, and the banks still get the same amount in fees, or more. We do not see somebody at the counter anymore; there is no job created for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681908">We will do more transactions, so we should actually have a reduction in fees. Ironically, when we look at the charts provided by the banks, the only argument economically has always been that when we buy more, we should pay less; however, when it comes to Interac fees and banking fees, the more we transfer means the more we pay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681909">I do not know what the difference is in terms of the financial cost to an institution specifically related to electronically moving money. What is the difference whether it is one dollar, five dollars, $10, $1,000 or $3,000? I do not know, but apparently it requires more labour, or different labour, for those different amounts, because the fees are reflected basically in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681910">I do not understand that, and the institutions have never been able to explain it. It just another way of gouging, in my opinion. Again, when it is expanded exponentially, it is really a cost on the whole economic system. Some of the best fraud cases have been perpetrated by some of the people who work at financial institutions or other places; they nip a couple of cents off purchases or transactions, so nobody really notices.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681911">People should always check their grocery store receipts, and some places are trying to move to a system where customers do not even get a receipt anymore. Some groceries are taxed and some are not; it is dependent upon the type of product and the quantity of the product. For example, with granola bars, if there are five in a box they are taxed, but if there are six in a box they are not taxed. Retailers market and change their practices so they can get further profits out of the system. People should always get their receipts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681912">The point I was trying to make is that some of the biggest fraud cases involve skimming just a bit so it is not noticed, but the volume is so high that at the end of the day, the wealth is supersignificant. That has happened many times, and it is the same thing with some of the fees with credit cards, Interac and all the different elements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681913">I will use bank machines as an example. It costs three dollars to use a different bank than one's own, and people put up with that fee in the moment. However, when we start adding up the fees, and let us say we are doing this once a month or however often it might be, it becomes very significant in the Canadian economy. If it is being done collectively across the board, it becomes a drain on the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681914">I come from a manufacturing town, and we were told so many times that the future of this country was through getting rid of manufacturing, that globalization was the end of it and that third world countries and others would do the manufacturing. We saw how it worked out in the pandemic, and it was not true. In fact, reshoring is taking place across North America. We have to compete with the U.S. on that, and we are now doing massive subsidization to corporations to bring them back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681915">New Democrats fought it at that time and said it was wrong, because the promise was that financial institutions and the service industry were going to rescue all employment. It did not happen. There was some growth in the sector that took place, but it was not reflected in the Canadian economy in employment and good jobs. Also, now there is a decline of some of the institutions, through automation and other things that went through, and we are now without the jobs and the services but are still paying some of the highest fees out there. Why is it? How good is that for the economy? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681916">I would rather have small and medium-sized businesses getting a break on fees through regulation, which is something we can control right now, than have some trickle-down economic theory that is supposed to give them maybe a tax reduction that they may not see and that depends upon how much they have coming in through their business model, in terms of profit margins and so forth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681917">What we can do by regulating the fees lower right now and ensuring that they are passed on is to ensure that they go to consumers right away; that they are taken out of the multinational institutions, many of which pay more taxes across the planet than here in Canada; and that the small and medium-sized businesses get the money they need and deserve. More importantly, we need to ensure that the fees become more reflective of the service and the value of what they should be paying for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681918"> I go back to that because transaction fees are out of whack with the cost of doing transactions. Nobody should be gouged through fraud by a government being neglectful on regulatory powers, just like there should not be fraud through the abuse of someone trying to do a criminal activity against them. We can control that in the House, so I appreciate the committee and the work we have been doing trying to get fees down, even with the cost of groceries, expenses and all the different things affecting Canadians right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681919"> We do not have to wait for a budget to adjust some of these things, and we do not have to wait for an announcement or a private member's bill; they can be done immediately by the minister, with the regulatory powers the minister has. The break can be passed on right away, which can also filter into the Canadian economy to create more wealth, more activity, more investment and more jobs, and better reflect the value of financial institutions and the contribution they make for productivity in the Canadian ecosystem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681920">Right now, financial institutions have been protected a number of different times. As I mentioned, before the pandemic, before the financial crisis, significant government revenues went to stabilize the banks and the financial sector, including the provision of loan guarantees and other activities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681921">During COVID we allowed the financial institutions to continue their practices as we shifted the economy, with lockdowns and other types of restrictions that required the increased use of their systems This was not through competition or by use of the money we had there, but by moving people, with intervention from the government, into a system that allows more abuse and dominance with respect to interest rates, costs and services, not from innovation in the market but by public policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681922">That is why it is warranted, as New Democrats argue, that public policy should be used to rein in some fairness for consumers right now. We did our part. Canadians did their part. They put their taxpayer money behind the banks, the loans and the things they had before to stabilize different things. They got moved into having to borrow and pay for certain things with higher interest rates and charges because of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681923">Canadians never got anything back from doing that. In fact costs have gone up, as has inflation. On top of that, new taxation models have been introduced to consumers with respect to tipping, which is coming on taxes and not just on the goods and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681924">For those reasons, we support continuing the work of the committee. Again, we implore that we do not need legislation or a private member's bill; we need the Liberals to act where they should have acted before and rein in some fairness for Canadian consumers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681928">Madam Speaker, the question from the parliamentary secretary is one that does not get a lot of coverage and has not been talked about as much. Part of the reason is that credit unions are owned by the people in the community who are the users. The profits go back to them, so they can, yes, provide some innovation. Sometimes their margins are very close to those of the banks. One could argue that there could be more competition there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681929">At the end of the day, the real benefit is the fact that the people who are part of a credit union are also shareholders; that is the difference. Banks have private shareholders who could be based in different places all over the planet, and not everybody can be part of that by buying stock options and so forth, whereas when people join a credit union, they become a member and contribute to their own wealth through the different services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681938">Madam Speaker, under the current model, banks do not have to pass on the savings right now. Interestingly enough, in testimony today, I asked about that. One of the officials talked about how our loan systems were going to be reduced, with respect to predatory financing, to 35% maximum. It is at 60% right now. I still could not get a proper answer with regard to what the penalties would be and the different issues that would take place if someone broke that law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681939">Ironically, the Government of Canada borrows around the Bank of Canada rate, but Canadians have to pay interest rates of up to 35%. With respect to fairness, how does that make sense? The government can borrow at a rate that is very low and is very much structured. Meanwhile rates are up to 35%, and on top of that, we still do not know the penalties and so forth.</ParaText>

My former colleague, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, did a lot of work on this on payday loans, and this is a good example. Even if people have a government cheque that is guaranteed, they can get be gouged for cashing it, yet there really is no risk whatsoever. Many banks moved away from cashing cheques without exponential fees, or they opened the system to have payday loans come in. That is a loss for the most vulnerable, often the most poor, and also for people who need money at a very delicate time in their lives for one reason or another.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8681952">Mr. Speaker, this is a really important conversation and debate. Our government is committed to addressing the cost of living, helping out small and medium-sized businesses and also protecting consumers. This is something about which the Liberals, residents of my riding, Pierrefonds—Dollard, and, I am sure, all parliamentarians care deeply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681953">I would like tell the story of a small business owner I visited just two weeks ago in my riding of Pierrefonds—Dollard. Her name is Paola and she works really hard each and every week, six days a week. She owns a small business called Tazza di Mattina, which has coffee, coffee machines and repairs coffee machines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681954"> I had an important conversation with her about a government program that is related to leaning on the credit card industry to ensure the costs that owners of small and medium business have to bear in consumer transactions are reduced. I let her know that Visa and Mastercard fees for small businesses would be reduced as of October 19. We know that a reduction of credit card fees will mean better prices for consumers and that fee increases are not passed on to them. The government's policy to protect and defend small businesses is really impactful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681955">I grew up in a household that lived, survived and had everything we needed because of a small-business owner, my dad. My dad and mom brought a family of six into this world. Our family lived off a small business, so I personally know the realities of what it means for a family to have everything its needs when things might be tight. That is the reality of many Canadians. I appreciate and empathize with Canadians. In general, they feel squeezed. That is why our government is meeting the moment at each and every step. With respect to the credit cards and small and medium-sized businesses, that is one key thing we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681956"> A second key thing is a code of conduct related to the credit card industry to protect one million businesses. That will also help to meet the moment. We are also leaning on the banking industry so that we ensure individuals have tailored mortgage relief available to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681957">I am sharing my time, Madam Speaker, with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681958">Another key aspect of meeting the moment is expanding low-cost accounts and also no-cost options when Canadians are opening bank accounts. The government is also lowering NSF fees, which is critical. Once in a while, some of us have had a bounced cheque. It used to happen to me as a student. Those fees of $25, or however much they cost today, hit hard, especially if someone has a lean income. Those things matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681959">Today, being in the Commons with the governing party, I oftentimes think about my life as a student, a young person, and in my career. I think about what those fees meant and how the measures we are implementing today matter for Canadians and small businesses. We are doing a lot within our government to meet the moment and address the cost of living. Yes, costs did rise during the pandemic. We all went to the grocery stores. We saw the increase in price of fruits and vegetables, and that hit us, without question.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8681960"> Thankfully, since then, inflation has come under control and the Bank of Canada has reduced interest rates. Things are easier for people who are renewing mortgages and for those who are entering the housing market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681961"> Our government has also had some key accomplishments, such as child care, which is a key win of our government. It allows mothers who choose to work to enter the workforce and to know that their children will receive quality care. I will just share about my own family background again. I was raised by my mother at home, as were my five younger siblings. There was a choice to do that as a household. I know that not all Canadian households can make that choice. Some families need child care in order to survive. That is why our initiative, to make child care affordable and to expand that across the country, is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681962"> Dental care is a recent initiative of our government. That is also really important. In our entourage, our families and our friendship circles, we all know seniors, persons with disabilities or young people who have benefited. Soon, all Canadians will be benefiting from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681963"> If we just think about these programs for a moment, they are meeting the moment. They are helping to address the cost of living and the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681964"> To that, I will add pharmacare. I had a conversation with a gentleman about three months ago, while driving between Montreal and Ottawa. He told me how important diabetes medication at no cost is to him, how much he relies on that medication, how it had put a big hole his wallet, and how he is really grateful for us, as a government and as a country, for doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681965"> As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities, I see the disability benefit as novel and super impactful. It will help alleviate the situation in which persons with disabilities of working age with modest income find themselves today. It will not solve everything, but it is a clear and firm step in the right direction. This benefit is being introduced and will be in effect this summer. It is being done in addition to existing provincial benefits that people receive. It is a proud moment for our country. As a member of the governing party, I am really happy that we are doing this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681966"> I go back to the idea of meeting Paola in her small business, and the initiatives that our government has done and continues to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681967"> At some point in the future, Canadians will be making a choice about who they want to see governing our country. It is really important for Canadians to reflect upon the policies and programs that we as a Liberal government have implemented from child care, dental care, pharmacare and the disability benefit, which will be implemented this summer, with money in people's pockets, to the measures I mentioned with respect to small businesses, where 27% of credit card fees will be reduced for small and medium-sized businesses. Those things are critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681968"> What I would say is that those programs and initiatives, and that sort of perspective of meeting the moment, will be taken away if it is not our Liberal government here in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681969">That is something I would like to leave with viewers who are watching. I would like Canadians to just hold that idea, and ask whether we want these programs to continue into the future. I am sure we do. Do we want everyone to be uplifted? I am sure that we all agree to that. Let us continue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8681985">Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting process over the last number of weeks. For those who are trying to follow what is taking place, allow me to attempt to summarize it. What they are really witnessing is what I would suggest is a multi-million dollar political game that is being led by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> because he has determined that it is in his self-interest and the interests of the Conservative Party of Canada to continue playing this silly, expensive game at a substantial cost. As opposed to participating in this filibuster, what we are actually witnessing is an opposition party that, I would ultimately argue, is in contempt, or nearing contempt, of the House of Commons today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681986"> It should not surprise people because the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was the parliamentary secretary to former prime minister Stephen Harper, who was held in contempt of Parliament, the first prime minister in the history of the Commonwealth and the only one to this very day to have been held in contempt. It speaks volumes, in terms of the character and the personality of the leader of the Conservative Party today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681987">Let us look at what the Conservatives are doing, and I do not say it lightly. In fact, I have recommended that every member of the Conservative caucus read the Hill Times story that was published on October 31. It was written by Steven Chaplin.

              <ParaText id="8681993"> The <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">deputy House leader</Affiliation>, earlier today, talked about legislation.

Also, we have Bill <Document DbId="12062671" Type="3">C-33</Document>, on the rail and marine safety issue, which is talking about economic supply lines. If we want to talk about improving the economy, this is one of the things that we should be discussing. My colleague emphasized Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act. We can think of pictures being posted on the Internet without consent from individuals over 18, as well as the harm that is being caused to children. These are the types of substantial issues that we should be talking about and voting on to see them go to committee, but instead, we are playing this game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681995"> Fast-forward to today, when we have a motion about banking and banking fees. I can assure members that banking fees are a very serious issue. My constituents are concerned about banking fees, whether they are for using an ATM machine or the monthly charges. There is also the interest that is applied in many different ways. There is a litany of issues with banking fees. I would love the opportunity to talk for 20-plus minutes on that issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681996">The problem is that this feeds into what the Conservatives are wanting us to do. The Conservatives, and this is coming from the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative</Affiliation>'s office, are not only saying that they want to take control of what is taking place on the floor of the House of Commons, but also wanting to start dipping more and more into instructing standing committees on what they should be doing. They have the Bloc completely fooled on this. It will be interesting to see who votes in favour of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681997">Members can think about this: The Conservatives, not once but twice, as Mark Carney was brought up late last week, have brought in an amendment to a concurrence motion to send the report back to committee for it to be further studied while calling for certain witnesses, and they have each had a deadline to get back to the House. However, these standing committees can determine their own agendas and who they want to call before them. They do not have to be instructed by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> on what they should be doing. This is a very disturbing pattern, which we have now seen with two concurrence motions that were brought forward by the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681998">I would argue that, ultimately, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is not only trying to dictate what we can and cannot talk about on the floor of the House of Commons, but also starting to reach into the different standing committees. He could have just advised, and said, “Well, look, send this back to the committee”. We could also do what we usually do, which is to vote concurrence on a report, so it would go on its way, and just allow the standing committee to do what it wants. However, there is an agenda there. It is a very selfish agenda that is being driven by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative House leadership team, at a substantial cost. As I said, it is a multi-million dollar game that is being played.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8681999">The Conservative leader needs to start putting the interests of Canadians ahead of his own self-serving interests and the interests of the Conservative Party. There is a lot more work that we can be doing on the floor of the House of Commons. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682046">Madam Speaker, what we have here, besides interruptions, is the issue that the Liberals do not want to talk about. That is why they are not doing anything about the oligopolistic economy, which includes the fees that Canadians pay for their banking services and, in particular, the fees around a company called Interac. It is on the back of our cards. Interac is an association, but it is basically owned by the four big banks: RBC, CIBC, Scotiabank and TD. Then there is a fifth one, Desjardins. They own it, and they charge a fee any time we move money around. They do about 19 million transactions a day in Canada, but one issue is moving our own money to somebody else through an e-transfer. I am sure members will be shocked to learn that the two companies that chair the board of Interac, which are RBC and TD, get a preferential rate over all other financial services companies. They only charge themselves six cents; they charge smaller and smaller financial institutions, particularly those that are not part of the Interac board, almost 44¢ to 46¢ per transaction. That is huge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682047">I understand that there is a $1.50 charge on each end on that. Technically, that is a three-dollar charge. If someone does not keep a minimum balance in their account, they get a three-dollar charge from the banks. RBC, TD and the big guys are only paying six cents for that transaction, so they are making a 98% gross margin. If there is a small credit union that is not part of the government-protected oligopoly of Interac, which basically has a complete monopoly on the movement of money in Canada, then it is out of luck. It must pay 44¢ to 46¢ to the big banks that own Interac for this service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682048">That is why we are here. It is because we had witnesses in committee who refused to table any of their fee structures, even though they are a protected government business. We also had witnesses who came before the committee in the credit card study on the issue of what is called the “interchange fee”. The government made a big announcement that it is reducing the fees that small businesses have to pay to credit card companies for every transaction. It is usually a per cent, somewhere between 1% and 2.9% of the transaction, if someone pays with their credit card, that a small business has to pay to the big banks and the Visa card companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682049">There are companies that are the plumber of the system that do that, and one of them is called Stripe. Another one is called Moneris; some may have heard of it. Moneris agreed to the voluntary fee cut that the government asked for, but Stripe decided that it was not going to. Its representatives said that it is because they are being charged a new GST fee and cannot afford it. It is actually a GST fee that they were paying all along, but it was delayed for 12 months because of a court action. However, Stripe representatives used that as an excuse, either because they are greedy or because they are just not as efficient as the other providers of that service. We will be the judge of which one it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682050">An interesting thing is that a person on the board of Stripe, which is one of the biggest companies in the world at doing this, is Mark Carney, the special adviser to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the economy. He is the boss above the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and he is the next Liberal leader. This is the same fellow who is on the board of a company called Brookfield; the entire company has just decided to move from Toronto to New York to avoid paying Canadian taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682051">Mr. Carney preaches that Canadians should pay more for everything with a carbon tax; carbon tax Carney loves the carbon tax and thinks it should be 61¢ a litre. At the same time, he moves all his business interests to the U.S. and avoids the things that the Department of Finance is trying to do. This is the character of an individual who supposedly aspires to be Prime Minister of Canada. However, he thinks it is better for the companies that he sits on the boards of to dodge Canadian taxes and move to the U.S., where they can pay lower taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682052"> I do not know why carbon tax Carney wants to help the newly elected President Trump by moving his head office to New York. Apparently, he admires him more than he admires the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, or he would not be doing this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682053">As such, why is it that the Liberals continue to filibuster in committee to stop these examinations from happening? The <Affiliation DbId="311629" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry</Affiliation> has done nothing but filibuster every time we bring up a motion to bring carbon tax Carney, disclose the financials of Mastercard or disclose the financials of Stripe, which carbon tax Carney is on the board of. The parliamentary secretary does not have the guts to vote against it. He just keeps talking and talking, stopping us from getting to a vote. That is the reason we are in this situation in the House, and we have to use the power of the majority to try to get that study done. It is because the parliamentary secretary is too afraid of having this debate in committee.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682054"> It makes me wonder what that individual is trying to cover up for the government by preventing these studies from happening. We had one of the banking executives from RBC, who is co-chair of Interac and sits on their board, before committee. One of our members asked him a number of times if he knew the fees of the company he is on the board of, where he represents his bank. His bank owns this company, which is called Interac. He said he does not know the fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682055">I have served on private boards and Crown boards. I always knew what the fees were of the businesses I was on the board of. It defied believability that this senior banking executive in Canada would not even know the fees he charges or gets charged on Interac. This is the kind of obfuscation we see happening on this credit card study, and that has prompted this motion. In fact, all the banking heads were before the committee, and we told them we did not want them to betray their confidential commercial stuff, but they all judge themselves publicly on something called “return on equity”. That is how much profit a year the company makes per share that shareholders own. The companies overall, the banks overall, have anywhere from a 10% to 15% return on equity. This means that, for a $10 share, they make $1 to $1.50 in profit a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682056">We asked them to share what their credit card business is as a percentage, not the overall revenue numbers or their expenses, as they do on their overall business. What do they make in their credit card business? They said it is all confidential. Of course it is confidential. Some may know that I used to work for a bank at one time, a long time ago. I had hair then. When I worked for the bank on Bay Street, it had a return on equity of 52%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682057">Some might call that loansharking, but that is the level of return they get. That is why they do not want to do it. That is why the government does not want to do it. We had finance officials in industry committee this morning. We asked them if they knew those numbers on their credit card business. They said they never asked. We had the senior finance officials in committee this morning and asked if they ever looked at the anti-competitive pricing of Interac and what they do between the owners of RBC, TD, Scotiabank and CIBC, and what they give themselves as a cut rate versus all the other financial institutions. They said they have never looked at it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682058">I asked if the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> cares about competitive behaviour in the industry she regulates. They said they do not look at it. That it is somebody else's job; it is the Competition Bureau's job. It is not their job to look at policy and decide whether the industry they regulate is competitive. I asked the same question about these great interchange fees and carbon tax Carney's company, Stripe, which is refusing to abide by the Minister of Finance's order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682059">I asked if they look at anti-competitive behaviour on the interchange fees. They said it is not their job. They are just the government; there is nothing to see here. They are just the Department of Finance and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>; they are not concerned with competition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682060">That is the reason we have an oligopolistic economy. We have a Minister of Finance, a Liberal government and a Department of Finance that do not care about the fact that we have an oligopolistic cellphone industry. We have a government that does not care about the fact that we have monopolies in banking, telecommunications and airlines.</ParaText>

Petitioners observe that Eritrea has been ruled by an authoritarian, brutal dictator under a totalitarian system for the last 30 years with no constitution, no elections, no parliament, no freedom of the press, and no freedom of movement and association. It has been called the North Korea of Africa. Many Eritreans have been forced to flee and have sought asylum in various places.

Petitioners therefore call on the House and the government to strengthen engagement with Eritrean political and human rights activists and pro-democracy groups, to take a stronger role opposing the Eritrean government's human rights abuses and support for Russia's neocolonial agenda in Africa. Petitioners also want to see additional steps to ensure that agents of the Eritrean government are not able to come to Canada and engage in political interference here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682088">Petitioners are also calling for the release of a number of political prisoners in Eritrea, including Swedish Eritrean journalist Dawit Isaak and 11 imprisoned Eritrean parliamentarians.

I spent 16 years working for important non-profit organizations that were dedicated to helping people, including the ALS Society of Manitoba, the Kidney Foundation and the Children's Wish Foundation, which is now known as Make-A-Wish. I also worked for a local community centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682096"> Like many Canadians, I had two jobs to support my family. For the last four years, I worked as the executive director for the local business improvement zone, helping small and medium-sized businesses navigate a global pandemic while supporting and connecting with local social services groups. Social services groups are the backbone of community. They provide services to our neighbours where the government has fallen short. We are talking about local food banks, veterans services, youth programs and so much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682097"> I recognize that my experience brings a unique perspective in my new role. There are many community members who have dedicated their time and energy to making things happen in my neighbourhood, and I am just one of them. I do, however, understand, with every fibre of my being, the struggles and preoccupations my constituents face every day. I promised them that as the new member of Parliament for Elmwood—Transcona, I will continue to advocate for my community and every member in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682098"> As for today's topic, the question of privilege, we have been debating this since I arrived over a month ago. Nothing in the government has moved forward, and we are wasting Canadians' time and money. For months, I knocked on doors, I visited community members, and I listened to their concerns. Over and over, the same things came up, including the exasperating cost of groceries. People in my riding have been forced to choose between groceries and their prescriptions. A few short years ago, Canadians could get a full cart of groceries for $100, and now they are lucky if they walk away with two small bags. Families need relief. We need action from the government now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682099">My local food banks, like many across the country, are seeing a record number of people accessing them. In some cases, these are families who have two incomes, people who have never accessed food banks before. I even know of one woman who just last year donated to the food bank and this year is accessing it. Again, families need relief. We need to see action today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682100"> Constituents spoke a lot about the lack of affordable housing. Every month in Winnipeg, there are fewer affordable places for people to live. The cost of rent goes up, and there is no increase in income. Although I appreciate the government's push for more housing, I wonder what percentage will actually be affordable housing. We do not need more $800,000 homes. In my riding, we need homes that families can afford, and $800,000 homes are not it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682101"> I was fortunate enough, as a single mom, to be able to buy my first home at 24. I was able to provide a home for my son, so he had a place to call his own. Now as my son enters adulthood and has a good trades job, he cannot see that possibility in this economy. We need to stop greedy landlords. We need to ensure builders are required to build more affordable homes in our communities, homes that the next generation can afford to raise their families in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682102"> Rounding out the top three issues is the current state of the health care system in the riding and across the country. Manitobans are currently looking at a backlog of over 40,000 surgeries. We are also known across the country for having the longest wait times in our emergency rooms. What is the government doing to help Canadians access the health care they need and deserve? Manitobans saw the cutting and gutting of our health care system under the previous provincial Conservative government, which cut 3,500 health care workers and closed a very important emergency room in my riding.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682103"> Our current NDP government in Manitoba is working extra hard to try to reopen those spaces, hire back those qualified staff and manage the backlog, but we need to remember that the quick cuts to save a buck today will have long-lasting effects on our country. We need to stop filibustering. We need to be making things happen for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682104">The reason I agreed to run in the by-election was to continue the amazing work for which the NDP has worked so hard. Voters know that the New Democrats dragged the Liberal government to the table to get things done. We forced it to deliver on valuable things that the families of Elmwood—Transcona need, things like the national dental care program for seniors and children. We saw this time and again, and yet it is a flawed program under the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682105">We also saw free birth control being provided to over nine million Canadians and diabetes medications for over four million Canadians, yet there are still many drugs that the Liberals could add to the pharmacare program to help Canadians. The New Democrats want to see a head-to-toe health care system that can help everyone in every way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682106"> We have seen the creation of a national program to provide meals for children in schools so that they can focus and learn, and to give parents a break, yet the Liberals are still falling short, as many schools in Manitoba, which started months ago, still are not seeing meals being served. We need to invest more. We need to continue to do things like this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682107">The New Democrats are dedicated to helping improve the lives of Canadian families and the Liberal government is still falling short. We need to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682108"> In my community, we know the cost of the Conservatives. Manitoba saw the cost to social services and community groups when they were cut. We saw the cutting and gutting of our health care system. We saw the short-sighted cuts and we saw how it affected us daily. We need to continue to fight for Canadians because they continue to struggle. Our youth continue to struggle. Our seniors continue to struggle. We need to stop with the pathetic slogans and the runaround answers. We need to deliver more for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682109"> I am also keenly aware that I am following in the heels of a great NDP MP. In every corner of Elmwood—Transcona, Winnipeggers still speak fondly of the late great Bill Blaikie. It is not in my speech, but I am going to tell members that he honoured my dad on April 16, 2008, in the House of Commons after he passed away. I will fondly remember him for that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682110">Mr. Blaikie was and will continue to be an inspiration to many. His exemplary legacy casts a long shadow on those who follow. I endeavour to work as hard and as effectively as he did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682111"> I would also be remiss if I did not pay tribute to another great Blaikie, my predecessor Daniel Blaikie, who was as worthy a successor as his father. He was a brilliant, articulate and effective member for Elmwood—Transcona. I thank him for his service in this chamber</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682112">Taking my place in the chamber is a true honour, an honour I do not take for granted. I would like to thank the volunteers and voters for getting me here. I look forward to many other opportunities where I can bring a voice to my constituents in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682113"> I conclude my speech with a simple promise. I will always work as hard as I can to advocate on behalf of my constituents, and I thank my colleagues for accommodating me today.</ParaText>

T1D is a chronic autoimmune disease that prevents the body from producing insulin. Cailey was diagnosed just after her first birthday. Over the years we have witnessed remarkable advancements in treatment. In our meeting, two youth advocates, Sophia and Bennett, shared the daily struggles of managing blood sugar and what a cure would mean for them.

Today, Canadian researchers are on the verge of another breakthrough, one that could change the future for the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who currently live with T1D. Insulin was discovered here in Canada, and I have no doubt that our brightest minds will continue to lead the way toward finding a cure. Thankfully, the future is hopeful for all those affected by type 1 diabetes.</ParaText>

Not only is she determined and hopeful for our future, but her hard work and passion for her province and community inspire us all. This is a collaborative moment that everyone in our province can bask in and be a part of, something truly unforgettable. As a determined leader and a fantastic mother, she understands the struggles and needs of families across the province.</ParaText>

This railway was essential to Canada's Confederation, ensuring British Columbia's entry and connecting our nation from coast to coast. This date marks the completion of the railway in 1885, a feat that would have been impossible without the efforts of over 17,000 Chinese workers who faced gruelling conditions, low wages and unfair treatment, risking and giving their lives to bring this national vision to life. Their contributions, often overlooked, are a cornerstone of our shared history.</ParaText>

The more we look, the more links we are finding between the green fund and Liberal cronies. This, however, takes it to the next level. These funds went directly to firms in which the minister has financial interests.

Recall that when text messages came out about someone named Randy directing the affairs of the company in violation of ethics laws, the minister's partner claimed it was someone else named Randy.

He was also my great-grandfather.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682192">Leonard was killed in action in August 1917 in the Battle of Hill 70, leaving behind a wife and five children, among them the six-month-old daughter he would never meet, my grandmother Edith. Like so many others, he left his home and family, stepping into the unknown to protect a future he would never see. He fought not just for his generation but for every generation to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682193">I had the honour of visiting my great-grandfather's grave in northern France in 2017. I was the first family member to do so, 100 years after his death. The solemn promise I made that day was to ensure that his memory and legacy would live on. Lest we forget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682386"> The journey from playground to podium is long and hard, and our athletes train for years. Our Liberal government is proud to support over 1,900 athletes through the athlete assistance program and we are also proud to be increasing this program to provide more money for more athletes. An additional $7 million a year means a 23% increase in the living allowance and an additional 30% allowance for Paralympic athletes.</ParaText>

In order to address those challenges, we need to ensure that we build out the affordable housing stock so people can find a place that is safe and that they can afford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682392"> That is why we are moving forward with billions of dollars of investments to help build affordable housing in our country at a pace not seen in many decades. It is why we put money on the table to support non-profits to buy up existing affordable housing in the market to ensure that it remains affordable forever. It is also why we have restored, after decades of cuts, more investments in co-operative and affordable housing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682430">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour to stand in this place and talk about the important issues facing Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682431">However, I will take a brief moment to say that, a number of weeks ago, a friend of the Conservative Party, and the father of former member Monte Solberg, Stan Solberg, passed away. His funeral was this past Monday. I know many gathered to celebrate the life of Stan Solberg, who was a true patriot and proud Canadian. I had the chance to work with him in politics for many years in a volunteer capacity. Even just a number of months ago, I had a great visit with him. He was always a visionary, thinking forward about the future of Alberta and the future of this country. He was a real patriot, a proud Conservative, and certainly a great Albertan and great Canadian. We remember Stan Solberg here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682432">As well, like some of the members who spoke before me, this will likely be my last opportunity to rise in this place before Remembrance Day. I want to say God bless our troops, past and present, for the work they have done and the sacrifice they have made, and continue to make, to keep us free. We can never let down our guard and not support those who fight so hard for what is right. God bless our troops. Lest we forget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682433">I am once again rising to join in the discussion about a scandal that has paralyzed Parliament. We are seeing a scandal that was initially referred to as one that would be mammoth in comparison to the sponsorship scandal, which brought down the Chrétien-Martin government. As details have been revealed, we certainly see how that is truly the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682434">I am glad to rise in my place today and have the ability to share some comments. This is also being streamed. The live feed from the House of Commons is being streamed on Facebook. For those who are watching on my Facebook page, I would welcome them to share their comments and feedback, and I look forward to hopefully integrating some of that into the discussion here today. We are discussing misappropriation, the conflicts of interest and what we have learned was ultimately nearly $400 million of hard-earned taxpayer dollars that was given to insiders of the government. It was rife with conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682435">Here we are, more than a month into this debate, when the Speaker of the House of Commons has ruled that the government has to release the documents, because the Liberals simply refuse. I would like to unpack things because the Liberals are very good at trying to divide and distract from what the real issue is. Let me unpack it very simply: The Liberals have the ability and the authority to release the documents today, but they refuse to do so. This debate was not started by the Conservatives. It was started by, and has been sustained by, the Liberals, who refuse to release the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682436">The Liberals will talk about privacy. They will talk about the independence of the judiciary. They will talk about all these things, but what they fail to talk about, at every step of the process, is that they have the right, and I would suggest the responsibility, to uphold the standard that Canadians would expect of a government of any colour and to be transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682437">There is nothing stopping the Liberals from walking into this place and placing those documents on the table. There is nothing stopping them from releasing them, but they refuse. As a result, Parliament is exercising its constitutional authority, which is the ability that Parliament has by nature of what Parliament is. We are exercising our ability to demand these documents and taking great care to not interfere in the process of justice. We are ensuring that great care is taken in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682438">However, it comes down to the simple truth. The fact of the matter is that the Liberals could release the documents today, but they refuse to do so. One has to ask what they are hiding. What is so embarrassing? What types of scandal and corruption would be revealed if those things came to light?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682439">It is becoming increasingly clear that the cover-up is more important to the Liberals than anything else the government has been tasked to do. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals have now, for more than a month, paralyzed Parliament. This is on them. They could release the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682440">I have heard from Amber, who is asking, “How are there no repercussions for the corruption that has been proven...?” I thank Amber for that question. The Auditor General, the non-partisan officer of Parliament who looks at the books, found that there were incredible discrepancies, and there have been conflicts of interest found at every stage of the process. It has caused an erosion of trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682441">I am asked this question often: If a regular Canadian was to do what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the cabinet and those members keep doing, would there not be consequences? Would there not be prison time? Would there not be criminal prosecutions? Those Liberals have been paralyzing the actions of Parliament for more than a month to keep these documents from being released. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682442">Lise is asking about “the corruption that happened in the Winnipeg lab”. There are 20 minutes allotted to each of these speeches, and in some cases, a number of colleagues have started listing off the number of scandals that have happened under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and these Liberals. After nine years of these Liberals, we can hardly get through just reading the list. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682443">On the question surrounding the Winnipeg lab documents, it was the Liberals who took the unprecedented step of taking the Speaker to court. It was unprecedented that the government would take the Speaker to court to cover up its corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682444">With this $400-million green slush fund scandal, we are seeing that the Liberals will stop at nothing, including paralyzing Parliament for months on end, to keep the truth from coming out, which leads us to ask what I think is a very fair question about accountability. From what I am hearing from folks who are watching this debate right now, there has to be accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682445">Patricia says that there need to be stiffer penalties and laws to protect Canadians and Canadian tax dollars against this corruption and to stop the conflicts of interest. That sounds like common sense. Canadians want an election. It needs to end so we can get a government in to clean this up. That is from Patricia, who is frustrated, obviously, with the corruption we are seeing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682446">Esther is asking, “Are there no rules that can be enforced...?” It is a good thing Parliament exists because this is the final mechanism. While the Liberals try each and every day to force Parliament to bend to their will, the Conservatives will not do so. We will stand up for the rights of Canadians, including democracy, which is represented in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682447">To Esther, Conservatives are fighting for accountability, which is absolutely essential in the way we go about everything we do here. That includes making sure we continue to demand that the Liberals release the documents so we get answers in the $400-million green slush fund. Where there is smoke, there is fire, as the old adage goes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682448">What has become incredibly clear is that these Liberals are covering up something. Nobody would go to the great lengths they have to cover up corruption unless they had something truly to hide. The question was asked about there being no rules. It is a good thing Parliament exists because Parliament and the premise of parliamentary supremacy persists beyond a corrupt <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a government that is certainly not worth the cost.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682449"> Jordan asks a great question: Why are there so many silent Liberals? Jordan asks why the member for <Affiliation DbId="278141" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> and other Liberals refuse to stand up and ask for accountability. Do they work for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or do they work for their constituents? I think it is a very fair question, so on behalf of Jordan, I ask every Liberal member of Parliament whether they will stand up for the people who sent them here, beyond the guy who sits in the front row who has proven he does not care about their best interests, certainly, because time and time again he shows how he will put personal political gain ahead of the best interests of the country. That is absolutely unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682450"> Debbie says, “Somebody should be able to stop Trudeau and the corruption.” I agree. That is a good thing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682453">The question, I think, is incredibly valid. I am glad the Liberals opposite are paying attention, because they should listen to what Debbie has to say, which is that somebody should stop the corruption. I would tell Debbie the good news is that the Conservatives are fighting every day on her behalf. As soon as we are able to have a carbon tax election, we are going to get a common-sense government, led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Carleton</Affiliation>, who is going to bring integrity and accountability back into the way we do things in this place. In the meantime, we are going to continue to stand up for Canadians to fight that corruption, whether it is the $400-million green slush fund or the many other examples of corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682454">Michael asks a question that more or less demands there be no more coalitions. What is interesting about that is that in the last election, Conservatives said a vote for the NDP was a vote for the Liberals. We were told at the time that would not happen; there would be no coalition. However, only months after the last election, out marched the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>, along with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, with their so-called confidence and supply agreement, a blank cheque to do everything. Even though the leader of the fourth party supposedly ripped up the agreement, the NDP still seems very willing to support the Prime Minister being in charge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682455"> Eva said, “There should be no scandals.” That emphasizes a very important point. The government talks a lot about the money it spends, but the simple truth of the matter is that it is not its money. The $400 million in the green slush fund that was allocated in conflicts of interest to Liberal insiders and those with connections to SDTC is one example of many. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682456">Every dollar the government spends is not its money. It comes from somewhere. In particular, it comes from hard-working Canadians in the form of taxes. Certainly, there should be no scandals, because every person who makes a decision when it comes to the public purse should take great care to ensure that money is treated responsibly.

              <ParaText id="8682459"> Carrie said, “When are we going to get taxpayers' money returned?” That is exactly it. I know when it comes to the policy role I have the opportunity to be a part of right now, and the position of Canadian Heritage, we are demanding that the $18 million in bonuses paid out to executives and managers of the CBC be returned. It just makes sense. We have a failing organization, led by a failing government, that pays itself bonuses and in fact changed the rules. Whether it is SDTC, the CBC or the myriad of other scandals, it is clear that Canadians want their money back. It is absolutely essential that the respect for taxpayers' money is returned to this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682460"> We need to make sure this place respects the immense privilege we all have to steward the democracy of the land. Quite often the intricacies of Parliament are not well understood, which is unfortunate for somebody who is passionate about the systems we have developed, such as the Parliament of Canada and the Westminster system and its history dating back so many centuries. It is only by act, will and proclamation of Parliament that any dollar can be spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682461">That history speaks to something that is often forgotten. In centuries past, when kings in the United Kingdom wanted money, wanted to tax their subjects, there was significant conflict and quite often it would result in war. However, throughout history, there was this coming together to say it was time to ensure the people had a voice. When the Liberals tried to pass a motion that would have given them unlimited spending and taxation authority for a period of 18 months, it was unprecedented in Westminster democracy. They tried to slip it through and say it was time for a team Canada approach. That was their excuse when the reality was that if they wanted a team Canada approach, they would have done the hard work to ensure taxpayers' dollars were respected, yet they refused to do so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682464"> Jacqueline says, “We need to have action to take on this.” I would say to Jacqueline that the action is very simple: The Liberals need to release the documents. They are so obsessed with this cover-up that they are willing to throw out their agenda for the purpose of covering up the corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682465">I am grateful for the opportunity to have once again entered into this debate. We have seen close to $400 million in taxpayers' money spent. The Liberals are quick to suggest that this fund that gave grants to develop clean and new energy had been around for a long time. It had been around for a long time, but the Liberals broke it. In 2018, former industry minister Navdeep Bains, who did not like the board because it resembled Harper's vision too much, and the Liberals replaced the board. Since that point in time, it has been rife with scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682466">I will just give a shout-out to my wife, Danielle. She commented on there too. Love you, sweetheart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682467">I will conclude by saying this: Canadians deserve answers. Canadians deserve to see these documents. There needs to be accountability, which is the fundamental premise of what democracy is. I regret that after so many weeks the Liberals are still so bent on covering things up that they would paralyze Canada's Parliament to serve their own personal political interests. It is time for better, and Conservatives will bring it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682496"> I have to say, at the start of this speech today, that I cannot believe we are still here. I cannot believe that we talked about this topic in September and for all of October, and that it is November and we are still talking about it. For those at home who do not know what this privilege motion is about, it all started with Sustainable Development Technology Canada, a fund that was supposed to support sustainable technology development. The fund was created in 2001 and worked fine under both Liberal and Conservative governments until the current corrupt Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682497">Basically, it appointed people to the committee that was going to decide who got the money, and all its members gave it to their own companies. The Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest, a whistle-blower implied that there was criminality involved and Parliament voted to have the documents related to this scandal produced. Of course, the Liberals did what they always do: They delayed and then produced the documents all blacked out without anything useful. The Speaker has correctly ruled that they need to produce the documents unredacted and that no government business or private member's business is going to take place in the House until that happens. We have been waiting for five weeks for the Liberals to produce the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682498">Bills are not coming forward, but there are some bills that I am glad are not coming forward, like the online harms bill, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, which would do absolutely nothing to help children being sexually exploited online. Everybody wants that to be dealt with, but it would create a parallel system with no criminal consequences, and that would not help anyone. It would also put a person in jail for life if someone thinks they might commit a hate crime in the future. That is a chill on freedom of speech in this country. I am also happy that we do not have Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document> coming forward, the bill that would give all Liberal and NDP members who are going to lose their seat in the next election their pensions by moving the election date out a week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682499">One of the bills that I would like to see come forward is unfortunately not happening. As part of the federal redistribution process, my riding was renamed Sarnia—Lambton—Bkejwanong. The new chief of Bkejwanong, which is Walpole Island, objects to the use of that name. As soon as I heard that he objected to it, I asked it to be part of a bill to alter riding names that need to be changed, which is done regularly in the House. I am very disappointed that this bill is not coming forward, because now I am not able to do what the chief asked me to do and what I said I would do, which is bring it forward here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682500">The reason we are here is that the Liberals continue to block us by not producing the documents. Let us talk about some of the arguments that have been made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682501">The Liberals are saying they do not want to give the documents to the RCMP because that would be a violation of people's charter rights. I want to be clear that the RCMP gets tips all the time, like from Crime Stoppers. It follows up on them. Nothing is a violation of anybody's charter rights with respect to that. What would happen is that RCMP members would look into the documents, especially if we give some indication of where they should be looking, and if they found evidence of criminality and wanted to pursue criminal charges, they would go to a judge and order those documents to be produced so they could be officially used in a criminal trial. That is where we are at today.</ParaText>

Here we are again with the same thing because the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> was part of the cabinet that approved the billion dollars. One of the board members was a lady named Andrée-Lise Méthot. She was the founder and managing partner of Cycle Capital, a company that the Minister of Environment and Climate Change is invested in.</ParaText>

He, as we know, was a convicted felon. In 2001 he was charged and convicted. He served a year's probation plus 100 hours of community service and paid $1,000 of restitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682526">This is the calibre of corruption in the Liberal government and cabinet. It is no wonder things go awry when these kinds of people are involved. The Liberals have been trying to suggest that they need to stand up for the charter rights of Canadians. I certainly wish they would, because they have not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682527">One is what their record says they are, and if we look at the record of the Liberal government on the matter, we see the chill the Liberals have put on freedom of speech in this country with Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the censorship bill. With Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>, the freedom of the press was compromised. Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms bill that I just talked about, once again would violate everyone's charter rights happily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682528">Then there is freedom of religion. I spoke about this before, but since then, things have escalated even further in our country. Have members heard about the persecution that Hindus are facing in Brampton? People were out with knives. There were violent attacks on temples. The government has done nothing about it. Liberals wring their pearls and say that it is unacceptable, but they have done nothing to ensure that the rule of law in this country is enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682529"> What is the point of having rules to protect Canadians if they are not enforced, and why has the federal government, which has the highest authority to make sure that rights are protected, done nothing? A hundred or more Christian churches were burned in our country, and again, it is crickets from the Liberals on this. It goes on and on. What has happened to Jewish Canadians is heartbreaking. They have been constantly harassed, and their synagogues and their businesses are vandalized. They have been given death treats and nothing has been done. Certainly freedom of religion in this country is in serious jeopardy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682530">Furthermore, there is discrimination that happens. We are supposed to be free from discrimination in this country, but it happens even in the Liberal benches. The Liberals are discriminating based on age. They decided to give seniors who are older than 75 more money than the seniors who are between 65 and 75. Similarly, there are violations in the minority language rights; the government has been proven several times in court to not have done what it should have done to protect the minority language rights of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682533">The other argument we will hear from the Liberal benches is that the RCMP does not want the documents. Is it really the case that the RCMP does not want to see evidence of potential crime? The whistle-blower was clear that there was criminality going on, and it is possible that it was with more than one minister. I talked about the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>, but actually there is also the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who was overseeing the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682534">There is an agreement that says the board members had to disclose any conflicts of interest to ISED, so the minister would have known about them and not acted. Perhaps that is what would be uncovered when the documents are released. Certainly there is an issue there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682535">I think that what happened in the slush fund is just another example, and we keep racking up dollars. I think about the number of scandals that have happened in the government since I came here in 2015. This one is $400 million. There was the $372 million the Liberals gave to Frank Baylis to make ventilators when he had never made ventilators before, and they never ended up using any of them. It goes on and on with the different scandals. There was the WE Charity scandal and the huge waste of money there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682536">Canadians are finding the current scandal particularly obscene, at a time when the number of people going to food banks is the highest it has ever been. There are also 1,400 tent encampments in Ontario alone, and they are spread across the country. At a time when people are struggling, cannot afford food and cannot afford to feed their family and heat their house, there is an incredible waste of money and people lining the pockets of insiders. It is just unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682537">When I look at some of the previous things that have happened, I ask myself what we need to do to put in place some accountability so that this sort of thing does not happen. What kind of protection can we provide to whistle-blowers? If it is going on in one department, what is going on in all the other funds?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682538"> It is said that the fish rots from the head. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already been violating ethics laws in the billionaire island fiasco, and he is also under suspicion in the SNC-Lavalin scandal for pressuring a criminal prosecution, which the RCMP is investigating. In the WE Charity scandal, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took an action, by awarding money to the organization, that benefited himself and his family: his brother, his mother and his wife. As I said before, under subsection 119(1) of the Criminal Code, that is illegal. It is not just a mistake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682539"> Therefore we really have to clean up the government, and it does not look to me like we can change the spots on the leopards. Over here on the Conservative benches, we believe in the rule of law. We believe in transparency. We believe in accountability and we believe in trying to be prudent with the use of taxpayer dollars for the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682540"> I think that Canadians are looking for a change. They cannot take the continual rise in taxes that they have seen under the current government, such as the carbon tax, which it is going to increase to 61¢ a litre at a time when people are already struggling. The Liberals want to quadruple it and quadruple the misery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682541">EI premiums, CPP premiums and all of these things are going in the wrong direction at a time when there is going to be increasing competitiveness from the U.S.; President-elect Trump has clearly put America as a priority, and we are not on competitive ground. We have taxes and a regulatory burden that are going to drive millions of dollars and millions of jobs to the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682542"> The Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund is the tip of the iceberg. We have to get to the bottom of it. As much as everybody would like to move on from this, until the documents are produced unredacted and we can give them to the RCMP so we can get to the bottom of what happened, the Conservatives are going to continue to do what is our job. We are His Majesty's loyal opposition, and our job is to hold the government to account, which means not just saying, “Oh, there's nothing to see here.” It means asking for the documents, doing the hard work to get to the bottom of it and going to committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682543"> I understand that once the documents are produced, the PROC committee is supposed to look at them. However, I have a little bit of skepticism about that, because with every other scandal that has gone to any committee, NDP members, partners of the Liberals, work together with them. They are still doing it, even though the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> made a big deal of ripping up the agreement, effectively saying, “Oh, the Liberals are too weak and they can't be trusted. We're not going work with them anymore.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682544">The New Democrats are still supporting the Liberals today at committee. What they do is shut down the committee. They filibuster so they do not have to produce the documents, and that is exactly what would happen if this thing went to committee, which is why we have to hold on and wait until the Liberals deliver the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682545">Why will they not deliver the documents? The Auditor General has seen them, although she was not auditing criminality. The documents exist and need to be produced, but what are they hiding? Are people going to go to jail? That is what it is starting to look like. However, we will not know until we see the documents, so the Liberals need to produce them, the sooner the better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682561">Madam Speaker, just yesterday in the public accounts committee, we heard that the government has referred three more cases, seven in total now, to the RCMP over theft issues and fraud issues with ArriveCAN. However, the government seems very hesitant to do so with a similar scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682562"> In the contribution agreement signed between SDTC and Industry Canada, there is a very specific paragraph that states that for any money given out ineligibly, SDTC has an obligation to return the money to Industry Canada, therefore, taxpayers. However, SDTC has not, and Industry Canada has not, forced the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682563">I wonder if my colleague could perhaps expand on why she thinks the government is refusing to claw back ineligibly received taxpayers' dollars.</ParaText>

In this example, there's $58 million that the Auditor General said went to companies that were not eligible. They did not reduce emissions and it was not green tech. The companies were absolutely not eligible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682565">Regarding my colleague's comments, that money should be returned and the government should be going after it. However, the Liberals never get the money back. The Liberals waste Canadians' money. Their friends get rich and taxpayers never get their money back. We need a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682566"> Madam Speaker, the member is trying to sidestep the real issue of the motion. The motion is very simple. The Conservative Party is asking that Parliament, the House of Commons, provide unredacted documents directly to the RCMP. The RCMP has said that the game the Conservatives are playing is not right. The Auditor General of Canada has said that what the Conservative Party is doing is not right. We have other professionals who are saying the same thing. We cannot just give the papers over. There are quotes of people saying that there are potential threats to charter issues and yet, the Conservatives close their eyes, believing it is okay to demand it and ultimately mislead Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682567"> The government is not going to go against the RCMP and the Auditor General because the Conservatives believe something that is not true. Why should the government of the day believe the Conservative Party ahead of the RCMP and the Auditor General? Do the Conservatives not respect what those independent institutions are saying?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682568">Madam Speaker, the role of the RCMP is to enforce the rule of law equally for all. It is interesting to me how often the RCMP does not investigate things happening in the government that are suggested to be criminal, like what happened with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the WE Charity scandal and like when Brenda Lucki kept information from the public on the Nova Scotia massacre because of an announcement with respect to gun legislation that was coming from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682569">There is not enough separation between the current Liberal government and the RCMP, and that is a concern. The RCMP needs to investigate all of the accused criminality. The whistle-blower said there was criminality and certainly I have outlined how the RCMP officers can look at that evidence the way they would if the whistle-blowers just called up the RCMP and told the officers where to go and look. That would be a great thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682570"> However, in lieu of that, this is what we as parliamentarians can do to make sure that the information gets there so that they can investigate. Perhaps the officers will find nothing. The RCMP can choose to do whatever it wants to do. If the RCMP officers do want to use it in a criminal prosecution, they will have to follow the law and get a warrant, but they will know where to look.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682571">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their remarks and contributions to this debate. The very fact that we can debate here in this House on this matter is so important for Canadians. It is something that our veterans fought for. The right for civil debate is something that we must always cherish and hold with reverence equivalent to the sacrifice required to attain it. As we all wear our poppies this November, I want to thank the men and women who have have served in our military and continue to serve our country in such a capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682572">The last time I was here in this House speaking to this issue, I was able to draw on much of my teaching experience to highlight just how important this motion is. This motion, which we all know by now, is concerning the government's refusal to provide all files, documents, briefing notes, memoranda, emails or any other correspondence engaged among government officials regarding SDTC or the NDP-Liberal government's green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682573">While I do not want to belabour the point of discussing how the government could learn lessons from high school students in finally coming clean to Canadians on yet another scandal, today I want to try to appeal to the government's better angels by asking them to make a decision. Today, I am asking the government, on behalf of the many parents and young, bright students of the future that I represent, to set a good example and once again come clean to Canadians on this scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682574">As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> may remember, children look up to us adults for influence and inspiration and as role models. While it sometimes remains to be seen that this is the case, we are all indeed adults in this House. With the added responsibilities of being parliamentarians and elected representatives of our people, our nation, the bar only gets higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682575">In search of role models, children look for those who lead by example and once again, the government has a choice to make. It can come clean with Canadians on this corruption-stricken slush fund and the lack of stewardship over taxpayers' dollars, or it can continue to allow our House to be frozen and in dysfunction in service of the Liberals' questionable political goals. They have a choice to place the sake of Canadians over themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682576">I am not ignorant to the reality that political parties of all stripes will attempt to paint their opponents in an unflattering manner. However, in this case, among many others, putting political interests over Canadians has become an absolute reality in what remains of the NDP-Liberal government. I intend to make this point here in this House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682577">It is clear to Canadians, now more than ever, that the government has adopted a doctrine of, “Do as I say, not as I do.” In 2015, the Liberal Party put out this message in campaigning efforts. It stated, “Canadians deserve an open, transparent government that will focus on their real priorities—economic growth that works for everyone.” They also said, “Only Liberals have a plan for real change that will restore trust in our democracy, and ensure an open and transparent government.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682578">After nine years of the government, trust in our democracy and the transparency of government has never been lower. Recent numbers show that at least six in 10 Canadians are not satisfied with the accountability and transparency of the Canadian government's spending practices. While polls are not gospel, I must ask those opposite, is this not the slightest bit concerning?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682579">This theme extends beyond just the realm of this green slush fund. While NDP-Liberals pull out all of the stops to virtue-signal on how great their climate plan has been and how great it has been for Canadians, they have failed to hit a single emissions reduction target. According to the Auditor General, they are unlikely to hit their 2030 targets either.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682580">There is something to be said for sticking to what one says one will do. It is a matter of integrity and, frankly, pride. However, I am routinely surprised by the lack of shame for its many shortfalls demonstrated by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682581">Of course, this all comes as the ever-present carbon tax continues to hurt Canadians at the pumps and at the grocery stores. As I described earlier, it is “do as I say, not as I do”. It creates a clear double standard in which the government can do no wrong, but Liberals continue to attack industries in my home province of Alberta for easy political points with their ever-diminishing voter base.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682582"> The government's recently announced emissions cap for the oil and gas sector is a blatant attempt to strangle an industry that is, frankly, critical to Canada's economic prosperity and growth. The irony is that they continue to fail to hit their own emission targets while expecting provinces and industries within said provinces to now follow a new arbitrary production cap. How is that not a double standard? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682583">Recent data from Stats Canada shows that energy-rich Alberta contributed 38.2% to the overall natural resources GDP in 2022. Let it be known from coast to coast that Albertans take incredible pride in how we do energy. We excel in planning and executing reclamation processes to return the land we use back to how it looked and how it was used before development upon the land took place. The notion that Albertans are anti-environment is simply untrue and reeks of anti-Alberta prejudice. The ability to harness Canada's natural resources is truly a Canadian superpower; by extension, this makes Alberta an all-star. The energy sector is a massive contributor to employment in central Alberta, and applying a de facto emissions cap would be devastating to those employed in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682584">I am a fourth-generation farmer. I work hard to represent fellow farmers here in the House. On top of that, the people of Red Deer—Mountain View have placed their trust in me as their elected representative to advocate for them and be their voice in Ottawa. Not only do I cherish this trust, but I will also fight for their interests as long as I have the honour of representing them in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682585">On that note, I want to shift my focus back to the government. I will turn my attention specifically to the hon. member opposite who sits as Canada's <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. I do this because this individual announced the de facto production cap on our oil and gas sector, and while he has stated reasons of his own, I wish to highlight an alternative explanation, not only for this cap but also for the government's reluctance to disclose documents that would expose the corruption that has taken place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682586"> If we were to open up the books and look at the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>'s working history, we would see that he was a strategic adviser for more than 10 years at a Canadian fund dedicated to the development of clean technologies. One might say that sounds awfully familiar, given the matter that has seized the House for about a month now. What was SDTC? It was also a Canadian fund dedicated to the development of clean technologies, except that it was run by the federal government. While that is the case, it goes even deeper than that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682587"> For those unfamiliar with the matter, one of the directors of this very fund found their way onto the board of SDTC. On top of that, this green slush fund has had a history of giving money to companies in the portfolio of the fund our <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> used to work at. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682588">The saying often goes that people in government should always strive to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. This is a means to ensure that faith and trust in our institutions remain strong. Therefore, it is bizarre that any person armed with a handy little tool called Google is able to find out that there are so many layers to the corruption we are attempting to uncover. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682589">As members of Parliament, we represent our constituents; not only that, but we also represent ourselves. That is true. It is a fact of human nature. As I outlined before, I have no qualms telling people about where I come from, about the honest work I do on our beautiful farm in Red Deer County or about the interest I represent on behalf of those in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682590">It seems such forthcomingness is not a characteristic shared by some of those who sit opposite from me and my colleagues. That is, of course, what we are discussing here today, and it leaves many questions unanswered. What other interests does the government hold that it continues to conveniently cover up for its own political gain? Once again, it is do as I say, not as I do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682591">This narrative has become tiring for everyone in Canada. That much is absolutely clear. Conservatives have been steadfast in our efforts to prosecute the government for its many shortcomings and dishonesties to Canadians; Canadians themselves are fed up and have had enough with the NDP-Liberal government. Both say that something needs to change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682592">When scholars look back at this tumultuous period within the Liberal caucus and the many uncertainties that have come with it, I worry that their takeaways will be less than charitable. Whatever happened to setting a good example for our children and teaching them the importance of accountability for one's actions? Whatever happened to showing one's homework when presenting proposals to chief executives? As a reminder, here in the House, the chief executives over all of us are the Canadian taxpayers who sent us here. Our responsibility is to them, to the people who pay for us to sit here in the House, but some twiddle their thumbs and pretend there is not a massive cover-up taking place here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682593">A carbon tax election is around the corner, but for now, the government is still hanging on. This is despite the fact that many Canadians across the political spectrum are telling the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> he is not worth the cost, the crime or the corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682594">I will now move away from indicting the government's actions because I wish to appeal to the better angels here today. As many of my peers in the teaching profession and in the scholarly realm will often say, history is the best teacher. When we look back on history, there is an abundance of literature and cases showing that the truth always comes out in the end. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682595">The truth prevails, no matter how powerful the efforts are to suppress it. The reality is that we see this in recent history, even in the past couple of decades. The truth, whether the government likes it or not, is going to come out sooner or later. As always, if someone has nothing to hide, why bother? On the flip side, if someone does have something to hide, they would be better off coming clean sooner rather than getting burned twofold when the truth comes to light without their hand in it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682596"> History is the best teacher, and as with all governments, sometime in the near future, the current government will become just that: history. When it does, as with all governments that come and go, it will be subject to the 20/20 vision that is hindsight and held to the level of scrutiny that it can grant. This is what we call legacy. Legacy is what we leave for the history books and the impact we leave on people once we have left them. What legacy does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> want to be known for? What legacy do his colleagues wish for their government? Does the government wish for its legacy to be that it is better to hide mistakes and wrongdoings if it should suit its purposes?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682597">As parliamentarians, we are not the masters but the servants. As I said before, our masters are the Canadian people, and our purposes should fall second to the needs of the Canadian people. They need a transparent and accountable government. Was that not the promise the Liberals gave those who voted for them in 2015? Is this going to be yet another broken promise by the government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682598">Now, more than ever, with trust in our institutions at an all-time low, we cannot afford this sort of tomfoolery. We need to ensure that Canadians can trust us to get things done and that our federal government does not fall into obscurity in the eyes of the Canadian public. It is not too late to right the ship in this instance and come clean to the people of Canada. Today, I hope this message resonates with my colleagues across the floor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682599">Another question I have for the government regarding its potential legacy is this: Do the government members wish to leave behind the lesson that taking on a sacred duty to their country as an elected representative is something that can be shrugged at and abused? A recurring theme in the government has been that of conflict of interest, time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682600">Parliamentarians are entrusted with the sacred duty to represent the voices of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. These voices should always supersede those of powerful corporations and investment funds. Common-sense Conservatives have been strongly against the presence of corporate lobbyists in our political process. We will always advocate that the best way for Canadians to influence their parliamentarians is to speak to them directly. The tables have turned. It is the people's time to be heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682601">I have one last question: Does the government wish to teach future generations that it is okay to freeze the nation's legislature for more than a month, to shrink from accountability over hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682602">I hope every member opposite is able to ask these questions in private, as they look in the mirror after work today. After all, we are at work, and taxpayers have sent us here to advocate for their best interests. How withholding these documents serves Canadian taxpayers is beyond me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682603">As would the people I represent in Red Deer—Mountain View, I would appreciate a more genuine response than a simple non-answer. It is time for us, as the adults in the room, to take stock of where we are as a democracy and ensure that we are moving forward in a way that best reflects the views and values of the people of Canada. This is a chance for us to show Canadians we can still get things done in this country for the good of all citizens. It was not always like this in Canada, and it will not be like this forever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682604">The winds of change are setting upon Canada, ready to transform our country once more, as all democracies observe. We are in a transformative time when many things are uncertain. While there still remains much that we are unsure of, such as what the future holds, one thing remains clear: Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682617"> Madam Speaker, I think the last time I spoke, there was a similar question. Of course, it is easy to say tens of thousands, but it is not that amount as far as the Conservatives are concerned. As we know, Navdeep Bains worked his way around the proper procedures for determining who would be the chairperson of SDTC, so it goes a lot deeper than that. As for the donations she made, they were for people who were friends of hers, not friends of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682618">At any rate, when I look at the actions of the Liberals in this case, it would be nice if the NDP's leadership could put pressure on the Liberals.

              <ParaText id="8682627">Madam Speaker, at a time when Canadians are struggling to put food on their tables, when the dream of home ownership in Canada is just that, a dream for many young Canadians, and when our country is plagued by so many other serious challenges brought upon us by the failed policies of this incompetent and reckless NDP-Liberal government, here we are again this afternoon continuing debate on the government's failure to live up to its responsibilities and the Speaker's order to produce important documents pertaining to the Sustainable Development Technology Canada green slush fund scandal. In fact, this is my second time speaking to this important issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682628">Today, I am here debating the amendment that would replace the reporting date of Friday, November 22, with the following: “the 30th sitting day following the adoption of this order”. This change makes sense given the uncertainty around when debate on this important issue will finish. No one knows for sure when that will be, but the Conservatives are doing our part in holding this corrupt Liberal government to account until it hands over the ordered and unredacted SDTC documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682629">While Friday, November 22, sounds far away, it is in fact just around the corner when we consider that Remembrance Day is on Monday, and next week all members of Parliament will be in their constituencies catching up with their constituents, local stakeholders and their families. By the time we return to this place, it will be November 18, and November 22 is that Friday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682630">When November 22 was first proposed in the motion, no one could have imagined we would be continuing to debate this issue in the House of Commons. Back then, it sounded like a reasonable and realistic date to set as a deadline. However, the Liberal government has dug in its heels and is refusing to budge. That is how Canadians watching from home know that the Liberals are hiding something, and that something must be very concerning. That is why we are here today to hold this corrupt government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682631">It dismays me greatly that since the first time I debated this subject a few weeks ago, the Liberals have still not done what is right and handed over the ordered and unredacted SDTC documents to the RCMP. Consequently, the House of Commons remains seized by this issue and paralyzed from moving on from it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682632">For those watching at home, I will note that SDTC was established by the Government of Canada in 2001. As a federally funded foundation, it was responsible for the approval and disbursement of over $100 million annually in taxpayer funds to help Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies. For many years, SDTC operated responsibly and earned a generally good reputation for its work. However, that all changed in 2019 when former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains appointed Annette Verschuren as chair of SDTC. The issue at hand was a matter of conflict of interest. Verschuren was an entrepreneur who was already receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies, and then she was appointed by the NDP-Liberal government to hold responsibilities in overseeing the very same SDTC funds that her company was receiving. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682633">That fact alone should have sounded alarm bells and set off flashing red lights to alert everyone in the government about the obvious conflict of interest at hand. In fact, it was no secret. The minister, the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office all knew, and they were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair. However, those warnings fell on deaf ears and there was indifference, as Verschuren was appointed by the Liberal minister anyway. How can we tell that a government has lost its moral compass? It is when it makes poor decisions like this one without concern for doing the right things and without fear of consequence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682634"> Only two years later, in January 2021, Minister Bains announced that he had decided to step away from politics and not run again in the upcoming federal election. That same year, SDTC entered into a five-year, $1-billion agreement with the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. Fast-forward to the fall of 2024, and it is clear that the Liberals are trying desperately to run away and wash their hands of this mess, one they laid the foundation for through their own actions, and especially after the Auditor General released a scathing report about SDTC in June 2024. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682635"> The AG found massive issues at SDTC, which resulted in the current Minister of Industry, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278162" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation>, abolishing the SDTC and immediately transferring its funds over to the National Research Council of Canada. These are truly astonishing developments in just three years for something the Liberal government does not want to talk about anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682636">What did the AG find that was so bad to cause all this carnage? In June 2024, the AG found that SDTC demonstrated “significant lapses in governance and stewardship of public funds”. Nearly 20% of the SDTC projects examined by the AG were in fact ineligible, based on the government's own rules for funding, with a total price tag of $59 million. There were also 90 instances where the SDTC ignored conflict of interest provisions while awarding $76 million to various projects. Indeed, the AG found 63 cases where SDTC agency directors voted in favour of payments to companies in which they declared interests. Further, there were serious matters of governance, including the fact that the board did not have the minimum number of members required by law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682637">The report concluded: “Not managing conflicts of interest—whether real, perceived, or potential—increases the risk that an individual’s duty to act in the best interests of the foundation is affected, particularly when making decisions to award funding.” It also blamed the government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, whose ministry did not sufficiently monitor the contribution agreements with SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682638">Believe it or not, it gets far worse. Since June, the Auditor General found that directors had awarded funding to projects that were ineligible and where conflicts of interest existed. Over $300 million in taxpayer money was paid out in over 180 cases where there was a potential conflict of interest, with Liberal-appointed directors funnelling money to companies they owned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682639">Time after time, this Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have shown total contempt for Canada's ethics laws. In fact, the Prime Minister himself has been the subject of three ethics investigations and was found guilty of breaking ethics laws twice. The Liberal government allows the culture of law-breaking to persist, as six Liberals have been found guilty of breaking ethics laws. Liberals have gone through these ethical scandals before. That is why they are withholding these documents, breaching parliamentary privilege and trying desperately to sweep this mess under the rug and move on to the next thing. However, common-sense Conservatives are not going to let them get away with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682640">The Conservatives are holding the corrupt NDP-Liberal government to account. It will be held responsible for its carelessness, recklessness and corruption. This is why, on June 10, 2024, the House of Commons adopted the following motion proposed by common-sense Conservatives on this matter. The motion read:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682641">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House order the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) and the Auditor General of Canada each to deposit with the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, within 30 days of the adoption of this order, the following documents, created or dated since January 1, 2017, which are in its or her possession, custody or control.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682642">The motion then details what documents were to be supplied and then directed that “the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel shall provide forthwith any documents received by him, pursuant to this order, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682643">This common-sense Conservative motion passed with the support of the New Democrats, Green Party and Bloc Québécois. Only the Liberals opposed it. To be clear, nothing in the motion orders the RCMP to conduct an investigation. The House is simply asking that the documents be turned over to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682644">Thirty days came and went, and instead of complying with the adopted motion, federal departments outright refused the House order or provided heavily redacted documents, citing provisions in the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act. This is not a good look. Nothing in the House order contemplated redactions to documents being made by the government. The House of Commons enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents, which is not limited by statute. These powers are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682645">In response to the NDP-Liberal government's failure to produce these documents, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege, rightfully arguing that the House privilege had been breached due to the failure to comply with the House order.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682646">On September 26, the Speaker issued a ruling on the question of privilege raised and found the privileges of the House had in fact been breached. Now, nearly a month later, we continue our important debate on this matter today and continue our demands for the Liberal government to provide the RCMP with the unredacted SDTC documents. The Speaker has ruled the government has violated a House order to turn over evidence to the RCMP in its latest $400 million green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682647">The NDP-Liberal government's refusal to respect the ruling has paralyzed Parliament, pushing aside all other work to address issues such as the cruel and crippling carbon tax, the cost of living crisis that Canadians face for food and shelter, and the increasing crime, disorder and chaos in our streets and in our communities and cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682648">This is happening at a time when the costs of food, fuel and shelter are all up and millions of Canadians are having to line up outside food banks just to survive. Sadly, as Canadians continue to struggle, life for well-connected Liberals and insiders has never been so good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682649">One of the drivers of this hardship is the cruel NDP-Liberal carbon tax. In fact, this carbon tax will cost the average Ontarian $903 this year. This is completely unacceptable to the constituents in my communities of Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie, who work hard for their money, who save carefully for their futures and who dream of a better tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682650">Instead of doing anything about climate change, the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is impoverishing Canadians. Recently, the PBO confirmed Canadians will suffer a net cost, paying more in the carbon tax than they will ever get back in rebates. Unfortunately, the NDP-Liberal government does not care. Instead of giving Canadians the tax relief they deserve, they hiked the carbon tax by 23% last spring as part of their plan to quadruple the carbon tax by 2030. It turns out the carbon tax is not a tool to fight climate change like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> argues; it is just another tax grab. Canadians can add it to the long and growing list of Liberal-NDP taxes they already pay including the income tax, sales tax, excise tax, underused housing tax, property tax, capital gains tax and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682651">After listing all those taxes, it is easy to see why Canadians are getting poorer. It is because the government is taking more of their hard-earned money away. The SDTC scandal is also happening at a time when the cost of food is up. In fact, food will cost families $700 more this year than it did in 2023. That is because when we tax the farmer who grows the food; the trucker who ships the food; and the store that stocks, stores and sells the food, we end up taxing the family who buys the food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682652">As Sylvain Charlebois, Canada's “food professor”, who serves as director of Dalhousie University's agri-food analytics lab has said that the costly NDP-Liberal carbon tax “likely adds a significant cost burden to the Canadian food industry.” When it comes to food, Canadians are going hungry. That is evident by the massive surge in demand and need for food banks. Food bank usage has increased every year the NDP-Liberal government has been in office, because its inflationary spending and punishing carbon tax have hiked up the price of groceries, causing Canadians to skip meals, eat less healthy food and rely on food banks to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682653">This was confirmed recently by Feed Ontario, which revealed that a record “one million people visited a food bank in Ontario” in 2024. This is a dramatic increase of 25% from the previous year. In fact, Feed Ontario's CEO told media, “I never thought I would see this day.” Feed Ontario's CEO went on to say, “I've been with the organization for almost 15 years.... I never thought we would reach a number so high....” The CEO could not believe that we reached a point where numbers were so drastically high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682654">Across Canada, food banks reported earlier this year that they had seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021, with food banks handling a record two million visits in a single month in 2023. Of the people visiting food banks in Ontario, one in three visitors are children. One in six adults visiting food banks are unemployed. The NDP-Liberal government cost of living crisis has become so severe that even working Canadians are having to depend on food banks to get by. These numbers also reflect what is happening across Niagara.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682655">We can try to wrap our heads around some of these statistics from Project Share, which serves vulnerable residents in Niagara Falls. Last year, Project Share saw a 20% increase in people served, compared to to the previous year. There were 4,740 people who accessed its services for the first time. On average, 120 families per day access its essential support services. There were 13,995 people served last year, which equates to one in seven residents of Niagara Falls having accessed its essential support services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682656">We should be debating these issues, and we could if the government simply abided by the Speaker's ruling and provided the documents the House requested. Why are government members so hesitant to do what is right? Is it that they do not want to speak to the situation facing young Canadians and first-time homebuyers, which is so bad that the Canadian dream of home ownership is dying? Two-thirds of young people believe they will never be able to afford a home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682657">Canadians see this housing crisis most tragically in our streets, where there are now 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario and thousands more across the country. Time after time, the NDP-Liberal government has promised to fix the housing crisis, but the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has been clear that the number of new homes being built is not enough to reduce the existing supply gap and improve affordability for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682658">Crime is also getting worse under the watch of the NDP-Liberal government, and perhaps again this is why it refuses to hand over these documents, so we cannot debate these issues that are so important to all constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682659">Since 2015 when the Liberals formed government, the number of auto thefts skyrocketed by 45%, violent crime has increased 50%, human trafficking is up 73% and hate crimes have increased by 251%. Just recently, the Toronto Police Association had to come out publicly and fact-check the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682660">The reality is the Liberals' soft-on-crime approach is making life easier for violent criminals by repealing mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes with Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, making it easier to get bail with Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and failing to stop the flow of illegal guns across the U.S. border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682661">These issues I noted are all pressing issues parliamentarians should be debating, but the House of Commons is seized because the government is refusing to comply with the House order to hand over SDTC documents to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682662">Canadians are suffering great hardship after nine years of the NDP-Liberal coalition. The country is headed in the wrong direction, and we are all worse off than we were 10 years ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682669">I can assure the House that I will never be in government. However, if I were, I would want to know what was not working. I would work with others to improve whatever was going wrong, because that is the responsible and dignified thing to do. We are all elected and we all represent our constituents, not just the ones who voted for us, but also those who voted against us. We must represent them with dignity. That being the case, I find it hard to understand why the government refuses to hand over the documents. This would allow it to ensure, not as a government, but as a manager of funds, that all funds are being used properly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682717">We can imagine what could have been accomplished if the $400 million of this green slush fund had been allocated in a manner that helped Canadians and the communities they call home. Instead of creating yet another scandal, the Liberal-NDP government could have literally saved lives. Investing $400 million in addictions treatment could have saved lives in the ongoing opioid crisis that claimed at least 47,162 lives in Canada between June 2016 and this March. Under the current government, more Canadians have lost their lives to the opioid crisis than were lost in World War II combat. A total of 14,260, or 30% of those lives, were lost in my home province of British Columbia, including lives lost in my constituency of North Okanagan—Shuswap. These dark realities are a very important reason that the government must release the unredacted documents and let the green slush fund scandal be investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682718"> When I am connecting with citizens of North Okanagan—Shuswap and I hear them talk about the needs and priorities of their communities, I do not just listen; I carry their voices to Ottawa to advocate on their behalf. I have repeatedly written to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to convey the need for the government to initiate actions to fight the availability of illicit opioids and non-prescribed controlled opioids. I repeatedly wrote and advocated for federal resources to prevent opioid addictions and to assist those who are attempting to overcome addiction. I never heard back from the minister or the government. We know who did hear back: the characters who doled out $400 million in the green slush fund scandal. The Liberal-NDP government seems to have unlimited dollars for its friends, but it will not even respond to the pleas from elected representatives of Canadians. That $400 million could have saved the lives of many Canadians lost to the opioid crisis, as well as preventing so much pain and the grief of parents, families and loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682719"> Canada's housing crisis has also played out in North Okanagan—Shuswap. This is another burning issue that I have repeatedly conveyed to the government, which is more concerned with helping its friends than with helping Canadians. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682720"> For instance, eight years ago, in 2016, I hosted round tables in North Okanagan—Shuswap to discuss the matter of housing with representatives from local governments, first nations, social services, construction, real estate and organizations assisting Canadians facing challenges in securing housing. Following these engagements, I wrote to the finance minister and shared great opportunities for the government to recognize the existing willingness of private investors and developers to construct new rental stock and to mobilize this willingness with reasonable incentives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682721">I wrote the minister again in 2018 and stated, “Many...Canadians below or near the poverty line exhibit determination to work hard to improve their positions but the absence of affordable housing undermines their aspirations and efforts.” Again, I received no response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682722">This government did not take up the actions suggested. Its response was inaction, and it actually made the housing crisis worse by driving up costs, rents, and housing and rental stock scarcity with out-of-touch policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682723">That $400 million could have gone a long way in helping to unleash construction of new homes for Canadians; instead, it was allocated to the shady insider dealings of the green slush fund scandal, which the government must stop covering up. It could have provided Canadians with water security, had the money been allocated for water and waste water treatment systems, which I have repeatedly advocated for to the government over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682724">In 2017, I wrote the finance minister on behalf of the Skwlāx te Secwepemcúl̓ecw, or Little Shuswap Lake Indian Band, which had identified to me the need for $300,000. This was required to extend water service for up to 20 homes. At that time, I also raised the needs of the Splatsin First Nation for a sanitary sewage system for homes that were, on average, 40 years old and lacked access to treatment services. I told the minister how the reserve was subject to regular boil water advisories and needed support from Ottawa to establish a waste water treatment plant. The minister never did respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682725"> In the same correspondence, I advocated on behalf of the Okanagan Indian Band, which also required support to establish water and waste water treatment systems to meet the government's requirements. Over the years, I have also delivered urgent requests to the government to support water and waste water treatment systems for the Neskonlith Indian Band, the Adams Lake Indian Band, the City of Salmon Arm, the Village of Chase and the communities of Falkland, Scotch Creek, the North Shuswap, Sorrento, Blind Bay and the South Shuswap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682726"> Again, I never received a response saying that the government had resources for these essential projects. Again, friends of the Liberal-NDP government over at the green slush fund did receive a response. They heard back from the government, and they received $400 million. Self-interest and political interest eclipsed the needs of these communities, which needed support to protect their community, their health and our waters. This is another reason we are here today, calling on the government to release unredacted documents, finally, so that the $400-million green slush fund can finally be investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682727"> Over the years, I have also conveyed to the government many other needs and priorities of North Okanagan—Shuswap that could have been supported with the $400 million that needs to be investigated in the green slush fund. In 2016, I sought government support for the $5 million required to connect the communities of Seymour Arm and Shuswap Lake to hydroelectric service.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682728"> In the same year, I identified the need for federal support for assessments of biofuels and renewable energy in the Sicamous area and biomass heating systems in Enderby. In 2018, I advocated for support for a natural gas line to supply the Adams Lake and Little Shuswap Lake indigenous communities. All of these projects could have delivered benefits for citizens and communities. The government did not respond to my advocacy with support, but it did make sure there was $400 million for the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682729">Since 2016, I have been pleading with the government to prioritize the removal of unexploded explosive ordnance, or UXO, from the lands of the Okanagan Indian Band. UXO are a lingering legacy of wartime training ranges on the lands of the Okanagan. Economic development, and the jobs and prosperity that economic development could bring, continues to be stymied because the government has not ensured the UXO are cleared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682730">Just this morning, I received correspondence from the Okanagan Indian Band administration on this very issue, which persists because the government has not prioritized resolving the matter. This is yet another example of what good could have been achieved if $400 million had not been sent to the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682731">Canadians have no choice but to pay taxes. Canadians deserve to know what their tax dollars are being spent on and to have those tax dollars spent in a manner that results in equitable, meaningful benefits. The Liberal government and its NDP accomplices continue to deny Canadians transparency and value for spending. My Conservative colleagues and I will continue to fight to expose what happened to the $400 million that clearly should have been allocated for the benefit of Canadians, not the benefit of insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682732">As I have said before, parliamentarians, at least on this side of the House, take their roles very seriously. Members of His Majesty's loyal opposition have a job to do, and that is to hold the government of the day accountable.

Next, we heard about non-indigenous companies passing themselves off as indigenous in order to get contracts.

He survived numerous crashes and close calls. There is a book about him, <I>Tales of a Bomber Pilot Who Defied Death</I>, authored by Deana Driver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682767">What is amazing is that Reg "Crash" Harrison was signing the books last year at the Nutana Legion in Saskatoon. He was 101 years old, and now he is 102 years old. He was named an honorary Snowbird with the renowned Canadian Forces aerobatics display team, which flies under the same squadron number as the one Reg served in for England. We were in Moose Jaw just a few years ago and saw “Reg ‘Crash’ Harrison” printed on one of the planes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682768">That is a bit of history as we head into Remembrance Day weekend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682769">I would like to give a shout-out to all the veterans and a reminder that Monday in Saskatoon we will host, yet again, the largest indoor Remembrance Day service in this country. Over 8,000 people attend at SaskTel Centre to remember our veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682770">We must thank and remember our veterans for the freedom we all enjoy today. I just wanted to say that up front because my community of Saskatoon is very proud of the veterans. This weekend we will be selling poppies, and then Monday we are going to celebrate and be involved in the Remembrance Day ceremony in Saskatoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682771">It is my pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents of Saskatoon—Grasswood to once again speak about the corruption of the Liberals. They are refusing to obey an order of the House that states they simply have to hand over the documents regarding another scandal of the Liberal Party, not anyone else's scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682772">Another scandal has come out of the government, and I am sure that by now Canadians are getting used to the scandals, unfortunately, since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office in 2015. This one, though, believe me, is far more significant than the others. We are talking about close to $400 million, $390 million to be exact. The Liberals are going to tremendous lengths, weeks upon weeks here in the House, not wanting to simply lay down the unredacted documents we have requested. In fact you, Madam Speaker, were part of the ruling earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682773">Parliament has ground to a halt for weeks because of the Liberals' unwillingness to hand over these documents to the public. It is not us, as opposition members; we are trying to make the government accountable. It simply is not accountable, as it has been in the past, which is why we have been at this for five or six weeks in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682774">The $400 million of mismanaged taxpayer money shows once again how the government treats the hard-earned money of all Canadians. Furthermore, since we are talking about taxpayer dollars, I will say that Canadians have a right to know what the government is doing with their money. Although we already know where it went, the government refuses to admit it. Indeed we know, since the Auditor General has indicated that the money went to Liberal friends whom cabinet had appointed to the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, better known as SDTC. We are calling it the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682775">It is green for a very good reason, and that is the money that was going into the pockets of the Liberals' friends. It is interesting, as we continue with this debate, that we could be here for months. It is important to note that the government was directly in charge of appointing the board members of this fund. This company was actually a pretty good company. It was formed in 2001, and it was very good. A lot of start-ups went to this company, got some help and proceeded on. All of a sudden, the government took over in 2015, and it made changes to the board in 2016 and 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682776">Those Liberal insiders worked their way onto the board, and they were at the trough for close to $400 million, or 186 conflicts of interest, I should say. Those are 186 instances where taxpayer money could have gone to help families struggling with the cost of living and businesses trying to stay afloat. Instead, the money was funnelled to companies with ties to senior Liberal officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682777">Even worse is that $58 million of that money went to companies that should not even have been considered by SDTC. Canadians are asking questions. They want to see all governments be accountable. They want to see all governments be responsible. Both are lacking, obviously, with the Liberal federal government. We saw this with Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, once a proud government agency. Many companies used it, as I mentioned, to promote new technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682778">In fact, on their website it says, “from seed to success”. It was success from 2001 to 2015. The website today says there are three funding streams. Number one is a “one-time non-repayable contribution of $50,000 to $100,000 to validate an idea.” Number two was to “be nominated by one of SDTC’s 90+ accelerator partners.” Number three was to “have raised $100,000 to $200,000 from accredited investors.” One, two, three, it is simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682779">This is frustrating, and Canadians have noted a pattern with the government. There is simply no respect for the average taxpayer. I sit on the heritage committee. Would members like for me to start on the CBC bonuses that were handed out by the government earlier in the year? It was $18 million, with $3.3 million going to the CBC executives, averaging over $70,000 per executive, handed over by either the <Affiliation DbId="300004" Type="4">Minister of Heritage</Affiliation> or the Privy Council. They have now said they know their KPIs, they just have to keep going. KPIs, by the way, are key performance indicators. They have never met them. There are 14; CBC met three.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682780">What did they do? They lowered the KPIs so they could all get the bonuses, and that is what happened. The trust is down. Ad revenue is down. Viewership is down. It is surprising that the <Affiliation DbId="300004" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the Privy Council signed off on these massive bonuses to the executives. The Liberal government then wonders why Canadians coast to coast to coast are upset. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682781">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said that the budget deficit would then not go over $40 billion. I remember the hon. member standing in the House talking about how they will not have a deficit over $40 billion. However, the Parliamentary Budget Officer said the other day that we are headed to a deficit of nearly $47 billion. That is $7 billion over, nearly 20% over the original $40 billion that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said she would never go over. Are we surprised with any of this? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682782">The government then decided, because it needs money as it continues to print money and give bonuses and spread to its friends, to go after the capital gains. People who spent decades planning for their retirement are now being targeted by the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682783"> In the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Canada, so many are forced to line up today at food banks, which is a shame. What could we feed this country with $400 million? I have been to the Salvation Army in Saskatoon, which has a wonderful summer program that feeds kids at parks. It said today that one in four parents in this country had cut back on their own food consumption to ensure their children have enough to eat in the past year. In the past year alone, 58% of those who accessed the organization's food banks did so for the very first time. It was startling to hear that today. It is unbelievable what is going on in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682784">I have talked before about the fact that I come from a province that not only feeds Canada but feeds the world. It is the food basket of the world, and yet today there are more people in my province of Saskatchewan going to the food bank for the first time. I am very nervous. The holiday season is coming up. People in our communities, and everywhere in the country, are nervous about where they are going to get the extra cash needed for Christmas, but also for food. We are concerned about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682785">The Auditor General was very clear in the report that the fault falls clearly back on the government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who, in the words of the Auditor General, “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts given out to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682786">To give Canadians an idea of the Liberal corruption, I note there were 186 conflicts of interest. We have next week off and there is going to be a cabinet shuffle. I wonder if the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> will be one of those people shuffled out, because this is a disaster that Canadians are starting to take notice of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682787">I notice the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> cites The Hill Times. I keep citing Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail. Three weeks ago, the editorial said that Conservatives are right to ask for the unredacted papers. That is The Globe and Mail's editorial board. It is not The Hill Times, it is the editorial board of Canada's most successful newspaper. It is Canada's national newspaper. Even the board of The Globe and Mail agrees with the Conservatives, the opposition, that we are within our right asking for the unredacted documents. The parliamentary secretary keeps talking about The Hill Times, which most Canadians do not read, or do not even know what it is, but Canadians do know that The Globe and Mail stands for integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682788">We are concerned because there was a board member appointed by the green slush fund way back in 2016, just a year after Liberals took office, who runs a venture capital called, as we all have heard from day to day, Cycle Capital. Her company received a total of $250 million from this green slush fund. Some of that came before she was a board member, so that is fine, but $114 million came to the company she had invested in while she was on the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682789">When someone takes governance training, and I would think this company, SDTC, had governance training, they are told that as a member of the board, they must recuse themselves when the board is talking about their company. They must leave the room. We heard that several of these board members just stood in the back, waited for the vote and just nodded their head. Their company was up to receive money and they were watching to see what the board was going to do. This is governance 1.8. It is unreal that members of the board of governors would be allowed to stay in the boardroom as other members were talking about millions of dollars going to their companies. This is inexcusable at the lowest level of the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682790">How can the board members stay on the board when they are talking about giving millions of dollars to their company and they know first-hand that they should have left the room? They also know that it is not good that their company is getting money from SDTC, yet it has come about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682791">We have seen all the allegations, almost $400 million. That is ridiculous. Right now, Canadians from coast to coast are paying over 50% income tax in a lot of cases. They are upset over many things that our party has brought out over the last number of weeks in the House. They are upset with the carbon tax because they have now seen the playing field in this country shift dramatically with the election in the United States. There, they do not have a carbon tax. Our energy companies in my province of Saskatchewan and in Alberta are going to be under siege. They have been under siege since 2015, when the government took over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682792">There is an <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> who is completely against energy in this country. He would rather go to Venezuela. He would rather go to Russia and other diplomatic countries that we should not be dealing with on energy, rather then deal with the clean energy that we produce in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. We are concerned about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682793">We are going to see, and we have already seen, companies move their money down to Texas en masse. We have been concerned for a number of years, but now that President Trump has taken over, we are going to see a massive amount of money leave this country. One of the reasons is the carbon tax. The carbon tax has hurt this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682794">We will axe the tax. We will build the homes. I know that a lot of Liberals laugh at us on this side of the House because they say the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has a plan that makes no sense. Stu Niebergall is the executive director of the Regina and Region Home Builders' Association. Today, he said that the federal Conservative leader's promise to cut the general sales tax, better known as the GST, on new home construction is a brilliant idea that will save families hundreds of dollars a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682795">They estimate at least $250 a month on mortgage payments. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s proposal would apply to new homes worth up to $800,000. I can tell members that they can get a pretty good home in Saskatchewan for $800,000. They probably cannot in the Toronto area, the GTA, or Vancouver, but in our province of Saskatchewan, they could get a pretty good home for $800,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682796">That is from Regina, talking about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> coming through, cutting the GST. It would save young families trying to get into the housing market $250 a month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682797">In terms of stopping the crime and fixing the budget, I do not have to tell members about fixing the budget. I have talked for 18 minutes about the corruption of the Liberals, who have spent millions and millions of dollars. I could go through their corruption since I got elected in 2015, but we would be here all night. I am only going to talk about the green slush fund, which we know was worth $400 million. The sponsorship scandal was $42 million, and it took down the Chrétien government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682798">We could not give enough golf tees and golf balls away back then. That was $42 million. This is 10 times the amount. It is no wonder that they do not want to give the RCMP the unredacted documents. That would be historic for the Liberal Party. The green slush fund, as we all know in this country, is corrupt; it needs to be overhauled. It will take a Conservative government to overhaul it because the current government, since it came into power in 2015, has done nothing but destroy the green slush fund, which was SDTC to everybody who used it before 2015.</ParaText>

Whistle-blower legislation is very important. We stand with the whistle-blowers in this country because they should have the freedom to come to committees and talk about what they are seeing with the current government and the money that is not going where it should be going. I support every whistle-blower. It takes a lot of courage; I am going to say that. It is not easy being a whistle-blower in this country. They are in the line of fire because not only are they trying to get things right, but employees around them may look the other way. Certainly the government of the day does not believe in whistle-blowers because they are showing the corruption of the current Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682830"> Madam Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to rise in the House today to speak yet again to the issue of Liberal corruption. This is my second time rising in the House, and I will continue to rise as long as the Liberals refuse to hand over evidence to the RCMP. The Conservatives will not allow the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his caucus to hide the truth that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682831">It is deeply concerning to witness the government covering up yet another scandal. According to the program's website, SDTC was a government-funded program that claimed to help Canadian companies “develop and deploy sustainable technologies by delivering critical funding support at every stage of their journey—from seed to success.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682832">What the program's website does not tell Canadians is that SDTC became corrupt when the Liberals made changes to its board of directors in 2019 under the direction of the Liberal industry minister, whose appointments were made to the board. The website does not tell us that the companies owned by these appointed directors would soon be caught in conflicts of interest due to receiving the same funds they were responsible for handing out. The SDTC website does not tell us that Liberal insiders began to siphon funds into their own pockets and were getting rich for years, while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet turned a blind eye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682833"> How do we know this happened? Extremely brave whistle-blowers came forward to call out the corruption they saw while working at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Without their honesty, bravery and sense of morality, this scandal may have never been uncovered. Thanks to the whistle-blowers who flipped the spotlight on the corruption, the rats are now scrambling for cover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682834"> The investigations that occurred as a result revealed that SDTC's negligence was much more than just mismanagement of funds. Yes, I did say investigations, plural, because both the Ethics Commissioner and the Auditor General have reported findings that greed and corruption were allowed to thrive under the Liberal government's watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682835">Over the course of multiple investigations, including investigations by Conservatives at committee, it seems Parliament has only scratched the surface of the Liberal corruption. What started as tens of thousands of Canadian tax dollars being quietly directed to Liberal insiders turned into hundreds of thousands, which turned into millions, then tens of millions and finally hundreds of millions of dollars. Multiple investigations have revealed that through the green slush fund, $390 million in funding was approved for projects that had extremely disturbing conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682836"> What the Auditor General found, which was frightening, was evidence that the Liberals' green slush fund handed out $58 million to projects without a promise that contribution agreement terms were met. Another $58 million went to 10 projects deemed ineligible, as they, at times, could not prove an environmental benefit or were not developing green technology.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8682837">Finally, there was $334 million in over 186 cases where SDTC board members held a conflict of interest. Let that sink in. Out of the cases sampled, the Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest, and who knows how many more she will find. Maybe that is why the Liberals will not release the documents to the RCMP. Canadians listening can draw their own conclusions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682838">I am proud to say that upon discovering the gross negligence and potentially criminal acts, the Conservatives stood firm and demanded that a proper investigation take place. The Conservatives voted to pass an order in the House of Commons to force the Liberals to hand over documents involved in the green slush fund. We demanded that they be handed over to the RCMP so a proper investigation can take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682839">However, surprise, surprise, the Liberals voted against the document production and refused to release the documents to the House of Commons. This is undoubtedly a breach of parliamentary privileges, as the Speaker of the House of Commons has ruled. It is this breach of privilege that my Conservative colleagues continue to raise today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682840">Not only were the Liberals caught giving funds to their Liberal friends, but the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible was also exposed for handing out tax dollars to projects with no guarantee that the projects would have a positive environmental effect. Some SDTC fund recipients had no requirements to meet the environmental goal set out in the fund, and others were not eligible for funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682841">The Liberals failed to manage the program, leading to $390 million going into the bank accounts of Liberal insiders, which is precisely why the SDTC documents must be handed over to the RCMP so Canadians can understand just how corrupt the deal was and whether it was criminal. The situation proves once again that the Liberals are nothing more than fake environmentalists. We must hold the government accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682842">In my previous intervention on the topic, I listed several Liberal scandals that have been uncovered in the nine years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, such as the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the WE Charity scandal and the $9-million condo on Billionaire's Row in New York. There are many more to list, but I am sure the Liberals know which ones they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682843">All the blunders have a few things in common. They all have the fingerprints of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on them. They all involve Liberal negligence and the misuse of taxpayer dollars. Canadians are worse off for each and every scandal that the Liberals have created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682844">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has inflicted incredible damage on Canadians' well-being. Billions of Canadian tax dollars are being mismanaged by the Liberal government, and in some cases they are going directly to the Liberals' friends, with no real commitment to get results for Canadians who foot the bill. It has become clear that instead of working to ensure that Canadians have affordable food to eat, Liberals focus on ensuring that Liberals can fill their bank accounts. Instead of building enough affordable homes for Canadians to live in, Liberals choose to build bureaucracy and red tape. Canadians deserve a government that can benefit them, not just Liberal elites.</ParaText>

I would like to remind the Prime Minister that talk is cheap. I challenge him to support his words by acting on them.

It was the boy who FaceTimed his mother yesterday while she was at work in the office adjacent to mine saying that his father had been shot. It is her six-year-old son that told his grandmother last night that he failed his father because he could not protect him. He had surgery last night at Sunnybrook and had a bowel resection. They are waiting in a room in yet another crowded, overcapacity hospital. I am beside myself with anger and frustration. [This Prime Minister] is Canada's biggest terrorist. He is an economic vandal that has let criminals run rampant, and nothing is happening.

              <ParaText id="8682861"> Madam Speaker, in Adjournment Proceedings, we debate questions that were not answered properly in question period, when members of the opposition ask a question and the government refuses to answer or provides an unsatisfactory answer. This, indeed, is the case with the question that I asked on June 14. I noted that the Liberals had promised to be the most open and transparent government in history and had said that the data paid for by Canadians belonged to Canadians. I went on to say that the Conservatives forced the government to release some of the data the government had been suppressing relating to the cost of the carbon tax, and it showed the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> had in fact misled Canadians. I then asked if he would resign. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682862">The answer I got was quite unsatisfactory. He did not speak to the issue at all, but insisted that the Conservatives should resign since they did not agree with him about the carbon tax. We are here tonight to debate this question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682863">The reason I asked this question is that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and his department had withheld a report clearly stating that the cost of the carbon tax was an additional $30 billion, which had not been made public. They suppressed this information and prevented the Parliamentary Budget Officer from having it. The Parliamentary Budget Officer was forced to resort to the access to information system, which goes to the business of the government's promise of openness and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682864"> It promised in 2015 to be the most open and transparent government in Canadian history. It made a big deal about this. This was an important promise. For those of us who go back to the election in 2015, this promise was one of the ways the Liberals, really, ate the NDP's lunch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682865">The New Democrats, to their credit, have historically been very concerned about the secretive nature of a history's worth of Canadian governments. At least before they started propping up the Liberals, they were for openness and transparency. The Liberals took away that plank from their platform, copied it and promised openness and transparency, with sunny ways. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, they said. However, as I said in my question on June 14, that is a sick joke. The government is so secretive that, right now, Parliament is seized with its refusal to table documents related to SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682866">Getting back to the question, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> suppressed information about the carbon tax and gamed the access to information system, which was used to deny information to journalists, academics, regular Canadians and individuals who are in a conflict or have a grievance with the government. It is unfortunate that it would not release the information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682867"> I do not expect the parliamentary secretary to say the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has resigned as we asked for, but we have new reasons for him to resign. The scandals continue. We have a new scandal wherein he has perhaps conflicted himself in the SDTC scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8682876"> Madam Speaker, like I said, I am in adjournment debates all the time, so I know there are no points of order or anything like that. We are here to discuss an issue, but this is not the issue that he sent in when he requested a late show. He talked about PBO documents and an access to information request. That is misleading Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682877">The commissioner of the environment's report came out today indicating that our emissions are the lowest that they have been since the mid-1990s, and that is good news for Canadians. It is clear the Conservative Party is not focusing on emissions reductions or protecting the environment. It is not interested in climate change. Conservatives work for big oil and gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682878">We have proposed a cap on emissions and a cap on pollution for the oil and gas sector, primarily in Alberta, and Alberta MPs are standing in defiance of that because they do not want emissions to go down. They feel as though the oil and gas sector can continue to use Canada as an exhaust pipe. Sadly, the emissions intensity of many types of energy products in Alberta have gotten worse since the 1990s because of a lack of regulation. We have focused on emissions reductions and efficiency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8682879">The Conservative members claim to be experts on the environment and on oil and gas, but it is obvious, through their speeches in the House of Commons, that they are neither.</ParaText>
