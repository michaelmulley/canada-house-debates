If passed, the bill will amend the Canada Health Act to expand the definition of insured services to include community-based mental health addictions and substance use services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601674">Currently, provincial and territorial health plans are only required to cover mental health and substance use health services provided by physicians or in hospitals and deemed medically necessary. As a result, many services like counselling or psychotherapy are not covered under public health insurance plans. Without public coverage, many Canadians do not get the care need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601675"> Again, this landmark legislation would begin to address the disparity between mental and physical health in our health care system by creating a federal requirement for provinces and territories to include coverage of community-based supports in their health insurance plans and to ensure that timely, inclusive and accessible mental health and substance use care is enshrined into law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601676">I want to thank the Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health, the Canadian Mental Health Association and all those advocating for mental health parity and spreading the message that mental health is health, including my NDP colleagues who are wholeheartedly behind the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601689">We know service dogs that support people living with many neurodiverse conditions are becoming more common. These dogs are highly trained animals doing very specific jobs to assist their handlers with daily living. They assist their handlers in becoming contributing members of their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601690"> Currently, there are no specific guidelines around public access for service dogs in Manitoba and several other provinces and territories. Nor are there any licensing requirements. There are also many misconceptions that result in limited access and harassment for service dogs and their handlers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601691">The petitioners therefore request that the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> consult with his provincial counterparts, service dog trainers and handlers regarding the need for guidelines on public access; to consult with provincial counterparts, service dog trainers and handlers on licensing requirements for service dogs; consult with provincial counterparts to develop guidelines for public access and licensing requirements for service dogs; and consult with provincial counterparts to enter these guidelines and licensing requirements into federal and provincial legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601695">Madam Speaker, today I rise to table a petition on behalf of firefighters across Canada to address an urgent issue impacting the health and safety of firefighters. This petition was sponsored by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation>. It calls for immediate action to ban per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFASs, in firefighter gear and firefighting foam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601696">PFASs are man-made chemicals resistant to heat, water and oil, but their durability comes at a significant cost. Scientific evidence links these substances to health risks, including cancer, and puts firefighters at significant risks just by doing their jobs. Research shows that PFASs can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters already face a higher rate of cancer than the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601697">We must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control within their working conditions. Several countries have already restricted PFAS use. Canada must follow suit. Our firefighters deserve gear that is free from toxic chemicals. We need to protect those who put their lives on the line for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601699"> The community of Swan River is alarmed by the extreme levels of crime caused by the Liberal government's soft-on-crime laws, like Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Bill C-75 allows violent offenders to be in jail in the morning and back in our communities in the evening. Bill C-5 allows criminals to serve their sentences from home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601700">It is no surprise that after nine years of the Liberal government Statistics Canada reports that violent crime has risen by 50%. The people of Swan River see crime in their streets every day. That is why they are calling for jail, not bail, for violent repeat offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601701">The people of Swan River demand that the Liberal government repeal its soft-on-crime policies that directly threaten their livelihoods and their community. I support the good people of Swan River. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601703"> The petitioners, of their own accord, have observed that after nine years it is clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not worth the cost, the crime or the corruption. Further, the failed Prime Minister and his failed NDP-Liberal government have increased the cost of everything and failed to take responsibility for their failures.

              <ParaText id="8601712">Madam Speaker, the next petition draws attention to the human rights challenges in Eritrea, as well as foreign interference that is being caused by the Eritrean regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601713">By way of introduction, the petitioners note that Eritrea has been called the North Korea of Africa. It has been ruled by an authoritarian, brutal dictator under a totalitarian system for the last 30 years. It has no constitution, no elections, no parliament, no freedom of the press and no freedom of movement or association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601714">Eritreans continue to flee indefinite military conscription, religious persecution and political repression. Hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have fled to escape these severe human rights abuses. These abuses have been documented by the UN commission of inquiry on Eritrea. Many who flee still face intimidation and extortion from representatives of the regime. When members of a family seek refuge abroad, they worry about their family in Eritrea being harassed and forced to pay huge sums of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601715">The petitioners highlight various instances of foreign interference that have happened in Canada and elsewhere. They also highlight the collaboration between the Eritrean dictator and Vladimir Putin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601716"> Therefore, the petitioners call on the government to engage actively with Eritrean political and human rights activists and pro-democracy groups; to challenge the Eritrean dictator's human rights abuses at home and his strategic collaboration with other authoritarian powers, such as the Russian government; and to do more to combat foreign interference here in Canada to ensure that we do not have refugee or other immigration applicants who are affiliated with the regime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601717">The petitioners call for strengthened sanctions against human rights abusers in Ethiopia. They also want to see the release of a number of imprisoned parliamentarians, as well as Swedish Eritrean journalist Dawit Isaak, who I believe is the longest-imprisoned journalist in the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601720">The petitioners note that, since the summer of 1999, the Chinese Communist Party has undertaken an intensive persecution campaign seeking to eradicate Falun Gong. That persecution has included forced labour, brainwashing centres and prisons, and torture. Thousands of people have died as a result. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601721"> Further, the petition highlights the history of forced organ harvesting and trafficking that we have combatted in the House through a piece of legislation that finally passed in the current Parliament.</ParaText>

However, many people in Hong Kong have been arbitrarily charged and convicted simply because of their involvement with the pro-democracy movement. That includes national security law-related offences, as well as cases where people have been arbitrarily charged and convicted under other statutes, not the national security law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601728"> The petitioners call on the government to create a mechanism by which Hong Kong people with pro-democracy-related convictions may provide an explanation for such convictions. On that basis, the government could grant exemptions to Hong Kong people who would otherwise be deemed inadmissible based on this criminality determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601729">The petitioners also want to see our government work with other like-minded governments on a fair and reasonable mechanism to achieve this end.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601735">As has been described, what has effectively happened is that, after nine years, the NDP-Liberal government has completely lost the plot. There has been scandal after scandal, and the Auditor General of Canada's findings have continually shown all kinds of misgivings in terms of spending and any kind of compliance. In fact, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, turned into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. We have heard from a variety of different whistle-blowers about just how bad this is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601736">In fact, one SDTC whistle-blower said, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.”</ParaText>

It should never have taken two years for the issues to reach this point. What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601739">These quotes are exceptionally troubling. This is not the first time the current Parliament has had to have conversations that are very serious in nature regarding the government's trying to cover up scandal. One part that I am actually quite frustrated with when it comes to this particular piece is the number of conflicts of interest in which Liberal insiders were getting money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601740"> In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> served as a strategic adviser for a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital from 2009 to 2018, prior to joining cabinet. This was not a short period of time. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has entrusted the same person to handle Parks Canada. We have seen that this is an absolute failure in terms of what has happened in Jasper, where those at Parks Canada were either completely incompetent or negligent and let 30% of the homes in that community burn as a direct result of mismanagement. However, the minister still has shares in Cycle Capital, which is interesting, and this company actually got money from the green slush fund. It just continues to show the number of conflicts of interest, and this is where it becomes a serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601741"> We have Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet and to put food on their table. We are approaching Thanksgiving, yet the homes of 30% of the people in Jasper are gone. The NDP-Liberal government sat on its hands for the last nine years, mismanaging the forests because it failed to accept that the pine beetle was a real threat. There are emails. There is correspondence that went back and forth as to whether the government should consider the political optics of prescribed burns. The Liberals completely neglected forest management. Then, to add insult to injury, they turned away fire trucks and firefighters who were there, ready and willing to help. The Liberals also, interestingly enough, decided to install fire hydrants in the townsite of Jasper, but they were actually not compatible with the fire trucks in Alberta and British Columbia. This seems to be a total miss because it basically means that people are very limited in the amount of outside help they can get. That is because Parks Canada officials do not understand the western Canadian perspective. However, I digress here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601742">The problem is that the government has completely lost the plot. It continues to funnel money to Liberal insiders, giving them almost a blank cheque to mismanage Canadian funds. In addition, they put real people at risk day in and day out. It is exceptionally clear that Canadians have had enough. Every single weekend, when I go home to my riding of Fort McMurray—Cold Lake, I hear from people who tell me, “We just need an election. When are we going to have an election? We cannot handle the pressure of the mismanagement by the NDP-Liberal government any longer, with its waste, its corruption and its chaos.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601762">Madam Speaker, one of the things we continue to hear from the Liberals is around charter rights. I did not hear anything in the member's speech around charter rights that the Liberals have been talking about, so I was wondering whether she could mention a little bit about that. My understanding of the charter is that it protects individual Canadians from overreaches of the government; it does not protect the government from having to disclose documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601763">The Liberals also talk about the police needing to have independence. However, my understanding is that if a person sees a crime or if they are concerned that somebody has stolen from them, they call the police and provide them with the evidence that they think proves their case. In this case, we are asking for the documents so the House of Commons can pass the information on to the RCMP. What are the member's comments on this? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601764">Madam Speaker, I find it truly bizarre that the government has changed its tune as to why it cannot release the documents unredacted. It did release some of the documents, but they were redacted. It used a big black marker to cross out wide swaths of information because it does not want it to be seen. However, the interesting piece here is that the most recent argument as to why the documents cannot be released is supposedly charter rights. The government is failing to accept the privilege of Parliament and where we are at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601765">The Speaker has made a ruling on the case of privilege that is something exceptionally rare, or at least it was prior to the last nine years of the Liberal government, which thinks its job is to decide what Canadians do and do not get to see and what is best for Canadians. Frankly, I am going to stand up for Canadians each and every day, because they deserve better than this.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8601780">Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House on behalf of the hard-working people of Flamborough—Glanbrook. They indeed work hard for the tax dollars they send to every level of government, and they expect that those tax dollars will be respected and spent wisely. That is why it is unfortunate that we are here today talking about growing concerns of the Liberal government's corruption and incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601781">I am speaking about yet another scandal, this time involving the $400 million of taxpayers' money funnelled into a cesspool of corruption under the guise of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund. It is not just a singular incident of scandal; it is the latest in a long, disturbing pattern of Liberal ethics violations. The SDTC scandal is not about some missing dollars here or there; it is about the systemic failure of the government to uphold the most basic values of transparency and accountability. It is a gross breach of trust, one that has eroded Canadians' confidence in their government institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601782">Conservatives warned about this. We have consistently called for transparency. We have called for the documents to be sent unredacted from the green slush fund scandal and handed over to the RCMP. That was the will of Parliament. What was the response from the Liberal government? It was a refusal to comply. When the government ignores the will of Parliament, it is ignoring the will of Canadians, because members are here to represent the will of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601783">Let us be clear that when parliamentarians demand documents, we have the legal and democratic authority to do so, yet the government violated the privileges of parliamentarians by refusing to release the requested documents related to the latest scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601784">The Speaker of the House has ruled that parliamentary privilege has indeed been violated and that we must pause the work of the House until this corruption can be properly addressed. It is because, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278548" Type="2">Fort McMurray—Cold Lake</Affiliation> said, Canadians deserve better. They deserve to know where their hard-earned tax dollars are going, because they do work hard for the money that they pay in taxes on each paycheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601785"> However, with the Liberal government, every year we see a new scandal and a new abuse of trust. We have seen them before with the WE Charity scandal, the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Winnipeg lab cover-up, arrive scam, the infamous “other Randy” and of course now the SDTC scandal. This is just the latest chapter in a Liberal government that has been defined by corruption and secrecy. Enough is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601786">Let us first examine the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund and what it was supposed to be. SDTC was created with a noble goal in mind: to promote innovation and green technology. The fund was supposed to support small and medium-sized businesses, foster collaborations among sectors and enable the development of cutting-edge sustainable technologies that would benefit Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601787">However, it is clear that this vision has been utterly betrayed. Instead of serving as a driver for innovation and progress, the SDTC fund has been turned into a Liberal slush fund, a vehicle for funnelling millions of taxpayer dollars to the pockets of insiders and Liberal-connected businesses. Instead of supporting Canadians, it has supported the Liberal Party's friends and allies. The Auditor General's investigation found that there were 186 cases of conflict of interest, involving some $400 million paid out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601788">That is a lot of money, which could have been spent helping small businesses that are struggling. It is money that could have been spent purchasing over 400 MRI machines. It is money that could have been spent on proper equipment for our military so members do not have to buy their own helmet. As we recently saw, $34 million was spent on sleeping bags that did not work for Canadian winters, when it was less than 5°C, which of course is the temperature a good portion of the time in parts of Canada. Imagine that. We could have bought 10 times the number of proper sleeping bags for our military with the amount of money that was funnelled to Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601789">What kind of oversight allows this to happen? There was no oversight. The Auditor General made that clear. The blame for this scandal falls with the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation>. According to the Auditor General, he “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts that were being handed out to Liberal insiders. I would suggest this was not an accident or an oversight. There was negligence at the highest levels of government and a misuse of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601790">The Auditor General's investigation revealed an astounding 186 conflicts of interest. Those are 186 instances where taxpayer money could have gone to real innovation, to families struggling with the cost of living and to businesses trying to stay afloat. Instead, the money was funnelled to companies with ties to senior Liberal officials. What kind of government allows this? How can Canadians trust the government when it behaves like this? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601791">The SDTC fund received, overall, a billion dollars in federal funding, and yet $400 million of that was funnelled into ineligible projects. These were projects that by all measures should never have received a single dollar of public funding. The promises made in these applications were overstated, exaggerated or, in some cases, non-existent. This was wilful negligence. These insiders had projects rubber-stamped, knowing full well they did not meet the criteria. A blind eye was turned so the gravy train could keep flowing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601792">Canadians deserve answers on this. The people of Flamborough—Glanbrook who send their hard-earned tax dollars here want to know where that money went. What did the government do when we, as elected representatives, demanded transparency? It violated parliamentary privilege by refusing to hand over critical documents related to this scandal. The Speaker made it clear that Parliament has the right, actually, the duty, to demand that these documents go unredacted to the RCMP, as was the motion of this Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601793">We are here to hold the government accountable, to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and in the best interest of Canadians. I am here specifically on behalf of the people of Flamborough—Glanbrook to watch over their taxpayer dollars. The Liberals have thumbed their noses at Parliament, at the Speaker and at the Canadian people. As their excuse, they claim handing over these documents would blur the line between Parliament and the judiciary. It is not about blurring lines; it is about protecting their friends and hiding their corruption. It is about a government so entrenched in scandal, so determined to shield its insiders, that it is willing to trample on the very principles of transparency that underpin our democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601794">As we stand here discussing yet another glaring example of Liberal mismanagement, it is impossible not to draw comparisons to another scandal that took place, which was mentioned by one of my colleagues earlier this week in debate, and that is the ad scam scandal. At that time, we know, this was a scandal where the Liberal government used public funds for private gain. This was in the early 2000s and involved 40 million public dollars that was funnelled through advertising agencies for work that was never done or was grossly overpaid. That is $40 million, which is no small sum—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8601808">Madam Speaker, the $40 million in ad scam was certainly no small sum, but that is one-tenth the amount of money we are talking about with this current scandal. When we look at the current scandal, we have a government refusing to turn over documents, as is the will of Parliament, to the RCMP. Back then, the ad scam was a scandal that actually brought down the government. There was the Gomery commission, which was set up to investigate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601809">It did not just question lower-level bureaucrats or party functionaries. It questioned high-profile individuals, the very heart of the Liberal government of the time, to explain their roles in the misuse of public money. Political operatives, heads of agencies, senior ministers, even the prime minister at that time, were dragged in front of an inquiry. That scandal actually brought down the Liberal government of the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601810">We find ourselves here today talking on a motion of privilege about a scandal that has ten times the financial impact of what we saw back then. What we see from the current Liberal government is stonewalling. The Liberals refuse to hand over the documents that the House has ordered. We have to ask what they have to hide. How bad are the SDTC documents that they would require Parliament to grind to a halt rather than face the consequences of handing them over unredacted?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601811">The Gomery commission exposed a culture of corruption within the Liberal Party that was deeply rooted at that time. This culture seems to have permeated to the current government, which puts personal gain over the interests of Canadians. Now, with the SDTC scandal, we see the same playbook. Liberal insiders are benefiting from the misuse of taxpayer dollars, while the government does everything it can to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601812">Canadians deserve transparency, accountability and leadership that understands the value of every taxpayer dollar. The government in the early 2000s, at the time of the ad scam, was held accountable for its misdeeds and faced the electorate, who sent a very clear message about the need for transparency. Just as the ad scam marked the end of an era for that Liberal government, we certainly hope it is the beginning of the end for the current government, so we can have a new type of government to lead this great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601813">Let us not forget about another, more recent example of Liberals' rampant misuse of taxpayer money, the arrive scam scandal. An app that arguably could have been developed with a case of beer and a few techie people in the basement of someone's house over the weekend was going to cost taxpayers $80,000 but in the end ballooned to $60 million. That is what we know about so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601814">At the centre of that scandal was, as we know, GC Strategies, which was a two-person IT firm that actually did not do any of the work but rather was simply a middleman, brokering contracts. Even the subcontractors did not perform a lot of the work or make an app that worked properly. This is, again, another example. The reason we raise this is because it speaks to a pattern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601815">Taxpayers deserve answers about what is happening here with the Liberal government and this particular green slush fund scandal. I wonder how Canadians can trust the government when it refuses to follow basic principles of transparency and hand over the documents, as requested by Parliament, to the RCMP. How can we believe in a government that has repeatedly put the interest of its ministers, insiders and friends above the interests of Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601816">The SDTC scandal is just the latest in a long line of breaches, cover-ups and corrupt behaviour. The Liberal government has shown us time and time again that it will do whatever it takes to protect itself and its friends. We saw that in its proroguing of Parliament back with the WE Charity scandal, but also in its refusing to release documents with the Winnipeg lab scandal, and other cover-ups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601817">There is a very clear pattern. The government chooses secrecy over transparency, corruption over accountability, greed over public good.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601818">Let me clear. The cost of this corruption is not just the billions of dollars of mismanaged funds. It is also the erosion of public trust. Canadians are struggling right now, and they are seeing $400 million going to line the pockets of Liberal insiders, all while small businesses are fighting to stay open, mortgage holders are renewing their mortgages and facing a whopping increase in their mortgage payments, and seniors are going to the grocery store. We have seen a 36% increase in grocery prices in Canada, which is ahead of what we have seen in the U.S., so grocery inflation is worse here. All of these things are happening, and our communities are struggling with the fact that money is being wasted and with the carbon tax. What we see from the Liberal government is our hard-earned tax dollars being wasted by going to the pockets of Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601819">The government has focused on protecting its friends rather than helping Canadians, and Canadians see this. Every dollar of that money that was misused by the government, every dollar that was funnelled to friends and insiders, is a dollar that could have went to a family to help put food on the table, to a struggling small businesses, to a community that is struggling with various issues or to defending our north, but instead it went to the pocket of a Liberal insiders. Canadians have had enough, and they are tired of the excuses. They are tired of the corruption, and they are tired of a government that refuses to be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601820">The Conservative Party is committed to restoring that accountability, and we believe that taxpayers' money should be respected and should be spent responsibly on projects that actually benefit Canadians, not enrich the pockets of insiders. Taxpayer dollars need to be monitored properly and conflicts of interest need to be eliminated. We have seen the Auditor General comment on the 186 cases of conflict of interest. Safeguards need to be put in place. It is time for a change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601821">Only a Conservative government would make the changes necessary to restore accountability and put Canadians first to ensure that taxpayer dollars are respected and spent on projects that actually make a difference. We will fight for that transparency. We will fight for that accountability. That is why we are asking that the will of Parliament be respected and that the documents be turned over, unredacted, to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601822">Before I close, I would like to move that the amendment be amended by adding, after proposed subparagraph (a)(ii), the following: (ii.1) the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, who respected the order of the House and deposited unredacted documents; (ii.2), Paul MacKinnon, the former deputy secretary of the cabinet, governance. He was briefed by the Privy Council Office in the context of the Winnipeg lab documents, that in the event that parliamentarians press for the release of confidential information, the appropriate minister or ministers should take responsibility for the decision to provide or to withhold the information, and who, in turn, advised the government House leader that, consistent with the principles of responsible government, the ultimate accountability for deciding what information to withhold from or release to parliamentarians resides with the responsible minister.</ParaText>

It is like a crocodile knocking on one's door, offering to babysit their children and saying, “Trust me on transparency.” If someone has no sense of the history, it might sound like a great idea to let the crocodile in the house, but we do have a sense of history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601828">There is a blatant hypocrisy in the Conservatives talking about accountability on documents, when Stephen Harper was found in contempt of Parliament and shut down Parliament for three months. It was found to be threatening the very Constitution. What was that over? That was over the issue of the torture of people in Afghanistan. It let down Canada's standards around the world and suppressed evidence that parliamentarians had a right to. Stephen Harper did not care at all about transparency, and neither did the Conservatives because they shut down Parliament and refused to let us work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601829"> When I hear the Conservatives talking about transparency and accountability, I refer to Tony Clement and his $50-million slush fund, to Nigel Wright and the secret $90,000 cheque, and to Brian Mulroney and money in a brown paper bag being paid in a hotel room. That is Conservative accountability and transparency in a nutshell.</ParaText>

Nearly $400 million, nearly a half a billion taxpayers' dollars, has been spent and issued to friends and has been deemed, in over 186 cases, to have been issued in direct conflict of interest. This is raising serious concerns across the country among Canadians as to how their tax dollars are being utilized and really how they are being abused by this current government.

I can tell members I have the privilege of visiting and talking with Canadians in my region and those in New Brunswick and hearing what they are saying, and what they are saying is very clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601857"> It is direct. They are tired of what they are seeing. They are frustrated, but more concerning is that they are truly troubled by what they see happening within Canada. I hear it expressed over and over again. This does not feel like the Canada that we grew up in. This does not feel like the Canada that we have come to love and adore. There is a cloud over us, and somehow they are wishing and longing for that cloud to break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601858">We are in the midst of this uncertainty and malaise. We have scandal after scandal and dysfunction after dysfunction, and it seems that the great ship of Canada is rudderless, lost upon a sea in a gale without a sail, wondering who is at the helm steering the ship. Canadians are getting concerned, and they are saying that we need a change in direction and that if we do not get that change in direction, they are very worried about the direction that we are going as a country. It is time for change, and that voice is being heard more and more in every conversation that I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601859">I was reflecting on what I would share today, and it is funny how things come back to me. I recalled a book that I had read many years ago. It was written by someone who worked in a senior position in the White House, a previous administration of over two decades ago. This lady was writing of her experiences, and she was telling how after a very traumatic event in her time of service she was taking the commuter train on her way back to the White House, and she was rocked and emotionally distraught.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601860">She looked at the time, and she remembers very clearly when she looked down at her watch, and it hit her. She thought, “Right now, I personally, and our country collectively, and our world collectively, are ten minutes past normal.” Hence the name of her book, <I>Ten Minutes from Normal</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601861"> What I hear, coming from Canadians coast to coast to coast, is something very similar. Canadians feel like we, as a country, are somewhere past normal, and not just 10 minutes but perhaps nine years. They are feeling a malaise and a heaviness in their hearts, saying that we are not the country we used to be, we do not have the priorities we once had and we do not have the confidence that we used to have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601862"> Canadians are not used to seeing the displays that we are seeing in our streets. It has troubled and rocked all Canadians, and I am sure it did all members of this House, to see the Canadian flag being burnt, and hear chants of “Death to Canada” and death to our allies going up from our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601863"> People are concerned. They are saying that this is not the Canada they envisioned. This is not the Canada of their childhood. This is not the Canada where we could dream of having families, building a home, and being able to live, thrive and pursue those things that they thought were lofty ideals but yet felt were still attainable. Right now, there is insecurity. There is fear. Canadians are feeling like they are a long ways past a place called normal. They are almost longing for normal like a long-lost friend. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601864">I am hearing it from our seniors. They are dealing with the rising cost of living, and they are wondering, on a fixed income, how they can make ends meet at the end of the month. Then they see billions of dollars going out the door, and hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on those who are well-connected to government. That troubles them. They get frustrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601865"> I hear it in the voices of young couples who are dreaming of one day building a home, but that seems so distant. Now they are wondering when they can actually move out of mom and dad's place. They are not even sure if they can afford rent, because it has doubled and tripled in some places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601866">I hear it in the voices of families who are struggling just to pay the bills. They have more bills at the end of the month than they have paycheques. They are wondering how they can keep their kids in sports, let alone plan to pay for their college or university. They are struggling under the burden of the soaring cost of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601867"> I see it in the faces of our energy and resource workers, and those who work in our mills and our factories. Their livelihoods have been assaulted through oppressive legislation and burdensome and cumbersome regulation. They are saying all they wanted to do was make a good living for their family. They are crying out for change. They are saying that we are somewhere past normal, where an honest day of work made a decent paycheque, where Canadians could still dream and even maybe take the odd vacation with their family. That is getting further out of reach for more Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601868"> Citizens are feeling increasingly threatened by rising rates of crime. Even in rural communities like the areas I represent, they are genuinely concerned. The addictions epidemic is touching family after family. Despair has been rising. Why is this happening? It is because we are like a people adrift and our leadership has no vision for the future of our country. Inscribed on our beloved Peace Tower, right here in Centre Block, is that famous verse, timeless and true, “Where there is no vision, the people perish”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601869"> Right now, in Canada, we are struggling as a result of a visionless leadership, and a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a government that seem to have no overarching goals or high ideals for us to attain, other than preserving their place in power. Right now, Canadians are saying that they want to be the priority again. They want their dreams and aspirations to be attainable again. They want to be able to make a decent living, provide for their families and pursue those things that they have longed for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601870"> Canadians love our country and want what is best for our country. They are saying that what we need is a leadership that gets it.</ParaText>

On this side of the House, under the leadership of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, the Leader of the Opposition, we have a vision where taxes can be axed, budgets can be fixed, houses can be built and crime can be stopped. It is a common-sense, Conservative vision that is from the ground up and not from the top down.

That opportunity is before us, and it is rising from our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601872">I could not help but reflect on an old story. It took me back because I find when we are talking about these matters and we are talking with Canadians, we hear almost a homesickness in their voices. They are longing for a place called home. It is like the Canada they love. They are saying, “Oh, I feel homesick for that.” Have others ever experienced homesickness? I have. As a young person, I remember feeling it. It is not a good feeling. It is a lonely and rough feeling to experience, and it was captured so well by the great actor who has now passed. Members will recognize his name: the great Robin Williams. Perhaps some members have watched the old film that has been out several years now, <I>Patch Adams</I>. It is a great story, a story of Dr. Patch Adams. It is amazing and Robin Williams does a great job in it. He opens the movie with this monologue, and it captures what we are experiencing. It says:</ParaText>

How small you can feel, and how far away home can be. Home. The dictionary defines it as both a place of origin and a goal or destination....

They have been wandering, as it were, a long way from home, wondering if they could ever get back there, but they are discovering the right path before them and that will lead them to a home; to a Canada where opportunity abounds, freedom thrives and where we can all belong and where we can all become all that we once dreamed of. That home is not that far away and we can get there if we make the right choices in the coming election. I appreciate this time. It is a joy to be before this House.</ParaText>

Many of the provinces and regions of the country do not have as much wealth to generate, and we are thankful that we had a prime minister, a little over nine years ago, who fostered an atmosphere where people could grow, develop, thrive and prosper. He was proud of our energy sector, proud of our resource sector and proud of what Canadians could build. He stood up for Canada and stood up for Canada's workers rather than talk down Canada's regions, talk down Canada's livelihoods and talk down Canadian workers. Canadians had a prime minister who stood on their side, and I think they want one who will do the same thing. </ParaText>

The new green economy was just an excuse to create the slush fund for him and his corrupt Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601907">Along with this scandal there are massive conflicts of interest and massively corrupt misuses of taxpayers' money, at a time when there are two million Canadians lining up at food banks in a single month, with a million more projected for this year, a third of whom are children. For the first time in my entire life in Canada, one in four Canadians is now skipping meals. That is not something I thought Canada would be associated with, but that is the sad reality. As Canadians continue to line up at food banks, the corrupt Liberal-NDP government continues to line the pockets of its insiders. As they get richer, Canadians are getting poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601908"> There is no hope under the government, which once promised the Canadian dream for millions of Canadians. Whether they have lived here there entire life or moved here for a better future, it is gone; it has become a nightmare. They cannot afford a home. They cannot afford groceries. They cannot fill up a tank of gas like they used to without getting hit with high taxes. All of this is only done so that the Liberal-NDP government can continue to shovel millions and billions of dollars toward rich Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601909">What is the government doing right now? It is doing anything and everything it can to avoid accountability. It is literally blocking and hiding documents. These documents are so damning that it is doing everything in its power to not have them released, including seizing Parliament and freezing it the way it is right now. One thing is clear: The Liberal-NDP government never acts in the best interests of Canadians. The Liberals only care about the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601910">That the government does not want to turn over these documents is a clear sign that there is corruption on many levels, which the Liberals are trying to hide. There is wrongdoing, something so damning to them that they cannot afford to have it come to light so Canadians can see clearly how corrupt the Liberal-NDP government really is. It covers up and blocks this investigation so it can continue to fill the pockets of Liberal insiders. The $400 million of taxpayers' money is not a small amount, at all, for everyday Canadians, but not for the Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601911">Money was sent to board members of these companies that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> created a slush fund for to reward them. The Liberal-NDP government talks a big game about going green and the economy of the future, but it is so clear that these are all just words to cover up the corruption so the Liberals can try to get away with it. However, Canadians are smarter than that. With the record of the Liberal-NDP government, Canadians question anything and everything because they know the government does not have their best interests in mind. All the government does is take advantage when someone is down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601912">As I said before, during the pandemic, the government did everything it could in order to reward its friends. Now, at a time when Canadians are lining up at food banks, it does not care. It created a slush fund of $400 million for its Liberal insider buddies. Whether this money was stolen or wasted, Canadians cannot afford to feed or house themselves now, yet they see a corrupt government that continues to feed more corruption to its insiders. That is the track record of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601913">Canadians are paying for this corruption and greed. They are the only ones being affected. This does not hurt the trust-fund <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his other cronies. It does not affect carbon tax Carney or any of the other corrupt insiders who are rewarded for doing absolutely nothing except being friends of the Prime Minister. Everyday Canadians are those hit with higher costs on gas, groceries and home heating, and for what? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601914">In everything the government has done, it has always tried to put a blanket over Canadians' eyes with some type of buzzword. That is how it sold the carbon tax scam. When it first tried to sell this to Canadians, the government said it would introduce a carbon tax that would increase every year and fix the environment. It said that all the forest fires and floods would go away, and it would make sure there would be sunny ways and sunny days for everybody. That was one really big lie it sold under the guise of the environment or climate change. Those were the buzzwords for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601915">Because Liberals do not respect the intellect of Canadians, they said that Canadians would pay into a tax and the government would give them more than they pay. That was another blatant lie by the government under the buzz phrase “climate change”, which all ties into the green slush fund. Both of those lies were proven wrong by their own Parliamentary Budget Officer. Forest fires and floods have not been fixed as a result of the government starting to raise Canadians' taxes. In fact, the environment department admitted that the carbon tax scam is not measured on how much emissions go up or down. It is all a fairy tale.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601916">The second side to it, which the Parliamentary Budget Officer confirmed once again today, is that the majority of households are worse off in what they pay for this scam than what they get back in these so-called rebates. Canadians know that. They do not need anyone to tell them that. They see it every time they fill up a tank of gas, whether to go to work or to drop their kids off at sports or tutoring. When they go to the grocery store, they see prices have gone up. Because it is getting cold now, they turn up the heat in their houses and they see it when they get their bills. They know it has been a scam all along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601917">I will never forget, when I was first running for election, going to the door of a single mom in one of the communities in my constituency. When I introduced myself, she told me to hang on. She closed the door, took about a minute and came back with tears in her eyes, holding a bill. It was her natural gas bill. I will never forget this. She had a sign on her lawn because her house was for sale. She had to sell her house because she had just been laid off from her oil and gas job, and she was already saying that it was because of the policies of the Liberal government. We already heard about Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and the damaging impacts it had on Canadians, our industry and our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601918">This constituent was one of the people affected by the bill. She has two kids. First, she said that she had to sell her house because she could not afford to pay her mortgage anymore. She needed to feed her kids. With tears in her eyes, she then showed me her natural gas bill. She pointed to the line that shows the carbon tax and said that she and her parents had been heating their houses the same way her whole life. She asked, “Why am I being punished with this carbon tax now? What did I do wrong?” She had not changed anything. She had lost her job and wanted to know why she was being punished because it was cold outside. What did she do wrong? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601919">That is the pain the Liberal-NDP government refuses to understand. Its members refuse to acknowledge the pain it causes to these families, all under the guise of climate change. They use these buzzwords and think they can get away with all the corruption. It is the same single mom who will now have higher taxes because the Liberal-NDP government, under the guise of climate change, wants to reward its friends so it can collect more from Canadians, the same ones who are lining up at the food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601920">Liberals do not care that they get hit with all these scandals. It is their track record. That is who they are. They do not care about Canadians. Biggie Smalls once sang <I>Mo Money Mo Problems</I>. With the government members, it seems to be “mo scandals, mo taxes”. Canadians get hit with more taxes because of their scandals. The government members are less concerned about accountability and governing this country; they would rather keep protecting themselves from accountability by covering up as much as they can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601921">In committee after committee, the common-sense Conservatives bring these scandals to light, but the Liberals are okay and laugh it off because they know they have a partner in corruption in the NDP. Many times, Conservatives bring forward motions and studies so Canadians can see accountability for their money, but the Liberals just laugh it off every single time. Their accomplices and partners in the NDP are covering up these scandals, and the Liberals know they do not need to worry. At the end of the day, Canadians have to pay for all of that. Liberals are totally okay with that because they can all just hide under this cloud of climate change somehow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601922">During the pandemic, we saw the WE Charity scandal, where $900 million went to Liberal insiders who paid off the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. There was no accountability until common-sense Conservatives brought this scandal forward. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8601923">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would rather prorogue Parliament, as we have seen, than face accountability. That is exactly who he is. He is someone who has probably never filled a gas tank in his life or gone grocery shopping before. That is exactly why he does not care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601924">The arrive scam scandal sent $60 million to Liberal crony insiders for an app that did not work and that nobody wanted. Once again, under the guise of the pandemic, the corrupt Liberal-NDP government tried to reward its insiders. There were people who literally did no work and got paid off. As Liberal insiders line their pockets and Canadians line up at food banks, the NDP has helped get the corrupt Liberal government through all these scandals one by one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601925">The SNC-Lavalin case not only unravelled a lot of the corruption and scandals of the government but also proved how much of a fake feminist the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> truly is. When his brave indigenous justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, stood up to his corruption, what did he do? He did not admit it. He did not take any accountability or responsibility. He fired her. As a fake feminist would, he threw her under the bus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601926">Not only is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> corrupt and scandal ridden, but he also proved how much of a fake feminist he is through that scandal. That is a pattern of the Prime Minister, of being a fake feminist and throwing women under the bus when they stand up to his corruption. He is full of scandals and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601927">This $400-million scandal is on Canadians once again. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gets to be corrupt. He gets to do whatever he wants to reward his Liberal insiders because it is all on Canadians' dime. He has the Canadian credit card in his hand, and he is spending as though there is no limit. All we have seen from the Liberal-NDP government is more scandals, more corruption and more cover-ups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601928">The economy is in the toilet right now. We know the carbon tax scam puts a big hole in our GDP, but because of the failed policies, GDP per person in this country keeps on declining. It is at a lower level today than it was in 2014.

              <ParaText id="8601996">On June 10, the House was clear when it gave the government the order to submit a series of documents to the law clerk of the House so that he could hand them over to the police. Why did it do that? That is the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601997">The Liberals get all worked up, saying that it is crazy, that we cannot hand over documents to the police, that we cannot do their job for them. The Conservatives say that it is crazy, that the Liberals across the aisle are corrupt, that they do not want to hand over the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601998">In fact, the answer may be somewhere in between, because we still do not have enough information, so we cannot yet say whether they are corrupt. Neither can we say whether the documents should be given to the police. What we can say is that this whole thing smells, that money was mismanaged, and that, for that reason, we are justified in asking for access to the documents to see what really happened. That is why we support this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8601999">It all began at the end of 2022, when whistle-blowers informed the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and the Privy Council, in other words the government, that they were uncomfortable with the way that Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, was being managed. In 2023, things took off. An audit conducted by Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton appeared to confirm what the whistle-blowers had said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602000">At that time, the government appeared to be stalling. The whistle-blowers grew impatient, disappointed at the government's failure to act. We began seeing leaks in the media, which increased the pressure. Then, the president and CEO resigned, followed by the chair who managed the fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602001">On June 4, 2024, a bomb went off, figuratively of course, when the Auditor General decided to investigate the fund because she, too, had been alerted. She looked at 58 out of a total of 420 projects. That is a substantial number of projects, but she did not look at them all. In the 58 projects she looked at that spanned from April 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, she mostly found serious governance issues. Conflict of interest management was sorely lacking. Some directors voted for the allocation of funds to businesses in which they had a personal interest. That is the sort of thing that does not usually happen. It is basic good judgment. Usually, directors with a personal interest recuse themselves. It appears, however, that the people around that particular table did not possess good judgment.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602002"> The Auditor General found 90 cases of conflict of interest amounting to $76 million. Obviously, we do not have the details, but we would like to. She found 10 ineligible projects with funding that totalled $59 million. She only looked at 58 projects out of 420, but she discovered all that. Imagine if she had reviewed all 420 projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602003">We do not have all the details. That is why on June 10 the House asked for access to the documents. We are now into October, and June 10 is starting to feel like ancient history. Five months have gone by, but the government has not responded to the House's order yet. When the other side of the House claims that this question of privilege is not justified, I would reply that there are limits. This question of privilege is totally justified. The Liberals may not like it, but it is not up to them to decide how the House votes. They do not hold a majority; they are the minority. They are not above Parliament, but beholden to it. There is a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602004">The only limit on the House's ability to demand information is the House's good judgment, not the government's willingness to comply. The government must honour Parliament's orders. It is not a choice or an option; it is an obligation. If the Liberals are unhappy with the composition of Parliament, all they have to do is call an election. We will see whether they are happier with that result.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602005">In fact, that is the principle behind responsible government. It was the main demand of the Patriots. People died for that. The British Crown burned down villages and put people in prison. Some were deported, while others were hanged. Ten years later, the people had responsible government. Almost two centuries later, I hope that the Liberal government will have the courage to honour this principle, the legacy left by the Patriots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602006">As for Sustainable Development and Technology Canada, SDTC, I have my own little story. In 2019, I was the economic development and industry critic. Navdeep Bains was minister of industry at the time. Good student that I am, I looked into the portfolios assigned to the minister to see how money was being spent under his watch, and I discovered the existence of the famous fund managed by SDTC. I wondered what the purpose of the fund was, so I looked into that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602007">I found that the fund's mission was to “support Canadian companies with the potential to become world leaders [in clean technology]”. That was interesting. I wanted to know which companies and consortiums had benefited from funding. Names like Shell Canada, TransCanada Pipeline, Suncor Energy, Colonial Pipeline Company, Enbridge and Pipeline Research Council International came up—all nice French names by the way. It seems to me that when we talk about world leaders in clean technology, these are not the companies we think of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602008"> In 2016, the fund gave a $5-million grant to a Calgary-based company to test and market a technology that would make it possible to exploit deeper or hard-to-reach oil sands deposits. Money was taken from a fund for green technologies to help get more oil out from deeper in the ground. That is what the money was used for. Money for green technologies was literally diverted to benefit the oil companies. I was scandalized. We were paying the polluter, which made no damn sense. In fact, only the Bloc Québécois condemned this at the time, not the NDP or the Liberals, and especially not the Conservatives. It made the front page of the Journal de Montréal, but that was not enough to change anything. I could understand the Conservatives, who wake up each morning and check the oil share prices but, in the case of the other parties, we have a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602009">More specifically, I analyzed the years 2011 to 2015 to compare what happened with the green fund under the Conservatives and under the Liberals. Under the Conservatives, between 2011 and 2015, $50 million from the green fund went to companies connected to the oil and gas sector. Between 2015 and 2019, it is the same story: $50 million was misappropriated by the Liberals to the benefit of oil and gas companies. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Oil companies have already loaded up on taxpayer money to the tune of billions of dollars, but I guess that was not enough. They had to steal money from the green fund too. If we scratch the Liberals' green veneer, it will soon be apparent that it is completely brown underneath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602010">The Liberals promised us they would change, that they would bring a halt to oil company subsidies. They have since changed their vocabulary and no longer talk about this. They talk about ending inefficient subsidies. Not quite the same thing, is it. I would like to know what an efficient oil subsidy is. The fact is that they promised to reduce subsidies to oil companies, so the Bloc members put two and two together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602011">We told ourselves that things were not going well for the Liberals and that they would get smoked if an election were held. Basically, we wanted to give them a chance by giving them the opportunity to keep their promises. We were prepared to forestall an election call for now and let them enjoy their holidays. In exchange, though, we proposed something that would even have helped them keep their promises. To me, helping them keep their promises is not that bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602012">As we know, seniors have been hit hard by inflation. The Liberals created two classes of seniors, and those aged 65 to 74 got nothing at all during this time. Our proposal was simple: Funding pensions by cutting oil subsidies a bit. Last week, believe it or not, they said no. They are unable to take money earmarked for oil companies and spend it on seniors instead, but they are able to take money from the green fund and hand it to oil companies. They do not have money for seniors, but for oil companies raking in billions of dollars a year, it is an open bar.</ParaText>

Ultimately, when they do not want to hand over documents or give the public what it needs, we will not stand alongside them. We will continue working to ensure that Quebeckers get their money and that the documents will be made public.</ParaText>

I would like to thank him for this reminder because I sense that the government and the official opposition have forgotten that this is precisely the mandate voters gave us during the last general election. Essentially, they told us they did not want either the government or the opposition gumming up the works or trying to manage things as though they alone were lord and master of parliamentary proceedings. Rather, the parties should get along the way they should in a minority government. That was the mandate given to the government. It was to get along and get things done. It was neither to call elections nor impede the business of Parliament.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8602031">Mr. Speaker, I heard the beginning of the speech given by my colleague from Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères in which he put enormous pressure on me to deliver a quality speech. I will do my best not to disappoint him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602032">Honestly, there are several reasons why I am happy to speak on this subject today. First, it affords me the opportunity to comment on the question of transparency, accountability and the moral duties we must carry out when we agree to serve our constituents in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602033">Maybe I was naive, but when I decided to get involved in politics, I had principles and values, among them respect for institutions. I am convinced that we 33 Bloc Québécois members share this value and the desire to do our jobs while respecting institutions. Imagine that, a sovereignist Bloc member is saying that we are here to do our job while respecting the rules of the Parliament of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602034">One of these rules is that it is up to the House to decide certain things, for example, the documents it wants to have in its possession, the documents it wants to obtain in various situations. Regardless of the situation, the fact remains that it is up to the House to determine the relevancy and necessity of obtaining some document or another. This is not a decision that the House may take and the government can treat as it sees fit. It is incumbent upon the government to respect the will of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602035">The Liberals are arguing that the RCMP says that this would be injecting politics into a police investigation, and that if it wants documents it has the means of requesting them. There is truth in that, but what we are asking for and what we agree on is that an order by the House Speaker be respected. Regardless of the Liberal members' arguments on this motion of privilege, the fact remains that it boils down to a ruling by the Speaker following a request by the House of Commons and its members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602036">I do not understand why they insist on obstructing. I do not understand why they keep doing as they please and determining what is and is not relevant in the Speaker's rulings. Honestly, I fail to understand the strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602037">Maybe they have something big to hide. Maybe they are trying to protect something big. Who knows. I do not even care to get into the theories about the scandal. The Conservatives have led the way on that, but they are in no position to lecture anyone about such things. If it is something they are trying to hide, it must be one whale of a secret. They are risking the survival of their fragile government, and they are delaying proceedings that could help them gain a friend until the holiday season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602038"> This will hardly come as a scoop but there are currently two Bloc Québécois bills being used as preconditions for the Bloc's support of the Liberal government. The clock is ticking on both bills, and time is running out. If passed and implemented by October 29, they could guarantee the Bloc's support of this government until at least the holiday season, because both bills would be good for seniors aged 65 to 74 in Quebec and across Canada. I am talking about Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>, introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, which has the support of all seniors groups. In a Canada-wide survey, 79% of respondents supported this Bloc demand. I do not understand why the Liberals are stubbornly dragging their feet on these important proceedings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602039">The other piece of legislation, every bit as important and another of the Bloc's demands in exchange for supporting the government—until the holidays, anyway—is Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document>, which seeks to exclude supply management from any future trade negotiations. The bill is currently being blocked in the Senate by senators Boehm and Harder, whose arrogance defies comprehension.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602040"> One of the senators went so far as to insult my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, when he appeared before the Senate committee two weeks ago. The senator called him “special”, but not in a very flattering way. This unelected senator criticized the hard work of a member who has worked for years with farmers and agricultural producers in the supply management system to craft a quality piece of legislation. It was insulting. Both senators are blocking the democratic process, and that is shameful. I make no bones about it, I find that shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602041">When we ask the Liberals questions in the House, they respond as though we were born yesterday and have just fallen off the turnip truck. They say they have no control over senators they appointed to the Senate, that these are independent senators. Sure. No one thinks that Liberal appointees to the Senate are purely independent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602042">Frankly, I do not get their strategy, especially since the last time I checked the polls, the Liberals were at 22% nationally and were projected to capture 53 seats. That means that if the numbers hold up, 107 Liberal members will be gone after the next election. If it were me, I would want to work with the people reaching out and extending a hand, but I will not try to get inside their heads. It is a shame that we find ourselves today with a question of privilege that prevents us from advancing important work for seniors and farmers, not just in Quebec but in Canada as a whole. I do not understand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602043">Today we are discussing an issue of transparency, respect, jurisdiction and accountability that is an obligation for any public office holder and, by extension, a government. These are concepts the Liberals have a lot of difficulty with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602044"> This is a government that has not come to terms with its minority status, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278741" Type="2">Pierre‑Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères</Affiliation> mentioned earlier. It has no respect for parliamentary rules and traditions. There is no better illustration than the number of times it has invoked closure to restrict parliamentary privileges in the House since 2021, at the beginning of its alliance with its NDP friends. I did a quick search up to the beginning of June, and it is not even up to date. At the start of June, we were up to 48 closure motions since the NDP-Liberal marriage. These 48 closure motions allowed the Liberals to circumvent 72 bill stages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602045">I hear the Conservatives say it is wrong for the government to have gagged them 48 times. I would caution them against complaining too loudly, because between 2011 and 2015, the Harper government invoked closure 104 times. It imposed a gag order on the House 104 times to push through its ideas and bills at the expense of democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602046">As an aside, the most odious part of all this, the worst example, the worst denial of democracy, the worst shirking of parliamentary rules was the indefinite imposition of a hybrid Parliament. Normally, this is something that is done by consensus, with frank, non-partisan discussions among the parties. Traditionally, changes that are so important to the workings of Parliament are made through consensus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602047">However, the Liberals decided once again to bargain this away in return for some sort of support for some sort of project, because I am guessing that some members preferred watching parliamentary proceedings from their home computer in their comfy clothes, while throwing another load of laundry into the washing machine and making spaghetti sauce for dinner. I find that sad. We deserved a healthy, thoughtful debate on how to improve the way we do things here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602048">In short, I find it absurd that we keep talking, talking, talking about transparency with a government that is on its last legs and that we will remember for issues such as WE Charity, for which it went as far as proroguing Parliament to prevent us from getting to the bottom of things. We do not even know how bad the scandal was; we can only imagine. We had so much trouble getting answers about the laboratory in Winnipeg. We still remember that. ArriveCAN was not that long ago. The government gave over $60 million to two dopes working out of their basement. It is crazy. That is financial mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602049">At the same time, the fiscal imbalance means that Quebec and the provinces are having an even harder time, year after year, fulfilling their obligations, financing their health care and education systems, and providing housing for newly arrived immigrants and asylum seekers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602062">One of the criticisms against this Parliament is that there is less accountability. People often say that ministers and members can hide a little more easily behind a screen. They see the lack of accountability.</ParaText>

Instead of facing the music and doing what is right, in other words, responding to the House's requests, to produce the documents for example, or reaching agreements so that things can move forward—and I know that he also has matters he would like to put forward in the coming weeks— and instead of hiding behind hybrid parliaments and prorogation, the government should be able to face any difficulties and meet our citizens' expectations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602071">We are here with yet another day of Parliament being blocked from doing its work. The people of Canada sent us here to get things done. We have serious issues before us, but we are watching the Conservative puppet show, in this black-and-white world in which they live, interfering and stopping the work of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602072">That is not to give any kind of free pass to what the issue is at hand; the issue is very serious. It is the refusal of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to respect the will of Parliament. What that comes down to is a scandal: A liberal scandal, imagine that. If we look at the long history of the country, all the way back to the rum-bottle days on the Rideau, probably not one or two years has gone by without a scandal of Liberals looking after their pals. This has been the story of Canada since the beginning. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602073">As the opposition, we have an obligation to hold the government to account. The fact that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is refusing to turn over these documents is a serious issue. It is also a serious issue because it was my colleagues in the New Democratic Party who began to break open this green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602074"> These are important issues that have to be addressed, but what we have is a ruling from the Speaker, which is very clear. This issue has to be sent to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs so that parliamentarians can investigate and come back to the House with a decision. This is how Parliament works; this is the process. If that process comes back with a finding of contempt for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, then that is how we operate. What the Conservatives are doing is blocking the call of the Speaker and blocking the work of parliamentarians to get to the bottom of this scandal. It is a very straightforward thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602075">The bigger scandal is the absolute failure of the Liberal government to follow through on key promises. For example, people trusted them on housing. We heard about housing again and again, and we asked where that housing was. It is a government that made so many promises and failed. The purpose of opposition is to hold it to account and ask the question why it has failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602076">The green fund scandal is a particularly powerful metaphor. I remember when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to COP26, with his Haida tattoo, and said, “Canada's back”. He made legally binding commitments on the global stage to move Canada to become a leader in the fight against climate change. What have we seen since then? This green slush fund is the perfect example of money that was not sent out the door to do what was promised. Money was sent again and again to oil and gas. In fact, we see that three times as much money goes out under the government to help the oil and gas sector than on clean energy, as our planet burns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602077"> Under the Prime Minister, oil production in Canada, particularly out of the tar sands, has jumped 25% over the Harper government. That is not climate leadership; this is serious negligence on the part of the Prime Minister. Not only is it 25% higher, but thanks to the $34 billion gift to the TMX pipeline, it is going up much higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602078">We hear the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> talk about emissions going down, but he is not telling the truth. All sectors of the economy have done their part, but emissions continue to rise in oil and gas. We are the only G7 country whose emissions are rising despite the legal commitments made by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. That is the scandal, not of taxpayer money or insider buddies and cronies who hang out with the Prime Minister's pals. It is a scandal about our children's future, because we are now in the heart of the climate crisis. People voted for the Prime Minister to do his job on that. He has failed, and the green slush fund is the perfect example of that. </ParaText>

The Liberals are not very good, but they are rank amateurs compared to the Harper days. They tell us to trust them on transparency and accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602080">I listen to the demands of Conservatives to defend the vision of Parliament and the right to obtain documents. It is like people who move into a new neighbourhood and a crocodile knocks on their door. The crocodile says it is their new neighbour and if ever they need it, it will babysit their children. If the people do not know the history of the crocodile, they would think that is so wonderful and they would be more than happy to trust the crocodile to look after their children. However, if they know the history, they would know what a dumb idea that is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602081">Let us talk a bit about the history. All the language about documents right now brings me back to 2009 when Stephen Harper defied Parliament over the Afghan detainees documents. That was not just a minor scandal. That was a scandal that cut to the very heart of the Canadian nation. It happened in a November 2009 appearance at a parliamentary committee when Richard Colvin testified about evidence of torture of Afghan detainees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602082">The information that was brought forward was horrific, “pulling out fingernails and toenails, burning with hot oil, beatings, sexual humiliation, and sodomy.” That was raised by our ambassador on what was happening under the watch of the Canadian Army in Afghanistan. We sent our best young and most idealistic people to Afghanistan because they believed they were going to build a new Afghanistan after the Taliban. Instead, we learned that they were being drawn into the corruption of the warlords.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602086">Parliamentarians asked to examine this, because it was vital for us to reassure the Canadian people that when we sent our soldiers overseas, they maintained the highest standard and to ensure that our role in Afghanistan was to build a better society and not be a front for corruption, torture and abuse. Stephen Harper had no interest in that. He did not mind that our name was being sullied on the international stage, so he refused to turn over the documents to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602087">Who was being targeted? The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> slurs victims of horrific bombings in Lebanon and the people in Gaza and brags about his hope that people will be bombed in Iran. That is a man who does not have a security clearance or cannot get it making these horrific remarks given the torture and killings are happening. This was happening in Afghanistan and Stephen Harper was covering it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602088"> Ambassador Colvin, in his testimony, said that the people who were being tortured and sodomized were not the terrorists that the Conservatives denounced. He said that they had no connection to the insurgency and many were local people, farmers, truck drivers, tailors, peasants, random human beings in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, from an intelligence point of view, they had little or no value. We would have thought that if Stephen Harper believed in Canada standing strong on the international stage, he would have been worried about the torture of innocent people who were picked up by the military and the warlords and subjected to brutal torture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602089">Colvin went on to say, “Instead of winning hearts and minds, we caused Kandaharis to fear the foreigners. Canada's detainee practices, in my view, alienated us from the population and strengthened the insurgency.” The brutal Taliban is back, and it is back because countries like Canada went along with the torture and suppressed the evidence.</ParaText>

We have never heard a single Conservative mention we have a direct case of a prime minister not turning over documents. It is because if they were in that situation, they would never turn over documents. Stephen Harper would not turn over the documents. What did Stephen Harper do? Well, he always hated the democratic process anyway, so he just shut Parliament down. Do members remember that? Our Conservatives do not have much memory, but I will remind them. Stephen Harper shut down our democracy rather than work out a process for obtaining these documents. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602113">I mention Mike Duffy because he was a bagman for Stephen Harper. He got appointed to the Senate until he was 75. He was the member for "come from away" in Prince Edward Island. The two most famous fake, fictional people in Prince Edward Island are Anne of Green Gables and Mike Duffy. What happened? He got upset. He had his own hairdresser being paid for by the taxpayers. Nigel Wright had to write a secret $90,000 cheque. Do members remember that? This was Stephen Harper's right-hand man. Nigel Wright was proper, upstanding, a good Christian man, and he had to write a $90,000 cheque. Only in Canada can it be a crime to offer a bribe, but not to accept a bribe, or is it the other way around? Stephen Harper's inner office staff were writing secret cheques. Again, talk about the crocodiles being invited into the house; this is not transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602114">Now let us get to the man who is the present <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. A June 2024 report of the National Security and Intelligence Committee, a redacted document, said foreign interference in the leadership allowed him to take out Erin O'Toole. I would like to see Conservatives come clean with the Canadian people and release the documents. They are not going to release those documents. This is about foreign interference that allowed the guy now living in Stornoway to be leader. Members do not need to take my word for it. Erin O'Toole testified alongside federal lawyers that he believed Chinese interference took him out. I know some members of the Conservative backbench were definitely involved. Maybe they talked to the foreign Chinese government. I do not know. Those documents should be coming forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602115">Why is that important? I am not sure the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has ever actually had a job. I do not want to say that is not a problem. I personally find it kind of odd that he sort of claims he worked at a Dairy Queen. However, he does not have security clearance. He is the only leader in national history who either cannot or will not get a national security clearance. What the heck is with that? I mention it because the other day, when we were watching the horrific violence in the Middle East, the destabilizing of the situation, the people being bombed and killed, he was out there bragging that he thought it would be such a great thing for Netanyahu to bomb another country. The man is fundamentally unfit, and he is unfit because he does not even have security clearance. He does not even know what he is talking about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602116">We are trying to de-escalate a global nightmare in the Middle East where thousands of innocent people have been killed: Iranian people, Syrian people, Lebanese people, Israeli people and Palestinian people. At the same time, we have a guy living in a 19-room mansion, Stornoway, with his own personal chef, who cannot get security clearance, and he is talking about bombing another country. I want to know why Conservatives will not release the documents on his leadership. How did that guy get to the position he is in? How is it that he does not have security clearance?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602117">That is a simple question. We should get that answer and we have not got that answer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602181">Mr. Speaker, we are debating a motion saying that an issue at hand should go to the procedure and House affairs committee. That would provide a wonderful forum for all members of the House to address the content of the issue, in terms of why it is referred to the procedure and House affairs committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602182"> However, because the Conservatives ran out of speakers on the amendment, they moved an amendment to the amendment so they could start all over again and speak to the subamendment. That is actually why I get to speak on the motion again. It is interesting: We have had dozens and dozens of Conservatives stand up to speak to the motion, but I believe I am only the second Liberal that has spoken to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602183"> I can tell members opposite that there is a great desire to stop playing the game. That is not only coming from Liberal members but also even other members. There might even be a few closet Conservatives who would like to see us move on. Not all Conservatives are speaking on it, which no doubt defies the House leadership's decision to continue to have speaker after speaker stand up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602184"> Why the issue needs to go to PROC is very simple. It is not that complicated. Let me get to the core. There is a letter. SDTC has been an issue the government has been on top of ever since it became public. The issue is that, because of wrongdoings that have been discovered, standing committees want information, and understandably so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602185">As with other governments, whether provincial or previous federal governments, we often get redacted information. This is done to protect a spectrum of interests. There is nothing different in terms of what the government has actually done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602186">In wanting to make a game of this and trying to point the finger, the Conservatives have said they want not only to have those unredacted documents but also for the unredacted documents collected here in the House to be handed directly over to the RCMP. That raises the concerns of a good number of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602187">We say that this is in fact a Charter issue, a process issue, and it is blurring the independence of our judicial system. However, we get all the legal beagles coming from the other side saying that we do not know what we are talking about. The Conservatives do not know what they are talking about; it is not just Liberals who are saying that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602188">I will give a direct quote from the RCMP. This is in relation to the tactic that the Conservative Party is using in order for us to be able to talk about concerns that Canadians have. This is the tactic that the Conservatives are using in order for us to pass legislation that is going to have an impact on all Canadians in every region of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602189">The Conservatives are so focused on themselves and not the concerns of Canadians that this is the type of game they are playing. I will read from the letter to show what the RCMP has to say. Let us remember that the Conservatives are actually asking for unredacted documents to be collected and sent directly to the RCMP. The commissioner responded to that request, saying, “There is significant risk that the Motion could be interpreted as a circumvention of normal investigative processes and Charter protections.” </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602190">It is not the Liberal Party or the Government of Canada saying that. That is the independent office of our institution, the RCMP. Even though I have had many opportunities to question Conservatives on the issue of whether they are concerned about what the RCMP are saying, not one of them has had the courage to actually address that directly. I have witnessed dozens and dozens of them standing up, but not one of them has done so, because they are not concerned about such issues as the charter, our Constitution or proper process. They are concerned about trying to turn this into a game in which they can score cheap political points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602191">To try to give the false impression that the Government of Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible does not care about the issue is just wrong. That cannot be substantiated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602192"> Let us go through the actual process, in terms of what has taken place. A number of years ago, Navdeep Bains appointed a chair to SDTC. That chair was actually an adviser; she gave advice to Stephen Harper, a Conservative. She gave advice to Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative. I often hear the Conservatives talking about how wonderful the late Jim Flaherty was; he was a former Conservative finance minister. They might be surprised, or likely not, to learn that the SDTC chair actually gave advice to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602193">Navdeep Bains appointed her to an arm's-length organization of which we appointed maybe 50% of the board; the rest of the members were appointed outside that. After the appointment, a couple of years went by and we found out that there were issues that were taking place that should not have been taking place. As a direct result, the government, through the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible, had an internal review done. In fact, we have had two. We have had the Auditor General look at the issue. We have had hours and hours of debate in our standing committee. The Conservatives, because they want their cheap political points in this game, are now asking what the next step is. They want to get unredacted documents—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602200"> Mr. Speaker, that attempt by the Conservative member to be humorous is somewhat sad, because at the end of the day, as more and more Canadians find out who the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> really is, I think they will become disenchanted and disappointed because of the unethical behaviour that we have witnessed on numerous occasions. The type of misinformation that is espoused raises legitimate concerns. Then, for the member across the way to try to make a joke of a very serious issue when we have the independence of the RCMP and call into question a tactic that is being used here, I find it sad, even though the member sits in his corner and laughs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602201"> At the end of the day, we have a government that has been working on the issue to ensure that there is a high sense of accountability and there is, in fact, going to be accountability on the issue. However, what I find interesting is that the strategy now of the Conservative Party is to say “ignore what the RCMP concerns are and ignore the Auditor General” who affirms the RCMP, another independent institution. The Conservatives say “just ignore what they are saying”; and move full steam ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602202"> It was interesting. The New Democratic speaker before me talked about the Afghan scandal with Stephen Harper. I remember that scandal. It is interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> of today was there during that scandal. A number of the Conservatives who are sitting across from me were there during that scandal when Stephen Harper refused to provide unredacted documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602203"> Speech after speech, we hear the Conservative Party members, not necessarily talking about the process or the procedure that should be followed, which is the motion, but rather talking about character assassination and listing off what they believe to be scandals. I have said this before and I have read about it. I have no problem at all comparing our actions as a government to the types of decisions that were being made under Stephen Harper. I wish that we would actually see some of the Conservatives who were there during the Harper regime stand up and provide their defence on the issue and why they have had some sort of come-to-Jesus moment in terms of a complete road-to-Damascus reversal of their positioning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602204"> Now, the Conservatives feel that, as parliamentarians, we have a supreme right, and that is where I do agree,. We have a supreme privilege that enables us to do things that other Canadians cannot do. Where I disagree is this: Just because we have that ability does not mean that we should be using that ability. I have heard Conservative members talk about how Centre Block had a jail in the basement and how we have had individuals walk away from the gold bar and just drive away, implying they should have been put in jail. What a slippery slope it is when we feel that we can just instruct the RCMP and ignore what it is telling us, and then another member says we should have the right to put someone directly into jail. The Conservatives like to think that they are there to protect the individuals of our society regarding rights and freedoms. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602205"> I will stay away from some of the other issues that many of my colleagues have raised. Conservatives even think about issues like the notwithstanding clause and how it is no problem to use it. Why? It is because Parliament can. What a terrible attitude to have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602206">SDTC is an arm's-length organization, meaning that there is no political interference and it makes the decisions. There is a responsibility for us to ensure that there is accountability, and we have been doing that. That is the reason, as I say, there have been internal investigations. That is the reason it went to the standing committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602207">There are silly comments in the speeches coming from the other side and they try to justify them because they happen to be here on the floor of the House of Commons. There are assertions of people being Liberal-friendly and that there is all this corruption. That is what Conservatives say. If, at the end of the day, they want to talk about pure corruption, as they often do, let me touch on a few of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602208">There were the Conservative anti-terrorism scandal, the Conservative Phoenix scandal, the Conservative G8 spending scandal and the Conservative ETS scandal. Interestingly enough, the ETS scandal was a $400-million scandal that involved a minister. Members should google it and find out. Maybe then the Conservatives will look in a mirror and react to their own behaviour. There was the Conservative F-35 scandal, the Conservative Senate scandal and the Conservative election scandals, more than one. We will remember the robocalls and one of the Conservative MPs walking out in leg cuffs. They should not talk to us about scandals. They should look in a mirror. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602209">This is an issue the government has been on top of. This is an issue that should be going to the PROC committee. At the end of the day, the government would be doing a disservice to the RCMP, the Auditor General and Canadians by just giving in to the Conservatives' bullying and what they feel they are entitled to. I would suggest that this needs to come to an end and be given over to PROC so we can start dealing with issues that Canadians are dealing with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602210">We have had the introduction of bills like the Citizenship Act, the military court legislation, the rail and marine safety legislation and the online harms bill. Legislation was introduced earlier this morning. There is a lot on the agenda. Canadians want us working for them, not working for the Conservative Party's interests. I am asking members opposite to put Canadians ahead of their own political party. There is still a full year to go. Let us maximize that and get things done for Canadians.</ParaText>

Honestly, that is what it sounds like. It makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602218"> I am going to remind my colleague of something. In 2010, former Prime Minister Harper fought a very similar battle to not release to the House documents on Afghan detainees that were classified as secret. He lost that battle. The Speaker at the time, Mr. Milliken, reminded everyone of the supremacy of the House of Commons over the government and asked it to produce all the documents. That is what the Speaker of the House has said this time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602225">Mr. Speaker, the simple answer is to allow our independent offices and agencies to do what they are supposed to do. We have an RCMP agency that is recognized around the world as second to, I would suggest, no other agency or law enforcement group. It knows its stuff. It knows what it is doing. I think Canadians have more confidence in the RCMP as an institution than they have in the Conservative Party, on this file at the very least. I am trying to be kind here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602226"> I would suggest that we let individuals do the job they are supposed to be doing on this issue and allow more discussion in standing committees. That is why we have standing committees, to be able to go through the documents. That is where our Auditor General and the RCMP have made presentations. They provide all forms of opportunities to ensure accountability and transparency. I am a little concerned about the Bloc, but it is up to the Conservative Party, in particular, to stop playing political games at the cost of the interests of Canadians and start looking at ways in which we can support Canadians, not play games with them at a great expense. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602228">First of all, the Liberal government is pretending to care about people's charter rights, which would be new if it were believable. This is the government that has violated all of them, including freedom of expression and mobility rights. We can talk about the illegal emergency measures act, and we can go on and on. The member also alluded to the fact that there are no other Conservatives who want to speak to the motion, and that is why we have amendments and subamendments. I have not had a chance to speak to this privilege debate, and I would love to do so. Those are my clarifications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602229">The Auditor General says there are 186 conflicts of interest with the $400 million that was given to people's companies. The whistle-blower said there was criminality involved. If the Liberal government really believes there is nothing to see here, why will it not produce the papers?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8602230"> Mr. Speaker, the government has cooperated and produced the papers. They have been produced, just as Brian Mulroney and other levels of government have done in the past. The issue for the Conservatives is that they are saying there are redactions in the papers. That happens in government. Now the Conservatives have said that they will force those unredacted papers and go against what the RCMP and the Auditor General are saying. Why is that? It is because they want to play a political game of political cheap shots. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602231">I look forward to hearing the member's comments. I would encourage every member in the opposition, when they stand up, to start their remarks by indicating that they do not support the recommendations of or the concerns raised by the RCMP and the Auditor General. Based on that, we can recognize that they do not support the Charter of Rights or our Constitution because, if they did, they would be listening to what those independent offices have to say. If they are not going to listen to what those independent offices have to say, then they cannot try to tell me that they are supporting the Charter of Rights. I will not buy that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602232">Mr. Speaker, a number of my constituents have contacted me regarding this issue, and it is important that we address this series of troubling events, which have not only shaken the foundation of our parliamentary democracy, but also revealed a disturbing pattern of corruption within the Liberal government, highlighting a consistent disregard for the principles of transparency and accountability, which are the bedrock of our democratic system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602233">In 2018, going back that far, the SNC-Lavalin scandal is not just a tale of corporate misconduct, but a glaring example of political interference at the highest levels of our government. Under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Liberal government attempted to undermine the rule of law for political gain. The heart of this scandal lies in the actions of the Prime Minister and his office, which exerted undue pressure on then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. This engineering giant faced serious charges of fraud and corruption, yet the Prime Minister sought to offer it a deferred prosecution agreement, effectively allowing it to escape full accountability. This move was not only unethical, but also a blatant attempt to protect Liberal interests at the expense of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602234"> The fallout from this scandal was significant. It made Canada an ethical pariah in the eyes of its international peers. There are consequences, and it led to the resignation of key cabinet ministers. Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott could no longer stand by a government that prioritized political expediency over integrity. The Ethics Commissioner's report was damning, concluding that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had indeed violated the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring the attorney general. This is not the leadership Canadians deserve. It is our duty, as His Majesty's loyal opposition, to hold the Liberal government accountable and ensure that such abuses of power are never repeated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602235">The WE Charity scandal was another example of the Liberal government's pattern of corruption. The Liberals awarded a $912-million contract to WE Charity to administer a government program. It was later revealed that WE Charity had close ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family, as well as former finance minister Bill Morneau. The controversy led to multiple parliamentary committee investigations and significant political fallout, including Morneau's resignation. The scandal again damaged the public's trust in the Liberal government and led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in government contracting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602236">Next, we turn to the incident involving the Winnipeg lab. Here we witnessed a civil servant being called to the bar of the House for failing to produce documents. This extraordinary action highlighted the importance of parliamentary oversight and the need for civil servants to comply with requests for information. The subsequent election, unnecessarily called, to thwart this initiative further demonstrated the lengths to which some will go to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602237"> More recently, we have seen the case of GC Strategies, where the refusal to answer questions at committee led to the principal of the company being brought to the bar and questioned by Parliament, despite attempts by some members, notably from the Liberal Party, to give this individual a pass due to the stress he had said this caused him. I am sure all grifters were awaiting the outcome of that. This incident serves as a reminder that no individual organization is above the scrutiny of the House. The Auditor General revealed that the development of the ArriveCan app, initially estimated to cost around $80,000, ultimately ballooned to approximately $60 million. The exact final cost remains unclear due to poor record keeping, highlighting significant issues with financial management and transparency under these Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602238">Now, we are confronted with the $400-million scandal involving a conflict of interest uncovered by the Auditor General. This scandal revolves around a now defunct foundation responsible for distributing federal funds for green technology projects. The Auditor General's report identified 186 conflicts of interest in contracts tied to the fund with money allegedly funnelled to companies in which board members had vested interests. The Speaker ruled that the government had not fully complied with an order from the House to provide documents related to the foundation. As a result, the Speaker demanded the production of these documents before any other business of the House could be undertaken. This decisive action underscores the seriousness of the allegations and the need for immediate transparency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602239">The Auditor General of Canada has found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> turned Sustainable Development Technologies Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. The Auditor General's findings are damning: $334 million, 82% of the funding approved by the board over a five-year period, was allocated to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. An additional $59 million was given to projects outside the mandate of the foundation, breaking contribution agreements and conflict of interest laws. The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. Where is the minister's accountability to the House?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602240">These events remind Canadians that Liberals cannot be trusted with the public purse. There was ad scam, SNC-Lavalin, Winnipeg labs, WE Charity and arrive scam, and now there is the SDTC green slush fund. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars were funnelled to the Liberals and their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602241">Obstructing, refusing to co-operate, interference and manipulation are the hallmarks of gangsters and Liberals. We are faced with a governing body that is holding onto the last shred of power, refusing to turn over the documents that the Speaker has instructed them to turn over. These events, collectively, paint a troubling picture of a system in need of reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602242">As representatives of the people, it is our duty to uphold these principles and to take decisive action when they are threatened. This is Parliament's role, and the flimsy excuse that it could violate charter rights is nonsense. Were that the actual case, the House would lose relevance. The country is going broke while Liberal insiders are stuffing taxpayer funds into their pockets, and the government is doing all it can to ensure Canadians do not see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602243">I ask my colleagues in all parties if they really want Canadians to view their role here as elected parliamentarians as irrelevant. If some puppet in the Department of Justice, at the request of the Prime Minister, made parliamentarians' job irrelevant, we should stand up and say so. There should be no more. This is something we have to address.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602247">The best part is that because big polluters pay the most, the vast majority of Canadians receive more back through the Canada carbon rebate and those who pollute less save even more.

That language is unbelievable: a lack of maturity. It is deeply offensive, paternalistic and discriminatory. Let us be clear and say that the lack of clean drinking water on reserve did not just happen. It is the result of decades of neglect from Conservatives and Liberals toward first nations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602497"> We have gone through the ad scam, and it was the Paul Martin government that fell for that, recognizing it fell over a $4-million scandal. Now, $4 million is a heck of a lot less than a $400-million scandal. However, the government fell in 2004, almost 20 years ago, over a $4-million scandal, where it was proven that the government had actually given money to companies or money had been funnelled back to the Liberal Party, so money was given to insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602498">At the end of the day, the Gomery commission proved that a lot of that money ended up back in the Liberal Party's hands. It was atrocious. Canadians punished the government for that, sent them packing and sent in a new government in 2006, for good reason. The government was long in the tooth and was effectively paying a lot of money to their friends. The Gomery commission obviously found enough information, on $4 million worth of government graft or corruption, that it acted according to the way it should have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602499">I have spoken about this and I have spoken about the various other scandals that have happened in the Liberal government. We have talked about SNC-Lavalin. That was in 2018. That effectively tarnished Canada's reputation on the international stage because our largest engineering company was involved in corporate corruption around the world. That means that a lot of Canadian companies were not able to bid on international contracts. That is a huge cost to the country, if we think about how many Canadian companies could not participate in international bids from international organizations because of one bad apple that was in the pockets of the Liberal government.</ParaText>

This was deemed to be and ruled to be corrupt. It should never have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602501"> We know what happened in the Winnipeg labs. The Liberal government ended up calling an election rather than facing the consequences, in front of this House, of an order to produce the documents from the leaks of the Winnipeg labs. Incidentally, that was in 2021, when a civil servant was at the bar in this House, effectively saying that he had some privilege and did not have to provide them. Your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, ordered him to provide the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602502">The government took your predecessor to court in order not to produce those documents. That had never been done before in Canadian history, where the government takes the Speaker, the representative of this Parliament to court, legally weaponizing against this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602503"> Parliament is supreme. The government is not supreme. The government answers to Parliament. This is our role here as elected officials, to oversee the government, not to just do what the government says. Mr. Speaker, you have been very good at that, as far as making sure the government is held to account. I applaud the Speaker's order here, requiring them to produce these documents. The Winnipeg labs situation was one thing. Incidentally, I wanted to point out that in 2024, the government actually produced 600 pages of documents regarding the leaks at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Now, that was three years later than they were asked for by Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602504"> I want to really expose the lengths the government went to to avoid that. The government called an election in order to dissolve Parliament so it would not have to disclose what had happened, and what it was complicit in allowing to happen, at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. It was scandalous that the government got away with this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602505"> I have gone into the WE Charity in detail but, once again, it was senior members of the government working hand in hand with their friends, with money going back and forth and who is getting paid for what. There was lots of money going to Liberal pockets. It was scandalous and as corrupt as anything I have seen in the government. Luckily, we exposed that. It was one of my first years in Parliament. I recall bringing some of my skill set to the floor at that point in time, because I was looking at the financial statements, looking at one year versus the other years, and saying they were not right. We were actually looking at WE Charity, which was hiding some information. That is an in-out scam if there ever was one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602506">We have gone through the arrive scam in detail as well. The arrive scam was a lot of money going to two people working in the basements of their homes, money being shovelled out the door. Canadians know all about it. Again, we had one of them at the bar here in Parliament. We had somebody actually answering to parliamentarians about what was going on in their company and how they used a lot of influence with their Liberal friends and government friends in order to get a whole bunch of money shovelled into their bank accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602507">This is corruption. This is lack of oversight. I know that my colleagues on the other side of the House, the government side of the House, are saying that is just incompetence on the government's part, that it is nothing to do with them here and that we cannot tell them to be accountable. The government is supposed to be accountable. Every one of the ministers is supposed to be accountable for their departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602508">What was quite clear in the ruling the Auditor General gave when they looked at the green slush fund, which we are addressing here today, was that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> did not oversee the contracts with the conflicted Liberal insiders at all. I want everybody to address that here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602509">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> did not oversee those contracts at all. I call him the minister of writing cheques, because that is all he does. He thinks he is there to bring in business to Canada and write billions of dollars' worth of cheques to all kinds of industries, many of which are long-shot gambles. This is Canadian taxpayers' money that he is throwing out without any accountability whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602510">We need not just accountability for the money, but also accountability for the contracts, accountability for the people involved, and accountability in making sure we are getting value for money even if the contract is a terrible contract. Does it measure up? The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> is clearly not being accountable for that. He should be held to account in this House at the soonest possibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602511">There are hundreds of millions of dollars funnelled to Liberals and Liberal friends through the green slush fund. All of a sudden, we were asking for those documents. The Auditor General had found some malfeasance there. The documents came back and they were completely redacted. As my friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, said, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office could have run out of toner as there was so much black ink on the page.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602512">I have spoken of various scandals here, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We have spoken about a number of these issues. Let me ask this question: Is this criminal? We do not know yet. We are trying to get these unredacted documents into the hands of the police, so the police can determine if there are criminal charges to be laid here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602513">We are being held up by the government. Will it be three years like the Winnipeg microbiology lab? Is it going to hold us up for three years to try and shove it under the rug and say nothing happened here? Three years down the road it will say something happened, but not worry about it. It was so long ago, we do not need to worry about it anymore. That is not the way this Parliament works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602514">We are asking for these documents. We are asking for these documents to be unredacted and provided to us so we can oversee this process and make sure there is accountability built into it. I am going to ask this question as well: If this is criminal, is what is happening in this House right now a cover-up of criminality? I am asking the people on that side of the House, the people on the government benches. Is this a cover-up of criminality?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602515">If so, once it is determined that this is criminal, how do the Liberals think their complicity in this is going to be looked at by the Canadian public, but also by the police? They tried to hide this evidence from Parliament, which legitimately and legally asked for it. The Liberals decided they were not going to provide it, in a first iteration since Confederation, where the government has repeatedly provided not enough information to this Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602517"> I have heard the deputy House leader talk about the charter. This is nonsense. The charter was not designed, there is no foresight at all to have the charter interrupt Parliament's role in holding the government to account. That is completely made up. It is a fabrication and should not be entertained here at all. If any official at the Department of Justice is putting that forward as an argument, that name should be put forward, because the person should be disbarred very quickly here and should not be practising law in Canada, let alone for His Majesty's government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602518"> This, again, is a ruse put forward by the government in order to not be accountable to this Parliament. The government needs to be accountable to Parliament. Our job here, as His Majesty's loyal opposition, is to hold he government accountable and it is doing its best to obfuscate, confuse and try not to provide the information that is required for us to do our job here as His Majesty's loyal opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602519">Could the Speaker please enforce this as much as he can, as he has done to this point in time, continue to hold those people to account, as we do here today, and continue to enforce his rules as the representative of Parliament, ensuring the rules in the House are upheld and the government is held to account for its abuse of taxpayer funds?</ParaText>

As someone who covered criminal court for many years as a journalist, I have a lot of sympathy for the RCMP, which is saying even that if it gets these documents, which it does not want, it would not be able to use them in a court of law because it does not follow the proper chain of evidence. At the very end of the letter, the RCMP commissioner says, “the RCMP is operationally independent and strictly adheres to the principle of police independence. In a free and democratic society, this ensures that the government cannot direct or influence the actions of law enforcement.” </ParaText>

There were no checks and balances on money going out the door from the Liberal government at the time and money going in the back door through political contributions. It was absolutely obscene from 1996 to 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602528">The Gomery commission looked at how all that money was backdoored into the Liberal Party through money given to Liberal friends. It was an awful demonstration of how a democratic country should run itself, and that government was thrown out for $4 million, which was the amount found by the Gomery commission, as opposed to $400 million. I appreciate inflation, but inflation over 20 years is not 100 times the scandal that happened that year.</ParaText>

I was hoping you would be the chair occupant during my intervention on this issue because you and I share something in common. In my formative years, I went to school on the south shore of Montreal and grew up in Brossard. You are the member for that region and you will know my elementary school, Harold Napper. Many people went there, including one of your predecessors, whose wife was the director of the school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602546"> Another thing we have in common is that we both survived the 1995 referendum, and you lived through the sponsorship scandal. That is where I want to begin, because those events, the 1995 referendum and the sponsorship scandal, made me a Conservative. They convinced me that the Liberal Party of Canada was corrupt and would be infinitely corrupt. I remember the table talk with my parents, my friends and people I knew. It became the common, accepted wisdom that the Liberal Party of Canada would always be corrupt and there was no way to save it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602547">I find myself now, in this chamber, privileged by the people in the riding of Calgary Shepard to be sent here to speak on their behalf, and it is happening all over again. However, this time, instead of the sponsorship scandal, it is now the SDTC scandal, and it is eight times larger than the sponsorship scandal. We are talking close to $400 million that was corruptly awarded to friends of the Liberal Party. Taxpayers work incredibly hard to earn a living in this country to pay their taxes and they have seen them awarded corruptly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602548">There are two parts to my intervention today. The first part is to talk about the Speaker's ruling on this matter, and the second part is the content of the documents that have led us to this moment and why the governing party is blocking the work of Parliament and not allowing us to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602549">This could all end if the Liberals would just release all the unredacted documents to the parliamentary law clerk. It would end right there. We trust the law clerk. In this situation, I am fine with the RCMP looking at the documents; it has already put out a statement. If it finds nothing of value in the documents, the matter ends there. It is quite simple. There is no reason to hyperventilate and make up judicial opinions on the floor of the House of Commons or make up arguments about why the charter or the Constitution shields the Liberal Party of Canada from releasing the documents in its possession so we can see how bad the corruption is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602550">The Auditor General has already said there was corruption. The Auditor General has already ruled on this and so has the Speaker. The House ordered these documents to be produced June 10 with a vote of 174 to 148. No individual member of Parliament has the absolute right to obtain any document that he or she wants, but as a House, as a group of parliamentarians, a majority here represents a majority of the Canadian public and a majority of Canadian taxpayers. The Canadian taxpayer has been defrauded of close to $400 million. The exact number in question is $390 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602551">The Speaker's ruling said, “In some instances, only partial disclosures were made, owing either to redactions or the withholding of documents.” That means entire documents were not provided. It goes on to say, “In other instances, the House order was met with a complete refusal.” The Government of Canada, all of the cabinet ministers and every single department do not have the right to refuse an order of this House. The Speaker goes on to say that whether it is wise or not to do so is beyond the point. The House has an absolute right to government documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602552">The majority of members of Parliament approve spending. The government exists because Parliament approves spending, so we own these documents; these are ours. When we request them, when we call for them, when we demand them to be given to the law clerks, the government has to give them to us. We are not saying to give us all the documents across all of the Government of Canada. We are saying to give us the documents specific to SDTC, the green slush fund scandal. However, the Liberals have continued blocking the work of Parliament because they refused to give them.

              <ParaText id="8602553">In the early interventions that led to the Speaker's ruling, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> argued, as noted by the Speaker, that the “order for the production of documents should be respected”. The New Democrats were absolutely right. He also noted that the Bloc member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278653" Type="2">La Prairie</Affiliation> “contended that the government may well have reasons not to meet its obligations, but that the privileges of the House are well established and the order was clear.” It was very clear to all of us when we voted on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602554"> The time for debate was then. At the time, the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> should have made the arguments that are being made now by different Liberal Party members and parliamentary secretaries.

              <ParaText id="8602557">The reason for that is simple: We own those papers on behalf of the people of Canada. That is who we are doing this work for. They have a right to have the documents sent to the law clerk and then given to the RCMP. Then the RCMP can do whatever it wants with them. The order of the House does not tell the RCMP what to do. It does not say how the documents should be used or distributed within the RCMP. That is entirely up to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602558">Going back to the ruling, the Speaker said, “The procedural precedents and authorities are abundantly clear.” He further stated, referring to Speaker Milliken's ruling from April 2010 at page 2043 of the Debates, “procedural authorities are categorical in repeatedly asserting the powers of the House in ordering the production of documents. No exceptions are made for any category of government documents”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602559">I do not understand why the government keeps insisting that Speaker Milliken is wrong. Speaker Milliken, I think we can all agree, in the modern history of our Parliament, is probably the best Speaker we have ever had. If we go through his rulings, we see that he was a wise Speaker, indeed. He was a member of my political formation. He is a man I think many of us would lean on when it comes to procedures of the House.

We are not saying to give them to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">official opposition leader</Affiliation> or to me, but to the law clerk of the House of Commons, appointed by the government, who will see the documents unredacted and transfer them to the RCMP. There are no great complications here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602564">One of my favourite lines, heard in debate, is this: When someone breaks into a house, do we call the police or do we call a committee? I would call the police. They are the people I go to when I have a problem. No committee can fix the problem of someone breaking in. There is almost $400 million from Canadian taxpayers at stake here, and Canadian taxpayers were bilked out of it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602565">It is not that this is a recent thing. It is not that it just came about and was discovered later on. It started in 2017. SDTC has existed since 2001 and spent almost 16 years with a clean bill of health from the Auditor General. Then certain Liberal cabinet ministers began appointing their friends and then appointed more friends, and those friends saw friends with companies that needed money and they fleeced taxpayers. Then everything came apart and we had a bizarre kabuki theatre, where the minister abolished the fund and rolled it into something else. The Liberals said that it was all good, that they were moving on, that there was nothing to see here and that it was such a terrible shame that all this money went missing, $390 million. A billion dollars per year was spent and there were no problems whatsoever, but they could not help themselves and reached into the pockets of the taxpayers and gave money to their friends.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602566"> Let us look at exactly what happened with SDTC. The Auditor General found that hundreds of millions of dollars were not just misspent but also corruptly awarded, sometimes to companies of board members who were making the decisions at board meetings. There were 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board during a five-year sample by the Auditor General that were found to have conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602567">I cannot imagine an instructor, a professor or a teacher who is teaching corporate ethics who would look at that and say, “That's okay, we should just roll things under the rug and move on. Mistakes were made, but it's not so bad.” The findings were from the Auditor General's five-year sample. She did not even have the opportunity to look at all the cases of all of the awarding of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602568">In her report, the Auditor General said that the same board approved $59 million in projects that it was not authorized to. The Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund was meant to fund green-energy projects, but the $59 million was approved to go to nothing related to the fund, so it was illegally given. I would hope that we would all agree that $59 million is a huge sum of money. Taxpayers have a right to know where the money went and why the decisions were made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602569">There were people on the board who were awarding cash to each other's companies, which is an obvious conflict of interest. There were Government of Canada officials who sat through the board meetings, so how could the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> claim that he could not have known about it? How is it possible that there are no documents worthy of being given over to the parliamentary law clerk and to the RCMP to investigate and determine how exactly the decisions were made? They were completely in contravention of the conflict of interest laws of Canada, the public office holders rules and SDTC's own act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602570">I would think that when we appoint people to a board, they would read the act that governs their behaviour, but obviously that did not happen in this case. There were 405 transactions, and 226 transactions were the sample. In 186 of those 226, at least 82%, over $300 million, was corruptly given out. The fund had $832 million that was given out at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602571"> There are individuals specifically involved who were on the board and who were involved with a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> brought this up. Do members know who the lobbyist was for a few years for Cycle Capital? It was the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister for Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> before he became the minister. He was a paid lobbyist and had to register, which is how we know that he lobbied for the company; it is all public information. When he was lobbying for Cycle Capital, that company got $111 million. That was so fortunate for them. How lucky are they?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602572">There are documents that would show which meetings were held, what documents were exchanged and what was talked about. I am sure that there would also be diary notes from public servants in the meetings on how decisions were being made or what was being said. There were 25 times in the year before the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was elected that he lobbied, which is quite quite surprising. I wonder when he became the nominated candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602573">Others who participated were told at different points that some projects were rejected because they did not meet the funding requirements. They were told, in emails that we know of because they were released by the whistle-blower and by others at parliamentary committees, that they would be helped to find money from other government departments. Soon after that, the former board chair got $12 million dollars from ACOA and the ISET program. Therefore, even in some situations where it is quite obvious that, for conflict of interest reasons, a program could not get money, the money was given out through another fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602574">Nine directors, according to the Auditor General, accounted for the 186 conflicts. The nine directors were individuals appointed by the government, by cabinet, to sit on the board and make decisions, and they did make decisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602575">The sponsorship scandal was around $40 million, as I remember it. I am sure that with an inflation adjustment it would be a bigger number now, but $40 million is still a lot of money. It is still an incredible amount of money for the taxpayer. We are talking about close to $400 million in this particular case, which is a much bigger sum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602576">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said in June that there would be new transparency rules. New transparency measures would be introduced. Now the Liberal government is giving out money again, but not a single bit of the information has been made available anywhere on the new website. SDTC used to put out a quarterly report on every single company. The new fund, or whatever it has been rolled into, does not do that anymore. It is silent; the information is hidden. There is no more information being given out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602577">We are supposed to believe that the issue was only the nine directors who were directly appointed by the government. In 2017, the government went out of its way. It replaced the board chair because he was inconvenient. The government appointed its own person into that particular role. That person participated in some of the conflict of interest decisions, sometimes to give even her own company some of the taxpayers' own dollars, when they should not have at all. This goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602578"> As other members have mentioned in the House, this is not the first time that the Government of Canada, the Liberal cabinet, is refusing to disclose documents. The government actually took the then Speaker to court to stop the release of detailed documents from the Winnipeg National Microbiology Lab. We have even gone through two parliamentary committees to try to extract the documents. The government even called an election to avoid having to release them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602579">There was the SNC-Lavalin scandal, during which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed on live television during a press conference that there was nothing to see and that nothing was going on. There was the WE Charity scandal, and there were foreign interference campaigns. Again, in every single situation, at first the government refused to release the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602580">As I often do, I have a Yiddish proverb. I feel that the whole situation is like a bridge. I want to read the proverb into the record in its original Yiddish. I am going to practice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602583">I will translate: If his, that is, the government's, word were a bridge, I would be afraid to cross it. If we are to believe the government's argument right now that for charter reasons, for constitutional reasons, it cannot release the full documents that the Speaker has ordered released, based on a majority vote in this place of all the MPs, and it is making a bridge out of it, I would not cross it. I would tell every single person in my riding of Calgary Shepard that they cannot trust the government's words. If it has built a bridge out of its words, we cannot trust it. It is old Yiddish wisdom, and it applies right here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602584">This all ends when the government releases all of the documents; it is really that simple. Then we can get back to the normal work of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602585">There is actually, I believe, another question of privilege coming up after this one, involving “the other Randy”, who, I am told, has also done things in a corrupt way. We are also trying to figure out what is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602586">In anticipation of a question I am very likely to get, I do want to remind the other side about two times the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made comments about the RCMP's laying criminal charges. One is from a February 2018. The Prime Minister said in a town hall meeting that the police investigation of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman will “inevitably” lead to “court processes”. In April 2017, he had told reporters at a press conference that Norman's case “will likely end up before the courts.” That was about criminal court charges in that case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602587">The government ran through the mud a senior, decorated vice chief of the defence staff to suit its own goals, and now it claims to us that it cannot tell the RCMP what to do, when it has done it themselves. I do not believe the Liberals. Do not walk across that bridge. They must give us the documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602605">Madam Speaker, I hope it never comes to having to do a filibuster at any committee, particularly at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. As I jokingly say with colleagues, “filibuster” is my favourite F-word in this place. I have been at PROC as a regular member and as a substitute member. I have testified before PROC as well. I hope it does not come to that, because in this particular case, all a filibuster would do at a committee would be to give more time to the Liberal Party to find a way out of its current predicament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602606">All we are asking for is the release of the documents, not to the Conservative Party, not to the official opposition, but to the law clerk. I think it is a very reasonable thing to ask, to release them to somebody who has no political affiliations, no past political preferences that have been expressed publicly. I have seen this done at committee before, where we have demanded documents be produced. We do it through the law clerk's office, when there are these worries from the government, from the cabinet, that they could be used directly for a partisan purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602607"> Sometimes there are thousands or tens of thousands of documents, and it is perfectly reasonable. Then they can be passed on to the RCMP in this particular case, and the RCMP can determine what it wants to do. All a committee would do at this point, if the threat of delays called a filibuster came about, would be just to give itself more time. An election would end all the procedures and processes of the House; it would not be able to get to those documents to hand them to the RCMP, which I think is much more critical. When it has the documents, the RCMP can do with them what it wishes.</ParaText>

In the three years since I have been elected, they could turn on ParlVU or CPAC, turn it off for a couple of months or a year even, turn it back on, and here we are, still talking about incompetence and corruption, a lack of accountability, a lack of transparency and division in our country that has never reached this level in my lifetime of 45 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602617">What has happened here in the House of Commons is that Parliament has basically been brought to a halt, because the Liberals are refusing to turn over documents, and the Conservatives are demanding they do. What are these documents and what are we talking about? It is called the green slush fund. It is based on Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602618">This is a green slush fund, and it is supposed to be for companies to apply to. It is a billion-dollar fund to invest in green technologies or green businesses. What does that mean? A whistle-blower came before committee, and I think this is a really important piece of this discussion. Many bureaucrats and many people have to go to work, and maybe they are privy to some very important information there.

The opposition parties alongside us, everyone except the Liberals, have agreed with what we have asked for. These are documents that outline what corruption has happened. This is critical because it is the money of the people watching at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602625">The government does not have its own money.

              <ParaText id="8602626">It is a very simple ask. I want to read a couple of things into the record here, but first there is something I would ask people at home to really think about. This is a lot of procedural conversation about parliamentary privilege and this and that, but the question they need to ask themselves is, why do these documents exist in the first place? Why do we have a government in power that would not just misuse money but also give taxpayer money to its friends and family? Why are we even having this discussion? That is the biggest question I would have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602627">If the Liberals were innocent, if they were truly here to represent people, elected to ensure transparency and accountability, they would hand unredacted documents over to ensure accountability and transparency. Why do these documents exist in the first place? What are the Liberals hiding? How did we get here? How did we get to a level of corruption where we have hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars that has not gone to improving our lives and, in fact, has made it significantly worse? That is the question that needs to be asked today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602628">The Auditor General of Canada found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> turned the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. In this report specifically, the Auditor General found that $59 million was awarded to 10 ineligible projects that, on occasions, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. That amount, $59 million, sounds a lot like the arrive scam app number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602629">There was $334 million sent to over 186 projects in which the board members had a conflict of interest. The Auditor General did not even do all 400 cases.

              <ParaText id="8602637"> Are there any guesses as to who said that? It was the same guy, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in April 2015. I have another quote from April 2015: “Once I look at the trend lines in democracy, the empowering of citizens and activists, I know that the government of the future is going to be very, very different than governments of the past”. It sure is different. Since I have been here, it has been another day and another scandal. I have never seen the country in the state it is now in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602638">People ask me why Conservatives have to be so hard on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is because the opposition's role is to ensure that the government is doing the best for the people of Canada. It is to bring balance to this place. The Prime Minister has shown that he is incapable of balance. He has shown that it is rules for thee, but not for me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602639">I want to go through the list of scandals. Again, people should grab some popcorn because there are a lot of them. There is the McKinsey scandal. The Auditor General of Canada report criticizes the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government for awarding $200 million in contracts to McKinsey without proper guidelines; 90% of contracts were awarded without clear justification, with many lacking defined purposes or outcomes. In some cases, the Canada Border Services Agency altered requirements to allow McKinsey to qualify; 70% of contracts were sole-sourced, with no explanation for bypassing competitive processes. McKinsey operated without necessary security clearances in 13 out of 17 contracts. The firm's past failures include involvement in the Canada Infrastructure Bank and contributing to the opioid crisis, which has killed 42,000 Canadians since 2015. The Liberals paid $600 million in damages for this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602640">Then we have the trip to Jamaica; the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s $84,000 holiday vacation was a gift from family friends. Again, we have rules for thee, but not for me. Then he went to Montana for $228,000, not including the salaries of the RCMP officers. I am not done yet. There was another trip to Jamaica in April. That one was $162,000. Who can forget arrive scam? I know my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation> sure does not forget that one. We had to bring forward a government agency, GC Strategies. Does anybody know what “GC Strategies” stands for? It stands for “Government of Canada Strategies”. There was $60 million that went to a company that does not even exist and that two guys were able to build in a weekend for under $250,000 of taxpayer money. Does anyone want to know why the cost of living is out of control? We do not have a revenue problem in this country. We have a Prime Minister with a spending and corruption problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602641">Let us not forget about the $6,000-a-night hotel room, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> burst into song at the Queen's funeral. Who could ever forget the WE Charity? The Prime Minister announced that the WE Charity would manage the $912-million Canada student service grant, and the Ethics Commissioner initiated an investigation into that decision on July 3, 2020. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602642">Probably my favourite scandal that stands today is SNC-Lavalin; it really speaks to the character of what we are dealing with and the sort of rot we have seen in this country. The Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Mario Dion, investigated allegations that the Prime Minister's Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding SNC-Lavalin. Raybould resigned from cabinet and principal secretary Gerald Butts denied the claims before resigning. Jane Philpott also resigned in protest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602643">In August 2019, the commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his officials had breached ethics rules by attempting to undermine the federal prosecutor's decisions. SNC-Lavalin has been charged with fraud and corruption in connection with payments of nearly $48 million to public officials in Libya under Moammar Gadhafi's government and allegations that it defrauded a Libyan organization of an estimated $130 million. Two Liberal ministers took the fall for that one; they were female, I might add. That is another one of these classic things. I cannot wait to see who is going to take the fall for these documents. They will be turned over because we are not going to stop. Let us have that on this conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602644">To put this into context, can we imagine if somebody from CRA phoned and said, “We think you have violated the tax law and we need you to hand over documents”, and we said no? What would happen? Would the official just leave and say it was no problem? Let us say someone handed over documents but had blacked out everything important that CRA wanted to know. Would CRA be okay with that? The general public has to follow every single rule that the government imposes on them while it taxes them into poverty, but the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say, “No, not us; we are not responsible for following any rules”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602645">This mentality bleeds down into the entire front rows and benches, and not just that but into society. We have a societal blister in this country of a lack of accountability, a lack of transparency. It bleeds into our public safety when criminals have no consequences and crime is rampant; it is all over the place. Then, there is the erosion of trust in institutions. When we erode trust, we create chaos because there is no relationship. It is the most detrimental thing we can do, and the people do not trust the government, nor should they. I am not even done reading half the scandals, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has only been in power for nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602646">The other important piece to talk about in this is the green slush fund and, in itself, what it truly is. As we found out today, the PBO has now said that the carbon tax is just this big scam. Conservatives have been saying this from day one. It is driving up the cost of everything. Canadians are paying more out than they are getting back, and the PBO confirmed this yet again. Truckers testified in committee that they are paying $20,000 in carbon tax. What do they think is going to happen to the cost of food? Why has housing doubled under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? That is what I would like to know. The green, environmentally friendly initiative that the Liberals stand on all the time is a facade. They tout themselves as the most environmentally conscious party, but this is pandering. That carbon tax is not an environmental plan; it is a tax plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602647">We literally had the <Affiliation DbId="300007" Type="4">Minister of Mental Health</Affiliation> stand up in the House and say that we wanted the planet to burn. Later, we found out that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> prevented 50 firefighters and 20 fire trucks from fighting the fire in Jasper while it burned. That is the gist of what we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602648">I want to end with this: The undercurrent of all of this is that the government wastes money. I used to worry about how we were going to make this money work. Well, I just found $400 million. The Conservatives would make life more affordable for Canadians. We would restore hope, and we would make housing, food and groceries affordable again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602661"> I want to thank her sincerely for her courage and her allyship to the 2SLGBTQI community, with which she stood in solidarity when there was a very terrible and violent act of burning a pride flag in her community.

              <ParaText id="8602662"> In addition to that comment, I want to refer to an issue that I mentioned to her colleague related to Conservative donations. Part of the argument that has been made over the last few days by the Conservatives is that Ms. Verschuren, who was the chair of SDTC and gave herself millions of dollars, is a Liberal insider. As much as I agree, throughout her entire time as the chair of SDTC, she donated the maximum amounts to the Conservative Party, in addition to the Liberal Party.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602680"> Madam Speaker, my colleague asked a question for those watching out there today. Many have heard about this. What is this green slush fund and why are we here today?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602681">The Liberal government is obstructing justice by refusing to turn over documents to the RCMP showing that Liberal-appointed managers used the green slush fund to pay nearly $400 million to companies that they owned. There is so much scandal with this particular NDP-Liberal government that it is hard to keep track, and we just get desensitized to it, even in this place. There is so much of it, as my colleague mentioned. She did not even get through the full list of the scandals. We are here today because Canadians deserve transparency and a full investigation into this scandal. This is a big one. It is $400 million as it stands, and further investigation needs to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602682">I think we also need to highlight that while the NDP-Liberals have their carbon tax and are bleeding money from Canadians to pay into their carbon tax schemes, this is where the money is going. While people are literally turning down their thermostat or buying noodles for a dollar a package at the grocery store just to survive, these guys are filling their friends' pockets with literally hundreds of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602683">I will make one additional point here. In relation to northern B.C., I was in the House a few weeks ago and talked about how we have just lost two mills in the area. Why have we lost those two mills? The costs are so exorbitant just to get timber now that some of these companies have said that they cannot afford to do it anymore, a direct attribution to the carbon tax and its costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602684">I am going to talk about the basics and then I am going to get into it. It is going to take some time, but I think the folks out there want a deeper dive and want to know a little bit more. What are the basics of the scandal? At least $390 million has gone to Liberal insiders and this is what the Liberals are trying to hide, obviously. That is why they are opposing this production order for documents to be turned over to the RCMP. Obviously, it is better to cover it up, and we have seen the examples of where they do it all the time. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the PCO, defied the order of the House to produce these documents and ordered departments to redact all sensitive information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602685">This is a delay tactic. We want the documents. They gave us some black sheets of paper and that was supposed to pacify us in this place, but we had some pretty sharp members that caught it, and we are standing up to say that this will not cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602686">How bad is it? This is from my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, who has done yeoman's work on this: “a Governor in Council appointment, a person appointed by the government entrusted to oversee taxpayer money, is not to personally profit from their work on a committee, as a GIC appointment, and neither is their family”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602687">That is pretty obvious. We call it a conflict of interest in this place. We all know the rules. These folks did not just break the rules but they did it in abundance. Again, in terms of the rules that were set up before, when we were in government, the NDP-Liberals are pushing the boundaries of any limits that were set for any of us in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602688">“In a five-year period where there were 405 transactions approved by the [Sustainable Development Technology Canada] board, the Auditor General sampled 226, so only half of them, and found that 186 of those 226 transactions were conflicted.” One would be bad enough, but there were 186. “That is the 82% and that is, again, the $330 million”, as my colleague had said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602689">Those numbers are massive, but they are still a little bit unclear. It gets vague when you get past the $100-million mark. What does that actually mean?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602690">Let us talk about Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies that promote sustainable development, and it did some good work. Prior to these guys forming government and some of their ministers getting involved, it was actually doing okay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602691">SDTC is a federally funded non-profit that is supposed to approve and disburse over $100 million in funds annually to clean-technology companies. Executives awarded projects in which they held conflicts of over $330 million in funds.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602716">That same radical minister is having an effect. He wants Canadians to pay the carbon tax so he can get more money and give it to his friends. As my colleague said, “her in-house, paid lobbyist for 10 years before he was elected...was the current radical Minister of the Environment. While he was lobbying for Cycle Capital, the current radical Minister of the Environment got $111 million.” That is what he went to work for. He made money for this company.

The question is that we are not sure what the value of those shares is. He has not declared that. That is, again, what some of these documents will disclose, and we will hopefully find out how much that is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602719"> I will read on. My colleague said, “even though, as a cabinet minister of government, he participated in discussions that gave the green slush fund another $750 million, of which over a quarter has gone to that company.” This is the cabinet <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who has given the money to the same group to spend because he figured he could help out the Liberals' friends by dumping money into this thing, so he funded the fund with another three-quarters of a billion dollars. </ParaText>

There, this is the issue that folks are dealing with. I will use an example. The carbon tax bill for a person in Fort Nelson living in a 1,500 square foot mobile home was over $500. This was in the spring, by the way, and over half of that bill was pure carbon tax. This person, who probably cannot afford much, is trying to stay warm in the north in a mobile home, and the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is saying that this person can afford to pay a bit more. It would be one thing if it were going to a good cause and was for a good reason, but now we see evidence that it is going to line the pockets of his Liberal friends.

Another $58 million was given to projects without ensuring contribution agreement terms were met. </ParaText>

Members of the House fully understand that Parliament has ground to a halt because the Prime Minister is refusing to hand over documents relating to Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602760">Sustainable Development Technology Canada, also known as SDTC, was created by the government to fund new technologies that would reduce emissions. However, Canadians have discovered that SDTC has turned into nothing more than a Liberal slush fund rampant with corruption and conflicts of interest. Ever since the Liberals began appointing new executives to the board in 2019, executives were awarding money to companies that they held an active conflict of interest in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602761">The Liberals would have gotten away with this corruption had it not been for the brave whistle-blowers who came forward to sound the alarm on the financial mismanagement of the fund. Since then, both the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner launched separate investigations into the Liberal green slush fund. What did they find? The Auditor General's investigation revealed that $390 million in funding was awarded to projects that should have been totally ineligible or was awarded to projects in which the board members were conflicted. The Auditor General found SDTC awarded $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that at times could not prove an environmental benefit or a development of green technology, $334 million over 186 cases in which board members held a conflict of interest and $58 million for projects without guaranteeing that terms and conditions were met. Liberal insiders were caught padding the pockets of companies that they were invested in, and they were doing this all with Canadian taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602762">Although the Auditor General exposed this corruption, there are many reasons to believe that this is far more than just financial mismanagement. Canadians are asking if this is criminal, and rightly so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602763">The same whistle-blower who exposed the Liberals' green slush fund is confident that an RCMP investigation would find criminality. The whistle-blower stated at committee, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” When asked if the Auditor General's investigation was sufficient enough, the whistle-blower said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602765">That is why the House of Commons ordered that the documents on the green slush fund be handed over to the RCMP. How will we ever get to the bottom of this corruption if the RCMP does not have all the information needed to fully investigate the criminality of the slush fund?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602766">Although the Liberals voted against the document production order, the House of Commons adopted the motion. However, instead of respecting the will of Parliament, the Liberal government refused to release the documents ordered by the House of Commons and therefore breached the privileges of Parliament. This is a very serious offence. How can we represent Canadians if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fails to respect the House of Commons? How can we represent Canadians if the Prime Minister disregards the powers of Parliament? How can we represent Canadians if the Prime Minister turns a blind eye to democracy? The answer is simple: We cannot.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602767"> What we are seeing from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a full-scale cover-up to hide the massive corruption. The Prime Minister does not care about accountability. He does not care about transparency. He does not care about justice. The only thing the Prime Minister cares about is protecting his government and the Liberal insiders who got rich from taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602768">It is not just me who is saying this either. While testifying at the committee, the SDTC whistle-blower stated, “I think the current government is more interested in protecting themselves and protecting the situation from being a public nightmare. They would rather protect wrongdoers and financial mismanagement than have to deal with a situation like SDTC in the public sphere.” I could not agree more. It has become very clear over the last nine years that the Canadians who do best under the government are well-connected Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602769">The Liberal government has displayed a constant disregard for Parliament and the work of parliamentarians. This is not the first time the Liberals have failed to adhere to document production orders, especially regarding their failed environmental programs. For months, the environment committee ordered the environment minister to release proof that the carbon tax reduces emissions. In fact, the committee ordered the production of these documents on three separate occasions. We ordered this information on November 30, 2023, on March 21, 2020, and again on April 9, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602770">Each time the committee ordered these documents, the environment minister disregarded the will of parliamentarians and refused to provide them. I wonder why. Maybe it was because the environment minister admitted that his government does not track the emissions directly reduced from the carbon tax. Maybe it was because emissions have gone up under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Maybe it was because Canada's independent environment commissioner said that the Liberals would not meet their own emissions reduction targets. The point is that the environment minister's defiance of Parliament was an insult to Canadians. Unfortunately, the NDP and the Bloc refused to refer this matter to the House of Commons at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602771">With regard to the carbon tax, it is important to note that just this morning, the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer once again confirmed that the carbon tax will cost the average Canadian family more than they get back. According to the PBO's report, which was just released this morning, “taking into consideration both fiscal and economic impacts, PBO estimates that the average household in each of the backstop provinces will see a net cost”. It it no wonder the Liberals were hiding the carbon tax documents from the environment committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602772">This was not the only time this year that the Liberals refused to hand over documents on their failed environmental programs. Although we are discussing a billion-dollar green slush fund today, I am confident that we will soon be discussing another one very soon in the House of Commons. That is because earlier this year, the environment commissioner released a damning report on the Liberal government's $8-billion net-zero accelerator fund. The vast majority of Canadians have never heard of the net-zero accelerator fund, which I find very surprising given that it is costing taxpayers $8 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602773">Usually when a government spends this much money, its members travel across the country, talk about what the money was used for and how it will help Canadians. However, that is not the case with the net-zero accelerator fund. Thanks to Canada's environment commissioner, we now know why the Liberals do not want to talk about it. In a damning report tabled in Parliament, Canada's environment commissioner revealed that the $8-billion net-zero accelerator was nothing more than another Liberal slush fund. The audit found that over 70% of the funding agreements had no commitment to reduce any emissions. The whole point of this fund was to reduce emissions, but now we know that this was a complete lie. Does this sound familiar? It sure does. This is very similar to the corruption we are debating today on the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602774"> Canada's Auditor General found that 10 projects funded through the green slush fund did not even produce green technology or contribute to emissions reductions. In fact, $59 million of the green slush fund was spent on ineligible projects. This is the same type of corruption that was revealed by the environment commissioner on the Liberals' net-zero accelerator fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602775"> The commissioner testified at committee on this scandal. He stated that “the department did not always know to what extent GHG emissions had been reduced by those companies that took part in the initiative, or whether the funding provided would lead to reduced emissions.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602776">When I asked the commissioner how many emissions had been reduced by this $8-billion emissions reduction program, he stated, “I can't say how many yet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602777">It is unbelievable. When I asked the commissioner if the government was tracking the value for money from the net-zero accelerator, he replied, “Not in a public way.... We've made our own calculations of the value for money that we could, based on the data they have, but we have seen no public reporting on the value for money, no.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602778">Not only did the environment commissioner reveal that the Liberals were handing out money without any commitment to reduce emissions, but the commissioner also revealed that the emissions reduction target of net-zero accelerator was being protected under cabinet confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602779">According to a written response from the government's industry department, the government is “not in a position to disclose the [emissions reduction] targets, as they are protected under Cabinet confidence”. This is coming from the same department that was responsible for the green slush fund that we are debating today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602780"> The Liberals are charging taxpayers $8 billion for a government program that is supposed to reduce emissions without telling them the goal of the program. That means no one will ever know what the money is achieving, if anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602781"> Who got the money? In typical Liberal fashion, the government was keeping this list a secret from Canadians. The lucky recipients of $8 billion in taxpayers' money could not be found anywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602782"> That is why Conservatives on the environment committee ordered the government to release this list of recipients. We found that billions of taxpayer dollars were given away to non-Canadian companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602783">The Liberals refused to provide this list to Canadian taxpayers, so I will read the recipients of the money into the record: $200 million to Algoma Steel, $400 million to ArcelorMittal, $49 million to Heidelberg Materials, $514 million to Stellantis, $96 million to General Motors, $40 million to CAE, $61 million to Pratt &amp; Whitney, $222 million to Rio Tinto, $15 million to Volvo, $350 million to INSAT, $300 million to Air Products, $27 million to E3 Lithium, $15 million to AVL Fuel Cell Canada, $204 million to E-One Moli, $25 million to Svante, $48 million to Moltex, $500 million to NextStar Energy, $700 million to PowerCo, $551 million to Umicore Canada, $27 million to Westinghouse, $50 million to Lion Electric, $37 million to Vale Canada Limited and $148 million to POSCO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602784"> I doubt the Canadian taxpayers will ever get a thank you from these megacorporations. Taxpayers should be furious. I am furious. I cannot imagine hearing this and knowing that $8 billion went to foreign companies, very well-off companies, in the name of net zero, in the name of “we are going to reduce emissions and we all have to put our shoulder to this”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602785">What did we get out of this? Someone's pockets were lined, but it certainly was not the Canadian taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602786"> Canadian taxpayers should be disgusted with the Liberal government as it continues to spend their money without any transparency or accountability. That is why the environment committee ordered that those net-zero accelerator contracts be released, so Canadians could see the details, but the government is once again refusing to respect a documentation order. It has been over 150 days since we ordered these documents on behalf of Canadians, yet the Liberal government refuses to show Canadian taxpayers what it is charging them $8 billion for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602787">It gets worse. This is unbelievable. Earlier this week, at the government operations and estimates committee, the environment commissioner revealed the Liberals have created a fast-track lane for this $8-billion taxpayer-funded program. According to the environment commissioner, megacorporations can fast-track their applications for billions of taxpayer dollars by simply writing a letter. Guess who that letter is supposed to be sent to: the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602788">According to page 8 of the environment commissioner's report on the net-zero accelerator fund, “A project of more than $50 million also requires Treasury Board approval, concurrence letters from ministers of other concerned departments, and Cabinet approval”. It then states that net-zero accelerator projects “can be fast-tracked with a letter to the Prime Minister.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602789">The Liberals are giving special access to billions of tax dollars with a simple letter to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. We cannot make this stuff up. This is absolutely absurd. If Canadians thought the green slush fund was the damning scandal, wait until we uncover the truth about the Liberals' $8-billion net-zero accelerator slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602790">Parliament has the privilege to compel the production of papers. The privilege allows us to properly represent Canadians who elected us to serve them. However, as the Speaker ruled, the privilege was breached by the Liberal government and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Let us not forget that. The Prime Minister is blocking everything. We can all dance around this and we can all say what we want to say, but the Prime Minister is ultimately in control of this, and he does not want to have anybody see these documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602791">On June 10, the House of Commons passed a motion that ordered the production of documents relating to the government's green slush fund so they could be turned over to the RCMP. In response to this motion, the government either outright refused the House order or redacted the documents that were turned over, basically making them useless so no one could do a full investigation. It would ultimately end up at committee just like we are right now. That is why Conservatives raised the question of privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602792">The Speaker then ruled on this question of privilege. He stated, “The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any and all documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.” The Speaker then added, “The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602793">It is no wonder that Canadians have lost confidence in the government. Time and time again, we see the Liberal government cover up its wrongdoings. It is a pattern of behaviour that has resulted in anger among Canadians. Every time the Liberal government is caught doing something wrong, it does everything it can to cover up its wrongdoings. This approach is dangerous to democracy because it suggests the government can get away with anything. It sets a precedent that rules do not apply to the government of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602794">After nine years, this is more proof that the Liberals are not worth the cost, crime or corruption. The Speaker has ruled that the Liberal government has violated Parliament's order to hand over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation into the Liberals' $400-million green slush fund scandal. Instead of respecting the will of Parliament by handing over the documents, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has instead chosen to paralyze Parliament.

              <ParaText id="8602827">I have to question how my Liberal colleagues will go home for the Thanksgiving constituency week and look their constituents in the face and say they can still trust them and they have integrity and character, when they know there is a green slush fund of more than $400 million that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is doing everything he possibly can to hide from Canadians. That is a big number. There is no question about that. However, in my opinion, the size of the corruption in a scandal does not matter as much as what it says about the person involved in it, who is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602828"> He campaigned in 2015 about wanting the most accountable and transparent government in Canadian history, and he has certainly fallen well short of that goal. The epitaph of the government, when it falls in a very short amount of time, will be “Promises made, promises broken”, or perhaps “Here lies a government that took care of its friends despite the needs of its constituents”. I am not exactly sure if that is a legacy I would want my constituents to see in me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602829">The role of Parliament and all parliamentarians is to hold the government to account and oversee government spending. By refusing to comply with the Speaker's decision to produce documents, the government is undermining the principle and integrity of this House and is setting a very dangerous precedent for what I think Canadians expect from all of us in the House of Commons. Parliament is the House of the people, the people in our constituencies across this country who trusted and elected us to represent them, be their voice and ensure that we are good stewards of every single one of their tax dollars. Canadians, perhaps more than ever, as they struggle with the cost of living crisis and try hard every day just to put food on the table and pay their mortgage, deserve to know that their tax dollars are being spent prudently and on programs that will impact their lives in a positive way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602830"> I often give constituents or stakeholders tours of the House of Commons and Parliament. We have a running joke, as my constituents have elected me as a Conservative member, to watch their wallets and hold their purses tight, because if they pass by a Liberal, they may ask for a donation or pick into their pockets. We do that as something fun, in jest, to have a little laugh, but unfortunately, the joke has turned into reality, as the government is reaching into the pockets of every single Canadian to fill the pockets of Liberal insiders and their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602831"> Honestly, the level of this scandal is, in no uncertain terms, disgusting. It is enough to make most Canadians, and certainly the Canadians in my riding, quite sick to their stomach. Canadians deserve better. They deserve an honest, accountable and hard-working government that does not abuse their hard-earned paycheques, that fights for the people, that respects voters, that follows through with the promises it has given to protect and govern this prosperous country and that leaves it in a better condition and shape than when it got there. However, what is happening here flies in the face of what I think most Canadians would expect a government to do and steward forward for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602832">The RCMP commissioner said quite clearly that the directors of this green slush fund, who were hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, were abusing Canadian tax dollars at an unprecedented level. I would love to say that this is unusual for the Liberal government, but unfortunately, this is just the latest on the list of scandals the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has wreaked on Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8602833"> The level of this corruption has Canadians outraged and disgusted because the Liberals have taken advantage of their position of power to enrich their friends to the detriment of Canadians. I would like to say that this level of scandal is unprecedented, but I cannot, and that is unfortunate. Scandal and corruption have become a habit with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is not a one-off. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602834">Two million Canadians are going to food banks every single year and food insecurity is up 111%. That means millions of Canadian families are unable to feed their children and struggle from meal to meal. A quarter of Canadians are skipping meals just to make ends meet. At a time of very extreme financial difficulty, the Liberal government seems to have no problem pilfering the pockets of Canadians and wasting tens of millions of tax dollars just to ensure that political friends and insiders are well taken care of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602835">Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which was supposed to be managing a green energy fund for the benefit of Canadians, has abused Canadian tax dollars. What is interesting is that this did not happen once; it did not happen twice; it did not even happen three times. This has happened 186 times in just this one program. If there are 186 conflicts of interest in one Liberal program, imagine what else is out there. I think the Liberals are scared to table these documents because the level of scandal that will be uncovered is something Canadians have never seen before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602836">Let us go back in time. When I talk to my constituents about this issue and in the emails and letters I am getting, they compare it to the sponsorship scandal, which brought down the Chrétien-Martin government. The one similarity is they were funnelling tax dollars to enrich their friends and political allies. The difference is that the SDTC scandal is five times bigger, given the amount of money we are talking about, than the sponsorship scandal. If that scandal brought down a government, I hope Canadians will demand the same thing with the SDTC scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602837">We need to emphasize that this is not Liberal money. This is Canadian taxpayers' money. This is money that taxpayers have worked hard to earn. When they pay their taxes to the government, they expect those taxes to go to building bridges and roads, paying for hospitals and schools, hiring doctors and teachers and building important infrastructure and social programs, not to Liberal insiders. We know it involves $400 million, but it could be even higher. How many hospitals would that build? How many roads, ports and bridges would that maintain? How many meals would that serve? How many schoolteachers would that hire? How many people would that feed? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602838">The former chair of SDTC, Annette Verschuren, who is the face of this disaster, was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> despite warnings from a previous chair of her conflict. She tried to get $6.8 million for the Verschuren Centre in Cape Breton through the slush fund. She also tried to use her influence on the green slush fund to get a further $10 million for the centre from Industry Canada and ACOA. This is just one example of the many levels of corruption the Liberals are trying to hide from Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602839">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s appointees were doling out taxpayer monies to companies that the board of directors of this fund owned. They did not think twice about abusing this program 186 times. However, despite warnings that the chair was in conflict, the Prime Minister, as always happens, got his way. Ethics and conflict be damned, he put this person in that role, and he is trying to hide the level of that scandal by withholding documents from the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602840"> As they always like to do, the Liberals are saying that there is nothing to see here. However, there is something to see here; there is a scandal of 400 million taxpayer dollars stolen from Canadians and given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602841">I was thinking about this a bit, and I know that some of my colleagues have been doing that as well. I find myself, now and again as we are discussing Liberal scandals and corruption, saying a lot of “Oh my gosh, I forgot about that one” and “Oh my God, there was that one.” I kind of get the feeling that the Liberals bring up another scandal as often as possible so we have to forget about the ones that happened in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602842">I do have to give the Liberals a bit of credit; I do not know how they manage all of these different scandals, keep them in line and remember which one is which, whacking this mole and that mole. I have to give them credit because I do not know how they keep track of the bag men. They are removing tax dollars from one friend in one alley and from one company to another. That has to be a lot of logistics. If the Liberals only put that effort into actually governing the country, imagine where we would be, but that is not what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602843">Maybe if I have time I will list off the incredible collection of greatest hits that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has had of the scandals under his watch. It is a very long list. However, I thought of something else. I mentioned earlier in my speech that the Prime Minister campaigned in 2015 on having the most transparent and open government in Canadian history. I will share some of the greatest hits of his quotes. He said, “I think we're going to have to embark on a completely different style of government.

              <ParaText id="8602848">Let us go back a bit further in time. I find this one very ironic. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> was just a sitting member of the third party, his first private member's bill as an opposition MP was a transparency act. He offered bold promises to revitalize the access to information system. Where is that wide-eyed parliamentarian now? He came in with all this gusto, saying that he was going to shed sunlight on the House of Commons. I guess he was practising very early on the idea that promises are made to be broken. He started trying to fool Canadians in 2013, but Canadians are not fooled anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602849"> Even in a recent podcast with his Liberal colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> admitted that he courted the fair-vote folks, who are usually NDP supporters, promising them that he would change the electoral system, have electoral reform and make sure proportional representation was part of the discussion. Then he admitted in the podcast that he had no intention of ever entertaining proportional representation. He had only said that to win over NDP voters, and then when he got elected, it was pushed to the side and long forgotten. It was a promise made and a promise broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602850"> In 2015, after he was elected, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, “Canadians voted for change, and we are committed to delivering that change.

It is not about releasing the documents; it is about how it should be done in a way that protects charter rights. We have been advised by the Auditor General and the RCMP that releasing the documents to them is not the right way to proceed. There has been a ruling from the Speaker that said that the issue should go to PROC.</ParaText>

If we add up their speaking time, it is just over 24 hours, at 1,470 minutes. If we look at what it cost for the House to operate over that time, the cost to taxpayers is just over $1.7 million for the Conservative speakers, not to mention all the other speakers who have also risen on this.</ParaText>

The fact that $400 million has been funnelled to Liberal insiders and friends and that this would happen at a time when Canadians are struggling through a cost of living crisis is troubling. I have a very rural riding, as my colleague does, and I have talked to the farmers and ranchers of my riding every week. They are paying $150,000 a year just in carbon taxes trying to get harvest off right now. They are seeing, at a time when every single dollar is stretched as far as possible, a government that should be the steward of their tax dollars is now abusing 400 million dollars of their money, which would be much better spent on building railroads, ports or bridges to ensure that their products get to market and we would once again be a trusted trading partner around the world. That is certainly not the case right now.</ParaText>

For those watching at home, I will give the facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602897">The Auditor General found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has turned SDTC into a slush fund for Liberal insiders, finding that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that could not show an environmental benefit or development of green technology. There was $334 million, over 186 cases, that was given to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest, and $58 million was given to projects without ensuring contribution terms were met. Can we imagine? The very people who were trusted with safeguarding taxpayer dollars were funnelling money into projects they themselves were connected to. This is corruption, pure and simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602898">This is not a fluke or some isolated incident. This scandal is symptomatic of a Liberal culture that puts political survival and self-enrichment ahead of the interests of the Canadian people. They shovel the working man's pay into the pockets of elitists who provide no value to the country. They have created a culture of enrichment for their well-connected friends, lining their pockets on the backs of the working class. This is the kind of governance that erodes trust. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claims to be a champion of the environment while handing out public dollars to his friends. We have seen this before. It is the same culture that brought us SNC-Lavalin, the WE Charity scandal and countless others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602899">Now, the House has ordered the production of the documents around the scandal to the law clerk and the transfer of the documents to the RCMP for unredacted investigation. The only problem is that the government refuses to hand them over. What is the Liberals' excuse? They hide behind the Charter of Rights, stating that the order forcing them to produce these documents is a potential violation of Canadians' charter rights. I say to the folks at home that, after burning taxpayers' dollars, the NDP-Liberals are now attempting to bypass the House of Commons to hide the information that Canadians need in order to truly understand how much of their money the government has actually wasted. Here is a wake-up call to the NDP-Liberals: The charter is there to protect the people from the government, not corrupt politicians from prison. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602937">For the parliamentary secretary across the way, I thought he would be more grateful. A couple days ago I promoted him to deputy House leader, but evidently I got that promotion wrong. However, I assure him that these are indeed my words, and I stand by them with great confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602938">Canadians, who are barely scraping by, see this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> waste $400 million of their hard-earned taxpayer money, and he wonders why nobody has confidence in him or his NDP-Liberals. I look around. These same Canadians see crime, chaos, drugs and disorder on our streets. They see a <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> who offers up bail, not jail, for violent repeat offenders, causing violent crime to skyrocket 50%. Hate crimes are up 251%. More than 100 churches have been burned and synagogues have been firebombed. We do not even hear a pin drop from this government on any of this. It is a national disgrace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602939">Canadians see drugs flooding our communities and a government that offers up drugs rather than treatment and recovery. They watch a spiralling, flailing, out-of-control <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> go to war over nicotine pouches, but when it comes to fighting the drug overdose crisis, the leading cause of death for B.C. kids, he refuses. In fact, this government fuels the crisis further with its taxpayer-funded drug dens, and 42,000 lives have tragically been lost from the drug crisis in our country since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602940">We recently saw at the health committee a parent of one of the victims who bravely spoke out against the government's so-called safe supply experiment. When asked what her message to this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was, she asked, “How can you have 'safe'...and 'drugs' in the same sentence?” It does not make sense. Those two contradict each other deeply. How can this government continue to consciously fund this program? This disastrous experiment needs to be stopped before more lives are lost needlessly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602941">Canadians also see an <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> who has delivered nothing to clean up our environment. He has only brought in higher taxes on working people. His policies are as weak as the paper straws he is forcing us all to use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602942">Sadly, as I return to discussing the government's ethics, I look around and see NDP-Liberals in this chamber who do not even recognize the damage they have caused. They truly believe they know best. They have all the answers, even when Canadians have to suffer because of it. They think they can wave a magic wand and undo these last nine years, promising the world and yet letting down Canadians each and every time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602943">Today we see NDP-Liberals paralyzing Parliament over documents showing Liberal insiders stuffing their own pockets with taxpayer dollars. This week, we saw the government House leader call this investigation a “witch hunt”. How is it a witch hunt when 400 million taxpayer dollars are at stake? If this government has nothing to hide, why not hand over the documents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602944">The story changes by the week. Last week, Liberals told Canadians they had already handed the documents over to the RCMP and not to worry at all. This week, they say the Charter of Rights will go down in smoke if they dare show a shred of transparency. It is funny how that works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602945">The Ethics Commissioner appointed by this government has found the chair of the fund in violation of the law. The Auditor General, also appointed by this government, says there were 186 conflicts of interest involving Liberal appointees giving millions of dollars to their own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602946">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would rather put all of his government business on hold to hide whatever is in these documents. This is corruption unlike we have ever seen before in this country. As I speak on Liberal corruption, I have to reflect on the current state of their leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602947">In quiet moments, even Liberal MPs admit they are counting down the days. They are just wishing this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would take his proverbial walk in the snow. They know his days are numbered, and they are quietly placing their bets on the next man in line, Mark “carbon tax” Carney. Our friend from <Affiliation DbId="278432" Type="2">Red Deer—Mountain View</Affiliation> likes to quip that every circus needs its carny, but Canadians know better than to fall for this bait and switch.

Two million Canadians are relying on food banks, and many families are cutting back on their Thanksgiving dinners because of Liberal policies that have driven up the cost of food. This $400-million scandal is a slap in the face to all Canadians struggling to afford to feed themselves. I think of the people struggling to buy groceries for whom this money could go towards feeding. I think of the heartbreak that families in my communities are feeling. I hear the stories of parents who have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. Liberals promised phony programs, delivered no results and made big announcements with little to show for it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602971">Recently, Statistics Canada reported that GDP per capita continues to fall in Canada. Things look even worse when Canada's economy is compared with that of the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602972">I also want to mention that I will be splitting my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602973">America's GDP per capita has grown by 4.5% since 2022. Before it had the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canada was keeping up with the United States. In fact, nine years ago, The New York Times found that Canada's middle class was richer than America's. However, the Liberals really have destroyed Canada's economy with their job-killing taxes and wasteful spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602974">We have seen a collapse in productivity, which means how far people's paycheques go. This relates not to how hard people work but to the productivity of the country and how much money people have in their pockets at the end of the month. The productivity gap with the United States now stands at a difference of about $20,000 per person a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602975">Things that have recently affected small business owners and Canadians are the Liberals' changes to the capital gains tax, and I want to talk about that for a little while. The Liberals were scrambling when facing opposition from doctors, small business owners and Canadians saving for their retirement. As a result of these investment-killing policies, capital has been driven out of Canada and Canadians are worse off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602976">I have been at the housing committee, and I have recently sat in at the finance committee and trade committee. There, I had the opportunity to hear from witnesses from all different types of businesses. They are all basically saying the same thing, which is that this capital gains tax is going to hurt investment, that businesses are already moving to the United States and that it will make homebuilding more difficult. We also know that this job-killing tax is on health care, homebuilding, small businesses and farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602977">Those at technology companies have been talking about the fact that this will make it much more difficult for them to find investors. In addition, according to economist Jack Mintz, “the increase in the capital gains tax rate will reduce Canada’s GDP by $90 billion, real per capita GDP by 3 percent, its capital stock by $127 billion, and employment by 414,000.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602978">Taxing farmers drives up food costs. Taxing doctors means that it is harder to find a doctor. Taxing home builders means fewer homes being built, and taxing small businesses means fewer paycheques and that small business owners need to work longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602979">The Council of Canadian Innovators recently commissioned a survey of entrepreneurs. It showed that 90% of respondents believed the Liberals' capital gains tax hike would have a negative effect on the innovation economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8602992">This is why the Conservatives have said that within 60 days of forming government, we will name a tax reform task force of entrepreneurs, inventors, farmers and workers to design a bring-it-home tax cut that will allow workers to bring home more of each dollar they earn; bring home production and paycheques by making Canada the best place to invest, hire and make things; and bring home fairness by reducing the share of taxes paid by the poor and middle class, while cutting tax-funded corporate welfare and cracking down on overseas tax havens. We will also cut the paperwork and bureaucracy in the tax system by at least 20%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602993">One other thing I want to mention, since we are talking about Canada's economy today and the budget, is the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It has reports out noting that there are far fewer housing starts in 2023, 30,000 in fact, as a consequence of soaring interest rates. In 2023, the CMHC recorded that Canada had 240,000 housing starts, which was down 8% from the previous year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602994">We know that to bring back housing affordability and to build the homes Canada needs, approximately 550,000 homes would have to be built on an annual basis. We just completed a study at the housing committee on housing, and one after the other, developers and people who work in the construction industry testified that there was not a chance, based on current policies and the current situation with costs, taxes, interest rates and bureaucracy, that anywhere near the number of homes we need in Canada will be built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602995">In my last minute, I want to mention the Parliamentary Budget Officer's updated carbon tax report, which was just released. It shows that most Canadian families are worse off as a result of the carbon tax. We know that life has never been more expensive over the last nine years. The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that the federal fuel charge will increase the budgetary deficit by $1.5 billion in 2024-25, and ultimately by $4 billion in 2030-31, as a result of the decrease in employment and investment income. Also, as previously discovered, internal numbers within the government show that the carbon tax will cost Canadians $30.5 billion by 2030. This works out to over $1,800 per family in extra annual costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8602996">We need a country where hard work pays off, with powerful paycheques and pensions that buy affordable food, gas and homes in safe neighbourhoods. That is what Conservatives want.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603005">Mr. Speaker, I am rising tonight to continue to call on the government to get accountability and, specifically, a timeline on two-way, all-day GO train service between Kitchener and Toronto. It has been over a decade now that my community has heard promise after promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603006">Here is what then Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne said to Craig Norris from CBC K-W back in May 2014: “We're making the two-way, all-day GO a priority because I know people want to go back and forth. I can't give you the specific dates but we want to get going on this right away”. Her party was elected the very next month, and we never got a date for completion from her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603007">Then, back in 2017, the federal government committed 40% of the project cost. At the time, it put in over $752 million, three-quarters of a billion dollars. Now retired regional chair Ken Seiling, was thrilled, as he should have been. He said, “It is a strategic investment that recognizes the importance of the Toronto-Waterloo region innovation corridor to the Canadian economy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603008">Then the next provincial election came along. Keeping in mind that Conservative Doug Ford now knew about the federal money that was already committed, here is what he said: “We're going to have the pedal to the metal, and we're going to move forward, we're going to cut all the red tape and bureaucracy that gets in the way of these projects”. While Premier Ford got elected that year, that was six years ago. So much for pedal to the metal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603009">Where do we stand today? After more than a decade has passed since that first political commitment, and despite constant political ads from the provincial Conservatives bragging about progress in my community, we have a total of 10 trains a day that go from Kitchener to Toronto and nine trains a day from Toronto to Kitchener, and they run only on weekdays. Every now and then, if we are lucky, Metrolinx will announce special one-off weekend service on a holiday weekend like the one coming up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603010">Worst of all, we still do not even have a timeline for completion. It means that in my community, folks continue to get left on the platform waiting for overcrowded buses. They could be a commuter, for example. They could be someone looking to get to a medical specialist in Toronto or a family looking to get to a Jays' game. One young person even shared with me this past summer that, as a queer person, she would love to take the GO to be able to date in Toronto. She wants two-way, all-day GO for queer love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603011">This is also about the climate. We need to give people more convenient, more affordable and lower-carbon ways of getting around, recognizing that transportation is the largest emissions source in Ontario. Here is an example of what is possible: The Montreal REM rapid transit system opened last summer. It took just five years to go from “prep work” to “doors open” on a 67-kilometre line with service every three and a half minutes during peak hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603012">While two-way, all-day GO would, of course, be delivered by the provincial government, folks in my community are tired of having different levels of government blame one another. If the federal government put in 40% of the money, as it did, it should at least be demanding accountability on the funds. I have written to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. There have been almost two years of letters now. I raised it with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a few weeks ago. I am raising it again. When will the government call for accountability and specifically for a timeline from the province on two-way, all-day GO train service between Kitchener and Toronto? </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">Mr. Adam van Koeverden (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and to the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8603013">Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be here in adjournment debate with you and some colleagues. I would like to thank my friend and colleague for the question and the opportunity to talk about the Government of Canada's continued commitment to helping build sustainable, inclusive and climate-resistant communities. I understand that public transit is a foundational element to a thriving community, and I join my colleague in advocating for two-way, all-day GO train services for Milton because I also sympathize. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603014">Milton is in a very similar situation to Kitchener. We have been asking the provincial government to prioritize two-way, all-day GO train service for Milton because Canadians depend on the trains. They do not want to sit on the highway in traffic in order to get to work. The other problem in Milton is that we basically have eight trains that go out in the morning, starting early, the last one leaving around 9 a.m. Then those trains come back in the evening for a commuter-type experience. However, if a person wants to take a train on the weekend, or if they work shift work or work a shift that starts at noon or ends at midnight, they are out of luck. Therefore, it is important that we have a two-way, all-day GO train service, as well as reliable all-day GO train service. Right now, Miltonians drive down to the Oakville or Bronte GO stations to get that service. That defeats the purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603015">Taking the train is not only a great way to reduce our carbon emissions, but it is also a great way to multi-task. When I take the train, I send an email or two and listen to music. I suppose I listen to music while I drive as well. We all depend on that. That is why, since 2015, we have made substantial investments totalling more than $30 billion, more than any previous government, for over 2,000 public transit projects across Canada. That includes Canada's first-ever public transit fund, which I am happy to say Milton will be enjoying. We are a growing community with over 140,000 constituents now, as well as one of the youngest demographics, and they rely on that more and more. Therefore, it is important that we continue to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603016">It is also why we launched the largest-ever single public transit investment in Canadian history, the aforementioned Canada public transit fund. Starting in 2026-27, this fund will make an average of $3 billion a year available to help cities and communities deliver better public transit systems for Canadians. The fund will help communities of all sizes maintain existing transit systems and help plan for new transit infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603017">However, as my colleague correctly pointed out, the GO train service throughout the GTA is a provincial matter. I will continue to advocate with my member of provincial Parliament, and I know my colleague has a great relationship with his member of provincial Parliament because they happen to be party aligned. That is quite unique for the Green Party. The reason we will continue to do this together is that it will encourage the increased use of public transit, an increased housing supply and affordability. It will allow for people who do not necessarily want to own a car or drive a car frequently to live in a neighbourhood they can afford. It will improve public and active transportation options for everyone, especially indigenous peoples and equity-deserving groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603018">The Canada public transit fund is made up of three different funding streams with the provinces, territories and municipalities. They can all select from various funding options that will best suit their public transit needs. Perhaps if there is an opportunity for rebuttal, I will be able to explain what those three areas are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603020">I want to reiterate what I am calling for. In this case, the federal government did the right thing back in 2017: It put the funding forward. The federal government is an investor that has put in 40% of the project costs. It is reasonable that the investor would demand some accountability from the provincial government that is meant to deliver on the project. Accountability starts with a timeline for completion. Folks in his community and in mine deserve to have that accountability with respect to federal funds. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603023">The federal government has committed the funding. Then, at various times, the provincial government commits funding, but only when it seems to be politically expedient. I do not mind pointing out to my colleague how that works. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603024">We recently had a by-election in Milton. Doug Ford wanted a Conservative elected, so he had the transport minister write a letter to the federal government saying that the government was ready to invest some money into a both-directions, all-day GO train service for Milton; it is just a matter of the federal government coming into play. This is kind of ironic because we committed that funding in 2021. We told Doug Ford to come to the table to build a both-directions, all-day GO train service for Milton. Unfortunately, it did not fit his political goals at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603025">However, I am very excited to talk to my friend about more train service for our two communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603035">There was a chart on the average cost for an Albertan showing they would pay $697, so almost $700 more, in tax than they receive. That is data from the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603036">There are a couple more out there. There was the Agriculture Carbon Alliance. It sampled 50 farms and showed a total $330,000, in just one month, paid in carbon tax. Now if we have 190,000 farms in Canada, that gets to be a big number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603037">What makes it different in my riding is irrigation. As I said before, when I met with one farmer with an irrigated farm, he paid approximately $100,000 in carbon tax a year. I saw the bills he had, and went through them with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603038">I have hundreds of irrigated farms in my riding. If we multiply that number, we get the amount that is paid in carbon tax from irrigation farms. There is no rebate on what they use to power this. There are no exemptions. The amount that irrigation farm farmers in my area, who produce high-quality crops, pay is huge. What they ask me is, “Why does EV production get a $50-billion subsidy, when we have to pay a huge carbon tax?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603039">The farmers in my area see the carbon tax as a huge cost to them, much higher than average farmers, who are paying a lot. They see the subsidy to EV batteries at $50 billion, rather than them paying the carbon tax. It is really tough for them to take.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">Mr. Adam van Koeverden (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and to the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8603040">Mr. Speaker, as my friend and colleague pointed out, the PBO released today an update on his analysis for the impact of the federal fuel charge on Canadian households, because unfortunately there had been a mistake made. The PBO report confirmed just recently that when we look at the direct costs of pollution pricing and the amounts actually paid by households, in terms of the fuel charge versus the amounts actually received back through the Canada carbon rebate payment, we can see that the large majority of Canadian families are much better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603041">The PBO report also estimated the economic costs of implementing the carbon pricing regime, but it has not set these against the large and growing costs of climate inaction nor the economic opportunities of moving toward a greener, carbon-free future. It also does not necessarily take into consideration the enormous social and economic costs of climate change itself, which is a destructive force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603042"> Canadians are forced from their homes every summer during wildfire events. In fact, a really alarming statistic I heard was that over 40% of the worldwide population displaced from their homes from wildfire was Canadian. That is crazy. Canada has only 0.5% of the global population, but 40% of the world's people who are displaced from their homes because of wildfire live in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603043">That is because we are also extremely vulnerable to climate change in Canada. We have a forest that is drying quickly due to warmer summers and shorter winters, and less snowfall and less snowpack. There are also less frequent and harder to manage precipitation events in western Canada, where a lot of rain will fall all at once but then not again for a couple of months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603044">We know that carbon pricing has not and will not cost families in the long run. What will cost us is doing absolutely nothing about climate change. Sadly, the Conservatives refuse to acknowledge that climate change is a threat. Some of them even refuse to accept the notion that it is human-caused and that we have a role to play, but what they cannot refuse to do is nothing. Canadians will not accept that at the ballot box. Climate change has been an issue when Canadians have gone to the ballot box, and I think that the Conservatives are really underestimating how much people care about fighting climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603045">Canadian families stand to gain financially in the long run from fighting climate change with a carbon price. Other counties have demonstrated that. Actually, since it is Nobel Prize season, it is worth pointing out that William Nordhaus, not a Canadian but a fan of the Canadian carbon pricing system, won a Nobel Prize in economics for his work on carbon pricing and lowering our emissions with that market-based tool.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603046">Contrary to the numbers that the Conservatives continue to peddle, the commission concluded that carbon pricing would in fact boost Canadian incomes, on average, by $3,300 more in 2030 than if an alternative approach were taken or if absolutely nothing were done. Nothing is not an option.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603047">The global clean-energy transition is here. I will say that it actually matters in agriculture as well. My colleague and I have been on this topic a couple of times, with respect to propane-based irrigation. Canadians want affordable food and they also want low-carbon food. Our agriculture system has a carbon footprint, and it is actually one of the higher carbon footprints in the world with respect to agriculture. There are some unavoidable aspects of that. A propane-based irrigation system is not as efficient and certainly not as carbon-friendly as other forms of irrigation that are available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603048">A price on pollution provides a pricing mechanism to steer the agriculture sector toward greener production methods, because other technologies do exist, which is different from other sectors where things might not be available. It is important for us to demand better from various sectors, transportation, agriculture, oil and gas, and energy, that they lower their carbon footprint.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603049">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, but sorry, propane is not something we use in irrigation. I am not sure where the member is getting that information. Irrigation does not use propane. He needs to come out and see the electricity and natural gas it uses. It is not propane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603050">I thank the member for the rest of what he said. Adapting is what we need to do, but here is the real problem, which is taxing other levels of government. My neighbouring MP and I looked at the school systems and their buses, and at the municipalities. We looked at the health systems. There are tens of millions of dollars leaving our two ridings for carbon tax. That would be more doctors, more nurses, more teachers, and more people having programs and schools for their kids.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603051">Taxing other levels of government is a huge problem. We have been able to figure out that tens of millions of dollars have left our ridings in carbon tax. That is problematic, and we need a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603052">Mr. Speaker, carbon pricing has been on the agenda in the last two elections. In fact, my colleague got elected on the promise of a carbon tax with the former leader of the Conservative Party, Erin O'Toole. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603053">The Conservatives turned their backs on climate action. They decided they were not going to be a climate-forward party. We hardly ever hear of climate action or climate change from members of the Conservative Party these days. If they are not employing propane-based irrigation in my colleague's riding, then they are using a form of irrigation that does use fossil fuels. Whether that is relying on the energy grid, which is, unfortunately, high-carbon in Alberta, or using natural gas, as my colleague pointed out during his rebuttal speech, both of those have high carbon footprints. That needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603054">Electricity in Manitoba and Ontario has a lower carbon footprint, so our carbon charge with respect to our electricity bills is much lower than in Saskatchewan and Alberta. We need to move toward a no-coal, low-carbon energy grid. Unfortunately, as my colleague pointed out, Alberta's is high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603055">If the member wants to talk about education and health care, he needs to talk to Premier Smith, who has hardly mentioned those two issues as long as she has been premier.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603056">Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to raise concerns about radical criminal justice policies being introduced and considered by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603057">Right now, before the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is a report commissioned as part of the so-called Black justice strategy, and that report contains several radical policy proposals, including the decriminalization of a 30-day supply of hard drugs like meth, cocaine and heroine. The Minister of Justice has not rejected this proposal, as one might hope. In fact, the Minister of Justice celebrated it as “history-making” and “an important milestone”. It is unbelievable that the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would celebrate policies that threaten to flood more drugs into our communities, when one looks at our country's overdose statistics. Over 42,000 Canadians, including children, have died from drug overdoses under the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603058">The policy proposals in front of the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> also include proposals to defund police departments by limiting their access to federal grant money and to reduce Canada's prison population through mass decarceration of 30% over the next 10 years. I am pleading that the Liberal government and its justice minister reject these ideas as the harmful ideas they are and not celebrate them as achievements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603059">We have seen a massive increase in addictions and overdoses since the Liberals began to fund hard drugs with taxpayer dollars. We have seen an increase in crime since the Liberals made bail more accessible to repeat violent offenders. Police officers in our communities, including my home community of Durham, are doing their part. They are working hard to enforce the law, but they are being let down by the laws and policies of the current federal government. Police want to do their jobs, but when they arrest somebody multiple times for multiple crimes, and a repeat offender is allowed back on the streets in short order, it undermines policing across our country. How could the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> celebrate a proposal to cut police budgets?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603060">There is an ideological problem in the federal government right now. It is an ideology that has moved away from seeing the justice system as a system that ought to keep people safe and punish crime. Instead, there is an ideology running rampant all over this place that wants to weaken our justice system, because it regards our system as oppressive or racist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603061">Some people call this ideology “woke” or “far left”. Whatever label we choose or do not choose, I hope we can recognize the system needs to work for the good of the Canadian people. Tearing it down to permit more crime and more chaos will not help any of us. No matter what colour we are or where our parents come from, we need a strong system that is accountable, fair and true to its core mission of public safety and justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603062">With that core mission in mind, I return to my plea to the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> to please reject these radical criminal justice policies and please reject these radical policy proposals. Canadians do not want more drugs flooding into our communities. We do not want violent repeat offenders to have easier access to bail. We want our police to be resourced and empowered to enforce the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603063">I ask the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to reject these radical policies and to side with law-abiding Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603064">Mr. Speaker, today is World Mental Health Day, which is an opportunity to shine a light on crucial yet often overlooked aspects of our lives, one being mental health at work. This year's theme reminds us that our workplaces must be safe with respect to our collective and individual mental and psychological well-being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603065">Our work environments are ever-evolving and more dynamic than ever before. As leaders, employers and managers, we must all prioritize mental health just as we do physical health. Mental well-being is not a luxury; it is essential for productivity, creativity and overall workplace harmony. When employees feel supported, valued and understood, they thrive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603066">Our government has collaborated with various Canadian mental health agencies to create policies and invest in programs that prevent mental health risks, promote well-being and build supportive workplaces where mental health is prioritized. So, on this World Mental Health Day, I would like to thank mental health workers of all kinds right across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603067">I was asked to come to the adjournment debate tonight to talk about mental health and addictions policy. However, those sorts of guardrails get a little stretched occasionally, but if the member of Parliament for Durham would like to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="311639" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, then he needs to indicate that. I came tonight to talk about mental health policy and measures that we have undertaken to address the overdose crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603068">It is also important to recognize that, when in government, Canadians of all walks of life, whether they are left, or as my colleague might label them “woke”, centrists or more far on the right end of the spectrum, even if they are sometimes considered extreme, if they are academics, if they are workplace experts or if they just have ideas, governments need to be open to good ideas, regardless of who those ideas are coming from. We should invite good ideas. This place should be a contest of ideas in fact, and we should not be afraid to criticize those ideas and should not be close-minded about hearing them either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603069"> It seems as though in this place it is similar to a debate that happened a couple of years ago when an organization suggested that the federal government consider taxing the equity of personal primary residences. It is a notion that our government soundly rejected and did not want to do. Canadians do not want their primary residence home equity to be taxed. However, since somebody brought it up at a meeting, the Conservatives ran with it and sent out a whole bunch of mail that said, “Look, these Liberals are trying to tax home equity”, which was not true. However, suggestions that my colleague has made with respect to policy recommendations made by a third party are also not true. I am also certain that was a large document with multiple recommendations and suggestions. As a government, we will remain open-minded to the good suggestions from academics, civil service organizations, groups of people and experts, because that is important to do as a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603070">I will turn back to the issue of all of the efforts we have undertaken to address the overdose crisis, which include efforts right across the continuum of care to prevent drug use, to reduce harm, and to support people in accessing treatment and recovery services that they need and deserve. We will remain committed to maintaining public safety through all of those enforcement efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603071">There are four aspects of drug policy and overdose crisis response that are all very important. It is like a table, and without any one of those four legs, that table falls down. They are prevention, harm reduction, treatment and enforcement. If any group, party or academic suggests that an effective drug policy can operate without all four of those aspects, then they are wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603072">The Government of Canada has invested almost $200 billion over the last 10 years to support provinces and territories to deliver health services in addition to the $1 billion that we have directly invested to address this drug crisis, and we will continue to be there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603073">Mr. Speaker, let us return to some logic here for a moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603074">We have, in the last nine years, lost 42,000 Canadians, including children, to drug overdoses. Some policy report comes across the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice's</Affiliation> desk saying to decriminalize hard drugs, a 30-day supply of hard drugs. Now, the logical response to that would be, “no”, rejection, and “we are not going to be doing that”. This is what I am asking the Liberal government to say. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603075">However, what did the Liberals say when that policy proposal came to their desk? It was celebrated. The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> said openly in a press release that it was “an important milestone” and “history-making”. That is not a logical response to a very serious problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603076">What we need is specific vision and direction on how we are going to help struggling Canadians move forward, not to entertain more radical criminal justice policies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8603077">Mr. Speaker, we all have a role to play in stopping the spread of misinformation, and the Conservatives, over the last couple of years, have made a tabloid of a lot of things they read in the ecosystem. Perhaps news is not as reliable as it used to be, or perhaps some of the Conservatives are getting their news from less trustworthy sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8603078">The truth is that, on May 17, 2024, we refused a request from Toronto Public Health to decriminalize the personal possession of controlled substances for people in Toronto, including youth. Health Canada reviews all exemption requests carefully and thoroughly on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration and account all relevant options, including evidence of potential benefits, and risks and harms to the health and safety of Canadians. It was determined that the model proposed would not adequately protect public health and maintain public safety.</ParaText>
