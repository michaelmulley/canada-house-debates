              <ParaText id="7366505">Sadly, we recently lost Kari to depression and an anxiety disorder that made the future so bleak for her that she saw no point in going on living. On behalf of our entire community, we extend our condolences to Maggie, John and the extended Kokko family.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366508">Suicide can be prevented, and help is available. We all have a role to play. Let us also keep Kari and David's families in our hearts as we push for increased mental health resources so they might be accessible to anyone who needs them, without wait times, early discharge, discrimination or cost.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366510">Councillor Lai emigrated from Hong Kong in 1972 and built a successful career in real estate sales and management here in Canada. She became the first Chinese-Canadian woman to serve as president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. Elected to Toronto City Council in 2018, Councillor Lai was a voice for the unheard and under-represented. A relentless advocate for the Scarborough subway, she filled every room with energy, positivity and big ideas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366511">Last Friday, Councillor Lai was on a clear path to re-election in Monday’s municipal election when she lost her battle with cancer. On behalf of the people of Scarborough North, I extend my deepest condolences to her family, her husband, C.K. Fung, and their two sons, Derrick and Darren.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366527">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise this afternoon to highlight the work of community land trusts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366528">Over the past few days, the Alliance of Canadian Land Trusts, a newly formed umbrella network that advocates for local land trusts at the national level, has been holding a summit here in Ottawa. These community-based organizations are at the forefront of local action on conservation and climate change, with programs such as the land trust conservation fund, part of the much larger natural heritage conservation program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366529">Our government has invested $20 million through these local land trusts. This government investment has been more than doubled, and yes, more than tripled. It was actually quadrupled the money it had raised from private funds. This money has supported over 40 organizations and 116 projects, and it has protected over 13,000 hectares of nature reserves since 2009. The return on the $20 million invested by our government has been phenomenal, due to the work these land trusts have done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366530">The success of our government and country in meeting our environmental goals, both in emissions reduction and biodiversity protection, depends on all of these local land trusts, boards, volunteers and donors. For that, our government joins with me in thanking the new Alliance of Canadian Land Trusts and its member organizations greatly.</ParaText>

With the support of our Indo-Canadian friends, community organizations and mandirs from across the country, tonight at 6:30 p.m. I will be delighted to host the 22nd national Diwali celebration at the Sir John A. Macdonald Building. I hope all my colleagues will join us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366549">The Diwali celebration on Parliament Hill was started by our dear friend the late Hon. Deepak Obhrai. With this inaugural event, Canada became the first western democracy to celebrate Diwali in Parliament, in 1998. We continue this tradition by joining hands across political boundaries to light the Diwali lamp, a gesture that symbolizes the banishment of darkness and the ushering in of light, peace and hope. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366552">Mr. Speaker, women are misdiagnosed 30% more often than men. This gender gap in medicine stems from the lack of knowledge of women’s medical conditions and experiences. That is why I am thrilled that our government just launched the national women's health research initiative, an investment of $20 million to enhance health outcomes for women and eliminate gaps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366553">In the past, researchers excluded women from participating in early-phase drug trials in case they would accidentally fall pregnant during the trial, and women were generally left out of medical research because their hormonal cycles would complicate results. This has led to the complete neglect of conditions that primarily affect women, such as ovarian cancer and endometriosis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366554">Another factor contributing to this gender gap is a lack of trust in women to report on their own health. When doctors cannot explain why a female patient is in pain, she is told that she is under stress, that she suffers from depression or that it is hormonal. This is unacceptable. The women's caucus considers this a top priority and asks women in Canada who agree to please stand up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366822">Mr. Speaker, citizens and residents of Canada are drawing the attention of the House of Commons to the following: The Liberal Party of Canada promised in its 2021 platform to deny the charitable status of organizations that have convictions about abortion, which the Liberal Party views as dishonest. This may jeopardize, they say, the charitable status of many other institutions, such as hospitals, churches, schools, homeless shelters and other charitable organizations which do amazing work in Canada. They do not agree with the Liberal Party on this matter for reasons of conscience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366823">Many Canadians depend on and benefit from charitable work done by such organizations, and the government has previously used a values test, through the summer jobs program, denying funding to organizations not willing to endorse the political positions of the governing party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366824">They therefore call on the government to recognize that all Canadians have a right under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to freedom of expression without discrimination. They also call on the government to protect and preserve the application of charitable status rules that are politically and ideologically neutral, without discrimination on the basis of political or religious values and without the imposition of another values test.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366826">It relates to the really high value and importance of old-growth forests for Canada, particularly in the context of indigenous values, indigenous exercise of rights under treaties and the indigenous role in fighting the climate crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366827">Petitioners are calling for the Government of Canada to act to protect the last unprotected, intact old-growth forests on southern Vancouver Island, specifically referencing Fairy Creek. They call on the government to work with provinces and first nations to immediately halt logging of endangered old-growth ecosystems, move to high-value forest initiatives in partnership with first nations, preferring value added and the harvesting of second and third-growth forests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366828">The petitioners specifically also call for banning the use of whole trees for wood pellets, in what is described as a fairly fraudulent climate action because it does not reduce emissions of carbon, but it does remove forest. They also call for banning the export of raw logs, whole logs, from Canada, to instead make sure they reach Canadian mills to create Canadian jobs.</ParaText>

They comment on how this access is an important public health and public safety concern.

Moreover, the age verification software can ascertain the age of users without breaching their privacy rights.</ParaText>

The use of a sound moderator is the only universally recognized health and safety device, but it is criminally prohibited in Canada. We are the only one of the G7 countries that fails to recognize the health and safety benefits of the use of sound moderators by hunters and sports shooters. As affirmed in the Bedford v. Canada case, one cannot be prevented from taking reasonable steps to improve their personal safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366851">The petition also states that sound moderators reduce noise pollution and noise complaints within communities close to shooting ranges, in rural and farming communities and in areas for recreational activities where hunting, sport shooting and target shooting are legal. The use of sound moderators significantly increases the humane husbandry of game animals, livestock and pets as hunting companions. Hearing damage is a significant loss to the quality of life. This public health issue is costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars.</ParaText>

There are many victims and their families who have spoken out about the need to respond to the ruling that values each and every life that is taken when there is a case of mass murder in Canada. These cases are rare, but they do happen. The families of victims have said they do not want to go through the burden and retraumatization that is involved with parole hearings. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366876"> I would remind the House that eligibility for parole is not the same as parole. A life sentence is a long time, and a parole hearing, yes, is still there.

              <ParaText id="7366880">This bill is about judges' maintaining their independence but also maintaining the ability to discipline themselves in cases where the behaviour of a judge will bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The legislation itself was 50 years old. It was taken on by the Canadian Judicial Council, the council of all the chief justices of federally appointed courts across Canada, and reformed. A process was created that was not only fair in terms of hearing all sides, but also streamlined in terms of its appeal routes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366881"> We have seen very recently a case in which a judge fought tooth and nail and sought judicial review at every step of the way, costing a lot of money and a lot of time. Then, before the House had the opportunity to censure that judge, he resigned with his pension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366882">Therefore, we have a more streamlined process, a fair process and one with clear routes of appeal. It is designed by justices who, quite frankly, were fed up that their reputation was being brought into disrepute, so we have a better system, a less costly system and a fairer system. For that reason, it is important. It was in front of the Senate in the previous Parliament. Senators made some minor changes to the bill, technical changes that are very acceptable and have now taken their place in the new iteration of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366883"> It is long overdue. The justices want it. The Canadian Judicial Council asked us again this fall to get it going, so here we are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366884">Mr. Speaker, I am restricting my comments right now to the issue of time allocation. I will oppose time allocation in every instance, unless the circumstances are truly exigent. I first served in this place when Stephen Harper's government had a majority and, for the first time in parliamentary history, closure motions such as this became routine. We lamented it at the time. At the time, we, including the Liberal third party members and the New Democrats, all lamented and opposed the fact that, when I counted it up, there had been more closure motions in the previous 40 days than in the previous 40 years. We kept counting them up and seeing how egregious this was. I will oppose closure motions except in a case in which we see that Canadians are desperate for financial help and we are slowing something down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366885">This bill is very much needed. With respect to the case that was just referred to by the hon. justice minister, the judge was someone who, two weeks before being appointed to the bench, was caught on video buying cocaine. This is not someone we want on the bench, but the current state of the rights of a judge to keep going through appeals lasts a long time. I agree that it is egregious. The bill should be passed, but not at the cost of our democracy.</ParaText>

That leads us to a point at which we are not serving Canadians anymore. We are not adding. That is not a debate, in any sense of the word. That is just talking, and it is talking meaninglessly, in a sense.

The minister mentioned that people stand up and repeat and repeat and repeat. It is really important to me to have the opportunity to represent my constituents in this place and speak on issues that are important to me and to them, regardless of who else has spoken on them already. Quite often in this House, different people are in the room at different times, and it is an opportunity to continue that conversation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366913">As well, this rush the government seems to find itself in so often is because of mismanagement of its programs. An example would be its decision on COVID wage support. It came up with a percentage. We worked hard to convince the government this was not going to be effective enough, and we had to turn around and come back to this place and go through the motions again because of a change there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366914">On providing loans through the banks, it did not include the credit unions as a means of doing that, and it took time for our constituents and the credit unions to bring that to the forefront. That is why we needed to continue: to ensure things were being handled in certain ways. That is our responsibility in this place. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7366917">However, when debate is done and procedural shenanigans are added simply for the purpose of slowing down the passage of legislation, when it is no longer the case that bettering the bill or furthering debate is the point of the exercise, then it is time to have a vote and move on.

              <ParaText id="7366929">It is something that judges, in particular, feel needs to pass quickly. They have implored us to do it. They came out in September in a press release and said they wanted us to pass this quickly. When one member of the judiciary gets criticized for behaviour that is not becoming of a judge and it brings the system of justice into disrepute, they all feel it. It is important that they exercise this responsibility and create a better system to better manage themselves and hold themselves to the highest standard. It is important for us to react to that and to change something that was originally enacted 50 years ago. Reform to it is long overdue.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7366961">Today is an important day. We will be discussing an important program that is within Motion No. 62, a motion to welcome 10,000 Uighur who are facing genocide within China right now, at this moment in time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366962">This motion calls for the Government of Canada to resettle 10,000 Uighur as of 2024 from third countries. Why third countries? It is because we cannot welcome, unfortunately, Uighur who are currently undergoing the genocide within China, but we can provide safe haven for vulnerable Uighur within third countries. These third countries primarily include countries from north Africa and the Arab world, but not exclusively. There are several other countries where Uighur people are living and are present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366963">We have heard a lot of testimony from survivors at committees and at the Subcommittee on International Human Rights. In the past we have heard horrifying nightmare stories of people being abused in unspeakable ways, of women being violated and men too. We heard about forced labour. There are over a million people currently in forced labour camps. We heard about children, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, being separated from their families when they should be in the care of their moms and dads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366964">We know that 20% of the world's cotton is produced in China, likely tainted by forced labour. We know that 35% of tomato products are also tainted by forced labour because they come from the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region. We know that 45% of polyurethane, which is the base material for solar panels, as the world tries to go green, is also tainted by forced labour. This is wholly and entirely unacceptable. This is something that we, as a country and as a human family, must stand up against.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366965">We had a motion from the benches opposite in February 2021 that called on the House to recognize that a genocide is in fact occurring. Thankfully the House voted unanimously and spoke with one voice on that matter. Not a single person voted against it. We unanimously voted to recognize that a genocide is in fact occurring toward the Uighur people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366966">This issue is not a partisan issue. For those who make it such, shame on them. They know who they are. This is an issue about people who are dying, who are being violated and who are being mistreated. We said after World War II that this would not happen again. After Bosnia and Yugoslavia, we also reconfirmed that intent. After what happened in Rwanda, we did the same, and with the Rohingya again. Now we know, a genocide is occurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366967">What are we going to do? We heard the reports. We know the reports. Many of us have read the reports, over 50 pages long, from Michelle Bachelet, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. She said that these allegations of the Uighur people are well-founded, and they also may amount to international crimes, including crimes against humanity. These are high crimes in international law, as is genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366968">The international community, in 2005, said that these types of international crimes must be prevented. Therefore, each and every country has a responsibility to protect when we see crimes against humanity occurring, or the threat of them occurring. When we see genocide occurring or the threat of genocide occurring, we, as a human family, as a collective of countries and as Canada, all have a responsibility to protect.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7366969">Our responsibility is engaged and we must act. One way in which we can answer this is by voting for this program to welcome 10,000 Uighurs here in Canada. We have a proud tradition in our country of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers. This is a proud Canadian tradition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366970">This program will not halt the genocide. It will put a slight dent in it. This program will not answer our obligation, the responsibility, to protect. It will in part answer it. This is something that speaks to our tradition. This is something that we can do, should do, must do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366971">In the past, we have welcomed many different people who have been fleeing for their lives from genocides, from crimes against humanity. Recently, we can think of Yazidis, Syrians and Afghans. We can think of Hongkongers. We created some special pathways. We can do this again, now, today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366972">I will share some facts about the Uighur people. Who are they? We hear the term but we do not know who they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366973">Like all people, they are a proud people. They live in the western part of China, what they have traditionally called East Turkestan, what we know in international law as Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366974">Xinjiang has a particular meaning. It means “new frontier” in the tongue of the majority of people within China. It is approximately, as I mentioned, one-sixth the land mass of China. It also has many vast deserts and mountains. It historically has been part of the ancient Silk Road trade route that connected China, that allowed for trade to occur to Europe and the Middle East. That trade route is being revived, but with a modern update, with highways and the free flow of goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366975">That is why the supply chain issue is a big question. The current belt and road initiative runs through Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366976">As I mentioned earlier, 20% of the world's cotton is produced there. Eighty per cent of China's cotton actually comes from the region. I will repeat that for all of us who buy cotton. Eighty per cent of Chinese cotton comes from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, as does 35% of tomato products, pasta and pizza.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366977">I love pasta and pizza. Contrary to first impressions, I am actually one-quarter Italian and one-quarter Sicilian. I joke sometimes that my colour comes from my Sicilian side. It is a bad joke, but I say it sometimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366978">We know that approximately 45% of the base materials for solar panels come from that region also. Minerals, such as gold, silver and zinc come from there. It is very mineral-rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366979">There has been atomic testing also in the region since the 1960s. In addition to all of the horrors that we heard, these things are occurring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366980">These horrors are real, so real, as I mentioned, that the former high commissioner of human rights, Michelle Bachelet, said that these allegations are well-founded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366981">Thankfully, in addition to my motion, we had a preview this week in the House when we were discussing and then voted to concur in the immigration committee's report, which called for immigration. That report unfortunately, or fortunately, did not specify something. That report that we all unanimously concurred in this week said that we should create special immigration measures for Uighur people and other Turkic minorities, but we did not specify what those measures should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366982">This motion does exactly that. It completes what happened earlier this week, when we said, “Let us do this.” This motion says how. This motion is precise. It is specific. It is time-bound. It is what we need.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7366983">In addition to this, we thankfully have a number of initiatives in the House, and I would like to see them all pass and made into law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366984">First is Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>, which is on forced labour. It is a very important bill. Thankfully, our <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> has said that we support it. She said that in August, when replying to Michelle Bachelet's report that there may be crimes against humanity occurring within the region, so already our foreign affairs minister has said such. This initiative started in the Senate and now is in the House. It is actually heading to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366985">We also have a second initiative on organ harvesting: Bill <Document DbId="11474651" Type="4">S-223</Document>, which is also an important piece of legislation. Organ harvesting does occur within Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region, but not exclusively there. We know that Falun Gong, or Falun Dafa, practitioners have been subject to this in the past. It is well documented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366986">These are a number of the initiatives that are in progress and happening right now. They are initiatives that we should all be supporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366987">Our government has done a handful of things. We have implemented Magnitsky sanctions against four individuals and one entity that are active and responsible for these crimes. This was done in advance of the genocide motion of February 2021. We also have a number of advisory opinions for companies operating within Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region. As an advocate, I would like always to see that strengthened, and that must be strengthened through Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366988">I would like to highlight something. While we are speaking squarely about the crimes against humanity and genocide occurring within China, we need to be careful not to fall into unconscious bias about Asians and Chinese people. That is very important, as we advocate clearly and unambiguously, to not to fall into that. At the end, I personally have, on this issue, no qualms, if and when the government in China were to stop doing what it is doing, I personally would not speak on this issue, but only if and when China does stop doing what it is doing. However, until then, all of us, including myself, must speak on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7366989">I would like to impress upon the House how we united behind my motion. I want to share something. My seconder is Rachel Bendayan, a colleague of mine in the benches.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367011">Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this motion and everybody who is joining us for this debate. I know there are many people present in the precinct and following along online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367012">I have the honour of being the co-chair, along with my friend, the mover of this motion, of the parliamentary friendship group for Uighurs. That is one of many reasons that I am proud to speak in support of Motion No. 62 and express the support of the Conservative Party for this motion. I expect that when it comes to a vote, we will be able to speak united and with one voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367013">I think there is a critically important role for the official opposition, which is to support the government in the areas we agree with and challenge the government when there are gaps in the response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367014">This issue is deeply personal for me. It is not hard to tell that I am not of Uighur background myself, but my grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. She was a Jewish child who grew up in Germany and hid out, and many of her family members were killed. I was raised with an awareness of the grievous injustice that had been visited upon her extended family. She was in a position, as a vulnerable child and a member of a persecuted minority, where she was not able to speak out about her own situation, but she survived the war because people who had a voice and had an opportunity to speak had the courage to speak out against what was happening, the injustices that were happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367015">I have a big portrait on the wall in my office of Blessed Clemens von Galen, who was the bishop of the Munster area of Germany where she was. He was a bold, fearless critic of the Nazis, someone who had a position of privilege within that society and used his position to speak out against injustice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367016">A couple of years ago, my sister and I took a trip to Berlin. We were looking at the sites of deportation. What strikes Canadians when they go to Europe is how much closer everything is together. We are used to wide open spaces. We saw the streets through which Jews were brought to a train station and where they were being sent away, and what struck me was the apartment buildings that are close by where people, everyday Germans, would have been living. They would have been able to look down and see their former neighbours and people from their community being pushed and herded away to their deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367017">When I was there with my sister, we talked about this, and I wondered what these people were thinking, the ones who could see what was going on. Perhaps they had a mix of perspectives and knew it was wrong but were afraid in some way of the consequences of speaking out for truth and justice. What were they thinking? Why did they not do more?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367018">At the end of the Second World War, we made a promise to my grandmother's generation of “never again”. Never again would we allow people to be slaughtered because of their ethnic or religious background. We would do everything possible to make genocide a crime and stop it everywhere. However, in the seven years I have spent as a member of Parliament, we have recognized and responded to not one but multiple cases of ongoing genocide. It is clear that we have failed to deliver on the promise we made to my grandmother's generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367019">I think about those apartment buildings and the people who could see the injustice happening in front of them. Today, we have satellite imagery. We do not need to be in apartment buildings directly above what is happening. We can see the photographs. We can look at the numbers and see the precipitous drop in birth rates as a result of forced abortion, forced sterilization and systemic sexual violence targeting the Uighur community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367020">I owe it to my grandmother and to those like her to use the voice I have now to speak out against contemporary injustices, recognize the failure to live up to that promise of “never again” and do all we can to respond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367021">The first step should be a recognition of the crime of genocide, because in the history of jurisprudence following the Second World War, we tried to establish this crime of genocide and establish a responsibility to protect. Individual nations that are a party to the genocide convention have an obligation. It is not just an obligation where there is conclusive proof of genocide, but an obligation when there is evidence that genocide may be occurring.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7367022">Those obligations exist for individual states who are parties to that convention. Those obligations do not depend on whether some international body determines it to be a genocide. Those obligations are for individual states who are signatories to the genocide convention. Canada is a signatory, so Canada has obligations. We have a responsibility to act to protect when we see a genocide happening or when there is evidence to suggest that there may be a genocide happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367023">This testimony was clearly given by former justice minister Irwin Cotler at the Subcommittee on International Human Rights when we studied this question. He made clear in his testimony that not one but all five of the possible conditions of the genocide convention have likely been transgressed in the case of Uighurs. The evidence was clear then, and the evidence is more clear now than it was then. When this Parliament first voted on the question of genocide recognition, it was before some of the new information that has come out since and various other tribunals that have made all the more clear the situation we are in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367024">The problem is that, since nations have recognized that they have an obligation to respond to genocide and that they have an obligation to protect in the case of genocide, those same nations have become reluctant to acknowledge that a genocide is taking place, because when they acknowledge that a genocide is happening, then they are legally obliged to act. However, whether or not they are willing to admit that they know, they do know because the evidence is clear. To paraphrase William Wilberforce, we may choose to look away, but in the face of the evidence, we may never again say that we did not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367025">The evidence has been there, yet again this week we had a motion before the House on genocide recognition. Everyone who voted, voted in favour of genocide recognition, but the cabinet still abstained. This is extremely important because, if the government had voted in favour of that motion, it would be recognizing the legal obligations it has under the genocide convention, but it still failed to do that. I salute members of all parties who have been prepared to take that step nonetheless, but it would be that much more impactful if the cabinet, if the Government of Canada, was prepared to take that step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367026">The House of Commons, by the way, has led in the world. We were the first democratic legislature in the world to recognize the Uighur genocide, and many other legislatures followed. Ironically, while our legislature has led, the government has not yet taken that step. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367027">Nonetheless, there are still so many more things that we can do and we need to do. Now we are seeing myriad private member's motions and bills coming from various parties that respond to the recognition that at least individual members have, if not the government, that a genocide is taking place. We have Motion No. 62, which seeks to advance targeted immigration measures to support Uighurs. We have various pieces of legislation, such as Bill <Document DbId="11474494" Type="4">S-211</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11474400" Type="4">S-204</Document>, that seek to address forced labour. We have proposals, such Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>, which would strengthen our sanctions regime and allow parliamentary committees to nominate individuals for sanction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367028">We see this flurry of activity now from members of Parliament and senators using the power that we have as parliamentarians to respond to this recognition of genocide, but the ultimate power rests in the hands of the government. It is the government that has to act, even in the case of the motion before us, which is a non-binding motion that makes a recommendation to the government. It is an important tool to encourage the government to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367029">Of course, the government did not have to wait for Motion No. 62, and it does not need to wait for it now. The motion contains a timeline that is fairly generous to the government, fair enough, but I would challenge the government to take up its responsibility. Individual members of Parliament are doing what we can to be a voice for the voiceless to recognize the reality, and the government must as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367030">I believe that every single member of this cabinet who has looked at the evidence knows that a genocide is happening and knows that they have an obligation. It will be to their eternal shame if they do not act on that knowledge as soon as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367031">Madam Speaker, my friend from Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan gave an excellent speech, and I want to commend him for it. It is always a pleasure to work with him, particularly on the file that we are discussing this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367032">I think I am kicking this off by being transpartisan. Just last week, I was saying that we have different ideas in the House. It is not always easy working with my colleagues from other parties, but I am not in the habit of playing partisan games. I even think that, most of the time, being transpartisan helps me to do my job properly. In politics, there are issues where partisanship has no place. Obviously, human rights issues fall into that category. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367033">It will therefore come as no surprise to anyone when I say that, like my Bloc Québécois colleagues, I support Motion No. 62, which seeks to protect the Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims from China by resettling them in Canada. I know that many of my friends from the Uighur community are in the gallery this evening. I want to sincerely welcome them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367034">On October 21, 2020, the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights issued a statement in which it said: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367035">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Subcommittee unequivocally condemns the persecution of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang by the Government of China. Based on the evidence put forward during the Subcommittee hearings, both in 2018 and 2020, the Subcommittee is persuaded that the actions of the Chinese Communist Party constitute genocide as laid out in the <I>Genocide Convention</I>.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367036">In a way, Motion No. 62 is a continuation of past positions taken by the House. It contains four demands that I will sum up for those who are watching us: the recognition that Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims from China have emigrated to escape repression and intimidation by the Chinese state; the recognition that many third countries face pressure from China to deport those it refers to as “critics”; the need to welcome refugees over a period of two years starting in 2024; and the need for the government to table a report with a detailed plan within 120 sitting days following the adoption of the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367037">That is the motion. I just want to reiterate this. Motion No. 62 states that Parliament determined that China's treatment of Uighurs is genocide, but, as mentioned earlier, the council of ministers cravenly abstained during the vote on the previous motion. As I speak here in the House, close to two million Uighurs and Turkic Muslims are being held in concentration camps that Chinese authorities odiously refer to as “vocational training centres”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367038">Mass rapes and numerous acts of torture are being committed in these camps. Women are being forcibly sterilized, adults and children are being kidnapped, and surveillance camera systems are being combined with artificial intelligence software to track Uighurs around the globe. A full-fledged campaign of cultural erasure is also being waged, including the indoctrination of prisoners and the suppression of all Uighur cultural expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367039">The facts are disturbing. Parliamentarians of all parties are aware of them. I do not know how the House will vote on my colleague's motion, but one thing is certain: Nobody can plead ignorance. In fact, next to turning a blind eye, ignorance is the greatest ally of totalitarian regimes. Let us not be ignorant. Let us not be blind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367040">At this very moment, the most awful crime that a government can perpetrate against its own citizens is taking place: genocide. The Bloc Québécois has been at the forefront of denouncing the genocide against the Uighurs, notably by amending the February 2021 motion to force the government to demand that the Olympic Games be moved out of China. The government settled for a diplomatic boycott that had no effect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367041">In response to this proposal and that of the Bloc Québécois, some people told us that we should not mix politics and sport. Our response was that when we are confronted with a genocide, it is no longer a question of politics. It is a question of human rights, a question of crimes against humanity. I made that effort so that justice could be done. We did it so that justice could be done. We did it for the Uighurs, so that the crimes of China's regime would not be unjustly rewarded with the prestige of hosting the world's best athletes in its capital city.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7367042">Much like the 1936 Berlin Games, history will unfortunately remember the Beijing Olympic Winter Games as the games of shame. As both a member of Parliament and as a human being, I simply cannot accept the status quo. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367043">My colleague's motion calls on the Government of Canada to welcome 10,000 Uighur and other Turkic Muslim refugees from China over a two-year period beginning in 2024. As I said earlier, the Bloc Québécois supports the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367044">Nevertheless, part of me still believes that this is a bit arbitrary. Why is the number of refugees set at 10,000? What bothers me about this number is that the Uighur advocacy groups that I speak with every day are saying that this is not enough, that we should take in many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367045">The Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship has once again applied a double standard to this situation. This is probably the result of political rather than humanitarian decisions. I cannot say for sure, which is why federal immigration programs need to be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that they are fair going forward when it comes to welcoming refugees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367046">I want to point out that Motion No. 62 calls on the government to table in the House, within 120 sitting days following its adoption, a report on how the refugee resettlement plan will be implemented. That is a good thing, because we know the Liberal government has a tendency to ignore motions from the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367047">The government must respond quickly to make sure that the plan does not end up gathering dust on a shelf, like many immigration and refugee files do. Requiring the government to table a report is necessary and even essential, but it seems to me that 120 sitting days is much too long for members of the Uighur community to wait. The government needs to respond much more quickly than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367048">At the risk of repeating myself, I want to close with a reminder. I often have the opportunity to rise in the House to speak to motions proposed by all of the parties, and I think that we are all on the same side when it comes to providing assistance, and rightly so. I would remind members that a genocide is taking place as I stand before the House today. As parliamentarians, we must work for the common good without any partisanship, and that is especially true when it comes to human rights issues. It is with that in mind that I support my colleague's motion, but I am mainly supporting it because I stand for the principles of justice, and it is high time that justice prevailed for my Uighur friends.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367049">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who are standing in the House tonight defending the Uighur people. I agree with many of my colleagues when they say this is an issue that is beyond partisan politics. This is not an issue that we should be bickering about. This is an issue that all parliamentarians must come together for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367050">I was elected in 2019 and the very first committee I was put on was the international human rights subcommittee. I was put on that committee, I believe, because I have done work in international human rights for most of my career. One of the very first studies we undertook within that committee was to look at what was happening to the Uighur people, to the people in Xinjiang. It was very difficult testimony. I have said that in this House before. It was among the most difficult things I have heard, the stories of torture, of rape, of forced sterilization; of surveillance. The horrific testimony that we heard from people who had escaped was almost impossible to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367051">I have mentioned in this place before that for me, my job was to bear witness. My job was to hear that testimony. I did not have to endure what we have asked the Uighur people to endure. I was elected in 2019, so I am a relatively new parliamentarian, but I have to say that it has been three years. I have been a member for three years and I have not seen the action that we need to see to protect the Uighur people. We have not seen action by the government that would make me think it is taking this genocide seriously, that it is acting with the urgency that is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367052">There are many people in this place right now that have loved ones who are still in concentration camps, that they may not know where they are, that they know have been tortured, that they know have had to endure horrific experiences. To those people, as a parliamentarian in Canada, I have to say I am sorry. I am sorry that we have let them down, that we have not done everything we can to stop the genocide that we all have agreed is happening to their people. I am sorry that we have not been strong enough, that we have not done what we needed to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367053">We did declare this a genocide. This Parliament did say that this is a genocide and we do have obligations when we recognize that; every one of us. We all look at the horrific genocides that have happened in history. We said never again; never will we put the lives of people at risk this way; never will we turn a blind eye to the death of a people, and yet for three years we have been doing that. For longer than three years we have been doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367054">I am extremely proud to support the motion that has been brought forward by my colleague from Pierrefonds—Dollard. I am very happy that I have been able to work with him at the international human rights subcommittee. I am very happy that I have been able to work with members from all parties on this important work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367055">I am extremely proud of my colleague for the work that he has done and what he has brought forward. Of course I am concerned about the fact that when we have votes in the House, cabinet does not participate. Of course I am concerned that this is a motion. We know that a motion is not binding. We know that a motion is not legislation. It is not protecting Uighurs the way we need to. I understand this may be what he felt he was able to achieve at this point with the government, but it is not enough. It is not near enough. This does not go far enough to protect the people. As parliamentarians, as people who believe in human rights, as people who believe in human dignity, it does not go as far as we need it to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367056">I will say that in terms of the immigration issues that this motion brings forward, bringing 10,000 people to Canada who are fleeing violence, of course I support that. I do not understand and never will understand why every single persecuted group in the world is not given the unlimited number that certain persecuted groups in the world are given.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7367057">I will never understand why it is unlimited Ukrainians, and I am a hundred per cent in support of unlimited Ukrainians coming to Canada to flee persecution from the Russian war in their country. However, I do not understand why it is not unlimited people coming from other countries as well. I do not understand how we can put that value in place, how we can say that for some it is unlimited and for some we have a 10,000 limit. I do not understand it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367058">The other piece that we really need to talk about here tonight is that this motion calls for allowing 10,000 Uighurs fleeing violence to come to Canada, but we are not doing enough to make sure that the Uighurs in concentration camps, the Uighurs in China, can actually come to Canada. They are being held in concentration camps and tortured in China, and many of them are unable to get to safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367059">As a member of the international community, we also have a very big obligation to be doing what we can to ensure that the government in China is being held to account. Canada used to be a diplomatic powerhouse. We are not a giant powerhouse. We are not a massive economy or whatnot. However, we used to be seen as a convenor, a clear diplomat, a leader in terms of diplomacy. We used to have an ability to bring countries together, to bring groups forward to work together and to bring action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367060">Unfortunately, I do not feel like Canada has the ability to do that anymore. I feel like we have undermined our ability to do that, that we have in fact put trade at the top of all our relationships to the detriment of our relationships with regard to diplomacy, to the detriment of our relationships with development. We do not have relationships anymore that we can use to push things forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367061">A perfect example for me is that the human rights council was going to have a debate on the Uighur genocide. They really did need to get the votes from countries around the world to participate. China has a massive power, and it used that massive power to cajole, bully, force and make other countries vote on its side. It used all these different tricks and tools. As a country, we do not have the ability to push back on that any longer. That is a mistake. That is a place we have failed to be able to protect the Uighur people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367062">I would like to see us invest in diplomacy. I would like to see us invest in building those relationships so we can bring our allies and other democracies together, and so that as a common voice we are standing up for the Uighur people. As a common voice we have more ability to put pressure on the Chinese government to ensure that it is stopping the genocide against the Uighur people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367063">The support from multilateral institutions is key to making sure those institutions have unfettered access. That is a key thing that Canada can do to make sure we are able to report adequately on what is happening in China and invest in support for human rights activists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367064">The incredible human rights activists who are part of the Uighur population, who are standing up for Uighurs around the world, have raised their voices for years to get support, and Canada could play an important role in protecting them while they fight for their people, while they fight for the people in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367065">Finally, I have to say that as a Parliament, as a government, as a country, we must all stand and be very unified in condemning what is happening in China against the Uighur people. That includes our cabinet. That includes the government. That includes every member of the House of Commons. We need to stand together, condemn what is happening there and raise our voices to say, “No, we are not putting trade ahead of human lives. No, we are not going to say that money is more important than people. Not this time. Not anymore.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367066">Madam Speaker, it is with an immense sense of responsibility that I rise in the House to speak to a motion that I am sponsoring as the seconder. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367067">I would like to take my colleagues back to 2009. Many things were happening in 2009. The world was still in the grips of the great financial crisis, Barack Obama had just been elected and the people of Iran were holding massive protests against the Islamic regime. Some things change while others do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367068">I want to take my colleagues to the city of Urumqi, capital of the Uighur autonomous region of Xinjiang, also known as East Turkestan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367069">On July 5, 2009, a peaceful protest turned violent after the police used force to subdue the protesters. The riots lasted several weeks. These events were the impetus for the Chinese government to launch a broad campaign of expulsions, detention and torture against its Uighur citizens under the guise of combatting terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367070">Since then, the repression has intensified considerably. The Chinese government has imprisoned millions of Uighurs, most of them over the past five years. We have seen terrifying images of internment camps built for the sole purpose of suppressing the identity of the Uighur people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367071">The so-called “Xinjiang papers”, published in 2019 by The New York Times, detailed China's policies of surveillance and control of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Those who are not imprisoned find themselves under ever more intense surveillance. Forced labour and forced sterilizations are two of the main tools used to oppress the local population and erase their identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367072">In keeping with its modus operandi of using coercive diplomacy, the Chinese government is exerting immense pressure on countries around the world to turn a blind eye to these grave violations in Xinjiang, and I am sorry to say that it is paying off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367073">Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Council refused to open a debate on China's human rights violations in the region. Seventeen countries were on the right side of history, while 19 countries gave in to Chinese blackmail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367074">This comes a few months after China put considerable pressure on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to bury a report on China's human rights abuses. Although it was announced in September 2021 that the report was being finalized, it was only released on August 31, 2022, in the final minutes of the commissioner's tenure. It is widely speculated that the final report was watered down under pressure from China.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7367075">In a rules-based system, the United Nations should be a place where light is shone on these issues, and I find myself wondering how the international community or Canadians can trust the United Nations when, just last year, Iran was elected to the United Nations top legislative body on women's rights. There are no words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367076">Canada does value the international rules-based order, but Canada also has a long history of standing for what is right, even when it is uncomfortable or difficult. On this issue, there is no grey area. I am certainly heartened by the cross-partisan agreement on this issue. In February of last year, as we have said in the House, we recognized China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide. Just yesterday, the House once again voted unanimously to recognize this genocide and call for more action to protect Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in third countries who find themselves exposed to the risk of deportation back to China.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7367077">The motion before us today, brought by my colleague and friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, which I proudly seconded this evening, builds on this action by calling for the admission into Canada of 10,000 Uighur and Turkic Muslims in need of protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367078">This is about standing for what is right. It is also about sending a clear message to China and all authoritarian regimes around the world that Canada will not be intimidated, that Canada will continue to stand for its values no matter the consequences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367079">As long as China continues to violate the human rights of its people, as long as it continues to threaten Taiwan, to repress Hong Kong, as long as it continues to intimidate and harass people not only in its country, but also here on Canadian soil, and as long as it continues to empower regimes like Russia and Iran, we here in this House must continue to call China out and work with our allies to respond effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367080">With the time that I have remaining, I would like to speak on a more personal level to the reasons why I feel so strongly about this motion and about speaking up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367081"> As a young Jewish teenager in Montreal in the 1990s, I had the privilege of meeting many Holocaust survivors. I remember those conversations vividly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367082">On one occasion, a woman addressed a group of us to recount her harrowing experience in concentration camps. There are pieces of her story that I hear to this day when I close my eyes at night, such as how she would keep little crusts of bread in the folds of her ragged clothes so that at night when there was a child crying she could give the child something. At the end of her presentation, I remember asking her very innocently what I could do, me, a 15-year-old girl who was deeply touched by her story. She looked at me and said, “It is up to you and your generation to make sure that this never happens again.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367083">On another occasion, I remember walking up on stage to meet a Holocaust survivor. He had just told his story. I do not have the strength to recount it here, but I remember feeling that I had to go up to him to get closer to him and touch his hand to see that he was made of the same flesh and bones as I was. I had to know that he was real. Again, the only thing I could think of at the time to say to this Holocaust survivor was to ask him what I could do. He looked at me with a piercing glance and said, “I need to know that you will speak up. I need to know before I die that my suffering was not in vain. I need to know that “never again” means something to you.” I looked at him and gave him, and many Holocaust survivors, my commitment that I would stand up and ensure that “never again” would mean something, and I do so today in this House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367085">There have been many times when I have risen in this House to speak, but I would have to say there have been few on an issue as important and as serious as this one, the issue of freedom for the Uighur people, or for any people, for that matter, but in this particular case, we are talking about the Uighurs and their right to live their lives as they so choose free of government oppression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367086">I often think that in this country we take freedom for granted and we tend to think that freedom is free. For someone like myself, who was born and raised in this country, I have a unique perspective in that I have not been on the front lines, so to speak, of a genocide, a holocaust or a war, but I think that we Canadians can learn from people from other parts of the world who have not been so privileged or so lucky and who have earned their freedom— </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7367090">Madam Speaker, I originally posed the question of whether any of the spend-DP-Liberals thought about monetary policy a few weeks ago because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had already admitted he does not spend much time thinking about it. He also thought that budgets balance themselves, inflation was transitory and it was okay to borrow $400 billion because interest rates were low. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367091">A few things have changed in those few weeks since I first posed the question. The Liberal-NDP coalition government has been driving up the cost of living. The more the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spends, the more things are costing, and it is not just inflation that we are dealing with now, it is people's lives because they are having to consider monetary policy and make a choice between buying groceries or heating their homes. They are having to make the choice between putting fuel in their vehicles to go to work, or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367092">Interest rates are rising faster than they have in decades. People and families are at risk of losing their homes because they cannot make increasing mortgage payments. It is to the point that over one-half of Canadians are cutting back on groceries to cope with rising prices because of the thing elite Liberals think is just inflation. This means there are situations like the one I heard about just this morning. It came from Lyle, who said that he was shopping yesterday and the elderly person in front of him had to put four apples back as she could not afford them. He said that the increase in carbon taxes are driving up the costs of everything from home heating to food, and that the current government is completely out of touch with Canadians. That is what Lyle said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367093"> All this need not be. If the government had been prudent and responsible and considered monetary policy, it would have done things like not wasted $54 million on a punitive ArriveCAN scam and scrapped the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank. Let us not forget the WE scandal, the millions to Loblaws for refrigerators and so much more wasteful spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367094">On top of that, had Liberals not squandered an extra $200 billion in spending not related to COVID, Canadians would not be feeling the pain they are now, but the government chooses not to pay attention to monetary policy, so now Canadians are receiving the bill for that massive $500-billion deficit. They are seeing typical mortgages go up by $7,000 a year and having to pay so much more attention to their household monetary policy just to put food on the table and keep the heat on. On top of all this, the Liberal-NDP coalition is planning to triple the carbon tax, further increasing and inflating the cost of gas, groceries and home heating, just as we approach winter in Canada, when heating is not a luxury but a necessity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367095">I am sure I am probably going to hear an excuse from the other side about where I am going on this, and we are going to hear back from the government saying that inflation is a global phenomenon. The governor of the Bank of Canada now says that inflation is homegrown. It was grown by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet's lack of consideration of economic policy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367096">Madam Speaker, I would be happy to discuss monetary policy with my friend from the interior at any time, but his speech actually focused more on fiscal policy, as did his original question. I want everyone who is listening to know that our government is working to build an economy that works for everyone and is focused on tackling affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367097">We have done this while lowering Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio, increasing wages, maintaining Canada's AAA credit rating and maintaining our debt servicing cost at 1% of GDP, almost six times lower than it was in the 1990s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367098">In the member's original question, which led to this late show, he cited $2.13 per litre for gas in his riding. Indeed, it has been as high as $2.40 in metro Vancouver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367099">This is an increase of more than a dollar per litre over the last three years. It is putting a tremendous burden on Canadian families. However, we also need to acknowledge that the price on pollution in British Columbia has increased by only two cents during the last three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367100">It was nine cents in 2019 and is 11¢ today. That means 98% of that increase has nothing to do with pricing pollution. It is the result of global inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367101">The Conservative Party of Canada readily ignores these facts and therefore ignores 98% of the problem. It also ignores the real cost of climate change. In B.C., we have seen fires devastate communities and spread smoke throughout our summers. We have floods and droughts that have already caused billions of dollars in damage, yet the Conservative Party of Canada continues to call on our government to stop fighting climate change and to mortgage our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367102">It does that when it asks us to stop fighting climate change. It does that when it asks us to stop funding seniors' pensions. It does that when it asks us to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. It does that by trying to eliminate the CBC and by trying to stop kids from getting the dental care and education they need. It does that by obstructing assistance for impoverished renters who need it the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367103">I do not know if there is such a thing as an economic ostrich, but if there was, it would be a tremendous mascot for the Conservative Party, as it continues to suggest irresponsible economic policies as if its members were committed to keeping their collective heads in the sand. In contrast, our government has put together a plan that makes life more affordable and builds an economy that works for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367104">In jurisdictions where the federal government has a price on pollution, and B.C., by the way, is not one of those jurisdictions, a rebate is provided through the climate action incentive, which actually makes life more affordable for eight out of 10 Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367105">We are also doubling the GST credit for six months, which will provide hundreds of dollars to 11 million families who need it the most and more than 50% of our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367106">I compliment the member opposite for supporting this measure. I think it is important that we continue to work together to make life more affordable, but we need to do it in a way that is open, honest and transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367107">Let us not use the worst economic shock since the Second World War to gain political points. Canada has a great opportunity in front of it. We have the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Our inflation rate is significantly lower than those of the U.S., Europe and the OECD. We produce a tremendous amount of food and energy, the two commodities that are facing extraordinary price pressures from around the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367108">Our best times are in front of us, but we can get there only if we continue to work together to make life better for all Canadians.</ParaText>

This is literally a piece of legislation that is going to enable children who could not afford to get their teeth fixed to get them fixed. We know good oral hygiene and good dental health lead to better overall health and better productivity. Those investments not only are fair and the right thing to do for those children, but will actually help us grow our economy in the future. This bill also proposes a one-time top-up to the Canada housing benefit program, to those renters—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367117">Madam Speaker, as always, it is an honour to rise in this place. A number of months ago, I had the opportunity to ask a question about access to information in Canada, and it is directly related to a study that is ongoing before the ethics committee. The simple and only way that one can accurately describe the Liberal record on access to information is one of failure, full stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367118">A comment was made the other day that bears repeating in this place: Everything under the current Liberal government is broken. I hear daily from constituents about the cost of living that is unmanageable. We have a host of new government programs that are being created almost weekly to fix a problem that the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and their flawed ideology created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367119">The reality is that Canadians are hurting. It seems everything is broken, whether that be passports, ethics and accountability, or any host of other things that we can point to, including Canada's reputation on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367120">It leads me to the inevitable conclusion that the Liberals are good at one thing and that is politics. When it comes to governing, to serving Canadians and to doing what is in the best interests of our country, they have shown time and again that they are terrible at governing. The consequence of that is no more clear than it is in the access to information system. Starting in the 2015 campaign, the now <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tweeted out that it was time for a government without a new scandal every day. It is unbelievable how many new scandals seem to be piling up on that Prime Minister's plate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367121">When it comes to the promises the Liberals made about sunshine being the best disinfectant, they have created a culture of secrecy. We heard, more times at the ethics committee today than I would be able to reference in the time permitted here, that there is this culture of secrecy, even when the Liberals claim to have fixed it. They are good at politics, but they have failed on delivering, because they brought in what they said were solutions to all the problems through Bill <Document DbId="9057528" Type="3">C-58</Document> in the 42nd Parliament. However, the experts agree that it simply made the situation worse. Again, the Liberals are great at politics, and we hear that each and every day through catchphrases, slogans and an incredible ability to turn the issues of the day into something that is not their fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367122"> For seven years it has been these Liberals stewarding this country. I suggest, on every metric I can think of, that our country is in a worse spot today than it was seven years ago. What is worse is that they often take credit for the good management that took place prior to that. It is the height of hypocrisy when we see the arrogance with which so many issues are approached and all the ways that our country and Canadians are hurting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367123">When it comes to the access to information system, the culture of secrecy has to stop because Canadians are losing faith in the institutions of government, which is at the very foundation of what a modern democracy needs to have.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7367124">Madam Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation> is referring to the information requested in the previous Parliament about the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367125">Our government respects the role that parliamentarians play in holding the government to account. However, our government must also respect the laws that Parliament has passed when it responds to orders for the production of papers, especially when the records include classified information. When disclosing information to Parliament, the government is guided by its statutory obligations to keep some information confidential under statutes like the Privacy Act, the Security of Information Act and the Canada Evidence Act. Our government always seeks to balance these interests so that parliamentarians are provided information to hold the government to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367126">The original request for documents from the National Microbiology Laboratory was first raised at the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations on March 31, 2021. At that time, PHAC played a lead role in the government's response to the pandemic. PHAC worked diligently to produce the requested records and submitted them to the special committee on April 20, 2021. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367127">The records were redacted because they included information that PHAC was bound by statute to keep confidential. This included national security information that would have been injurious to Canada's reputation if it was disclosed. However, the special committee was not satisfied and reported the matter to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367128">Despite the government's opposition, the House adopted a Conservative opposition day motion on June 2, 2021, to order the production of the unredacted documents within two days. Our government explored options to balance the right of parliamentarians to access information with its duty to protect classified information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367129">PHAC provided the redacted documents to the law clerk's office on the timeline set out by the order. At the same time, the Minister of Health referred the matter to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, or NSICOP. The unredacted documents were submitted to that committee. Our government believes that this committee is the appropriate mechanism to allow parliamentarians to review unredacted documents while protecting national security information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367130">The NSICOP has members from both the House and the Senate and a broad mandate to review national security and intelligence activities. Members hold top secret security clearance, swear an oath or solemn affirmation not to disclose confidential information and are permanently bound to secrecy under the Security of Information Act. With these safeguards, committee members are able to receive classified briefings and materials. However, opposition parties did not support this approach in the last Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367131">In the current Parliament, our government remains committed to working collaboratively with opposition parties. On December 2, 2021, the government House leader proposed the creation of an ad hoc committee to allow parliamentarians to scrutinize confidential national security documents. The government based its proposal on the approach the former government proposed, and the House agreed to, in 2010 to give access to information about Afghan detainees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367132">Members of the ad hoc committee are required to undergo security screening and agree to confidentiality undertakings. A panel of arbiters will mediate questions where the disclosure of confidential national security documents would jeopardize Canada's interests. The New Democratic Party has agreed to participate in the ad hoc committee to review the information that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation> is referring to. I urge the member and his party to reconsider their participation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367133">Madam Speaker, I do find interesting the culture of secrecy that has permeated every aspect of virtually everything the government does.

              <ParaText id="7367134">When it comes to the true facts of the matter, I would simply suggest that the member and other members of the government try to look at the trust that Canadians need to have in their institutions— </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7367137">The NSICOP and the ad hoc committee would allow the members to scrutinize confidential national security and intelligence information in a venue where the appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure the information is not publicly disclosed. Both options worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367138">A similar ad hoc committee was established by the previous government in 2010 to allow parliamentarians to access classified information about Afghan detainees. This is what Speaker Milliken was referring to when he urged members, in 2010, to find a compromise between complying with an order of the House and protecting classified information from public disclosure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7367139">The committee is another mechanism that responds to Speaker Milliken's appeal to the House. Since 2017, parliamentarians from both Houses have worked across party lines to examine and report on national security and intelligence activities. Members undergo the appropriate security measures to ensure that classified information is not disclosed.</ParaText>
