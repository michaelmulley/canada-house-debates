              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583780"> We are now debating that motion to amend, which arose because of some underlying circumstances. I thought I would deal with those first, and then I will return to procedural matters, the question of privilege itself and the merits of the question of privilege a bit later on in my remarks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583781">I will start by dealing with the underlying issue, which is, of course, that Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, was found to be egregiously in breach of its mandate on a level that makes even the sponsorship scandal under the Chrétien Liberals look like it was merely dealing with sort of piggy bank stuff. That millions of dollars have been reported by the Auditor General to have been allocated in a way that is a clear violation of basic conflict of interest rules as well as the internal rules for disbursements that SDTC had is really quite striking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583782">However, an element that was also raised by the Auditor General that has not been discussed, which I will spend the first part of my remarks talking about, is very important. In addition to the fact that members of the board of SDTC were arranging to transfer contracts to companies in which they had an interest as shareholders and, in some cases, primary officers, there is the fact that the results produced by these contracts were spectacularly unimpressive in terms of the stated goal, which is to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. The Auditor General could not look at all of the projects and instead took a representative sample of 18 completed projects. In her report, she stated, “We found that in 12 out of 18 completed projects in our sample, the projected reduction of greenhouse gas emissions were, on average, half of what was presented at the time the project proposals were assessed.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583783">This raises the very important point that it may very well be the case that one of the reasons for this really extraordinarily poor level of delivery of performance is the way in which these contracts were allocated, who they were allocated to and the criteria that was looked at, which may have been enforced in a very lax manner, because the real purpose of giving out these contracts may well have been to provide income to those who were in fact involved in bidding for those contracts. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8583784"> Of course, this is a profound conflict of interest. However, one of the things that we see over and over again when we are dealing with conflicts of interest in general is the phenomenon that it is not just that money gets transferred to people to whom it should not be transferred; it is that the end results of which the money has been spent are spectacularly bad. This, in fact, is the whole reason for avoiding conflicts of interest. If people simply handing money to themselves produced spectacular results, we would have no reason to object. However, that never happens. It did not happen in sponsorship and, it appears, from what the Auditor General was able to discover, that it did not happen here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583785">Was the sample of 18 completed contracts a representative sample? We cannot be 100% certain. That is, of course, one of the things that will be determined when that impressive list of witnesses comes before the procedure and House affairs committee. We will, for example, be able to ask the Auditor General whether she believes that sample was genuinely representative. Were those projects unusually good or unusually bad as compared to the rest? I suspect the sample was representative, but she could confirm that. That is pretty important information to have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583786"> I do want to point out that the government itself clearly thought that this was an issue, although it will not actually admit that because, on June 4, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> announced that the SDTC program would be shut down. Now, the government did make an attempt to say that, nonetheless, it had impressive results. A spokesperson, Janemary Bennigan, stated, as follows:</ParaText>

                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583790"> That, of course, is obviously, on the ground, not true. The program would not have been cancelled if the government thought that. At any rate, that is what they said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583791">I have to stop and point out just how meaningless this whole exercise will have been, even if these had been successful. Canada's greenhouse gas emissions are not primarily caused by air traffic; by road traffic; by people using old-fashioned, non-electric, gas-burning vehicles; by heating their houses with oil, or, as is the case with many people in my constituency, in rural Ontario, with wood. Those emissions would be small compared to the amount of wood that has been destroyed by fires in this country, fires that, while to some degree were caused by the sources that the government always points to when responding to questions about the fires, were also largely caused and greatly exacerbated, in terms of the amount of carbon put in the atmosphere, by bad forestry practices and bad forest fire management. Those were the responsibility of governments, to some degree provincial governments and to some degree the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583792"> In 2023, fires raged across this country and turned skies orange in places as far away as New York City and the state of Maryland. These fires consumed 184,961 square kilometres. I am not quite sure how the estimate I have here was that precise, but 184,900 square kilometres is a round estimate. That is 18.5 million hectares. It is 5% of Canada's entire forest cover. To give some perspective, Canada is the country that has retained the largest percentage of its forest cover in the entire world. Less than half is being logged, but 5% was vaporized in a single year. That put three billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, obviously many times the amount that this program through SDTC would have mitigated by many multiples. In fact, three billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is equivalent to four times global emissions from all aviation worldwide. Our greenhouse gas emissions from all other sources, all the stuff we are trying to vaporize the economy to stop, reduce or mitigate—</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8583793">That is excellent mitigation right there with the lights going off in the House of Commons. Right there, we could probably reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Well done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583794">Our greenhouse gas emissions from other sources were 708 megatonnes. Just to be clear, that is 708 million tonnes versus three billion tonnes. We became the world's third largest greenhouse gas emitter in that year and put out more than the whole nation would do in this entire decade as a result of those fires. That is 10% of overall world emissions, which were 39 gigatonnes in 2023. This is data, by the way, from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, EDGAR, a well-respected source that even the Liberals cannot accuse of being somehow a front for the groups that they like to accuse of being climate denialists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583795">I am not saying that the government is responsible for all of this. I am just saying it is responsible for some of it. There is no doubt that the mountain pine beetle destroying forests and turning them into tinder was a significant, highly burnable potential. Tinder was a colossal feature of this and the fact that climate change caused temperatures to rise sufficiently to enable the mountain pine beetle to cross mountain passes that were previously seen as being an impenetrable barrier is unquestionably at the root of a substantial number of the forest fires, at least in the western part of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583796">However, bad forestry practices were also a source of this, allowing forest tinder to burn up and not building firebreaks. Not anticipating led to colossal fire. It is not as if this is the first time, as if we could not have learned from the examples of previous fires. I note that the extraordinarily well-publicized fires in Yellowstone in 1988, which is a lifetime ago, burned 3,200 square kilometres. The reports that came out afterward indicated that the wrong kind of forestry practice of excessive fire suppression, which led to a buildup of tinder, then meant that when a fire occurred, it would be far greater in extent and scope and far more damaging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583797">Those lessons have been well recorded for decades and were not taken note of. They were not taken note of, for example, in the lead-up to the devastating Jasper fire earlier this year. As we know, the fact that these conditions were in danger of being replicated were noted as early as 2017. Obviously, that gives seven years of lead time in which the government could have done something. That fire put much less carbon into the atmosphere than the ones a couple of years back. The fact is that bad forestry management, this time in a national park, which is exclusively federal jurisdiction and means the Liberals cannot blame the premiers, resulted in a disaster. This is after those fires, so the government literally learned nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583798">We became the world's number three greenhouse gas emitter. We put more carbon into the atmosphere than global airplane emissions for four years, 10% of all emissions, and we learned nothing because the government is fixated on one particular solution, which, in fact, will only nibble at the edges of the problem while ignoring this colossal other issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583799">I experienced this kind of danger myself a few years back. I used to live in Australia. The Australian Capital Territory, which is mostly beautiful, forested alpine wilderness, was struck by fires that raged January 18 through 22, 2003. They destroyed nearly 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's pastures, pine plantations and nature parks.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8583800">I was not there when it happened, but I was in one of those nature parks. When I lived in Australia, I was dating a girl who lived in Canberra, the capital of Australia, and we would go out. Our recreation was to go on nature walks in the forest preserves around Canberra, which were very beautiful at the time. They call it “bush-walking” in Australia. Fortunately, because of the fire-resistant nature of Australian forests, much of the native foliage has largely recovered from those fires. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583801">At any rate, I remember going to the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in the hills around Canberra in January 1999, four years before these devastating fires, and arriving at the front entrance to that park. There had been a dry spell. There is an entrance with a gravel road that people have to go through. The park ranger at the entrance had parked her car to block that road, facing the wrong direction, facing out from the park. She said that the park was closed because there was a fire hazard. The reason for the fire hazard was that it was forest fire season. Forest fires are quite common in Australia. On a previous occasion, I had not been able to get to my home because my whole neighbourhood was affected by a fire and shut down. I had to spend the night in a McDonald's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583802">At any rate, on this particular occasion, the park ranger said that there had been no fires there since 1939 and that the total fire suppression approach had led to, at that point, 60 years of detritus, of debris, building up. This meant that, if there was a fire, it would be extraordinarily severe and fast-moving. She said that, in the event that there was a fire, she would have to run to her car and hope she could drive out faster than the fire was moving; that was why her car was parked facing away from the park. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583803">A few years later, there was another set of fires on the outskirts of Melbourne. They were even more devastating, and people were burned alive in their cars as they tried to escape the fires. The park ranger was quite right to be thinking this way. My point is that this is widespread knowledge. It is widely known, and if the right things are done, the damage can be controlled by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583804">The Liberal government did nothing to control any of this. The result is that it is partly responsible for these massive carbon emissions, and this far outweighs the amount it was ever hoping to reduce in carbon emissions through this program. As we discovered, these programs were, on average, producing half the benefit that was recorded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583805">In addition, there was a series of abuses of process that arose because this is such a badly designed program. I now come to the reason we are dealing with all of this. Those abuses resulted in a motion that was produced in committee and then sent to the House and concurred in. This was a motion to produce a full reporting of a series of documents for the intention of taking them to our legal counsel, who would then pass them on to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583806">The government withheld some documents entirely and redacted others severely. When confronted about this, it then came back and lectured us. One has to read the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation>'s report to believe it. The government lectured us that the fundamental parliamentary privilege of summoning all and any documents should not be allowed to happen when it might be used in some way that interferes, in the government's opinion, with some worthwhile objective. Effectively, our privilege in this matter has been extraordinarily narrow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583807">I will just add that the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> came and made this claim to us not during the debate, but afterwards. This is an outrage in itself. The reasons for this will not seem obvious to someone who is not deeply imbued in parliamentary procedure, but it is an extraordinary thing to say. She was rightly chastised by the Speaker when he made his ruling, in which he said that there was a prima facie case and that we should have this debate. I thank him for that, and I thank all the members who have been participating in this debate. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8583811"> Madam Speaker, I think that two issues are being conflated here. The separation of the executive, judiciary and legislative functions is less formalized here than it is under the United States Constitution. People often regard these as being much more systematic silos here than they actually are. What I think is really going on here, to the extent that it is legitimate, is an issue of what we would call the <I>sub judice</I> convention. This is the idea that when a matter is before the courts, it ought not to be discussed here. That is a convention. It is not a hard and fast rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583812">None of this stuff is actually before the courts now or before the courts yet. The RCMP might choose to lay charges at some point. The thing about this right now is that the motion calls for these documents to be submitted to the House of Commons, not for the purpose of making them public but for the purpose of having them go directly to the law clerk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583813">Once they were in the hands of the law clerk, there would be about 30 days for the law clerk to go through them and determine what should be released to the RCMP. I believe that is what the motion states. The RCMP would be in a position to co-operate with the law clerk to confirm that, yes, this should be excluded or, no, that should not. This would be based upon the investigatory parameters that they are going to face and the restrictions that might be placed on wrongly obtained evidence being used in a trial. That can only happen if the materials are submitted. Withholding them is depriving the law clerk and the RCMP of their ability to do their job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8583814">Madam Speaker, I would like to take my colleague back to 2005. Sheila Fraser, who was the auditor general at the time, published a scathing report on foundations. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Liberal government created some fifteen foundations. As early as 2005, the former auditor general found that $9 billion had been transferred to these 15 foundations between 1998 and 2002. That is equivalent to about $17 billion today. She also found that the government had very little control over these foundations.</ParaText>

He has identified something without putting a label on it, so I want to ask him about the label.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583820">I am not quibbling with the member, because there was a massive amount of greenhouse gases emitted from the fires that occurred in Canada in 2023. The figure I found from NASA was 640 million metric tons. He is right, it outstrips the emission of an industrialized country for a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583821">He is quite right that the mountain pine beetle epidemic was brought about by warming winters, which meant that we no longer got the cold snap that stopped the pine beetle. British Columbia lost an area of forest two times the size of Sweden. Ironically, in British Columbia, that led Gordon Campbell, who was pretty much known as a right-wing premier, to develop North America's first carbon price and put a tax on carbon in B.C. at that time. He was trying to get ahead, bend the curve and reduce greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583822">The name for the thing he is talking about is a “positive feedback loop”. As the climate warms, certain natural processes accelerate. We get drier, hotter conditions that lead to a fuel load in the forest. The insect outbreaks that would normally be knocked back are not. The melting permafrost is the big kicker of a positive feedback loop, with a vast risk of mass amounts of methane reaching the atmosphere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583823">Does my hon. colleague believe that we should have a proper discussion in this place about the science of the real risks we face in the climate crisis?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8583824">Madam Speaker, there are several different things to unpack in that question. I know the next speaker is going to be this very same member; she knows a great deal about this topic. I hope that, if she does not mind veering away from the prepared text she had, she will share her thoughts on the subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583825">With regard to the issue of methane gas, in general, I heartily agree with her that trapped methane gas is very much a real issue. There is a formula that gets tossed around: Methane gas is 21 times as problematic as carbon dioxide. I am never quite sure exactly what that means, but clearly, molecule per molecule, it is a very serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583826">If we look at human-caused climate change, the cause from humans emitting methane is much more serious than one would think from listening to the popular discourse. There is a very interesting argument to be made. There is a book called <I>Plows, Plagues, and Petroleum</I>. I do not know whether the member has read it, but if she has not, I know she would find it fascinating. The author argues that humans have been causing greenhouse gases to release for far longer than we think, and it started with human rice cultivation, which caused an enormous amount of methane through the creation of artificial swamps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583827">This is a good area to study for sure. I am out of time to talk about the positive feedback loop, but maybe the next question will deal with that.</ParaText>

My brother is a pilot; in fact, he flew over Parliament Hill as the lead aircraft in the July 1 Canada Day celebrations in a 1928 De Havilland DH.60. I have no other way of getting that on the record, so there we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583832">There was a finding of contempt. It was brought forward via the procedure and House affairs committee. It never actually made it to the House. I know this because I was still debating it in that committee. I had the floor when the bells started ringing for us to come out for a vote of confidence in the government. In 2011, the intention was to introduce a motion that would bring down the Harper government on a finding of contempt from that committee. As members can guess, I was dissenting in that report, so I did not agree with it. The actual motion that came before the House was simply to find no confidence in the government, with no explanation. It was very similar to the first of the non-confidence motions that the current government faced about a week ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8583834">Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278243" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston</Affiliation> for having established some discussion on the real issue of climate change as we approach the motion on the question of privilege in front of us and the levels of breakdown of normal processes that occurred within Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which has now absorbed us for several days of debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583835"> I will cut to the chase and say this: With respect to the views of the Green Party, when Parliament requires documents to be submitted, they should be submitted in full so we can work on them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583836">I also recall the incident that my colleague was just referencing, which had to do with the documentation of Afghan detainees. My hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278418" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> knows much about this as well. We did, at the time, realize that evidence was coming to light that Canada was complicit in sort of grabbing anyone off the street who might be considered suspect, including street vendors and other people who were not combatants, and turning them over to U.S. forces, where they faced torture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583837">That was the issue we were last seized with in the House with a demand for documents that was thwarted. As my hon. colleague recalls so correctly, it led to an election and to not talking about the issue ever again. One of the first things I did when elected as a member of Parliament was to try to pursue it with questions on the Order Paper to try to find out, if we could, what had occurred and how it was that Canada was caught up in doing something that, certainly on the surface, violated international law and subjected totally innocent people to torture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583838"> However, we are where we are now, discussing Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It is really important that we define and try to avoid the obvious partisan appeal of screaming “scandal” and “corruption” in ways that will alarm Canadians by suggesting that this is just a cesspool of corruption here in Ottawa. I do not think it is, but there are some strands that require full inquiry and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583839">I am glad we are having the discussion here today. A lot has already been said in previous speeches. I am going to start with saying something about the context of a setting that I hope is helpful to Canadians, which is that there are a lot of different kinds of corruption. We throw the word around. I want to clarify that, in this particular narrative, I see three different kinds, and some are more alarming than others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583840">The first, and of course this is the issue that Canadians think of right away, is when a bunch of politicians are pointing fingers and saying that certain individuals are corrupt. The first and completely unacceptable level of misuse of public funds is when public funds are taken to enrich oneself. This is the kind of issue that we faced here when we called to the bar the head of GC Strategies, Kristian Firth, who had made millions on the ArriveCAN app. We know that story, and we have not concluded it. We have not had an RCMP investigation. We did not get the money back. Taking public funds to enrich oneself is an egregious wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583841">The second form of corruption that comes into the story of the process of government's allocating public funds is a failure to exercise proper oversight. In other words, the people involved are not enriching themselves nor their friends, but the system somehow breaks down through some kind of overload, allowing our public service to descend to a level that falls below mediocrity and become incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583842"> The third level of corruption at play here is when public funds are shovelled into projects where the goal is political. That does surface in the instance we are debating, and I want to go into it somewhat. This may cause discomfort for some of my friends on the other side, because a lot of public money is being shovelled into technology that simply does not work, because it helps the narrative that we can keep producing fossil fuels and meet greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, doing both at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583843">In other words, the strategies on the climate crisis could be described as someone having their cake and eating it too, the kind of diet to lose weight that says that, by the way, we can keep eating chocolate cake because we have a magic pill to take later. In the same category are some of the things that were referenced by the previous speaker about projects with environmental benefits that were exaggerated and not proven.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8583844">This particular category of energy projects is called carbon capture, utilization and storage. It is heavily favoured by the oil sands companies, particularly by the Pathways Alliance corporations operating the oil sands. It is the category that first triggered interest by any of the auditors, so let me start with that one because chronologically it comes first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583845"> The first time an Auditor General report said that we had better ask Sustainable Development Technology Canada to improve its performance was in 2017. A branch of the Department of the Auditor General is the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, which I wish had been created as a separate office, like the parliamentary budget office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583846">I remember appearing before the environment committee when the chair was the late Hon. Charles Caccia, who at one point had been environment minister under former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Charles Caccia's committee looked at how to set up a commissioner for the environment. It was one of the red book promises of the Liberals in 1993. It decided it could put it in the Office of the Auditor General. That is why we have the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development as a branch of the Auditor General's office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583847"> The report of the commissioner in the fall of 2017 looked in detail at a number of energy projects, those that dealt with trying to reduce greenhouse gases through new clean-energy technology projects. It found there were several sources of funds that went to them, which were reviewed by the report of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development: the clean-energy fund run by Natural Resources Canada; the ecoENERGY technology initiative, also run by Natural Resources Canada; and the sustainable development tech fund administered by Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583848">In 2017, just to note the date, the commissioner said that overall they were very pleased to find that the funds were being well administered, that they were audited and that close attention was being paid to conflict of interest. Nonetheless, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development said that Sustainable Development Technology Canada should take steps to ensure that we know that the projects are achieving their goals. We needed to follow up. The recommendations were clear that it should, in the words of the Auditor General, “improve its challenge function over projected sustainable development and environmental benefits.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583849"> This lays the groundwork for the commentary we find in the Auditor General's report that was recently quoted by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278243" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston</Affiliation>, the part of the Auditor General's report that states, “We found that in 12 out of 18 completed projects in our sample, the projected reduction of greenhouse gas emissions were, on average, half of what was presented at the time the project proposals were assessed.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583850">My hon. colleague asked what could be the reason SDTC was shovelling money out the door for projects that did not work; it must have been to get money into the hands of the people they wanted to have the money. I would posit a much more likely explanation, which is that the government has put forward a plan to achieve greenhouse gas reductions that depends on achieving magical results from unproven technologies. Therefore, we have seen a big increase in the amount of money that goes to carbon capture, utilization and storage, despite the fact that all around the world it has been shown not to work, and the projects within Canada have not achieved the demonstrated promised results. That is clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583851"> By the way, carbon capture, utilization and storage, for anyone who does not know, says basically that as we produce more fossil fuels or as we burn coal to create electricity, we will find a way to get the carbon that would otherwise be going into the atmosphere, capture it and drive it deep underground. Therefore we will avoid the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases by sweeping them under the carpet and hoping they stay there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583852">They tend not to stay there. It is a very expensive way to reduce greenhouse gases even if it works, and it tends not to work. The one thing we can absolutely prove about carbon capture, utilization and storage is what it captures. It captures public money. It captures politicians. It does not capture carbon much. It does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583853">However, when we look at the Auditor General's reports, and particularly the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development's report, we find that even though the results were not showing that it worked, by budget 2017, hundreds of millions of dollars more were dedicated to it. They were writing a report that stated their plan to reduce greenhouse gases, that this much of their target is going to be achieved by something that they just love and Pathways Alliance just loves, and that it is all wonderful. However, it is not even in the footnotes; it is not proven, and it does not work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583854">Therefore I put to my friends here that part of the incentive for shovelling money out the door for projects that did not work was that there is an ideological article of faith in the Department of Natural Resources Canada and in the industry that the “have our cake and eat it too” strategy is going to work and help us meet our targets. That is not classic corruption, and my Conservative friends should look at it, because I know, to the extent that we have any idea what the Conservative Party would want to do about climate change, the Conservatives have said it would be technology. I suspect they would not have a problem with shovelling more money to the oil sands companies in what is essentially a disguised subsidy.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8583855">Obviously, that is another way to subsidize the fossil fuel industry. The government created a public fund to pay for technology that does not work. That technology is and always will be a failure.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8583856"> This is always going to fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583857">Let us now look at the other aspects of the SDTC issue and what we learned from it. One aspect clearly is that it was a fund created under the Chrétien government that was working very well for a very long time. It was supposed to look at technologies that were unproven and emerging. The government was not supposed to step up and say, “We love this one. It may never work, but it is really good in press releases, so we are just going to keep throwing money at it.” It is the case that in the fall 2017, the report of the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development said that the operation did not have a problem with conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583858">We certainly know from the 2024 report of the Auditor General that there was a lot of difficulty with conflict of interest. The way the board was being run was rife with conflict of interest, and that is a terrible shame because this was an operation, as I have said previously in this place, that, over decades, had worked in assisting companies with emerging technologies, which tend to have trouble getting seed funding through commercial banks and so on. It is very hard to get investment capital for something that is innovative, unproven and not an article of faith of the government of the day, which we would have to shovel money at, whether it works or not. In other words, Sustainable Development Technology Canada had done much good work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583859"> The chair of the board changed after the 2017 report that found no conflict of interest problems, and I always feel awkward about using the name of a private citizen in this place, but she had to resign as chair of the SDTC board. Annette Verschuren had private interests in and continued involvement with companies that received SDTC funding. This violated the conflict of interest guidelines of the organization. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583860">This also violated basic conflict of interest guidelines. I do not know about the rest of my colleagues here in this place, but when I was first elected and read the ethics code, I thought to myself, “Does this really need to be written down? Do people not know this?” The conflict of interest guidelines said that no member of Parliament should hire a family member in their office as that would be a conflict of interest. I remember thinking, “Who do they think we are? They do not have to write this stuff down.” Apparently they do though, and one cannot be chair of a board and forget that they cannot distribute money to themselves when they are on that board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583861">Now, whether this rose to the level of criminality is something else to be explained and examined. The steps the government has taken so far mean that this is no longer going on. The SDTC operation has been folded into the National Research Council. The board members have completely changed. The new board operates to make sure these funds continue to flow to legitimate projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583862"> It is very important that operations are not tarnished by what is a completely unacceptable episode. To call it “sloppy” would be a compliment. How on earth do people sit around a boardroom table and say that, because of COVID and because everybody is getting this benefit, it cannot really be seen that I gave myself a special benefit? This is the kind of argument we heard in the committee. We also heard the people involved say that they talked to a lawyer, and they said it was okay. I practise law, and I ask what kind of lawyer gives that advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583863">There is a code of conflict of interest that must be followed. Every member around that boardroom table had a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that happened. There was a large system failure, but let me say very clearly that this is not at the level that it would be so easy to say this was a bunch of Liberals doing favours to other Liberals. We do not have evidence of that. I certainly would like to know the political affiliations of the various people who got the money, but we know a lot of the money went to the oil sands, so I do not think this is your classic hand-in-the-cookie-jar kind of scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583864">This is a large system failure that concerns me greatly. I worked in the Government of Canada many decades ago when I was non-partisan. I was not a member of the party at the time, and I am very proud of my record of working in the office of the minister of environment from 1986 to 1988 when there was a majority Progressive Conservative government under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583865">The Government of Canada in those days was a gold standard. I do not mean just in a political sense, and I especially mean in a non-political sense. I mean the civil service, the people who rose to the level of deputy ministers. It was really gold standard stuff. There were deputy ministers, such as Arthur Kroeger, Harry Swain, and Gordon Ritchie, who were people of great intellect who were completely non-partisan. They provided to the government of the day advice that was evidence-based and solid. Those kinds of civil servants, and unfortunately some of them have passed away, so I guess they are rolling in their graves, are wondering what the heck happened.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8583866"> Where did this mediocrity creep in? Whatever government is the government of the day, and I think, in fairness to some of my colleagues who are currently on the front benches of the Liberal Party, the level of competence at the civil service had already been significantly eroded, and then we were hit with COVID. Fixing this is going to be a bigger problem than pointing fingers across the aisle. Fixing this will require that we no longer have captive regulators that do what the industry they review as their client wants.

Science says that is fraud, but it was the kind of target that the oil sands industry was not going to mind because they can pretend they are going to meet anything set for 2050 through magic later on. We need to be honest and transparent. We need to face facts, and in this kind of debate, I commend all of my colleagues for digging into the facts to make sure that conflict of interest guidelines are never blurred again and to make sure that, when public funds go to reducing greenhouse gases, we get value for money by actually reducing greenhouse gases.</ParaText>

To the member, talking about accountability and public service is really important, but one of the tools we need is to update our Crown copyright laws.

The Liberals had some interest in this with the former member for <Affiliation DbId="214005" Type="2">LaSalle–Émard–Verdun</Affiliation>, who they then removed as a justice minister and has now left this place, who had an interest in updating Crown copyright because the United States, U.K. and Australia, basically anybody left on the planet, has Crown copyright in a democracy such as Canada.</ParaText>

A study commissioned by Bloomberg and conducted by Nanos Research shows consumer confidence is the best it has been in about two years. Second, inflation has come down to 2% and has been in the target range the Bank of Canada wants for the last eight months. Third, the interest rate is now 4.25%, and I expect it to go down by a further 50 basis points this month. I expect it to come down to 3.75% by December and further down to 3% by July of next year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8583893">The other point I would like to make is on the cost of living. It is still a matter of concern to most Canadians, but it has been falling in terms of percentage. It has already fallen by 7%. </ParaText>

The petitioners are calling for the Government of Canada to immediately protect all critical old-growth habitat for marbled murrelets. That habitat could be protected federally through the Canadian government's commitment to the Migratory Birds Convention Act.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8584150"> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate for quite some time and am learning some interesting things, but some of the confusion I have has still not been clarified. I keep hearing that Parliament is supreme. I agree that Parliament is supreme in many ways, but does it have absolute power when we say it is supreme? I am not very sure we have that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584151">The Canadian system of government, as we all know, has three branches. There is the legislative branch, which passes laws; the executive, which implements those laws; and the judicial branch, which interprets them. Both the RCMP and the Auditor General have expressed their concern that the separation of powers is getting blurred in this instance. Parliament has many powers, but we are subject to the Constitution. With my limited knowledge, I can say that we have a process to amend the Constitution, but as long as there is a Constitution, we have to follow it. Whatever we do has to be done within the confines of what is laid out in the Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584152">Whenever the word “supreme” is used in the democratic context, it reminds me of the word being used to describe, say, the Iranian Supreme Leader, who has trampled on the basic fundamental rights of millions and millions of Iranian people. The current government, the current system, describes him as the Supreme Leader, basically giving him the absolute power to do anything he wants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584153">There are other countries in the world where the word “supreme” is used in the constitution, such as North Korea. The North Korean constitution explicitly names its chief as the supreme leader, who represents the state. Whenever the word “supreme” is used, I am slightly uncomfortable because, in my view, it denotes absolute power, and we know that absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is something I am concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584154">The Westminster system of democracy we follow is being followed in other parts of the world. Some follow exactly the model in the United Kingdom. Some others have small variations, but fundamentally they are all the same. In some countries, there is no clear division of power, although it may be in the constitution. In one of the biggest democracies in the world, where legislators interfere directly in the workings of the executive, the day-to-day administration that is the sole responsibility of the executive, there is constant and direct interference. We are not that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584155">We are a different society. We follow the Constitution. Some people ask me how Canada can be rich and successful when there are other countries that have more richness in natural resources than Canada. I explain to them that Canada is rich, successful and one of the best countries to live in in the world because of the way society has organized itself. Society has promoted the democratic concept, and elected officials at all levels of governments are answerable to the people who elect them. That keeps a good check on the powers of elected officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584156">In Canada, we have always followed the rule of the law. There are many countries that may be richer in natural resources than us but are not as successful because the way Canadian society has organized itself is not practised in those countries. Again, whenever people say Parliament is supreme, this is the concern have. I think we should understand what is allowed by law and the Constitution and what the convention is. Convention is as important as the rule of law, just as the spirit of the law is as important as the letter of the law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584157"> On SDTC, I am disappointed about what happened. Three objectives brought me into politics, and the third objective was to ensure that Canada continued to remain at the forefront of knowledge-based economies. The world is moving toward a knowledge-based economy, so I wanted to ensure that Canada was at the forefront of the new technologies and innovations that are heralding countries into the global digital economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584158">Before joining politics, I was on the board of Invest Ottawa, a great organization that was set up to promote Ottawa and lead Ottawa into the new world by promoting the technology sector. Ottawa is a government town. We all know that. A maximum number of federal employees live in this beautiful city. However, the City of Ottawa, when the then mayor Jim Watson was elected, formed Invest Ottawa so that we could focus on using the knowledge power we have to promote the technology sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584159">I was working in the private defence technology sector when I was asked to join the board. We are so proud that Ottawa is moving in the direction that was envisaged when Invest Ottawa was formed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584160">SDTC was a good addition to the various institutions that promote not only new technologies but sustainable technologies, all those things that help Canada get to its rightful place at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy. I was happy to see that SDTC was funding new and sustainable technologies. However, I was very disappointed when reports started coming out about the conflicts of interest being floated. The number of instances was very painful for me to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584161"> Now that SDTC comes under the Natural Research Council of Canada, NRC, it is a matter of concern to me. I mean no disrespect to the bureaucrats and officials working at NRC. They have been successfully managing certain industrial assistance programs, like IRAP, the industrial research assistance program, but it is still a government department. It does not have the flexibility that an arm's-length body like SDTC has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584162"> We have great Crown corporations, from Export Development Canada to other major Crown corporations. SDTC, on its own as a Crown corporation, had the flexibility of conducting its operations. Many things related to new technology are not available in paper well in advance for people to gain knowledge, understand them and take moves to promote them. That needs people in the field to help guide funding for new technologies and new companies. SDTC was a good way of promoting this, but now it has gone to the Natural Research Council of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584163"> I have a bit of a concern with the bureaucratic rules. There is certainly not a problem with bureaucracy by its definition, but sometimes the rules involved in bureaucratic systems tend to tighten the flexibility required to promote new technologies. That is an unfortunate development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584164"> Now I am waiting and seeing. The funding streams have been restored; I believe they are working now. I am looking forward to seeing how companies are getting funding through the NRC house they are in. That is a matter of concern.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584165"> Speaking again of SDTC and new technologies, I am very interested in the mines-to-mobility sector. At this moment, the world is moving toward a clean economy. It is a trillion-dollar opportunity, but more than that, it is a necessity. It is necessary for us to be part of the clean economy, but this necessity also offers an economic opportunity. Mines to mobility is a small part of the larger movement toward that. This strategy is expected to position the government at the forefront of the new electric vehicle sector and everything connected to batteries, including energy storage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584166"> The potential of energy storage is huge. It makes wind and solar power much more viable propositions. Today, wind and solar power are economically viable on their own, but the efficiency that would allow us to achieve energy storage through batteries makes them much more viable and would transform the movement toward a clean economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584167">I am from Ontario, and I am glad to say that Ontario is one province that has moved away from power generation using coal. I wish the rest of Canada would move toward that. Recently, I heard a report that one of the G7 or OECD countries had become the first country to move entirely to power generation without using coal. I think we should move toward that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584168">Coming back to SDTC and mines to mobility, there are certain things organizations like SDTC can do, including identifying new technologies. However, these new technologies have to be implemented. When the Liberal government was formed in 2015, it renamed the industry ministry as Innovation, Science and Economic Development. I told the then minister to please not use the word “innovation” in any sentence unless the word “commercialization” is also in the same sentence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584169">There are still problems with mines to mobility. There are regulatory barriers regarding the time required for the development of new mines; for the exploration of new mines, it is still too long. I know the federal government is working with the provinces. It has formed, for example, what is called the Ontario table with the Province of Ontario so we can align our resources; stop the sequential approval process, as opposed to what we can do concurrently; and reduce the time required to develop new mines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584170">While that is a problem, in mines to mobility we also have a problem related to the processing of minerals. Today, China controls 70% to 90% of the processing of the critical minerals most essential to the electrical vehicle industry and energy storage industries using batteries. We do not have enough projects in the pipeline to be comfortable that we will take our rightful position in the entire mines-to-mobility spectrum. That is pending. Hopefully, we should be able to address this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584171">Our system of federation means certain powers are not with the federal government but with the provincial government. Under the mines-to-mobility strategy, one key component is transmission and distribution. The electric grid is under provincial jurisdiction, and I do not see a lot of things happening there. I hope the federal government will take a step forward, working with the provinces, to make sure that with the huge usage of electricity that is expected to come, we have enough power generation and a grid for the transmission and distribution of it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584172">On the power generation front, I have no issues. I think we can crank up power generation by using the natural gas we have. However, the electricity grid for transmission and distribution is something we need to look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584173">Again, SDTC was a small part of our bigger objective to move toward this clean economy, these trillion-dollar opportunities. I think we have to refocus on bringing back its original objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584174">On this particular motion, there are some concerns. Both the RCMP and the Auditor General have expressed deep concerns that we are blurring the separation of powers described in our Constitution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584175">I was first elected in 2015, and for the first four years, I was a member of the public accounts committee. I did not know the importance of that committee until I joined; then I realized it is the most important oversight committee the House of Commons has. That is where I interacted, for four years, with the then Auditor General, and I learned quite a bit about the role of the Office of the Auditor General and how important it is in the functioning of our country's system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584176">Whenever the Auditor General expresses any concern about any of the things we do, I take it with the utmost respect and seriousness. That is where I have a problem with this motion. The RCMP and the Auditor General are concerned about the blurring of this division of responsibility and separation of powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584177">In July, the RCMP wrote to the law clerk of the House of Commons. It had difficulty accepting and using the documents, or the records, that have been contemplated through this motion in its investigation because that would trample on the charter rights of the suspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584178">My problem is that if the RCMP is unable to use the records and the files we intend to pass on to it, then are we not defeating the very purpose we want to achieve? What we are doing here, in my view, is counterproductive to the ultimate objective of all members of the House. Our objective is that any suspected corruption should be thoroughly investigated and the criminals brought to justice. However, the process we are adopting here may act as a barrier to achieving that. That is the major problem and the major concern I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584179">I have listened to many of the members here and asked questions several times. The RCMP is an independent body, and it knows what to do and how to do it. We do not have to tell it how to do it. If the RCMP wants any record or any file, it knows the process. There is a legal process it can go through and obtain whatever it wants to complete its investigation, but we should not hinder its ability or capacity to do its work.</ParaText>

My only question is this: What is the process? The process, in my view, is that the RCMP is aware of it and, according to another member today, the RCMP has started its investigation. Let us go through that process. Let us not do something that actually hinders the process of investigation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584202"> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join in on today's debate on the question of privilege and the violation of parliamentary privilege by the Liberal government in its refusal to produce documents as they relate to the SDTC scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584203">I will do a quick recap for whose who are just tuning in. We know that the government took Sustainable Development Technology Canada and turned it into a green slush fund for Liberal insiders and friends. The Auditor General did a complete investigation on the governance of SDTC because a whistle-blower had come forward, and she found over 390 million dollars' worth of contracts had been given inappropriately by the board of directors, the members of which all had multiple conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584204">SDTC was a Crown corporation. It was fully funded by the taxpayers of Canada, and every person who served on that board of directors, including its CEO, was appointed by the government. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> individually appointed, through orders in council, all of those directors. It should be noted, as a former chair of the environment committee who worked closely with SDTC, that the organization had worked perfectly until 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584205">The former minister of industry, Navdeep Bains, is no longer a member of the House. He was hired by Rogers and is making a pile of money there. In 2017, he fired the existing chair and board at SDTC and loaded it up with Liberal friends and insiders, many of whom had already received grants through Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584206">When the Auditor General started doing her research, she found that there was $58 million involved. We are not talking about pennies here. This makes ad scam look like nickel-and-dime stuff. This was $58 million that was rewarded on 10 ineligible projects. She found another $334 million, in 186 cases, of money that was given to projects in which the nine board members had a conflict of interest and never recused themselves from the decision-making process. For almost 59 million dollars' worth of projects, there was no contribution agreement or terms that were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584207">The Auditor General made it clear that the failure of this is that of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, who did not follow through on his oversight or make sure governance was followed. He turned a blind eye when they found out that they were actually handing out money to Liberal insiders. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was tied to Cycle Capital, one of the companies that was receiving grants from SDTC, and we know that there was a board member on that fund who was also with Cycle Capital. He said that his shares increased by 1,000% after receiving SDTC funding. The Minister of Environment benefited as well. That is corruption at its core.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584208">We also know that, yesterday, the RCMP opened up its investigation into the nine directors identified by the Auditor General in the SDTC green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584209">Should we be at all surprised by this? This is a Liberal government that has always been ethically challenged. It is plagued by scandal, and the Liberals have a culture of corruption. All I have to do is go back. I mentioned ad scam from 2004. I was elected in 2004, and we were dealing with the ad scam fallout back then, but we have witnessed it going on and on as we have moved forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584210">Let us not forget the SNC-Lavalin scandal in 2019, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put pressure on his justice minister at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to approve contracts for, and also provide a pardon to, SNC-Lavalin so that it could tender and bid on government contracts again. She said no, and the Prime Minister fired Jody Wilson-Raybould because she would not follow his word.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584211">She did her job as the Attorney General of Canada to make sure that the law was respected and that these individuals would not be given a free pass for their fraudulent activities in other countries and here in Canada. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found in violation by the Ethics Commissioner for putting undue pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould. Of course, that was not the first time he was found in violation of our ethics rules. It was only the second time, but he is the first Prime Minister in history to face an ethics scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584212">We look back on the WE scandal of 2020, and here we had the Liberals trying to shovel over half a million dollars into the hands of their friends at the WE Charity. Luckily, we were able to get that stopped, but we found out that Liberal insiders, including Bill Morneau, who is the former minister of finance, was actually tied directly back to the WE Charity. His daughter worked for the WE Charity, and he was in there advocating, not recusing himself from decision-making processes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584213">We look at all the foreign interference that has taken place and the blind eye that has been given by these Liberals on what is happening. The arrive scam is another one where, again, we had millions and millions of dollars going into the pockets of two guys. We found out later that the ArriveCAN app could have been set up for about $80,000. We are talking about $54 million-plus that was used by these individuals to enrich themselves because they were tied directly to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584214">Let us not forget about the Winnipeg lab documents in 2021, which started in 2020. The House requested and ordered for the production of documents. The government stalled that and blocked it. It even took the Speaker to court to try to stop the production of these documents, which showed, when we did receive them finally this year, that the two scientists in question were actually operatives for the People's Liberation Army in Beijing. The documents also showed that viruses and intel on different vaccines were shipped to China, and who knows what other security breaches happened at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. The Liberals were too scared to let the public see it. They were so scared in 2021 that, instead of providing those documents and having everything come out through the Supreme Court, they called an election. That, of course, broke Parliament and the process stopped. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584215">I think that some of us over here would actually like these guys to call an election now so that we can have an election that would stop the documents from coming forward, if that is what the Liberals want to do. Then Canadians could make the decision on how badly they want to put the Liberals in the penalty box based upon the continued unethical behaviour and corruption that plagues their government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584216">I have mentioned that there has been ongoing ethical violations by the government as well. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found guilty for taking a private vacation on billionaire island and using an unsanctioned aircraft. We know that Bill Morneau was found out in the WE scandal, and he had to resign over it. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> has been found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner on two different occasions, including awarding family members clam contracts in one of the Crown corporations. He was also found guilty of having his sister-in-law, I believe, made interim ethics commissioner. How could he be unbiased when they are family members? It would make for interesting family gatherings, such as Christmas supper. We also have the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation>, who went and gave her BFF and campaign manager contracts directly out of her office without tendering them out at all, and she was found in violation of the ethics rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584217">Now we have the Liberals obstructing our parliamentary process. They are also obstructing justice. Will they turn these documents over to the RCMP? I doubt it. They are going to claim some sort of cabinet secrecy. We have to make sure that the rules of this place, our parliamentary procedure, our Constitution, our charter, even the British North America Act, are respected. That is the last thing the Liberals are doing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584218">The Liberals keep claiming that the issue is all about charter rights, but I will repeat what the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said yesterday. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms is designed to protect the people from the government, not provide a cover for the government to hide documents from the people. We have to recognize that the supremacy of our democratic institution, the Parliament of Canada, is the overall legislative body that writes the rules, writes the laws and directs our justice system, not the other way around. The Liberals are always trying to tilt the discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584219">If we look at the rules, we see that Standing Order 108(1)(a) gives the power to the House of Commons, to committees and to Parliament, to order the production of papers. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, which we often call Bosc and Gagnon, chapter 3, page 137, says this about Parliament:</ParaText>

We can talk about how the Liberals' out-of-control and hug-a-thug policies have created crime and chaos on our streets, the worst we have ever seen.

However, because of the political interference from Navdeep Bains when he was minister of industry, by the Order in Council appointments that were made through him by the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal cabinet, individuals came in and ultimately enriched themselves.</ParaText>

The same question of privilege we are discussing today was raised then. The Harper government refused to conduct independent inquiries. Peter Milliken, who was the Speaker of the House at the time, finally authorized the transfer of documents because everything had been redacted. We had access to nothing. It is funny, when the Conservatives are in opposition, they are the ones who are masters of transparency.</ParaText>

To answer his question on Afghan detainees, because I was here during that time, the government does have the power to limit access on things that affect national security and national defence. SDTC has nothing at all to do with anything other than Liberal embarrassment. With respect to the Afghan detainee issue, we did put in place a process that allowed members to actually look at the secret documents and report back if they saw anything that fulfilled any of the allegations that were being made by other parties.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8584265">Mr. Speaker, I will begin my intervention with a quote: “It’s hard not to feel disappointed in your government when every day there is a new scandal.” These are the prophetic words of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation>, our current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada, and how true those words ring today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584266">After nine years of scandal, corruption and Liberal entitlement, the business of the House has been put on hold to discuss a new scandal of monumental proportions, the green slush fund. The government did not like that the former chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, was being publicly critical of its agenda, so it fired him and replaced him with one of its friends. This replacement was known to the government as holding blatant conflicts, as she had interest in companies receiving funding from SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584267">The PMO, the PCO and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> were warned about these conflicts and the risks involved, but they appointed her anyway. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by board directors. What ensued was the creation of a slush fund for Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584268">The Auditor General found that SDTC gave out 390 million taxpayer dollars in inappropriate contracts. This included $58 million for 10 projects that could not account for an environmental benefit or the development of green technology. In 180 cases, $334 million went to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. All the while, senior Industry Canada officials witnessed these conflicts but did not intervene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584269">The Auditor General herself placed the blame directly on the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were being given out. The minister was going further than that. He was actively covering up the existence of these shady deals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584270">Where he failed, this side of the House attempted to deliver some form of accountability for taxpayer money. Before adjourning for the summer, the House adopted a motion calling for documents related to SDTC to be turned over to the RCMP for review. At no point in the motion did it say that the instructions were optional. At no point did it instruct the government to redact information. As we know, the House enjoys the absolute and unbound power to order the production of documents, period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584271">The Speaker found that the government's refusal to properly comply with the House order constituted a breach of privilege. That is our government. This was not a simple mistake by the NDP-Liberal government. It was a calculated manoeuvre to avoid the discovery of any potential criminal activity that may have occurred under the government's watch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584272">The SDTC whistle-blower had suggested as much. They admitted that the Auditor General's investigation only scraped the surface and that if her investigation was focused on the real intent of those transactions, “of course they would find” criminal activity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584273">Let us thank goodness for the breaking news yesterday: The RCMP has announced that it will be investigating. Of course, it has full authority to substantiate any criminal activities that occurred within this organization. The fact that the NDP-Liberals have tried to cover them up and prevent Parliament from shining a light on these transactions is a serious indictment of their disdain for our democratic system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584274">For the sake of our country and our reputation around the world, I wish the green slush fund was the only case of corruption and disrespect for Parliament. It has now been two Speakers who have ordered the government to produce documents requested by the House, by this Parliament, and on both occasions, the Liberals have failed to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584275">The former Speaker found that the Liberals breached parliamentary privilege when they refused to produce House-ordered documents regarding the transfer of the Ebola and Henipah viruses from the Winnipeg lab to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the subsequent revocation of security clearances of two Chinese nationals. The Conservatives wanted to know why two scientists with deep connections to the Chinese military were even able to obtain high-level Canadian security clearances and conduct work with dangerous viruses. What was the government's reaction? It thumbed its nose at Parliament. The Conservatives ensured that the president of the Public Health Agency was called to the bar of the House of Commons to be reprimanded by the Speaker, something that Parliament had not done in over 100 years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584276">Also, in relation to the pandemic, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to use the pandemic for his own partisan gain. Canadians did not want an election in 2021, but he decided to call one anyway based on differences of opinion between the Liberals and Conservatives on how the pandemic should be managed. He thought he could wedge Canadians. For the Prime Minister, it was his way or the highway. The Prime Minister rolled the dice and Canadians said “no way”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584277">He failed to get a majority but destroyed many people's lives in the process. He verbally abused and wrongfully accused, and he denied culpability for the physical, mental and financial harms inflicted on Canadians. He also realized that he could not make COVID vaccines his supposed ticket to a majority government if our Canadian Armed Forces members were not fully vaccinated, so he ordered our serving members to be put through a horrific process of mandates, restrictions and punishment, which left our ranks depleted, our men and women in uniform demoralized and many seriously injured. The ramifications of his decisions will be felt in our armed forces for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584278"> Like a mantra, the Liberals continually said on that side of the floor that every decision they were making throughout the pandemic was rooted in science and that they depended on medical professionals because they themselves were not. However, here, too, the Liberals went over the heads of all parliamentarians, over the head of the Speaker and even over the head of the professional House of Commons nurse by denying members of the House the ability to do their jobs in this place on behalf of their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584279">When it came to vaccination status and precinct access, the Liberals pushed aside the medical professional, the nurse. The Speaker ruled that she was the only one with the professional medical authority to make public health decisions for members of Parliament and House of Commons staff. The Speaker also ruled that the Board of Internal Economy had overstepped its mandate in its vaccine requirements in this place. That is when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, for overt personal political purposes, blatantly overrode the scientifically supported public health decisions of the House medical professional and took his own Liberal Speaker to court for daring to do his job without partisan, political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584280">Then there was a time I will never forget: the first debate I participated in, which sought to remove the government's accountability to this House. It was in regard to an environmental framework. That bill sought to give sweeping power to the minister and accountability to an advisory board. Today, with the green slush fund, we are certainly hearing how well it works out for us when one minister thinks a bit too much of himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584281">Somewhat alarmed over this, I questioned the freshly minted member for <Affiliation DbId="278702" Type="2">West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country</Affiliation> about this board. What was it going to look like? How many people would be on it? Where were they going to come from and what would their credentials be to give Canadians confidence? What would their mandate be? How long would they serve? I asked questions like that, while the member could not wait to rise and say that the board had already been chosen. With debate barely initiated in this House, the deed was already done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584282">From the green slush fund to the government's management of the pandemic to the obsession with appointing oversight bodies with little or no accountability to Parliament, the Liberals have a very unhealthy tendency to take more and more rights and responsibilities away from opposition parties in the House and give more and more power to ministers and outside governing bodies that are not accountable to this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584307">Madam Speaker, I am going to put a little more detailed flavour on this so that people watching understand. The chair of SDTC, Annette Verschuren, who was hand-picked by the <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, was put in place after the previous chair complained about the government. She tried to get $6.8 million for the Verschuren Centre at Cape Breton University from the slush fund she chaired. The investment committee said it was a conflict. The investment committee also said it would use the employees here to help her get the money elsewhere. The chair actually used the employees of the green slush fund to get a further $10 million for the Verschuren Centre from Industry Canada and ACOA. That is the least of the corruption, but it is a very specific instance of what the Liberals are trying to cover up with their hand-picked chair.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8584315"> Madam Speaker, what a sad state of affairs we have seen this week from the Liberals. Here we are engaging in what should be a serious conversation about a pressing issue, only to hear the members opposite say, “What about them? They did something worse.” It is that old political tactic of whataboutism, the ultimate escape hatch for avoiding accountability. It has become the go-to response by the Liberals during the course of this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584316"> Let us step back and look at the big picture. A government gets caught red-handed in a scandal. It is clear and undeniable and the public deserves an explanation. What happens next? We do not get an apology or even a hint of responsibility. Instead, we get a well-rehearsed, “But what about the other party?” They try to change the subject to someone else's wrongdoing, as if two wrongs somehow make a right. Whataboutism is the political equivalent of the schoolyard comeback, “I know you are, but what am I?” How childish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584317">This attitude of avoiding the tough questions by pointing fingers elsewhere is nothing new. It has been happening for years across all political spectrums, but under the Liberal government, it seems to have sunk to a new low. It is a strategy deployed to muddy the waters and confuse the public. Why talk about real problems when we can play the blame game instead? Why address policy failures when we can just drag our opponents into the mud with us?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584318">We stand here today once again facing a Liberal government that will do everything humanly possible to avoid transparency. The Liberal government's pattern of withholding crucial documents and hiding from parliamentary scrutiny is not just a betrayal of democracy. It is an outright assault on the accountability that every Canadian citizen deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584319">The present case involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or the green slush fund, serves as only the latest example of a long series of manoeuvres by the Liberals to avoid accountability. Here we have a Speaker of the House ruling that the Liberal government violated the powers of the House by refusing to provide documents related to this fund. This blatant refusal to cooperate with Parliament represents an alarming trend of deception. What is the government hiding? What could possibly be so damning in these documents that it would rather violate the very principles of parliamentary oversight than let the truth be seen?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584320">The arrogance of this behaviour cannot be overstated. Time and time again, when faced with tough questions, the Liberals shift the goalposts, stonewall or, when absolutely cornered, throw up their hands and give vague, non-committal responses. They have forgotten that they serve the Canadian people, not their own political interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584321"> What makes this evasion all the more ridiculous is the government's attempts to put a green spin on it. Sure, it grossly mismanages public funds to shovel money to its friends. Sure, it was involved in corruption. However, at least it was green corruption. That seems to be its argument: At least it was some nice environmentalist who got away with the cash. The absurdity of this argument is lost on no one, yet somehow the Liberals seem to believe that this passes as an acceptable response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584322">Despite how laughable and immature the Liberals' whataboutism is, they are unrelenting in their use of it. We have seen Liberal speaker after Liberal speaker stand up this week and waste the House's time with history lessons and other distractions that have nothing to do with the issue we are dealing with here and now. Their response has turned this debate into a competition of who did worse rather than who can do better.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584323">Their attitude is not just disappointing; it is dangerous. It promotes a culture of deflection where no one is held accountable because someone else did something bad too. It undermines trust in our leaders and institutions, because it suggests that as long as someone else is doing worse, then nothing needs to change. What a sad state of affairs for the Liberal Party. The party that waltzed into government with fine slogans about sunny ways and running the most transparent government in history now hides and cowers behind the excuse that at least the other guys were worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584324">What makes that attitude so much sadder is that it is not even true. By any metric we choose, like the taxpayers' dollars wasted, the length of time these schemes were running or the number of ethics violations incurred, any metric we come up with, the level of corruption by the Liberal government is in a shameful class all by itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584325">When the government first came to power, one of their slogans was “Canada is back”, a slogan that reflects the typical entitled Liberal Party attitude that the nation of Canada and the Liberal Party are the same thing and the Liberal Party is Canada's national governing party. If we go through life with that attitude, it becomes easy to rationalize stealing from the public purse. Why not use taxpayers' money for our own benefit? To put it another way, as far as the Liberals are concerned, taxpayers' money is the Liberals' money</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584326">Nowhere has the Liberal attitude of entitlement been more obvious than in the present issue of the Liberals' green slush fund, so let us take a closer look at this most recent incarnation of Liberal greed, corruption and insider cronyism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584327">Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, is a program that was supposed to be about protecting our environment, fostering innovation and creating a sustainable future. However, what has it become? It has become the Liberals' green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584328">The Auditor General's report, released earlier this year, is a damning indictment of SDTC and the entire Liberal government's mismanagement of public funds. Some $334 million over 186 cases went to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest, and a staggering $58 million was handed out to ineligible projects. What were these projects? Some of them did not develop a single new technology. Others made outlandish claims about their environmental benefits that could not stand up to the slightest scrutiny, yet they were funded anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584329">Let us not forget that the Auditor General looked at only a sample of SDTC transactions. She looked at roughly half of the transactions and found that 82% of them were conflicted. We can easily surmise that the remaining cases were just as conflicted and that the sums of money involved were hundreds of millions of dollars more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584330">This is about more than just paperwork errors or poor oversight. This is about a culture of corruption that has seeped into the highest levels of the Liberal government. This is about a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who promised transparency but instead gave us secrecy, a Prime Minister who said that his government would work for all Canadians but instead has set up a system where only his friends and Liberal insiders get ahead. Liberal insiders at the trough is what this program is all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584331"> How could this happen? How could a program designed to fund innovation and environmental protection be so utterly corrupted? Unravelling those questions starts by looking at the person at the centre of this scandal, Annette Verschuren, the chair of the SDTC board who oversaw much of this disaster, a person who voted to give millions of dollars to her own companies. Why would she not recuse herself? Someone with such a long history of corporate governance must have had at least some glancing knowledge of the concept of conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584332">The Ethics Commissioner himself called out this blatant conflict of interest for years, but, unfortunately, it went unpunished. We now know that Verschuren's company NRStor directly benefited from these funds. This is not a one-off event; it is a symptom of a system that has been so utterly compromised by greed and self-interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584333">When whistle-blowers tried to bring these issues to light, what did they get? Some of them got fired, some of them got silenced and some of them got a toxic workplace environment where honesty is punished and corruption is rewarded. Let us review some of the whistle-blower testimony from committee, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584334"> In other statements, the whistle-blower said:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584338">Is that not the truth? Is that not exactly what we have seen and heard from Liberal members opposite with their incessant whataboutism? One of the pieces of testimony from the ethics committee from last year that I found quite puzzling came from Doug McConnachie, an assistant deputy minister at Innovation, Science and Economic Development, ISED, who saw the handling of the whistle-blower complaints against SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584339">In a recorded conversation with the whistle-blower, Mr. McConnachie stated, “There's a lot of sloppiness and laziness. There is some outright incompetence and, you know, the situation is just kind of untenable at this point.” In the recorded conversation, he went on to say, and this comment coming from a senior experienced civil servant was especially relevant, “It was free money. That is almost a sponsorship-scandal level kind of giveaway.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584340">Then, in committee, after the Liberal bosses had talked to him and provided him with his new talking points, Mr. McConnachie made the following statement that I found both surprising and sad, “I was too transparent, too trusting, and I deeply regret any impact that this has had on the government, SDTC and ISED.” He said he was too transparent. Apparently, by the standards set by the Liberal Party, the government should be transparent only to a point. Its attitude seems to be that it will make a bit of a show of being honest and open, but it will not get carried away. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584341">Let us be clear that this is not just an accident. This is not a bureaucratic mistake. This is an apparatus of greed built to serve Liberal insiders, their friends and allies. What about the real innovators? What about the hard-working Canadians who play by the rules and try to get ahead through hard work and good ideas? They are left out in the cold, watching as Liberal friends get their snouts in the government trough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584342">Since its inception, SDTC received $2.1 billion in federal funding. Under the present Liberal government, the most recent agreement outlined $722 million in funding through 2028. However, instead of using the money to build cleaner, greener futures, the Liberals used it to line the pockets of their wealthy friends and business associates. At the end of the day, after all of their carbon taxes, all of their anti-oil and anti-gas policies and all of their environmental rhetoric, the only things greener are the wallets of their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584343"> Let us go over the numbers again to try to keep things in perspective; $58 million that we know about was given to ineligible projects, and $334 million that we know about was in blatant conflicts of interest. Those are the facts, the shameful, appalling, caught-red-handed, hand-in-the-cookie-jar facts. Nonetheless, we have not even heard a single Liberal member across the aisle offer to the Canadian people anything that even remotely resembles an apology, not so much as a syllable of accountability or regret but just an endless stream of excuses, evasions and whataboutism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584344">This is the very definition of Liberal insiders at the trough. This is how they operate and think. They take care of their own. They make sure that Liberals get rich while ordinary Canadians struggle to make ends meet. Then, when they get caught, what do they do? Almost like a reflex, they bring up one or two mistakes made by Stephen Harper from 12 or 15 years ago. Canadians deserve better. The Liberals' response has been unacceptable, especially when we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money thrown away on projects that should never have been funded in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584345">The green slush fund scandal is about more than just money; it is about integrity. It is about a Liberal government that has lost its way and has forgotten whom it works for. We need real accountability. We need a government that works for the people, not for the insiders, not for the lobbyists and not for the rich and well-connected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584346">The Liberals will tell us that it is all just a misunderstanding and that the issues are being fixed, but we have heard that before. We heard it after the SNC-Lavalin scandal, after the WE Charity scandal and after the ArriveCan app scandal, and we are hearing it now. This is a pattern of corruption and greed, a pattern of Liberal insiders at the trough taking whatever they can get and leaving the rest of us to pay the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584347">Canadians have had enough. It is time for a change. It is time for a government that puts Canadians first, that makes Canada work for people who work, and that believes in fairness, transparency and accountability. We cannot allow the culture of corruption to continue. We cannot allow the Liberals to keep putting their friends and insiders ahead of the Canadian people. Let us send a message to the government that enough is enough. Let us take back control of our tax dollars. Let us demand accountability, and let us make sure that the next time there is a program like SDTC, it is working for the people, not for insiders at the trough.</ParaText>

It was all my friends whom I appointed.” As for the second part of the hon. member's statement, good people cannot stand idly by and let this corruption and criminal activity go on. When we have honest, hard-working civil servants who come to work every day and do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, and they see all of these corrupt Liberals helping themselves to taxpayers' money, they cannot—</ParaText>

I am trying to figure out if we can find any evidence that Annette Verschuren is in fact tied to Liberals, is a Liberal or was ever a Liberal. I have gone through Wikipedia and everything I can find about her. I am a Cape Bretoner; I will not say a former Cape Bretoner as once a Caper, always a Caper. I know she was really highly regarded as a Cape Breton girl who was the daughter of Dutch immigrants and worked hard on a farm all her life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584365">I look through her political connections: She was named by Stephen Harper to help in the economic advisory council in the financial crisis of 2008, and she was awarded a place in the Canadian Business Hall of Fame in 2019. She was also an adviser to Brian Mulroney. She seems to have been on all sides of the political fences. She was also on the board of directors of Natural Resources Limited, an oil sands company that also received money from SDTC, and she is currently on the board of the Ontario Energy Association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584366">She did not seem to understand that she was in flagrant conflict of interest as chair of the board of SDTC, which is clearly mind-boggling for someone with that kind of business career. There is no question about that. I heard it thrown around that her organization received millions. As far as I can see on the record, it got about $200,000 from SDTC. Of course, it is unacceptable if the organization got a nickel while she was chair of the board. My point is that she is not beyond getting punished in all this; her reputation is in tatters. Still, one wants to know more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584367">However, this is a case where a board was set up under Jean Chrétien and run under Stephen Harper with the same board structure; I do not see how, suddenly, the entire thing is now condemned as a Liberal slush fund. It certainly was mismanaged. She was chair of the board when flagrant conflict of interest occurred, but I do not see anything that ties her specifically to one party or another.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584375">Madam Speaker, as we know, on June 10, the House voted on a motion ordering the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, and the Auditor General of Canada to each table documents with the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, within 14 days following the adoption of the order, and for those documents to be turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584376">The Bloc Québécois is of the opinion that the documents not being produced as requested is a breach of privilege. I would remind members that, on Thursday, September 26, the Speaker ruled that this is a prima facie case of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584377">We have been debating the motion to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs since last Friday, which has changed the House's agenda since privilege motions take priority. Since last Friday, the work of the House has been monopolized by this question and there is no legislation on the orders of the day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584378">Let us go back to the genesis of this foundation. SDTC is a foundation that was designed to lose control of public funds. Sustainable Development Technology Canada is condemned to inefficiency and waste because it has a design flaw. Let us go back to its creation to understand what is happening today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584379">When the 1995 referendum happened, Ottawa got spooked. After realizing that it was was essentially absent from Quebeckers' lives, the federal government began a major government restructuring that would benefit the federal government at Quebec's expense. At the time, Paul Martin was the finance minister, and the president of the Treasury Board was Marcel Massé, who was also a former clerk of the Privy Council. He used his expertise on the machinery of government to make some major changes that would make it so that Quebec would be stretched to the limit, while Ottawa would have plenty of financial leeway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584380">By doing so, he thought Quebeckers would begin to see the federal government as their government, the one they could turn to to meet their needs and to help them get things done. Perhaps they would change their allegiance. Perhaps Quebeckers would become Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584381">Marcel Massé made no secret of what he was doing. He said, “When Bouchard”, referring to Lucien Bouchard, then premier of Quebec, “has to make cuts, those of us in Ottawa will be able to demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of social programs.” That says a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584382">He succeeded in part. Deep cuts to health and social services transfers—a 40% reduction in transfers over three years—forced the Quebec government to make cuts of its own. Everyone remembers nurses retiring en masse. The health care network never fully recovered. The Parti Québécois and the independence movement lost their progressive sparkle and were at death's door as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584383">Ottawa began running large surpluses, surpluses so indecent in a time of austerity that they had to be covered up and camouflaged. That is how Marcel Massé came up with the idea of creating a series of foundations. By pouring large sums into these foundations, he emptied the federal coffers, shrank its surplus on paper and was able to then continue refusing to increase transfers that would have kept services afloat for the people under Quebec's jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584384">However, to ensure that the money paid to the foundations was taken out of the books, the government could not have direct control over it. The loss of control over public funds is no accident. It was necessary for the scheme to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584385"> In 2005, former auditor general of Canada Sheila Fraser published a scathing report, one chapter of which was entitled “Accountability of Foundations”. She found that the federal government had transferred $9 billion to 15 foundations from 1998 to 2002 alone. Those $9 billion are equivalent to $17 billion today. She also found that the government had no control over $7 billion of that $9 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584386">These foundations provided scholarships, through the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation; supported research, through the Canada Foundation for Innovation and Genome Canada; supported public infrastructure, through the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund, which dealt directly with the municipalities in order to circumvent Quebec City's control; and fostered industrial innovation. The message was clear: The future is in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584387">Created in 2001, Sustainable Development Technology Canada was one of the 15 foundations that were mentioned by the auditor general of Canada in 2005 and that were operating with practically no government oversight.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584388"> The loss of control over public funds at Sustainable Development Technology Canada is no accident. The foundation was created with that goal in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584389">Nineteen years after the former auditor general published her report in 2005, including ten years of the Harper government, SDTC still exists, and the loss of control over public funds has not been resolved. The same goes for the other foundations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584390">This brings us to the scandal and the issue that we have been debating for the past week. The Conservatives would like to turn this into a Liberal scandal, but the problem runs deeper than that and it transcends party lines. The situation at SDTC points to a widespread problem within the federal level. This foundation is only a symptom of a generalized cancer. The federal government is appallingly inefficient and treats public funds like Monopoly money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584391">While we are here discussing federal waste in Ottawa, Quebec is struggling to fulfill its responsibilities, which include almost all public services. As the Parliamentary Budget Officer reiterates every year in his fiscal sustainability report, the cost of Quebec's and the provinces' responsibilities is rising faster than their revenues, and Ottawa is taking in more money than it needs to fulfill the responsibilities that are strictly its own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584392">The consequences of this fiscal imbalance are manifold. The Quebec government is stretched to the limit. Once it has paid for the most essential services, there is not enough money left over to enable Quebeckers to make societal choices and shape their own social, economic and cultural development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584393">The federal government has no such constraints. It has so much money left over that it can afford to meddle in affairs that are none of its business, and it feels no need to manage its programs efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584394">The waste in the current federal system is a natural result of the fiscal imbalance, and it extends to all areas of government activity. Let me give just a few examples. It costs Ottawa two and a half times more to process an EI claim than it costs Quebec to process a social assistance claim. It costs the federal government four times more to issue a passport than it costs the Quebec government to issue a driver's licence. Lastly, before the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue veterans' hospital was transferred to Quebec, each procedure performed there cost two and a half times more than a similar procedure performed in a Quebec-run long-term care home. If Ottawa were in charge of health care, we would not be able to afford medicare. Even if every penny of the government's revenues went into the health care system, it would still not be enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584395">We cannot say it enough. It is not just a Liberal scandal. Waste and interference are inherent to the federal system, no matter which party is in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584396">Speaking of which, in 2014, the Government of Quebec released an expert panel's report on federal intervention in the health and social services sector from 2002 to 2013. The Harper government was in power for nearly all of that period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584397">The report identified 37 federal programs that interfered in health care under the Conservatives. The transfers in question were not very generous in terms of dollar amounts, but the interference was very significant and very costly to manage, and the public did not get its money's worth. In fact, the expert panel calculated that the amount it cost the Government of Quebec to deal with this interference exceeded the amount of the transfers, leading the panel to conclude that it would be more cost-effective to just turn down the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584398">In other words, many federal programs are a complete waste of taxpayers' money. There is $1 billion being spent here and $10 billion being spent there, with no oversight and no obligation to produce results. Even though Ottawa does not provide any direct services to the public—except to indigenous peoples and veterans, and we all know how that is working out—it found a way to hire an additional 109,000 public servants since 2015. Imagine what those 109,000 people could have accomplished if Quebec and the provinces had hired them to care for the sick, teach children or even repair roads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584399">Once again, let us come back to SDTC. This time, let us consider the recent report of the Office of the Auditor General. On June 4, the Auditor General published her performance audit report on SDTC. She analyzed the organization's activities between April 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584400">In short, the Auditor General's report indicates that there were serious governance issues with the fund. The main problems were mismanagement of conflicts of interest and a lack of clarity surrounding the criteria for awarding grants.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584401">The Auditor General determined that the foundation's management of conflicts of interest was flawed. As a result, the board of directors was not informed of conflicts of interest in a timely manner. According to the report, some directors voted on or participated in discussions about certain items even after declaring a conflict of interest. The Auditor General found that the board of directors relied on members to declare conflicts rather than maintaining a register of conflicts of interest. The foundation set up a register in 2022, but there were inconsistencies between the meeting minutes and the register. The Auditor General identified 90 cases, involving $76 million, where the conflict of interest policy was not followed. According to the directors, the inconsistencies identified by the Auditor General were not policy violations, but errors in the minutes. However, the Auditor General pointed out that the board of directors is responsible for correcting the minutes when they are approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584402">In the case of COVID-19 payments, the Auditor General found that some members apparently voted in violation of the policy. The directors argued that they had obtained legal advice to the contrary. Lastly, the Auditor General noted that the policy lacked specific guidance to address potential cases of perceived conflicts of interest. She identified five cases where directors' business or personal relationships gave the appearance of a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584403">As for the criteria for awarding funding, the Auditor General found that, since the eligibility criteria for projects were vague, some projects were approved even though they did not meet the goal and objectives of the fund. This also led to situations where the external consultants in charge of providing advice on project selection contradicted the fund employees, since the instructions that had been sent were vague. SDTC disputes some of the Auditor General's findings, claiming that the documentation she analyzed did not reflect SDTC's extensive analysis of the projects. SDTC says it did its due diligence on each of the projects and that the comments from the external consultants were incorporated into its analysis. Who are we to believe?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584404">Now let us talk about whistle-blowers. As we know, whistle-blowers reported concerns in 2022 about SDTC's management of public funds and human resources. Let me provide an overview of the chronology of events. According to the information reported by the media, in November 2022, whistle-blowers initially approached the Office of the Auditor General to raise concerns about the management of public funds and human resources within SDTC. The OAG suggested that they send their complaint to the Privy Council Office. The Privy Council Office received a 300-page document from the whistle-blower group containing allegations dating back to February 2022. Shortly after, senior officials at Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, or ISED, took charge of the file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584405">On November 1, 2023, the media reported that the whistle-blowers had sent them recordings of conversations with senior departmental officials, in an attempt to force the government to change the way it was handling the allegations about the foundation's governance and management of contributions. On the same day, the Office of the Auditor General announced that it was going to conduct an audit on how SDTC was financing sustainable development technologies within the department's portfolio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584406">The next day, Andrew Hayes, the deputy auditor general, appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts and said that his office was still in the process of determining the full scope of the audit. He said he expected that the audit would be completed before Parliament rose for the summer in June 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584407">Four days later, on November 6, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics to discuss allegations regarding the governance and management of contributions by SDTC. Among other things, he said that his department had requested that the foundation “take the necessary steps to conduct an in‑depth review of the allegations regarding its management of human resources.” That review was to be directed by an independent law firm, which would subsequently inform the minister of its findings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584408">Two days later, on November 8, SDTC officials including Leah Lawrence, president and CEO; Sheryl Urie, vice president of finance; and Annette Verschuren, chair of the board, appeared before the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8584409">During this appearance, Ms. Verschuren admitted, for one, to having proposed a motion to the SDTC board of directors that led to $217,000 in additional funding during the COVID‑19 pandemic for NRStor, a company she has run since 2012. She also confirmed to the committee that she receives an annual salary of $120,000 from that company. Ms. Verschuren said she proposed the motion after the board sought and received legal advice that there was no need to re-declare previously declared conflicts of interest regarding ongoing projects, and that the additional funding was for all existing projects, not individual ones. She also asserted that all SDTC-funded organizations received the same treatment and the same amount of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584410">On November 10, Ms. Lawrence resigned from her position at SDTC. Media outlets reported that she wrote the following in her resignation letter: “Given recent media reports, House of Commons committee testimony, and the surrounding controversy, it is clear there has been a sustained and malicious campaign to undermine my leadership.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584411">A week later, on November 17, the media reported that Konrad von Finckenstein, the interim Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, decided to review the issues raised by the decisions made by Ms. Verschuren in connection with NRStor. Three days later, on November 20, Ms. Verschuren stepped down from her position at SDTC. In a statement thanking Ms. Verschuren, SDTC said, “The Board of Directors will meet this week to review the response to the Management Response and Action Plan put forward by Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED), with the objective of submitting the response to ISED on December 1 and getting new funding flowing to Canadian entrepreneurs as soon as possible.”<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584412">It seems clear that SDTC did not always manage public funds according to the terms and conditions of the contribution agreements and of its legislative mandate. As I said earlier, this is baked in its very structure, and that has been the case since its creation. It is also clear that the oversight by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada did not guarantee that the public funds were administered according to the terms and conditions of the contribution agreements and the applicable government policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584413">That is how the saga played out. I would like to remind members that, last June, the House voted in favour of a motion compelling the government to produce documents by a certain deadline, which was not met. The government is refusing to provide the documents. However, Parliament's power to compel the production of government documents has been clearly established. The only limit to the House's ability to demand whatever information it deems necessary from the government is the good judgment of the House, not the goodwill of the government. Otherwise, the very principle of responsible government is meaningless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584414">On June 10, the House made its position clear. It ordered the government to hand over a series of documents to the law clerk of the House so that he could forward them to law enforcement. The government failed to comply, thereby breaching the privilege of the House. There may be a good reason for this, but it does not change anything. As I was saying, the only limit to the House's ability to demand information is the House's good judgment, not the government's goodwill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584421">This is a matter of ethics. We are are talking about people who were appointed to a board of directors and who voted to give money to their own companies, companies that pay them a salary. That makes no sense at all. The bare minimum that is expected of anyone who represents a foundation or another organization on a board of directors is that they must not put themselves in a conflict of interest like that. It does not make any sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584422">I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the important role played by the whistle-blowers who informed the media, Parliament and the government of this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584423">I deplore the fact that the government did not introduce any legislation to properly protect whistle-blowers. Why did this sort of bill have to come from the Bloc Québécois? A Bloc member introduced a bill in the House to tell the government that enough is enough and that whistle-blowers play an important role. They are the ones who inform us of wrongdoing and scandals, and the least we can do is protect them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584424">Madam Speaker, the hon. member stated that the arm's-length bodies, 15 foundations, as he mentioned, were created and funded by the federal government. He said there was a loss of control over the funding that goes to organizations like SDTC. However, in the later part of his speech, he referred extensively to the Auditor General's report, and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner's report on the issue related to SDTC. Is it not contradictory?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584425"> In fact, Parliament has control over the funding that goes to these foundations, to other organizations, Crown corporations, and we have the mechanism to see that it is administered properly. When it is not, as in this case, there is a mechanism that kicks into process and that is what we are dealing with.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584426">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Nepean for his excellent question. I thank him for raising these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584427">What we are saying is that the goal was to reduce transfers to the provinces and keep more money for the federal government, but to conceal it using the mechanism of foundations. That is what former Treasury Board president Marcel Massé said himself. In order to make the money vanish from the federal government's balance sheet, it could not be under the government's direct control. That was the fundamental problem, the same problem that Sheila Fraser raised in 2005. It was very serious and very important. That was a time of budget cuts and forced austerity, when fewer services were being provided to the public. Times were hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584428">There may be indirect validation mechanisms after the fact, which is what we are talking about here. For the Bloc Québécois, however, this is clearly insufficient. These foundations manage money generated from taxes and taxpayers' income tax. It is managed not by the government or by the elected members of the House, who are accountable, but rather by foundations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584429">The fact that there are then validation mechanisms, after all the foolish mischief is done, is clearly insufficient. This is not how taxpayers' money should be managed. That is why we are calling for these foundations, the mechanism conceived by Marcel Massé, to be abolished.</ParaText>

We have been debating this question of privilege that was raised here in the House for a long time, a week or two. This situation is a result of the government's stubborn refusal to hand over the documents. If the government had allowed the documents be tabled in the House, Parliament would not be paralyzed like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584431">I have been asking myself the following question, and perhaps my colleague can answer it. Why is the government willing to set aside its entire legislative agenda to prevent these documents from being produced?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8584432">Madam Speaker, that is a very good question. What is the reason for that? There are several hypotheses. However, what it boils down to is that an order was made. The House asked the government to produce documents, and the government did not do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8584433">Does it really bother the government that it cannot introduce any bills? Clearly, this government is tired and has run out of ideas.
