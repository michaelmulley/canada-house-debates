              <ParaText id="8789937"> Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise today to present the Conservatives' dissenting report from the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789938">For years, the Liberal-NDP <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has sought to distract Canadians from the failures of his government. The peak of his efforts came in February 2022, when the government invoked the Emergencies Act to silence dissent to his pandemic controls. Conservatives opposed this extreme overreach at the time, and every development that has since come to light has confirmed that the Conservatives made the right call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789939">Regrettably, the Liberals, aided and abetted by so-called independent senators, thwarted our efforts at committee to get to the bottom of these decisions in order to hold the government accountable. What is worse is that, in the report they have written, several recommendations gloss over the legitimate, serious concerns that arose. Moreover, they would further reduce parliamentary accountability of any government that claims such extraordinary legal powers for itself in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789940"> Even Commissioner Paul Rouleau, who once worked in the Liberal PMO, struggled to write a report upholding the Liberal government's decision, admitting, “Reasonable and informed people could reach a different conclusion than the one I have arrived at.” However, Canadians can be reassured that the federal court, in the only legally binding analysis of the invocation of the Emergencies Act, has confirmed that the NDP-Liberal government's choices were both illegal and unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789941">Conservatives have put forward a dissenting report, which I encourage everyone to read. It outlines our analysis of the situation and our deep concerns with the lack of government transparency, acknowledges the committee recommendations that we do agree with and sets out a series of additional recommendations we think will ensure greater government accountability and restraint if, God forbid, there is ever a similar situation in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789942">In conclusion, Conservatives wish to express their appreciation for the committee staff, who ably helped us through our deliberations, along with those witnesses who willingly contributed their evidence and views for our report.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8789946">Madam Speaker, as members of the New Democratic Party, we stand by the recommendations in the main report, but we believe that further reflection is essential. This will help us address the broader implications of this moment and ensure that we chart a future that protects the rights of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789947"> New Democrats stress the urgent need to rebuild public confidence in our institutions; achieving this will require a much deeper democratic commitment to parliamentary transparency and accountability, not just in the specific context of the Emergencies Act but also in our ongoing governance efforts. The failures of local police services during the “freedom convoy”, with officers appearing compromised or even sympathetic to the occupiers, exposed the systemic issues that must be addressed. Many Canadians felt abandoned during this crisis, and the resulting loss of public trust underscores the urgent need for structural reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789948"> It is troubling that the last royal commission on policing in Canada occurred in 1962. As the challenges of public safety have evolved significantly since then, we call on the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> to establish a new national commission on policing. This body should examine police mandates, budgets and their alignment with public safety goals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789949">In addition, we urge the government to create a dedicated office to investigate radicalization within public security forces and the misuse of resources for undemocratic purposes. The invocation of the Emergencies Act has revealed a deep and systemic challenge in Canada's governance and policing, as well as the protection of democratic rights. The issues exposed during the crisis, those of transparency, accountability and public trust, must be addressed with urgency and purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789950"> As New Democrats, we believe that the recommendations in this report are a vital step forward, but they must be accompanied by broader reforms. Canada must seize on this moment to rebuild its institutions in alignment with democratic values, whether by modernizing the Emergencies Act, investigating extremism within our public institutions or rethinking the role and structure of policing. Only through sustained effort and genuine accountability can we restore public confidence and ensure that our democracy remains resilient against future challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789951">We would also like to thank all the incredible staff, the clerks and everybody who participated, including each of our party staff, for the last close to two years.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">Ms. Rachel Blaney (North Island—Powell River, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Motion for concurrence</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="8789955"> Madam Speaker, I move that the ninth report of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, presented on Wednesday, December 14, 2022, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789956">I am very honoured to be here to speak on behalf of the tremendous members of my riding, North Island—Powell River, as well as on behalf of many people across this country, largely women, who married people in the military after they turned 60.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789957">What is unfortunate about this is that we are having this concurrence debate on something that started in Canada in 1901. It was a piece of legislation that was put in place to make sure that young women did not marry older military men for their pension. It was put in place that, if they were married after 60, the person they married would not be eligible for any spousal benefits when they died. They called it the gold digger clause. The rationale was that a person would only marry someone over 60 who had served our country because that person was waiting for their pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789958"> Here we are. It is 2024, and this rule is still in place. It is shocking that it has an impact on so many people. What is really upsetting to me and to people who have lived through this is that, in 2015, when the Liberals were put into power, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s letter to the Minister of Veterans Affairs stated very clearly that this was to be remedied. It was time to deal with this and to make it fair. Unfortunately, even though this was written to two ministers, in 2015 and 2017, it then suddenly disappeared from the mandate letters of the Minister of Veterans Affairs. It was clearly there before, and nothing was done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789959"> I know that some members in the House, especially the Liberals, will think about 2019 and say that they did do something, that they put in place $150 million to start to support some of these people, largely women, who are marrying people after 60 who served our country or who served as RCMP officers, and put it aside for them. They were going to find a process and make sure that they got a bit of a survivor's benefit. That was done in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789960"> Again, I just want to point out that it is now 2024. It is over five years later, and how much of that money has been spent? How much has gone to these amazing women who, in some cases, were married for 25 and 30 years and who cared for the people who served our country as they aged? Zero dollars has gone out to those women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789961">The <Affiliation DbId="300029" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and her team came to visit us in committee just over a week ago, and I asked about this again. This may surprise some, but people from all over Canada contact my office and talk to me about this issue; it is having an impact on them. I do not know how people feel in the House about having elderly women, in some cases in their eighties, call their office to explain this. What I have heard again and again is a woman saying she is not a gold digger. She married her spouse because she loved him, and she cared for him as he aged. Now that he is gone, she cannot afford the basic necessities of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789962">I do not want to hear that anymore. It upsets me that people who care for the people who served our country feel as though they are second-class citizens with the mantle of gold digger on their shoulders. We had a whole study about this in the veterans affairs committee a couple of years ago, and that is what I am talking about. What was very distressing about that study was listening to couples who were in this current circumstance, some of whom did not know. They went out and served their country. They found a spouse, and they were happily married. Then they found out, after they were married or in a common-law relationship, that their spouse would not get any survivor's benefits. Some who found this out went back and asked for information, and they were told then.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8789963"> One of the recommendations in the report is a very basic one, which is to please tell the people who serve us that if they find love after 60, they will be penalized. Then the government said, “Do not worry; we have this program, and you can implement it.” It is called the optional survivor benefit program. What they can do is give up a percentage of their income every month to put aside for their loved one. The pickup on this program is extremely low and I think all of us in this House instinctively know why. It is because veterans do not have huge pensions to begin with. What are they going to do? Are they going to commit to poverty through their whole time with their spouse so their spouse can have a pittance when they are gone? It is shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789964">One veteran spoke to me about what he had done. He loved his spouse so much, so when he found out about the optional survivor benefit, he put it in place. He put part of his pension every month, every year away for her. Sadly, his spouse developed a serious illness and passed away. For years he had been putting money away for her. It was his money, part of his pension, that he was saving for her through this program. When she passed, he asked what was going to happen to that money, and the government said, “It is gone now; that is ours.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789965">When we think about this, people are choosing to live in poverty so their spouse can have a pittance when they pass and then something like this happens and they lose absolutely everything. The department officials were assuring me that when the veteran lost their spouse, not to worry because they get the same pension; they are no longer deducting from it once they lose their loved one. Never mind that the money veterans put aside for a specific reason just disappears into the coffers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789966"> When we in this place think of injustice and unfairness, we have to really look at what is happening and really understand that we are asking people to care for the people who served our country as they age, during, in some cases, some of the hardest physical, emotional and mental times for these people, and we are asking their spouses to just go without. Never mind that people live way longer now than they did in 1901. Never mind that in 1901, already this was a sexist, misogynistic law, because it was. To assume the only reason people would marry a veteran was for their money is shameful, and that we are still practising that today is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789967"> The other thing that came up again and again is one of the recommendations in this report that I hope all members in the House take time with, because this is a simple injustice. We saw this happen again and again, and it was like a dance. We would talk to people at Veterans Affairs, and they would say, even though it is in the mandate letter from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, “It is not us; it is National Defence.” Then we would go to National Defence officials and ask them. They would say, “No, it is not us; it is Veterans Affairs.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789968">We have veterans, including RCMP veterans, all over this country who are fighting this. They are standing up and saying, “This is not right. This is not fair. We do not want our loved ones to be in poverty when we go because we cannot get that pension for them, that survivor's benefit.” They do not even know who to advocate to because these two departments keep switching it back and forth. That is simply unfair and really shameful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8789969">I keep thinking about the people who came and spoke with us. One of the stories I found most frustrating in this job was of a couple, a veteran who was 59 and his partner, who were planning to get married and then the pandemic hit. What happened during the pandemic? I think all of us know: Everything sort of fell apart for a while. By the time they could figure out how to get married, he had reached the age of 60. Because of a pandemic, he could not get married before 60 and now his spouse will not get a survivor's pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789970">I look at things like that and I think it is so ridiculous. What else has been surprising is how many veterans have contacted my office who did not know. We have actually had people call us and say they got married because they were worried that if they waited until they were 60, their spouse would get nothing. It is totally shocking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789971">I think of Walt and Norma. They both testified at our committee. One of the things that will always stick with me is Walt saying to the committee that he just wants Canada, the country he served, to understand that his wife is worth a survivor's benefit. They are married. They care for their family together. They have a grandchild who has some particular needs. Walt and Norma are a big part of providing support for those needs, which is what people do in a family. What Walt is worried about is that if he goes before Norma, she would not be able to afford and maintain their house, she would not be able to have space for that granddaughter and that whole family who need the support and care, and everything would start to fall apart. That is unfair, and Walt feels bad. It is shocking to me that we are in a situation where Canada is literally making people feel guilty for finding love after 60.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789972">I want to do a special shout-out to Madelyn, an amazing woman who lives very close here in Ottawa. She got a hold of me to talk about the fact that she has survived a beautiful person, Roger, who served our country, and things are tough for her. Madelyn, with tremendous grace and dignity, is addressing her day-to-day issues with as much dignity as she can, but she is struggling because she will not receive a survivor's benefit after Roger's passing. She was one of the women who called me and said, “Rachel, I promise you, I'm not a gold digger.” Then she said Roger was a lot of work sometimes at the end. It was a lot of work for her, but she would have done it again, even if it was hard and frustrating, because she loved him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789973"> I did the responsible thing and I said, “Okay, let us ask the PBO to do a bit of a report on this and how much it would cost.” There is no doubt it would be a change, but here is the thing that people have to understand: The increase to the actual payments that people are making today would be minuscule. I look at this place and I look at the fact that this government promised in 2019, in the budget, $150 million to help out these women, largely. About 97% of survivors are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789974"> Some of these women are struggling financially every day. Since 2019, there has been money in the coffers put aside specifically to support these women that has not moved forward. The only thing the government paid for was some research done during COVID, but it was legitimate research and it was very clear that we need to make this right and help these women out, so here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789975"> Is there not a way for the government to figure out how to use that $150 million to get these women a little money and, while it is doing that, to figure out, on the other end, how much the government can start getting paid into this system to make sure that in the future, survivors are covered after 60? This is not rocket science. This is about accepting and understanding that specific people are struggling in our country because we have an unfair rule that was made in 1901 and we have never, ever fixed it. It is something the current government committed to doing. It was put in two different letters to the <Affiliation DbId="300029" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> that said to make it right and fix it, and then it disappeared.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8789976">Everywhere I go, I am surprised. A couple of years ago, I was in Campbell River at a fundraiser, talking to people, and this gentleman came up to me and said, “Thank you for fighting on the gold digger clause. I am that person. I am 61, I am dating, but I feel uncomfortable that if I actually find someone I want to marry, I am going to have to explain to them that there will not be anything for them.” That is startling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789977"> This summer, I went to New Brunswick, and when I was there, several people contacted me. They had heard me and knew I was coming, and they met with me just to talk specifically about this issue. I remember sitting at a restaurant when I was there and I met a lovely couple who were married. He was older than 60 when they got married, and she has a pension. If she goes first, he gets her pension, her survivor's benefits, but if he goes first, he cannot return the favour. I think that is shocking and very concerning. It does something that I think all of us should care about: It makes senior women poorer in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789978">We know for a fact that the poorest seniors in Canada are women, and here we see this cycle continue. We are penalizing women for their caregiving duties, not acknowledging them, not accepting the tremendous amount of support and free labour that they do, and we take away their survivor's benefit. It is absolutely shocking. I think of Elva in my riding. Her husband was a World War II veteran. She is my constituent and I appreciate her service to our country through loving her husband, and she needs that survivor's benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789979"> I also want to point out that the following organizations are in favour of eliminating the clause: the RCMP Veterans' Association, the Royal Canadian Legion, the National Association of Federal Retirees, the National Council of Veteran Associations and the Armed Forces Pensioners'/Annuitants' Association. These are important organizations that have all come behind it and said, “Yes, this is something we need to make right.” We need to stop punishing veterans and their loved ones for finding love later in life. We have to stop it. They deserve better. They served our country and we need to do better by them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789980">Again, if the government were to eliminate the clause, the additional cost to the pension fund would be less than a 2% change on an annual basis. I know that sometimes we really have to think about money, and I appreciate that. I come from a long line of people who were struggling financially, and I come from the non-profit sector. We did everything we could to spread everything as far as we could, and we really had to pinch our pennies and take care. I appreciate that, but I think there is a cost associated with this, and that cost is leaving women who care for the people who served our country in poverty and with the burden of financial insecurity. This does not address that issue. If we are a country that is about fairness, about respecting those who served us, then we have to make sure that a survivor's benefit is there, that veterans get the care they need and so do their loved ones. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789981">In conclusion, in Canada we should not be punishing veterans for finding love later in life. We should not be punishing them and we should not be punishing their whole families by not providing a survivor's benefit. </ParaText>

That was for everybody who is excluded after 60. It is a less than a 2% increase. I think it is the right thing to do.

              <ParaText id="8789989"> Madam Speaker, I do not think there is one specifically in this particular case, but I think it outlines one of the things that we have studied repeatedly in the House, which is the free labour of caregivers. If we look at that quantification, we see again and again largely women caring for people and how much work they do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789990"> I want to talk about what we heard repeatedly from veterans. I think of Bob and Sue, an RCMP veteran and his wife. He talked about that, saying that in the future he knew that she would be looking after him and how he felt crappy knowing that, when he was gone, she would not have any survivor's benefits to honour that labour. How do they ask for that? It is a really interesting idea of the difficulty this brings to a relationship, when veterans and their spouses have to talk about the fact that a veteran is asking their spouse to care for them and they will do their best to care for their spouse, but when the veteran is gone, they cannot leave them anything because of this law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789991"> We hope that the government, which talks about being a feminist government, does a very good analysis of how this is actually incredibly sexist, as 97% of whom it impacts are women.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8789992">Madam Speaker, what an extremely interesting exchange we are having. Since I am critic for the status of women, I have heard about this issue, this injustice. The question asked by the Conservative member who spoke previously is interesting. It reopens the debate on how unpaid labour can be better recognized. Caregivers who have to care for someone else when they retire is indeed one example of unpaid labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789993">Yesterday I attended a meeting of the Canadian Branch of the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie's Network of Women Parliamentarians. We discussed the fact that, unfortunately, women are still too often penalized in retirement. I will not even mention the debate on Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>. So many women have written to me saying that a 68-year-old woman cannot get the same pension as a 78-year-old woman. It makes no sense. My colleague supported Bill C‑319, and I hope that her party will continue to support the Bloc Québécois's bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8789994">This is all just common sense. The clause by which women are discriminated against after age 60 and are not entitled to the pension makes no sense.

One of the most memorable things I experienced was meeting with and marching with World War II veterans. We learn a lot in the different discussions we have with veterans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790007">Spouses of veterans play an absolutely critical role in providing the types of supports that go far beyond, I would suggest, in many ways, a more typical marriage. There is a profound impact on individuals who have been through war, whether World War II, the war in Afghanistan or other wars Canada has been engaged in over the years. War has a profound impact on soldiers who are returning, and family members often have to make significant sacrifices in order to cater to the needs of that returning soldier. I have a deep amount of respect for the family unit, and in particular the spouses of veterans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790008">Having said that, before I go into details on this, I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight why we are having this particular debate today and maybe express a bit of my frustration. As we are talking about veterans and the Canadian Forces, one of the government bills we introduced quite a while ago for debate would have had a very significant impact on our Canadian Forces and those who are serving today. We talk about survivor benefits and how this impacts women disproportionately by a long shot. The legislation we introduced would have taken issues related to sexual harassment and exploitation out of military courts and put them into civilian courts. That is one aspect of a number of pieces of legislation that the government has been trying to get through. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790023">Madam Speaker, I think it is important for people who might be following the debate to understand why we are debating this today. If the member were to look, the member would see that we get hundreds of reports brought in from standing committees and that there are detailed responses to all of the reports. When the member stands up and asks me to tell him something about the report, if the member would like, if he does not have access to the Internet, I would be more than happy to provide him with the government's response to each and every one of the recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790024">This is part of the issue. These concurrence reports typically mean that a standing committee has done wonderful work investigating a wide spectrum of issues, such as the issue we are talking about today. The reports then come back to the House for the House to concur in. There is already a detailed response. For example, I want to highlight recommendation number three because I think it cuts to the chase. This is after a great amount of discussion and debate in the committee. I am not too sure when this report was brought to the House, but I suspect it was quite a while ago. It is being used as a way to change the topic. However, instead of changing the topic, we should be dealing with government business and with private members' business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790025">I am trying to get the point across that we have witnessed, in the last nine weeks, borderline contempt of Parliament because we are not able to do the things we should be doing to serve all the people of Canada, including the people of Quebec, the people of Manitoba and people from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790026">The member asked a very good question. The member who introduced the concurrence report cited example after example of individuals, and we all know there are many people this is affecting. Equally, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are being ignored because we continue to allow the abuse of a matter of privilege, and we are not able to address the issues Canadians expect us to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790027">If I go to the specific response, for example, on recommendation number three, it says, “That the Government of Canada immediately adopt regulations to make the Optional Survivor Benefit (OSB) available to both common-law spouses and legally married spouses.” If we go through the responses, there are a number of recommendations. I highlighted this one because I thought it was quite interesting to read the response to the report. It states, “The Government of Canada agrees with this recommendation as work is currently underway to amend the regulations under all three of the Federal Pension Plans (CFSA, RCMPSA, PSSA)”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790028">I will stop there because that is the reason I asked the person moving the motion, in regard to talking about the military. I hear a lot of sympathy for the military. I can assure all members of the chamber that I am very sympathetic, being someone who served in the Canadian Forces, and someone who marched on Remembrance Day with World War II veterans and with others. I fully understand the important role that families play. I am very interested to see how this issue can be advanced and can be addressed. However, we should also take into consideration, at the same time, the RCMP. I suggest that the same principles we apply here would also apply to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790029"> I would argue that if we were to talk to federal civil servants in Canada, we would find a very keen interest in the federal civil service also being able to qualify. I was not a part of the committee when they were having these discussions. I do know that, like many other issues committees deal with, they would come back with a report, and typically, if we were in agreement in trying to move the issue forward, we would concur in it. If we were to debate every report, we would never be able to have a private member's hour and would never be able to have government legislation pass. That is why my comments at the beginning were more so regarding my concern about what is happening on the floor of the House of Commons today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790030">We can now write off this whole fall session as a direct result of that, but we are coming back in the spring. I am hoping that we will see parties, whether it is the Bloc or it is the NDP, recognize that we need to move forward because that is in the best interest of Canadians</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790031"> Let me continue on with that one recommendation because there is detail to it. It states, “The Government of Canada agrees with this recommendation as work is currently underway to amend the regulations under all three of the Federal Pension Plans...to make the Optional Survivor Benefit available to both common-law spouses and legally married spouses.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790032">I was standing up, hoping to get another question, because in some of the examples being raised by the New Democratic Party, she made reference to an individual who was not able to get married because of the pandemic. Common law, from my understanding, still would have applied. We need to ensure that, at the very least, we recognize that, because there is no doubt that it would not have been an issue for that couple in that situation. He was under 60. She did not make it perfectly clear, but it sounded as if they were potentially living as a common-law couple. That was worth noting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790033"> This is noted in the government's response:</ParaText>

This means that a portion of the retired members’ pension would be reallocated to fund their spouses’ “survivor benefit.” This option is only revocable upon the death of the spouse or divorce and as noted previously is currently not an option for common-law relationships.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8790053">Madam Speaker, one of the encouraging things that has been happening over the last eight or so months is that not only has inflation gone down but interest rates have also gone down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790054"> We have also been looking at the overall performance of the economy. We continue to look at ways in which we can invest in and support Canadians.

              <ParaText id="8790056">Madam Speaker, if I were to summarize the parliamentary secretary's speech, I would simply say that we should not be talking about this today. We should not be talking about the report that recommends that survivor's pensions should be available to people who married later in life. We should not be talking about this because, in his opinion, the report should have remained on the shelf. It was collecting dust, and that was perfect. The government was happy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790057">We should not be talking about the Conservatives' motion of privilege either. What we should be talking about are the government's priorities, but as it happens, this report deals with the government's priorities. It has been in the ministers' mandate letters since 2015, and it still has not been resolved. It has been almost 10 years, and the government is still twiddling its thumbs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790058">Meanwhile, there are people who will not get a survivor's pension when their spouse dies. Today, age 60 is far from old. Today at 60 people still have a life to live, and it is normal for situations to change.</ParaText>

The only thing he is wrong about is the fact that it is not the Liberal Party's priorities; it is Canadian priorities that we should be talking about. What we should be talking about is the type of legislation that is on the books. We should be talking about many of the private members' bills. There are all sorts of things that the House of Commons should actually not only be talking about but also taking action on. That means passing legislation and passing a fall economic statement.</ParaText>

The whole notion of “marriage after 60” should be stricken from all the rules around pensions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790078">I do say to my hon. colleague the parliamentary secretary that it is a bit much to say that some people will say the $150 million was not adequate. Not a single penny has moved toward the people who are disadvantaged by the gold digger clause that affects the widows and survivors of our veterans. It was a sham move by the former finance minister Bill Morneau to get out of doing what he promised to do, which was to remove the clause entirely.</ParaText>

Looking at my desk, I feel like I am having a yard sale. I forgot my own glasses at my condo, so I am using some from the lobby. They are women's glasses, so I hope I can carry them off. Maybe I could exchange with my colleague across the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790082">It is truly an honour and a privilege to stand here on behalf of the people of Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan. This is an important issue for our riding because, not only do we have two military bases, but we have a lot of veterans who live and reside within the riding. Before I go any further, I would like to say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation>. I am making sure that I am dotting my i's and crossing my t's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790083">I appreciate everything that has been shared today by my colleagues in the NDP and in the Liberal Party on this very important subject. One of the things that was brought up was priorities. I want to focus on that for veterans right now. I am one of those members who have served. I did not serve for very long, and I did not do anything that was heroic or dramatic. I think of those who have put in a lot of time, who have served overseas, and who have encountered, seen and witnessed things that we, as Canadians, have not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790084"> What they experience and what they bring back to this country is sometimes hard for them to understand, including the devastation that men can do to each other. They come back to this country and walk through grocery stores where things are aisled up. There is milk everywhere, and there are eggs and groceries in abundance. We live in a country of abundance, and that is what they are fighting for. However, they do not understand what they have witnessed in other countries, where people are fighting for scraps and where people are treating each other inhumanely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790085">That stress and that trauma manifests. One of the biggest challenges we deal with in veterans affairs is post-traumatic stress disorder. My cousin served in the PPCLI and was in the Medak Pocket, in Croatia. He came back and has faced those challenges. He shared with me what he has dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790086">We know that it is not just the person who is serving in the military who experiences that. They bring that home with them. They come home and their spouses do not understand why their husband or their wife has changed. They could not wait for their spouse to come home and to start their lives over again. They missed their spouse. The kids missed their parents. Things happened. They were not able to spend Christmas together. They want to make up time, but there is something missing in that person. There is brokenness. Sometimes marriages fall apart, and we understand that. People can move on. They rebuild their lives, and they go and get married again. Some get married when they over the age of 60, and this is what we are here to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790087"> We are here to talk about the meaning of this gold digger clause. It has to be said that this is, culturally, an old comment made over 100 years ago. We now live in a different culture. The Canadian Forces and Canada have evolved, and our engagements, where we have been deployed and what we stand for, have changed. This is one of the issues that was brought to the veterans affairs committee for us to study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790088">The committee has conducted many studies. For some of these, even with my own experience as being someone who has served, I have to say I was horrified. I was horrified to hear what some of our witnesses had experienced and gone through, but it is important to keep our eyes and ears focused on the times and on what we are experiencing. Time and time again, we are hearing about the challenges veterans are dealing with upon retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790089">The cost of living crisis is impacting veterans. More veterans are using food banks than ever before because of, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278451" Type="2">Battle River—Crowfoot</Affiliation> mentioned earlier, inflation. Inflation has impacted veterans, who are on fixed incomes. If they have remarried and their spouse is helping them out, as we talk about this gold digger clause, which I will get to, they are finding their dollar, their buying power, is not going far enough. It is not meeting the needs of today's grocery prices, and veterans are finding challenges. They are cutting corners. They are cutting meals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790090">I have heard heartbreaking stories of the spouses who have had to care for them. They have fallen in love. They love their partner and need to care for them. They made a commitment. They made an oath in front of the church, in front of their families, that they would stand by them through sickness and in health. Many of these veterans are dealing with issues related to the war, because of, for example, carrying backpacks, or they have physical or mental ailments. These spouses over the age of 60, who are there to care for them, are being left out. We understand that, so that is why it was so important for us to do this report. It was important for us to listen to the people who are caregivers now for those they love who have served. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790091">One of the challenges we have dealt with in this file is that, after hearing the heartbreaking stories, we are finding that this file has gone from pillar to post. We understand we just cannot change one pension act. There has to be a holistic and inclusive look at this. We understand that, but one of the challenges is whether this is a priority or not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790092">One of the disappointing things we recently heard about is that the <Affiliation DbId="300029" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> has had to take on another portfolio. One of the biggest concerns for the Conservative Party is whether there is enough focus being put on veterans, after all the horrific stories we have heard time and time again of neglect, of not being a priority for the Canadian government and of continually being put on the back burner. Is this department now being put on the back burner because the Minister of Veterans Affairs has another portfolio to look after? That is one of the questions the Conservative Party has. Is the government focusing on this file?</ParaText>

They closed district offices, forcing veterans, often with disabilities, to travel across provinces to try to get the services that were systematically being denied by the Harper regime. They denied disability benefits, and perhaps in one of the most cruel examples of disrespect by Conservatives of our nation's veterans, they denied 20,000 funerals for veterans. They were people who had laid their lives on the line for this country, and Conservatives treated them in the most disrespectful, dishonouring way possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790110">Before I get into the substance of my speech, let me first thank, on behalf of the people of Battle River—Crowfoot, and, because I represent a military base, camp Wainwright, the thousands of serving men and women who don our nation's uniform and do the hard work that is required to keep our nation safe. In spite of the challenges we face, these dedicated men and women are absolutely an incredible example of what it is to be the best of our country. Along with that, because of having a military base in Wainwright and the small towns and communities that surround it, there are many veterans whom I have the honour to represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790111"> As we go into the Christmas season, especially at a time when often emotions run high, and times can be difficult, whether because of economic circumstances or emotional circumstances for those who have faced loss, let me start by thanking the men and women who have served and who are currently serving our nation. All those veterans and servicemen and servicewomen are the best of what our country is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790112">We are here talking about an interesting subject, which reminds of the early months when I was first elected. I heard from a veteran, Tom, who shared a bit of his story with me. He reached out to my office before COVID, which seems like a long time ago. As a newly elected MP, I heard from Tom and he described a little bit about himself. He was a technician in the armed forces. He had served in a number of overseas deployments, had retired and was now doing contract work with DND. However, he had spent much of his life, as is the story of so many who have served our country, travelling and did not call any one place home for very long. He had just settled down in a small town in rural Alberta, which is, of course, the greatest place on the planet. After getting settled there, he bought his first house, which he was very proud of. He then found love and got married, but much to his surprise when wanting to make sure that his wife was taken care of, while updating the pension documents and associated paperwork, he learned about this clause that would eliminate the ability of his spouse to be entitled to his pension. If memory serves correctly, he was just over the age of 60, and so had just fallen out of the qualification range. He was now having to make difficult decisions in terms of long-term planning for his family, because of the implications of this clause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790113"> I remember very specifically the grace with which his request was made, as Tom explained that he wanted to see that this was fixed so that others did not have to go through what he went through. I would highlight that while this was part of the mandate of, I believe, two or three consecutive ministers of Veterans Affairs, there were some proposed changes, which were clarifying changes that did not actually fix the substance of the issue, but clarified some of the rules around marriage versus common-law in the superannuation acts affected. However, this is still a concern that many veterans have to face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790114">We deal with this on other public policy issues, such as CPP, OAS and other seniors' benefits. At the time when many of these things were brought into effect, the average life expectancy of Canadians was significantly lower than it is today. As a result, the calculations associated with these programs were based on a life expectancy that was generally much lower. Thankfully, because of advancements in health and whatnot, we see that the average life expectancy now of men and women in Canada is pushing 80, and I believe for women it is a little above 80, which is good news for Canadians, but it has also changed the way that many of these things are calculated. The context in which that happens has in fact changed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790115">In 1901, this policy was brought forward. Circumstances were very different in terms of what an average Canadian family life would look like. We couple all of those things together and now we have individuals who are simply falling through the cracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790116">Let me highlight how important it is that we honour and respect our veterans because they are putting their lives on hold. It is not that they get into the military. I do not know that I have ever heard of a military serviceman or servicewoman who gets into the military because they want to serve for the pay. They get into it because they want to serve our country; they want to do what is best for our country. I am proud to serve in a caucus with a number of veterans, and get to hear their perspectives, including the member for <Affiliation DbId="278182" Type="2">Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan</Affiliation>, who spent some time in military service. I think he does not boast enough about his time with the Snowbirds, the pride of the Air Force. Those incredible men and women put their lives on hold and not for financial gain. There is a sacred obligation that the government has to ensure that they are taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790117">When it comes to what is really a technical issue of ensuring that family members are able to have peace and security, as life can be unpredictable, we need to ensure what should be predictable at a time when men and women face circumstances that so often are, by nature of their service, unpredictable, and the consequences that go along with that. I know about that very well from some of the things that happened in my own life last fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790118"> I would just highlight that this is, I believe, incumbent upon all of us. Camrose is the only city that I represent, a small city, about 18,000 people, where my main constituency office is. I remember John, who lives in Camrose. He was a veteran who was very outspoken and very stereotypical in terms of the demeanour we would expect from a military man. He had very strong opinions and was not afraid to share them with me. I knocked on his door in the 2019 election, again in the 2021 election, and we had great conversations. He pointed out to me, which I am highlighting again today in the House of Commons, the irony that an MP qualifies for a pension after six years, but that is certainly not what is afforded to our veterans, although they have put their lives on the line for our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790119">I think that highlights how quite often there is a disconnect in the way we approach thinking about what public service is. We must do everything we can to ensure that our men and women who put their lives on the line are, in fact, given dignity and respect. It highlights how difficult it is for all Canadians, specifically those who are on fixed incomes, like those who are pensioners, and the fact that someone may have a pension that may increase by 2% or 3%, sometimes less, sometimes, if someone is fortunate, a little bit more than that, but yet their costs are significantly more than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790120"> I asked the parliamentary secretary earlier if he could explain to Canadians how celebrating the rate of inflation coming down does not actually mean cost savings. It is important to highlight that and just highlight another important aspect here, which is the help that veterans need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790121">I want to give a shout-out. During the first week of September, I had a great conversation with members of the Worthington branch of the Royal Canadian Legion in Wainwright, Alberta. That is home to camp Wainwright, one of the army's training facilities. I am very proud to represent that. I had a great conversation with the president of the legion and other representatives, including some veterans, who shared practical steps that the government could take and, in some cases, not even steps that would cost much in terms of the dollar amount, but just to help make sure that barriers are removed and that veterans are respected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790122">Something interesting came up which I will put on the record here, just as I wrap up my speech. We need to make sure that, when a veteran calls for help, it is a veteran who answers the phone. That seems to me like common sense. Sometimes when a veteran is facing a difficult circumstance, making sure they have somebody who answers the phone who is in fact a veteran would give them the calming security they need and help to ensure they get the response that they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790123">When it comes to the important issue of this particular clause and the larger issues surrounding veterans, I am glad to have had the chance to intervene today.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8790139">Madam Speaker, we are debating the ninth report of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs entitled “Survivor Retirement Pension Benefits (Marriage After 60)”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790140">This is a complex issue. In October and November 2022, the committee met three times for a total of six hours and heard 19 witnesses. I am going to dive right back in there. I learned only an hour ago that I was supposed to speak about this. I will do my best, but I repeat that it is a complex issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790141">We cannot say that it is all the government's fault, but we also cannot say that it is all the veterans' fault. Still, there is work to be done. To set the stage and understand the issues at stake, I would like to start by presenting six factors as something of an appetizer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790142">Most pension plans, regardless of whether they are public or private, contain clauses that guarantee benefits for the beneficiary's surviving spouse or children should the beneficiary die. That is standard practice. The terms of these clauses can vary greatly, but they almost always involve a clear distinction between the individual who was still paying into the plan at the time of their death and the beneficiary who may be entitled to benefits. Let us start with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790143">There is another very important factor. If the individual was retired at the time of death and was already receiving pension benefits, most pension plans will consider their spouse eligible for a survivor's benefit if, and only if, they were already the beneficiary's spouse before the beneficiary retired. That is the crux of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790144">In other words, if a beneficiary enters a new relationship, a new union, after having started receiving pension benefits, the beneficiary's spouse is not eligible for a survivor's benefit if the beneficiary dies. That is the long and short of it. We at the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs inherited this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790145">In the case of Canadian Armed Forces retirees, spouses are also excluded from the survivor benefit if they began their relationship after the member began drawing pension benefits. However, there is an exclusion clause in the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act that does not apply when the member begins drawing benefits, but instead when they turn 60.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790146">Sixty is the mandatory age of retirement in the CAF. In other words, if a military member begins receiving pension benefits at 55, the exclusion clause does not apply immediately. If the retiree marries or remarries before reaching 60 years of age, the retiree's spouse would be eligible for survivor benefits. This is the important part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790147">The act contains a clause entitled “Marriage after sixty years of age”. Apparently, this is a common occurrence. I cannot wait until I am 60 so I can get married again. Oh wait, I forgot, I have never been married. The “marriage after 60” clause, named after the title of subsection 31(1) of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, has been frequently criticized in recent years. In the 1990s, the courts ruled that this “marriage after 60” clause was not discriminatory.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790148">That is a problem too, and it may raise some issues. The courts ruled “that the clause was not discriminatory, or if it was, the resulting exclusion was based on reasonable grounds.” That is the context.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">To better support veterans who married over the age of 60 and their spouses, Budget 2019 announces a new Veterans Survivors Fund committing $150 million over 5 years starting in 2019–20 to Veterans Affairs Canada. With these funds, the Government will work with the community to identify impacted survivors, process their claims and ensure survivors have the [adequate] financial support they need.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790153">With all that said, we can see that there are some huge challenges, such as gender equity, equity between veterans and the general public, and equity between benefit plans. Another challenge concerns the fact that 80% of veterans or military personnel who leave the forces are men, and 20% are women. Obviously, this has huge financial implications. If 80% of veterans or military personnel who leave the forces are men, it means that 80% of the spouses of these veterans or military personnel are women who may not inherit or receive an adequate pension. The amounts involved are huge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790154">The transfer in question is not easy. This is not how things usually work in the public service, which is relatively gender equal. Obviously, this issue is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790155">What impact does this have? If the military pension plan were to be harmonized with the public service pension plan, the financial impact would be enormous. A brief assessment from two or three years ago mentioned the figure of $1 billion. This means it would cost $1 billion just to put the plans on an equal footing. In fact, it would have an even greater impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790156">If the government were to do that, which we all want it to do because we want everyone to be treated properly, it would also have to renegotiate the collective agreements for 400,000 public servants. We cannot use legislation to equalize, adjust or change plans without anticipating that other public servants might react. They are going to put their hand up and say that they, too, deserve it. A few things will then need to be reviewed and adjusted.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790157">Clearly there is quite a confrontation or discussion ahead for the government and the unions. Despite the fact that it was in the mandate letters, the government then considered the possibility of injecting the tidy sum of $150 million over three years to try to compensate. It did it. It provided the money. The problem is how that money is used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790158">This brings me to the first recommendation of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790159">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence work with the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Public Safety to issue a declaration that gives a definitive answer to which department is responsible for survivor pension benefits of Veterans.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790160">As always, when the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs submits recommendations, we receive responses from the government that are practically always favourable. The Government of Canada agrees with this recommendation. Generally, it is the implementation of these recommendations that creates little problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790161">This leads me to another recommendation that the committee made:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790162">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the Government of Canada immediately table a document explaining in detail the reasons for creating and maintaining clauses denying survivors' pensions when the relationship began after the pensioner reached age 60....</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790163">Two years later, we are still waiting for an answer, a follow-up or potential solutions. In its usual gracious manner, the government responded to the committee's recommendation by saying that it agreed and by explaining the reasons for these provisions. It spent a whole page explaining why it agrees. The problem is not whether it agrees or not. If a solution is being considered, we just want to see it put in place as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790164">The following recommendation is also very interesting:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790165">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the Department of National Defence and the Department of Public Safety take vigorous action to ensure that members of the Canadian Armed Forces and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have all the necessary information about their pension plan, and have access to financial advice to make the most informed financial decisions before they retire.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790166">I really like the word “vigorous” in this recommendation. I mention this recommendation because it implies that the retiring member should be advised by someone. There are people in the government who are capable of advising the member. That is not a problem. However, this involves a level of financial planning that mere mortals and military members may not be used to doing. They were deployed, and usually there were people at home who took care of their affairs. They were off doing their job. Significant planning needs to be done. The department is essentially saying that military members should think about putting money aside while they are still serving in combat roles or elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790167">Earlier I was talking about the $150 million that the government injected. In theory, that is great. However, when the military member leaves the Canadian Armed Forces, they may not be in the best mental state to ask for help. Many of them end up with post-traumatic stress. Returning to civilian life is not easy. When a person has worn the uniform for 10, 15 or 20 years and has to get dressed the morning after leaving the Canadian Armed Forces, they do not know what to put on. They do not know how to dress themselves. They do not know how to function outside of this society that was regulated to the nth degree. It sounds silly, but that is how it is.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790168">Nevertheless, they are being asked to do that before they leave the armed forces. They are being asked to come up with a financial plan. If not, there is the $150 million provided by the government. That is great. The services are there. That is not the problem with Veterans Affairs Canada. The problem is accessing them. The veterans must not have it done for them. Rather, they must be referred to the appropriate resources, in this case the necessary financial resources, that could make up for it, because this $150 million could be used to enhance or adjust the spouse's pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790169">Now we are getting into the technical details. I taught plenty of university courses in more than one faculty for 10 or 11 years, and I am pretty good with money matters. However, when we had to look closely at this report, at the implications and the figures, it was a complex affair. When we got to the $150 million and saw that they had access to it, I wondered how I would have reacted. Where would I have gone for help? There is a door I have to knock on, but what do I ask for? That is evidently still a problem for our veterans. The fact that they do not find it easy to ask for help needs to be taken into account. A veteran is a hero, someone who fought for their country, someone who theoretically does not necessarily need help. It is someone who thinks and says they are independent. Just asking for help, in a case like the one we are looking at today, does not come easily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790170">In addition to all the inherent problems, we have a Liberal government with two departments, the Department of National Defence and Veterans Affairs Canada, that do not talk to each other, that operate in a vacuum. When a military member leaves the military and becomes a veteran, they cross over into another silo, another zone. The fact that the two departments do not communicate obviously creates problems, including those in the case we are discussing today, the survivor's pension.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790171">As I said earlier, yes, they can get help. There are 32 Canadian Armed Forces transition centres. When a member leaves the armed forces, they are entitled to a few hours of training to prepare them for what comes next. Once again, however, they may not be in the best mindset to be making decisions, to be listening, to be seeking help. However, there are people there. There are 32 centres that are there to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790172">In conclusion, I would just like to tie this issue in with the Bloc Québécois's request to increase the pensions of seniors between the ages of 65 and 74. Most, if not all, of the people involved in the case we are discussing today fall squarely in that camp. The Bloc Québécois wants a 10% increase because we calculate, based on the figures we have, that this segment of the population needs more financial assistance than anyone else. That is our position, and the government is aware of it. The connection I am making is that we are talking about survivors, pensions at age 60, and so on. Once again, it is seniors who are bearing the brunt of the failures in our system. It is always easy for the Liberal government to target people in this age group, because they probably are not going to take to the streets with signs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790184">Madam Speaker, I think that today we all agree on the wording of the motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790185">It must be said that the federal government has not always treated veterans with respect. I am mostly talking about the Harper years, when the Conservatives ran roughshod over all services for veterans. They even denied them the right to have their disability recognized. They denied 20,000 veterans a funeral. It was appalling. So far, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has never apologized for how shamefully veterans were treated for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790186">Does my colleague agree that the Conservatives owe a heartfelt apology to all the veterans they mistreated during the years of the Harper regime?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790187">Otherwise, what should Canadians take away from their refusal to apologize to veterans?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790188">Madam Speaker, I see that my colleague wants to take this in a more political direction. Some might say that is why we are here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790189">Yes, the Conservative Party can certainly be criticized for some things, including the cuts it made, but it also did some positive things. Personally, I am more interested in finding solutions. Anyone can hit others when they are already down. They can hit, ask and demand, but I prefer to compromise and come up with solutions that work for everybody. Talking about parties and cuts and all that is not the solution. The solution is about human beings. People are at the heart of this issue. We must ask ourselves how we can respond appropriately, no matter which party is in power. With our parties, our platforms and our agendas, we all have our own way of responding to these issues. Again, as I said in my previous answer, I think we have to remember the human aspect. Veterans Affairs is one of the few departments that deal with human beings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790190">People should be at the heart of everything, and we should take much better care of them than we do, regardless of the party in power.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790191"> Madam Speaker, I have two quick questions and a brief commentary. First off, during the study, did the committee look at the fact that the prescribed age of retirement of 60 is really no longer relevant? Just recently, at Remembrance Day, I met two serving members in my own neck of the woods. One just completed basic training at 54. Another one is serving at 58 and still continues to serve and is able to serve past 60, because the military is doing that now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790192">Secondly, the member talked about post-traumatic stress, its impact and how it does not necessarily happen right away. It can happen decades later. The fact of the matter is that, within the military, the rate of divorce unfortunately is a lot higher than even in civil society. That is an impact that this specific clause and issue faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790193">As for my brief commentary, as someone who is only 50, who did serve and who may be lucky enough to find that special someone after 60, it really scares me, to some extent, to think that this future loved one may be left in the dust if we do not fix this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790194">I would just like the member's feedback on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790195">Madam Speaker, I absolutely love the member who just asked me a question. I had the opportunity to serve with him on a memorable mission. I was afraid of him before the mission, but he has since become a friend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790196">His first question is about the 60-year age limit, and it is a good one. People can join the army at 17 or 18. They might stay in for 10 years or they might have a very long career. I understand that we have to pick a number and set a limit, because there has to be a starting point and an end point. Right now, the age limit is 60. Yes, that is something the committee considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790197">Honestly, I do not know what the ideal solution is. This whole issue involves very serious actuarial data. People can enlist in the army when they are young or when they are older. Age 60 is the limit. Personally, I do not think that is all that great. We might change that when I am the minister. Just kidding. Age is indeed a challenge in this file.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790198">As far as PTSD is concerned, my colleague is absolutely right. I do not think many military personnel leave the forces and are diagnosed with PTSD right away. It can happen five, 10, 15 or 20 years later. I have a good friend in my riding who served in Afghanistan, but it was only about two years ago that things really started falling apart for him and he was diagnosed. If there had been adequate follow-up and support when he left the armed forces, he might not be suffering from PTSD today, as such a high percentage of military personnel are. As I said, early support and prevention are key.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8790199"> Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time today with the incredible member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790200">I am quite honoured to be able to stand and speak to this debate today. I am very grateful to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation> for bringing this forward to the floor of the House of Commons. I have been listening to today's debate very carefully. It is something that all parties clearly feel there needs to be action on. We have seen, of course, that action has not been taken by the current administration or the administration prior. There is a clear indication that this piece of our legislation is deeply wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790201">I am a proud advocate for the well-being of Canadians and a strong supporter of our veterans. I am here today to talk about the provision within veterans' pensions that some call the gold digger clause. I am deeply grateful that we have the opportunity to have this debate, because what has been happening for far too long is that this piece of policy, this piece of how we deal with veterans, is cruel. It is unjust, and for too many veterans and too many veterans' families, it means financial insecurity, unfair restrictions and unnecessary hardship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790202">To give a bit of a sense of what the gold digger clause is, in Canada, this refers to the rule that denies spousal benefits to any surviving spouse who marries a veteran after the veteran turns 60. This provision applies to all veterans, but it is extraordinarily discriminatory. It assumes that there is an ulterior motive for marriage, that those marriages are not based on love or partnership and that they are not genuine marriages. This is an absolutely appalling thing to say to our veterans. It punishes honest, committed relationships. It disregards the rights and dignity of both veterans and their partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790203">Obviously, this is very misogynistic as well, when we consider that this has a disproportionate impact on the group of seniors who are women. These seniors are already among the most vulnerable and discriminated against, those who will already find life more unaffordable. This is one more way we are making lives more difficult for women seniors. This is appalling, and it needs to be fixed as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790204">This discriminatory and outdated policy has real and harmful impacts. Many veterans remarry later in life. We have heard about that from many of our colleagues today in the House. They are seeking love and companionship after years of service, but their spouses are denied that financial support simply because of an outdated and old rule. It is not about protecting pensions from exploitation; it is about denying help to families who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790205">The reality is that many of these spouses dedicate their lives to caring for veterans. Often making personal sacrifices along the way, they act as caregivers, as advocates and as companions. When the veteran passes away, the surviving spouse is left without the pension benefits they need to maintain their livelihood. This is obviously a situation that is unjust and needs to be avoided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790206">I want to tell a personal story. My grandfather was a veteran. His name was Albert, or Bert, McCoy. He was a gunner in the Second World War. I have told this story in the House before. He was shot down over Belgium. He lived in the underground for two years. It took two years for him to come back to my mother and to my grandmother. Sadly, my grandmother passed away, and my grandfather remarried Dorothy later in life. At the end of his life, my grandfather had dementia. He had a number of health issues. He was in his late eighties when he passed away. Dorothy cared for him and provided the love, companionship and care my grandfather deserved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790207">When I think of the legislation, I do not just think about random policies we need to fix. I think about my grandfather. At the end of his days, as he was suffering from dementia, as he was reliving those moments that he had spent during the war, it was Dorothy who cared for him. She made sure he was loved, and he was given that companionship. To say that any veteran's partner who cared for them does not deserve those benefits, does not deserve to be supported, is really something we should all be deeply ashamed of.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790208">Canadian veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country. They have served in peacekeeping missions, defended our values abroad and responded to domestic crises. They are Canadian workers. They deserve the utmost respect. Of all workers, they are the ones who have sacrificed the most for this country, for us; however, the gold digger clause sends the message that we do not trust their personal decisions, do not value their loved ones and do not value their families. This is not the Canada I know. Canadians believe in fairness, in dignity and in compassion. We understand the importance of standing with those who have supported us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790209">Therefore, we need to look at the report we are discussing today. We need to look at what needs to be changed to deal with this outdated and discriminatory rule and to stop this. We need to modernize the policy so that it supports veterans and their loved ones rather than penalizing them. In this report, we have nine recommendations that were brought forward; the government could act on them right now. In fact, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation> brought forward two additional recommendations, which I would encourage the government to follow. I am just going to read these two: “That the Government of Canada eliminate the ‘marriage after 60’ clause from all pension legislation, immediately” and “That Veterans Affairs Canada distribute the Veterans Survivors Fund to the identified survivors, immediately.” It says “immediately”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790210">We have heard in the House today from many people that this is something that has been going on for far too long; this is something that has not been fixed by the current Liberal government and was not fixed by the Conservative government before it. This is an opportunity for the current Parliament to do the right thing and to actually adopt these recommendations, including the two recommendations from the New Democratic Party, and fix this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790211"> In closing, I will just say that our veterans and their families have given so much to our country. They have earned more than just our thanks. They have earned policies that support them through every stage of their life. The gold digger clause does not align with Canadian values, and it is time we changed it. Let us work together to build a system that truly supports our veterans and their families, a system that is based on fairness, justice, compassion and respect.</ParaText>

I certainly would not hope that we are making decisions as a tit-for-tat scenario. I do not think that is what the member meant, but we need to look at the very basic principles of what is just, what is fair and what shows respect for our veterans. What we have right now does not do so, and we should fix that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790216"> Mr. Speaker, I will note that, in the committee's report, many of the recommendations were vague. I would classify the government's response to it as more vague. There is a clause that dates back to early military history when, in fact, perhaps there was some abuse; however, any society evolves, as ours has here in Canada. I believe that there is a fundamental right of people who marry military members to be granted this type of coverage as a result not only of the member's service but also of the caregiving. I think the member agrees with that, but that was my comment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790217">Mr. Speaker, as my colleague correctly says, this is a watered-down report. That is why the New Democrats put two much stronger recommendations in the supplementary report that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation> brought forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790218">This could and should stop immediately; there is that possibility, and the government has the ability to do that. I cannot help but note that the member, as a member of the Conservative Party, also had that opportunity. Instead, the Conservatives cut supports for veterans. That becomes a bit of a problem when we have the government of the day failing to take the steps necessary to fix the legislation and when previous governments, when they had that opportunity, also failed to take those steps.</ParaText>

I think there is consensus on the fact that veterans must get their due. It makes no sense that still today, and after decades, veterans' pensions are not paid to their spouses under the pretext that they marry latter in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790230">An NDP government will not hesitate to rectify that immediately. One of our priorities when we form government will certainly be to resolve this issue.

The Royal Westminster Regiment is based in New Westminster and the armoury is often the site where we pay respect to our nation's veterans. Legion branch 83 in Burnaby and Legion branch 2 in New Westminster are both organizations that provide remarkable service to the community but are also focal points for respecting our nation's veterans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790235">There is this gold digger clause, even though Parliament passed a motion in 2006, as the Harper Conservative government was just coming into power; the Harper government refused to implement it and did much worse things. I will come back to that in just a moment. Subsequent to that, we had a new government, a Liberal government, and it does the same thing. It ignores the needs of veterans and discriminates against the spouses of veterans. To our mind, in the NDP corner of the House, we believe it is simply profoundly disrespectful to our nation's veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790236"> This is something that should be done today. It could be done today, yet the government has delayed for nine years. The previous government delayed for nine years. It shows a remarkable and profound disrespect for our nation's veterans. This can be done, and as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">North Island—Powell River</Affiliation> pointed out, these are real people who are impacted. She mentioned, in a supplementary opinion to the report we are debating today, the case of Walt and Norma Pinsent. She mentioned as well the case of Corporal Kevin Sewell and his spouse, Tracy Evanshen, and what it means, in terms of their lives, that the pensions are denied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790237">Despite their finding love later in life, there is profound discrimination by the federal government toward veterans who have put their lives on the line for their country, some coming back with severe disabilities or a whole range of challenges. Coming from a family whose family members went overseas, I can tell members about the kind of impact being in service can entail. It is profoundly sad to me that we are not immediately moving to honour our nation's veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790238"> A number of Conservatives have stood up today, and I want to come back to the Conservative record on veterans. The Liberals have been restoring some of the damage that was committed during the Harper regime, but I was here in the House. As so many veterans have indicated, because of the discrimination by the Harper regime, the former Conservative government has lost any moral authority forever with respect to the stewardship of our nation's veterans. The Conservatives should never, ever again, in the history of our country, be put in charge of Veterans Affairs because what they did was absolutely reprehensible. It is unbelievable to me how that party pretends, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> often does, and pays lip service to honouring our nation's veterans. What they did was profoundly despicable, was disrespectful and should never be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790239"> I want to take a few minutes to go through the litany of the tragic and horrible things the Harper Conservatives did. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has never apologized for a single one of these things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790240">It was not just slashing services at Veterans Affairs, cutting about a quarter of the services and staff available to veterans. The Harper Conservatives often forced veterans to travel for days across provinces as they closed offices across the country. In the interior of British Columbia, northern Ontario and western Newfoundland, veterans services were no longer available. It was absolutely reprehensible that they would do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790241"> They denied funerals. The scale is unbelievable: 20,000 applications for veterans' funerals and burials were rejected under the Harper Conservatives. The reality is that if we, as a country, cannot pay tribute to our nation's veterans at the time of their passing, then how can any member of Parliament stand in the House and say they respect our nation's veterans? This is what the Conservatives did systematically, not over one, two, three or four years, but for more than half a decade. They systematically denied tens of thousands of proper burials and funerals for our nation's veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790242"> Not a single Conservative has ever stood in the House to say they were sorry or to apologize to our veterans for the profound disrespect they showed in clawing back a billion dollars, denying services, slashing staff, closing offices and denying the legitimate disability claims that came in from our nation's veterans. Time after time, the Harper Conservatives denied those fundamental benefits. The most disrespectful period of time in our nation's history toward our nation's veterans was under the Harper Conservatives, yet since that abysmal period, not a single Conservative MP has ever apologized for it. The Conservatives have never said they were wrong, that they should not have denied funerals and disability claims, slashed offices and clawed back a billion dollars from veterans who needed those services desperately and given it to billionaires. Not a single Conservative has apologized. I hope they stand in the House today and solemnly apologize to our nation's veterans for all of the devastation they have wreaked upon veterans over those terrible years.</ParaText>

We are not talking about 18 years ago, 15 years ago or even 10 years ago, during the Harper regime, which was the worst period for veterans in Canadian history.

              <ParaText id="8790256">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak about the veterans affairs committee report that is before us. The reality is that the <Affiliation DbId="300029" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> has great power, and literally with one fell swoop of a pen she could make this happen if she wanted to. The situation has been going on far too long. The committee report, as I said, was somewhat vague in its recommendations. There was not unanimous support, because there was a dissenting report by the NDP that called for the change to happen as soon as possible; however, I think there was agreement. A lot of witnesses came forward and spoke to this particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790257">In October 2016 I was given the honour by then leader Rona Ambrose to be the critic for veterans affairs. Admittedly, it was a very difficult time, after the 2015 election, to be the critic for veterans affairs. I had a tremendous amount of advice given to me by the former Conservative minister of veterans affairs, Erin O'Toole, on what I needed to do as the new critic at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790258">I immediately embarked on a cross-Canada tour to meet with veterans, their families, stakeholders and advocates. I was very grateful to do that with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278361" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation>, with whom I will be splitting my time. She is a great advocate for veterans and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790259">As I went across the country, obviously coming out of the 2015 election, as difficult as that period was, there were a lot of questions posed to me. I did not back away from any of them at all; I faced them head on. I talked to veterans and their families right across the country and explained to them the challenges that had come out of and in advance of the 2015 election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790260">Many of the people I spoke to were grateful for the types of programs the former Conservative government had put in, but there were some issues. I faced those issues head-on. The one thing that veterans appreciate more than anything else is telling them the truth. Face their questions head on, admit when mistakes were made and do not necessarily take credit for everything; show some humility. Those are some of the things I tried to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790261">I have listened to much of the debate this morning, and the blame game is being used in this place. I will say that this is a very toxic place right now; everybody is looking for political positioning. The NDP and the Liberals are 20 to 25 points behind in the polls, so they are looking to attack the Conservatives in any way they can. That is part of it, and I get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790262">However, when it comes to veterans and their families, there should be no attacks or partisan games. Veterans and their families can smell it from a mile away. They know when they are being used as political pawns by political parties, and in much of the debate I have heard today, that is happening. Frankly, veterans and their families do not give a flying you-know-what about what people say; it is what they do that matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790263">There were difficult times; I admit that now as I did when I was critic for veterans affairs, but the one thing I was with veterans was honest. If there was something that we could do, we did it; if there was something that we could not do, I would tell them why. It was in that spirit that in 2017, after travelling the country and talking to veterans, their families, stakeholders and others, I proposed my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="9165503" Type="4">C-378</Document>, which would have established a military covenant, an obligation between the Crown and our veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790264">I used the example of Great Britain at the time because it was the only Commonwealth country, and the only country in the world in fact, that had established a military covenant. The covenant would have been based on respect and would have obligated not just the government of the day but also governments of the future to prioritize the needs of veterans and their families.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790265">There were many cases I heard about where benefits were not being applied in a fair amount of time, so I was hoping that, by establishing that obligation on the minister, on the government and on future governments, including our government, veterans would have been respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790266">The bill dealt with three basic principles; the minister would have to have taken into account, in every act that they undertook, the three principles. The first is that veterans, as well as their families, survivors in the context of what we are talking about today in the so-called gold digger clause, would have been taken into account and been treated with dignity, respect and fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790267">The second principle is that veterans and their duties are unique among Canadians, which I think we can all recognize. There is an obligation to care for veterans because of the sacrifices made by them, and that obligation extends as well to the experience of their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790268">The third core principle in the military covenant that I looked to establish through a private member's bill was that the care, treatment and transition of Canadian Armed Forces in and to civilian life would be dealt with in a timely manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790269"> I have sat on committees and I have been through many Veterans Affairs reports, including the ones involving transition. I think the number, and maybe the member for <Affiliation DbId="278361" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation> can correct me, is that there have been about 13 or 14 reports on military members' transitioning into civilian life, but many of the problems are still a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790270">Oftentimes at committees, when witnesses some and make recommendations to the government, the government responds but the reality is that, in many circumstances, nothing gets done. We wonder why veterans and their families are frustrated when consecutive governments do not fulfill their obligation to those veterans. Unfortunately my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="9165503" Type="4">C-378</Document>, which would have established the military covenant, was defeated in 2017. I was extremely disappointed by the fact that we were not able to fulfill that obligation to veterans and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790271">I will remind members again that service extends beyond the battlefield; it is not just about the men and women who are on the front lines protecting our nation, defending peace and security around the world and the rule of law, human rights and human dignities. The service of the families back home, who worry and who are there to support their family while their military member is deployed, in my opinion, is equal to or greater than the member's service and sacrifice itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790272">With respect to the clause in question, the report suggested that there were roughly 9,000 people who would be affected by it. It is interesting, because there was a PBO report in 2022 that showed five-year costs would be over $1.3 billion over those five years. The Canada pension plan 2019-2020 annual report indicated that the removal of the clause would be less than a 2% change, or less than $1 billion on an annual basis, of $38.9 billion in payouts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790273">Let us put that in context in terms of what this nation is spending as far as foreign aid is concerned. Veterans and their families are not unlike anybody else; they see the amount of money that is going towards supporting other nations. They see the amount of waste. They see the amount of money, for example, in the SDTC scandal of $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790274">They are able to calculate all the numbers and figure it out, and they ask, “Why are we not looking after ourselves? Why are we not looking after, as a matter of priority, our veterans and their families?” when they see announcements of billions and billions of dollars going towards what they would consider, because they have told me this, ideological pet projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790275">I believe it is incumbent upon us to look after our veterans, not just by the words that we say but also by the actions that we take. Bill <Document DbId="9165503" Type="4">C-378</Document> would have established the military covenant and provided respect and dignity to our veterans. I stand by everything I have done as veterans affairs critic, and I will stand by veterans now and forever.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790287">It is important to understand that, in 1930, a man's life expectancy was 60 years. In 1945, a man's life expectancy was 65 years. Maybe it makes sense that, back then, getting remarried at the end of one's life might raise the government's suspicions, hence not wanting to allow pension transfers under those circumstances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790288">Today, a man's average life expectancy is around 80 years. Now, 2024 is not 1930, nor is it 1945.

              <ParaText id="8790291"> Mr. Speaker, it means a great deal to me to be able to stand in this place today and speak to the issues that are impacting our veterans and, specifically, this one issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790292">As the previous speaker mentioned, I had the privilege of being the deputy shadow minister for Veterans Affairs when I first came in as a brand-new member of Parliament, and I was able to travel with my colleague across Canada to ensure that we were really learning and hearing what veterans and what Canadian Armed Forces members had to say. That was in 2015, following 10 years of the previous Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790293">I remember being told a great deal about new veterans. They are new veterans, not modern-day veterans, as they hate being called that. The next generation of veterans was very upset with the fact that they came back from Afghanistan to a whole new set of rules around care for them with the new veterans charter, which was created just before the Liberal government fell and was adopted by the entire House without the proper oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790294">Since then, it has been a challenge for veterans to appreciate what the new veterans charter did, and now it has been changed more and more. Conservatives say, if we are going to spend a dollar, we have to take a dollar from somewhere else, but this is just a pile-on of one program after another. It is very confusing for our veterans, and they deserve better than they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790295">I can say, as my colleague did, there are things here that need to be put right. I have been on the veterans affairs committee for a decade now. I am into my 10th year. My colleague was absolutely right. We have studied transitioning to death and given recommendations. Witnesses have come and talked about what needs to be done to make this means of taking care of our veterans smooth, transparent and fast, but nothing has changed. If anything, things have gotten more difficult. It shows partially the inability of the National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces to work with Veterans Affairs through a seamless transition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790296"> In the government's response to this very issue, it says that the Government of Canada agrees with most of these recommendations. However, it then goes on to explain that:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790298">Then it says the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> is responsible for the RCMP part, and here is what it says about the <Affiliation DbId="300029" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>: “The Minister of Veterans Affairs has no authority over any superannuation acts.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790299">The minister has no authority, even though the government made a big to-do about making this a seamless transition and that the departments were going to work well together. The government made the Minister of Veterans Affairs the Associate Minister of National Defence, yet, somehow still, nothing seems to be able to be done to solve a lot of these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790300">I can appreciate the fact that, as the member from the Bloc said, this reflects something from, my goodness, decades ago, when the average age of a man, in general, was 60. Today, I am way past that age. I can tell colleagues that 68 is the new 50, just saying. The truth of the matter is that we are functioning in an archaic environment and not taking care of our veterans the way we should be. As a matter of fact, there is proof of that in the way that veterans are feeling about how they are being cared for.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790301">I have the supplementary estimates that we discussed and spoke with the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> about just recently. This is really important. The government asked for an additional $942.5 million in the supplementary estimates. That is a lot of money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790302">The bulk of the requested appropriations, the Liberals said, was for pain and suffering compensation applications. It represents an increase of 51.6% compared to what was in the main estimates, so it is a huge jump in funding for pain and suffering. The explanation was that the additional funding is needed to respond to an increase in the number of benefit applications, which includes the pain and suffering, but also higher than expected numbers of veterans who are opting for a lump sum instead of monthly payments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790303"> Huge numbers of veterans are saying, “I'm leaving. I'm getting my pain and suffering. I want it all and I want it now.” They no longer have confidence because of the way the government has treated our Canadian Armed Forces and treated our veterans over the course of these last nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790304">Since the Liberals came into power, what we are seeing and what I hear quietly said over and over again by our veterans is, “Here we are in another decade of darkness.” That is what they called it the last time the Liberals were in power and decimated the Canadian Armed Forces. There is no way that the government is taking care of our veterans. Right off the bat, the government said the veterans were asking for more than it could give, but there is this slush fund. The Liberals have their friends to take care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790305"> The confidence of our veterans and our armed forces in the government is pretty well nil. As my colleague asked, do we have work to do when we form government shortly? We absolutely do. Do our veterans know that we have not done everything right in the past? They absolutely do, and we are open about that. At the same time, our veterans are facing the same challenges that every Canadian is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790306"> There are veterans' food banks that cannot keep their shelves full because of the need that is out there. There are more veterans who are homeless now, because they cannot afford rent. They cannot afford a home. There are veterans now who are on the street or couch surfing, because they do not have the ability to take care of themselves or their families. They feel guilty, so they have left their homes and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790307"> There is no question that our veterans are not being cared for the way they should be. I have had the privilege of being part of the women veterans study, reflecting on the largest study that has ever been done, actually no study was done until this one was done, on our women serving within the armed forces. It is frightening what they have had to go through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790308">We have a great deal of work to do to improve life for our armed forces, but I can assure members of two things: We will care for them while they are serving, and we will provide what they need to go to war, something that this government pretends it does not have a role in. We will care for our veterans in ways that meet their needs, and when there is a situation where something cannot be done the way that they would want it to be done, we will have our conversations and we will do our best to come to a consensus. There will be true conversations, rather than organizations of veterans groups set up that the government rarely reaches out to, but claims to have that relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790309">I am so pleased to see that we could have the opportunity very shortly to give credence to what we are saying with what we will do.</ParaText>

When we took government and had to deal with the extreme load of debt of the previous government, we went to every department and said that we needed them to help out and to please inform us of where cuts could be made.

Going back to the third report, picking up four paragraphs later, we read, “[then Ottawa police chief] Peter Sloly told the Committee that the [Ottawa Police Service] had a plan ready to clear downtown Ottawa, and the [Ottawa Police Service] maintained control of the plan during his tenure as chief of police.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790381">On October 27, 2022, former Ottawa mayor Jim Watson confirmed, at page 14 of the evidence, that he had not sought any emergency declarations.

At no point did I provide or request that the Emergencies Act be invoked.” He then added, “I did not provide any advice of that nature, nor am I aware of anyone from my legal team providing such advice.”</ParaText>

The House considers legislation and scrutinises government activity on the basis that what it is told is accurate. Parliament expects and requires proactive candour and transparency. This is what is necessary for the House to do its job properly. If a Minister makes an inadvertent error they are expected to correct it at the earliest opportunity. Mistakes inevitably happen and corrections are made routinely. There are, every year, roughly 100 corrections per year by Ministers who have inadvertently misled the House.

              <ParaText id="8790416">Third, the context of the former minister's comment, in trying to manage concerns regarding an extraordinary assertion of legal powers by the federal cabinet in response to a protest against its policies, is one that goes to explain the likely intention behind it: to syndicate the responsibilities for such a controversial decision onto the shoulders of non-political institutions like the police and away from the political actors who actually took the decision.</ParaText>

In the case where a Member later admits to having knowingly provided false information—as in the Profumo case—the issue of intent is clear.

              <ParaText id="8790452">I contrast that, of course, with how the Conservatives acted when we had the takeover of downtown Ottawa, with 600 businesses closed, seniors not being able to get access to groceries and people with disabilities not being able to access their medications. It was a complete calamity. We saw businesses that flew a pride flag being vandalized, with windows broken. The Happy Goat Coffee Company on Elgin Street, for example, was vandalized by convoy extremists. Despite the fact that we had to move through every day with the obstruction, intimidation, insults and jeers that were thrown at members of Parliament, at no point did Conservatives want to entertain any sort of question of privilege there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790453"> That is a case where there were severe restrictions on parliamentary activity. The case of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> is simply ludicrous. The fact is that sat on it for four days, and she is trying to weaponize a question of privilege. This should be treated as what it very clearly is.

This touched on GST relief and making the relief permanent with respect to essential goods, including home heating, cellphone bills and Internet bills, all of which are family essentials. Conservatives opposed this; however, instead of speaking against it in the House, which would have been the honest and honourable thing to do, Conservatives created obstruction that day. They obstructed the member for Burnaby South's ability to intervene, and they raised a series of speeches, none of which touched on the question of privilege in any meaningful way.</ParaText>

The prayer has stayed with me from that moment on; it was “Salvation for my family.” The true gift of salvation came when a baby was born in a manger in Bethlehem over 2,000 years ago. It is a gift if we acknowledge who that baby was, who he came to be and what he did on the cross for us. His name was Jesus, Emmanuel, God is with us.</ParaText>

Already, 2024 is the worst year on record for Saskatoon in the number of murders, and the year is not over yet. The NDP-Liberal coalition does not care at all about victims.

              <ParaText id="8790767">Madam Speaker, I am rising further to the notice I provided to the Chair under Standing Order 48 concerning the third and final report of the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency, which was tabled in the House of Commons earlier today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790768">In brief, on May 31, 2022, the committee adopted an order for the production of several unredacted documents related to the government's declaration of a public order emergency in February 2022, as well as the regulations and orders that were imposed in relation to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790769">The committee was particularly concerned with receiving, and specifically ordered, the production of a copy of the government's legal opinion for invoking the Emergencies Act. As outlined in the report, the then deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general of Canada wrote to the committee refusing to produce the legal opinion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790770">The material facts are outlined in the third report's chapter 10, aptly titled “Access to Information and Documents”. I will recap the essential points for the benefit of those who are not familiar with this particular saga, followed by citing pertinent authorities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790771">In establishing the special joint committee, the House conferred upon it, among other authorities, the power to send for persons, papers and records. I would refer the Chair to subparagraph (m)(ii) of the motion adopted on March 2, 2022, found at pages 471 to 473 and 480 to 484 of that day's Journals. The Senate conferred the identical authority on the committee in subparagraph (l)(ii) of the motion, adopted on March 3, 2022, as recorded in a message that the House received and published at pages 487 to 490 of the Journals for that day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790772">This being the first ever invocation of the Emergencies Act, the mandate to be pursued by the parliamentary review committee required by law to be appointed was something to be settled. As mentioned in the eighth paragraph of chapter 2 of the third report, the committee adopted a motion that, among other things, articulated the scope of the study it would initially pursue. The mandate included “the options that the Government of Canada utilized during the invocation of the Emergencies Act” and in the “study of each option...the necessity, implementation, and impact of that option.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790773">Seized with the House's authority to compel the production of documents, the committee sought to do just that with a view to discharging the mandate it had defined. As the committee explains in the 10th paragraph of chapter 10 of the third report, “The Committee also learned that an internal federal government legal opinion had been drafted to determine whether invoking the Emergencies Act was justified under the circumstances, but the Committee was unable to obtain a copy given that solicitor-client privilege was invoked.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790774">We have since come to know, thanks to the access to information system, that it is a 10-page opinion and forms tab C of the Clerk of the Privy Council's February 14, 2022, memorandum to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to secure his formal approval for invoking the Emergencies Act. </ParaText>

Public servants and Ministers may sometimes invoke their obligations under certain legislation to justify their position. Companies may be reluctant to release papers which could jeopardize their industrial security or infringe upon their legal obligations, particularly with regard to the protection of personal information. Others have cited solicitor-client privilege in refusing to allow access to legal papers or notices.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8790830"> In conclusion, the NDP-Liberal government gave itself sweeping authority to legislate in this place of Parliament and the provinces, and refused to come clean about the legal authority for doing so. Without straying too far into debate, the Rouleau commission heard testimony from the former CSIS director David Vigneault that the events of February 2022 did not meet the threshold that CSIS must apply for threats to the security of Canada, the same threshold Parliament said must be met before any public order emergency can be declared by the cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790831">However, Mr. Vigneault testified before the commission that there was some special, magical, “separate interpretation” of the threshold that he professionally applied, day in and day out, to justify the decision the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers were hell-bent on making. The fact that the Federal Court of Canada has since ruled that the government's actions in February 2022 were both illegal and unconstitutional only makes it even more imperative that there be full accountability and transparency for the Liberal Prime Minister's unilateral invocation of the sweeping legal powers the Emergencies Act conferred upon him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790832"> It is in this light, Madam Speaker, that I refer you to page 141 of Derek Lee's <I>The Power of Parliamentary Houses to send for Persons, Papers and Records</I>, concerning times when the House may need to compel the production of the Crown's law officers' work product. Lee writes, “[Then U.K. home secretary] Sir Robert Peel also acknowledged the power of the House in requiring the opinion of the law officers: ‘They stand in the situation of all other responsible servants of the Crown; and there can be no doubt that they are liable to have their opinion called for, and their official acts revised, where sufficient grounds exist [in the opinion of the House] for such a proceeding.’</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790833">“An example of where the House might wish to require production, Sir Robert Peel said: ‘If there were a suspicion that they [law officers of the Crown] had acted under undue influence, an imputation against them of straining a point in favour of the Crown, the law-officers would be justly liable to have their opinions called for, and their official acts investigated.’</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790834">“Similarly, Sir Robert Peel said: ‘I will suppose a case where the law-officers gave a wrong opinion, or where there was an opinion given against which the Government acted; in either of those cases, I admit, the House would be justified in calling for the production of the opinion.’”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790835">That is why the special joint committee worked so vigorously to obtain a copy of the infamous legal opinion and is also probably why the government has so steadfastly refused to shed any light on this matter. That is why I urge the Speaker to find a prima facie case of privilege in the circumstances and to permit the House to vote on ordering the production of the government's legal opinion. </ParaText>

We are not the ones saying that. I am not saying that and neither is the Conservative Party. It is a group of world-renowned scientists who said it. Every year, they submit a performance index for 67 countries.

At the risk of repeating myself—as environment critic, I am more than happy to do so—we all agree on the main elements. Where we differ is in the approach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790849">We all recognize that climate change is real, that we must deal head-on with its challenges, its implications and its impact on everyday life.

For the past nine years, we have been seeing dogmatic approaches, with the results we know: Canada is the worst country in the G7 and the 62nd country out of 67 according to world scientists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790850">Our approach will be based on concrete measures. Technically speaking, we agree with the principles behind SDTC's green fund. However, the problem lies with the way these Liberals have managed this fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790851">I would remind the House that SDTC had a $500‑million budget. The Auditor General looked into this and found 186 instances of ethics rules being broken. In all, $390 million of the $500 million was mismanaged. That is almost four out of every five dollars. Only one in five dollars was managed properly, and four out of five dollars were not managed according to the rules, certainly not according to ethics rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790852">What have we seen over the last five years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790853">It was literally a revolving door. Board members gave each other public money through the programs they were managing. That is not how it is supposed to work. That is not how to earn the public's trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790854">The Conservatives are not the ones saying that. I am not the one saying that. It was the Auditor General, who analyzed how the green fund was managed over the past five years. The fund has very good objectives, but, unfortunately, it was managed the Liberal way. That is why their cronies were scratching each other's backs and exchanging envelopes of Canadian taxpayers' money. They were donating to each other's own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790855">Right from the start of this operation five years ago, board members realized that, four times out of five, they were in a conflict of interest. They had to leave the room and leave their seat empty, but in the very next seat, someone else was making the same decision for their own business. The only thing these people should have done was stop and admit that they were the wrong people in the wrong place. There are thousands of people in Canada who know how to run public companies. I understand that this requires a certain expertise in technology and the environment.

              <ParaText id="8790856">Instead, the Liberals, who are all about friends helping friends, allowed the situation to continue. Unfortunately, as we saw, this just continued to happen. That is why the Auditor General produced a scathing report indicating that the Conflict of Interest Act, particularly subsection 6(1) and section 21, had been violated because of the private interests of the heads of this organization. The minister was made aware of the conflicts of interest but took no action.</ParaText>

It is a minister for whom I have a great deal of respect and esteem, the member for <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation>. Unfortunately, according to the Auditor General's report, the current minister “did not sufficiently monitor” what was happening within that organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790858">When the information was made public, all of a sudden, the minister, who is also the member for Saint-Maurice—Champlain, stopped everything.

That is what is happening right now at many levels of this government and that is what happened with this $500-million green fund that was so badly managed. That is why we need to tighten things up. That is why we, the three opposition parties, asked that the documents be transferred to a third party. That is an order from the House. The Chair recognized that these documents did indeed need to be transferred to a third party. Naturally, this created a precedent.

              <ParaText id="8790864">Speaking of good work, we at the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development have once again shown that another funding entity is sadly being mismanaged as well. So far, the problem is not as serious as what happened before, but that is why we want to delve a lot deeper into the matter. The fund is called the net-zero accelerator. Three key words: accelerate to reach net zero. The goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. By then, this country must have reached net zero. That means picking up the pace. No matter what, the zero target must be reached by 2050. What lessons have we learned after years of this Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790865">Let us not forget that we are talking about an $8-billion envelope. Earlier, we were justifiably upset about $380 million out of a total of $500 million being mismanaged. Now we are talking $8 billion. The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development looked into the management of various things here and there. He wanted to know what that looked like. So far, about half the envelope has been spent. What we are learning is that there is a flagrant lack of objectives, a flagrant lack of respect for the rules surrounding the net-zero accelerator's actual objective. Do not forget that this means net zero by 2050. We need targets. Unfortunately, no progress has been made pretty much anywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790866">We have learned that a mere five of the 17 projects analyzed had targets, according to the commissioner. The whole purpose of the net zero accelerator initiative is to set a target that the entire planet set for itself under the Paris Agreement, namely, net zero by 2050. Billions of dollars are being invested to meet these targets. Now we have learned that, at the halfway point, with $4 billion spent so far, only five of 17 companies have targets. Of course, it is easy to meet a non-existent target. They get the money, but they have no target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790867">Here is a great example of that: $700 million of taxpayers' money was given to a foreign firm that had no reduction targets. Obviously, I am talking about the agreement announced with great fanfare a year and a few months ago, when Volkswagen, a foreign company, received a contribution that could go up to $18 billion of taxpayers' money. One might even call it a donation. The company was given taxpayers' money via a direct subsidy. That $700 million has already been paid out. It is important to understand that this is not revenue from the goods and services tax, the GST, because all the GST does is pay the interest on the debt that this government has doubled over the past nine years. That is how bad things have gotten. All Canadians need to know that, when they pay GST, the money is not being invested in the services to which they are entitled. Instead, it is being used to cover the interest on the debt that this insatiable government, which has no scruples about spending and no parameters, has allowed to balloon over the past nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790868">When the government takes tax dollars from working people and hands them over to a foreign entity, one would at least expect it to have real objectives, but there are none. It is disappointing. There is no accountability. Based on how certain targets are calculated, they are sometimes counted twice. I am not the one saying this. The environment commissioner said so. The government is exaggerating the reductions that are being assessed. The government cannot say how much greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions have been reduced with this project. The government cannot say how much money has been allocated to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On top of that, five out of 17 projects have no targets. They are, however, receiving funding from taxpayers. That is not the right way to manage taxpayers' money. This means that people may not have the confidence they should have when it comes time to have a proper and intelligent discussion about reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>

There are always plenty of words, targets, ambition and attempts, but very little in the way of real results. Canada is the worst country in the G7. It is 62nd out of 67. However, the Liberals are great when it comes time to make announcements and put on a big show. Unfortunately, that is what we saw with Lion Electric in Quebec. I take no pleasure in saying that, because I am a proud Quebecker. The government made a big announcement three years ago, but it did not take action when it was time to do so.

They want results, and they are frustrated because they are getting no results for the absolute gargantuan amount of money that is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790904">We need a government that prioritizes the priorities of the people. I think if the Liberals did take it to the people in a carbon tax election, like we have been calling for, they would hear clearly that their priorities around this are not the priorities of the people they say they represent. Need I go any further than the grandiose announcement about planting trees? When we think about it, two billion trees, it is amazing. It is incredible and makes us feel warm and fuzzy that we are going to plant all of these trees. Do members know how many trees have been planted? Only 0.04% of the target number of trees have been planted. It is an amazing outcome for the amount of money the Liberals are spending and how few results we are getting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790905">People want real, tangible, practical results, which is why we are going to continue to hold this government to account, demand transparency and ask that it release the documents, as the majority of the House, the people's representatives, have clearly asked for and as the Speaker has ruled and said that we deserve. It is time that transparency came to the House. It is time that honesty comes to the people's chamber and that we get the results we want. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790906">We come to this place now where we are looking at a gargantuan amount of money going out the door with no real transparency or accountability, and as a result, Canadians' level of frustration is growing. We see it on their faces. They work day after day to earn the dollars that they have, and at the end of the day, they have more bills than they have money to pay those bills. No wonder they are upset. No wonder they are angry when they look at a government that does not prioritize their needs and does not seem to be concerned about their priorities. Instead, it has all kinds of time and money for its ideology. However, right now, with a nation that is facing an economic crisis with the threat of tariffs on the horizon, basically people are wondering, “Do I pay the rent? Do I get groceries, or do I put gas in my car? Can I buy my kids Christmas gifts this year, or do I make my rent payment?” These are not fictional stories; it is the reality.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790907">Our food bank use has overwhelmingly grown. In my region, food bank usage is up over 30% year over year. That is a staggering stat. People are now wondering, especially seniors on fixed incomes, how they will make it to the new year when they are looking at escalating power bills and fuel costs, and every time they go to get groceries it is costing more. I think we have a responsibility as parliamentarians to be responding to those kinds of needs and those matters. It is too bad that those on the other side will not simply comply with the order of the House, release the documents and get back to work on the priorities of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790908">The frustration is real. They are being taxed and burdened. I cannot help but think of that. It is said that history repeats itself. In reality, it probably does not repeat itself, but it certainly does rhyme. We will find rhymes throughout history and cycles within politics, governments and societies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790909"> It is a wonderful time of year, Christmastime. This will come as no surprise to many in the House, but I cannot help but think of the most wonderful story that has been told and is still being told the world over. It is why literally billions will be celebrating this month. It is the wonderful story of Christmas. Anyone might ask how Christmas relates to what we are talking about, but it does. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790910">On that very first Christmas, it was written that it came at a time of taxation. It was a heavy and burdensome time of taxation, and a census had to be done to find out exactly what the population was in that region so more taxes could be collected. The census was rendered and everyone was to return to their place of origin or birth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790911">A young man by the name of Joseph, who had taken a young, beautiful lady by the name of Mary to be his wife, had to make the journey to Bethlehem. It was not an easy journey. We have a way of romanticizing the imagery. We have these wonderful images of nativity, but it was probably not very pretty nor exciting at the time for this terrified young couple, who were living under accusations and probably being very much falsely accused. The rumour mill was rampant. They were heading out into uncertainty. She was not just early in her pregnancy, but a long way into it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790912">I do not know about members, but I am thankful that I have never had the experience of carrying a young one inside me, but my beloved bride has, and I must say—</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790913">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> You had the better part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790914">
                <B>Mr. Richard Bragdon:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I had the better part. I will agree. I remember that when she was with child, I had no way of totally understanding that or relating to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790915">Members should picture this and go with me now on this journey. Can they imagine what this couple would have been feeling as they started out and a very pregnant lady is on the back of a donkey going down a bumpy road, very much with child, with a young man?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790916">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> They're not smooth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790917">
                <B>Mr. Richard Bragdon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not smooth on the back of a donkey. It is not comfortable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790918">They are making this journey to a place called Bethlehem. Members can imagine the thoughts they were thinking: “This is not how I imagined it would be, Joseph”; “This is not exactly what I had in mind when we started courting”; and “This is not really what I had hoped for, that I would be stuck on a donkey going to a town I do not know where I have to pay more taxes. That is the last thing I want to be doing when I am about to give birth”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790919">We forget about this part of the story, but it is very real. They must have been feeling overwhelmed and filled with questions, wondering how they were going to get out from under the burden they were carrying, and she is getting more uncomfortable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790920">We can see that back then, as it is now, it was a time of taxation. It was a burdensome time. It was a time of uncertainty for this young couple. They were feeling the pressure of the moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790921">Can anyone imagine what Joseph must have been experiencing? His new bride is about to have her baby and he is going to a town he had not been to in a long time. He gets there and starts looking for a place to stay. He goes to the inn thinking that they finally made it. He knocks on the innkeeper's door and the innkeeper asks how he can help. Joseph says he needs a room; the innkeeper does not know how bad he needs a room because his bride is expecting. The innkeeper says there is no room in the inn for them. There was a housing crisis in Bethlehem. There were no rooms left. They had more people than they had rooms. People were wondering where they were going to go. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790922">To complicate matters, Mary is with child, is about to deliver and Joseph is not a doctor. They have no place to stay and Joseph is scrambling. He asks the innkeeper if is there anything he could do; somebody needs to help him because his bride is about to deliver. Can members hear it and see it? We have to picture it. All of a sudden, the innkeeper says that he does not have much, but there is a stable out back, an old barn. It is not all that luxurious, but it at least gives them some cover for the night. Joseph said that would do; it was fine. Can members see it? Mary is waddling her way back to the barn and Joseph is panicking, saying he does not know what they are going to do and it was so strange. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790923">Then sure enough, that incredible, unbelievable night happened in the midst of incredible uncertainty and great taxation. When they were shut out of one place after another and it looked like all the odds were against them, Mary brings forth the child. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and placed him in a feed-box. This promised king and prince of peace did not come by way of a palace, was not escorted by a private jet and did not come in a Maserati. He came humbly by way of a donkey, born in a barn out back. He was witnessed by cattle and surrounded by sheep dung. It did not smell good and it was not pretty, but something incredible came out of something very ordinary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790924">Mary and Joseph are incredible people through the lens of history, but they did not have large pedigrees, big names or wealth. They were common folk who had exceptional favour on their life and were chosen for an exceptional purpose. A lot of Canadians who find themselves in uncertain times and under the weight of great taxation can draw hope from this timeless story. No matter how ordinary they feel, how stacked the odds may be against them and how many times they may feel overlooked by society and forgotten by governments, there is someone who still knows their name and recognizes them. That is what the story of Christmas is all about, that we are not alone. He came to us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790925">I love this story because the first ones to be entrusted with the great news of the newborn Saviour and the babe in a manger were not the kings and rulers of the day. Guess who they were. It was the farmers and shepherds, those tending their flocks on the hillside at night with the stars brightly shining. The angels lit up and gave the message. They said they had great news of joy, good news for all people, peace on earth and goodwill to all men. Who was that news given to? It was not given to the rulers of the day. That news was entrusted to the common folks, the forgotten ones: the sheep herders and the farmers on the hillside. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790926">That relates to us as parliamentarians. Some of the greatest news, some of the best ideas and some of the things that will help get our country back on the right track will be found at the tables of ordinary folks, from hearing their stories, listening to their challenges and understanding where they are coming from. If we took time to listen to more shepherds, farmers, truck drivers, oil workers, bucket carriers and waitresses, I think we would gain a lot more wisdom than spending time at fancy conferences, paying big money and listening to the so-called experts tell us things that obviously have misled us in so many ways. If we get back to the people who built this country, the common folks, I think there is wisdom there that can get us out of the malaise we are in now. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790927">I have to wrap up this little story. I am down to five minutes. Oh my land, I have to bring it to a close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790928">We cannot leave it with the shepherds and the angels singing on high and Mary, Joseph and the baby. There were three others who came. They were called the wise men. I love this about the story. The three wise men, the Magi, came from afar, because wise people recognize that sometimes we have to go a long way to find the truth in life. Sometimes we have to be willing to step out of our comfort zone, come down from our high places and go to the lowly places to find some of the most precious gifts that can be found, and those three wise men were wise indeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790929"> They were wise enough to seek out the answers to what they were facing in an uncommon place, and they followed a star and it got them to the town of Bethlehem. They came bearing gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790930">When they showed up with the gold, the gold obviously spoke to financial resources. How can we reflect the wisdom of the wise men? Perhaps we can help the less fortunate with our resources. If we have been blessed with some goods, let us remember to give to good charities that do good things in our communities and make a difference in people's lives in a real way. Let us remember to bring our finances and our gold to the table. When we give to the least fortunate, we are actually giving it to the king, and it brings honour to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790931"> The second gift was frankincense. Frankincense was incense, which basically represented the prayers of the people throughout the ages. The good news about prayer is that prayer lives on. The prayers of our forefathers, our moms and our dads, and yes, the prayers of our parents and our own prayers, will live on. When we bring our prayers to God, they are a gift to him. The wise men brought that, and prayers for peace are going on right now all over the world, looking for peace. This time of year, we remember that a promise of peace is offered to us, and we can give that to others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790932">The last gift they brought was myrrh. What was myrrh symbolic of? Myrrh was the ointment they brought to heal wounds. It represented brokenness. The amazing thing about this king, which is different from other kings, is that the greatest gift we can honour him with is our vulnerabilities and our brokenness. I think a lot of Canadians and a lot of people throughout the world are hurting right now. Christmas can be a time of mixed things. It can be filled with a lot of joy, but for those who have recently lost loved ones, there is a lot of hurt, a lot of pain and a lot of questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790933"> My own family knows what that is like. I lost a brother during the Christmas season. He was 34 years old. He had three young daughters, and I watched my parents age overnight. He passed away on Boxing Day of 2007, and as a person of faith, I can tell members that Christmas is mixed for us. We have many joyful memories, and we have some painful ones, but I can tell members this: I am thankful for the greatest gift that was ever given at Christmas, because it helped my family. My prayer for everyone in this House is that it helps all of them to know that, yes, he came for everyone on every side of the House, regardless of partisanship or politics, because there are things bigger than politics in life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790934">That is the greatest gift that was ever given, because his name was to be called Emmanuel, which means “God is with us”. He is with us in uncertain times. He is with us in hurtful times. He is with us in painful times and in joyous times, and he promised to never leave us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790935"> With that, to conclude, my wish for the House and for everyone in Canada who is hurting right now is that he may be their Emmanuel, their God, who is with them and with us. Merry Christmas to members and their families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790937">I was raised in a Catholic household and went to church. I since have not attended church.

              <ParaText id="8790938">I am also a big fan of Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical Christian who wrote a book called <I>Saving Us</I>. It is a book about how to communicate about climate change and how to communicate the necessity of humans to act, given the impact we have had on our planet, through burning fossil fuels. It is about how to have those conversations, particularly when we come together over the holiday season. If anybody out there is looking forward to getting together with their family, but maybe is not looking forward to having discussions about politics or climate change, I would encourage them to look up <I>Saving Us</I> by Katharine Hayhoe. She is brilliant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790939">I also know that foundational to Christian ethic is that we ought to all support vulnerable people. In my view, Jesus was undoubtedly a democratic socialist. He cared about people first and foremost. I would just remind my colleague that he was on his way to Bethlehem because Mary and Joseph were tax compliant. They were going for the census because they believed in helping other people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790940">Statistics tell us very clearly that evangelical Protestants and Catholics are among the people who care about climate change the least. Could the member change my mind? Could he tell me that he believes in climate change, and that he believes we ought to act to lower our emissions and to fight for our planet because it is the only one that God ever created for us?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790956">The carbon tax has cost every sector, because every time someone is taxed, for example when the farmer who grows our food is taxed, the trucker who transports our food is taxed and the grocer who puts the food on the shelf is taxed, that affects every Canadian who has to buy the food. It is a multiplying effect that has no genuine benefit to the environment. The whole world is starting to pivot and realize.

              <ParaText id="8790961">Madam Speaker, I always enjoy conversations with my colleague. We had a brief stint on the fisheries committee together. What is glaringly and absolutely obvious is that, every time, the New Democrats go back and talk about what happened under Harper; however, it is nine years later, and they and their party have been propping up a government that has produced no results on the environment and has cost Canadians exorbitantly more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790962">I call it a gimmick because I got a call from a small business owner just last night who was saying how frustrated he is right now because the GST break is going to be for only a month and a half, it is only on certain items while other items are exempt, and it is not applicable across the board. It is leading to more frustration, more consternation, and no relief on a broad basis for Canadians who are desperate for relief. The best way they can get that is to have a carbon tax election so they get to choose.</ParaText>

It was a Conservative idea, albeit for a month as opposed to two months, and it is a GST break at a time that I believe is an appropriate time to do it. Conservatives actually campaigned on it; it was in their Conservative election platform. The leader of the Conservative Party at the time tweeted about it, saying it was a good thing. Now we were able to vote in favour of it, yet they decided to vote against it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790969">On to the point at hand, which is the continuation of the debate on the government's mishandling of the green slush fund for Sustainable Development Technology Canada, another institution that has now been, basically, tarnished and, as a matter of fact, disbanded. It is another victim of absolutely abysmal leadership. Never in my time here has one person, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, been such a collection of bad ideas, bad judgment and bad leadership. Never has Canada, I think, had such a pall cast over it and never has the citizenship been this frustrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790970">I now rise a third time to address the chamber in this matter relating to the green slush fund. Why? Because the government has refused, and continues to refuse, to turn over documents relating to the corruption at SDTC, as ordered by the House on June 10. With this issue dragging on for months now, it is clear the government has entrenched itself. It clearly has something it wants to hide. There is no majority in this House that is going to let the government off the hook. It is not just the Conservatives. For the time being, I am sure there is a price that somebody can be purchased for. I will save my comments for that time when that day comes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790971">For now, we are at an impasse. If I do not rise on my feet again before this House adjourns for Christmas, when I return, I will have eclipsed the 19th anniversary of my election to the chamber, and I have never seen anything like this. As a matter of fact, to my knowledge, this is the longest privilege debate in our nation's history. Wayne Gretzky set all kinds of great records. The kind of records this guy is setting will certainly have him remembered for all of the wrong reasons in the history books to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790972">For those who are watching, here is a quick refresher on the scandal. Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, was an organization that gave taxpayer-funded grants to companies with solutions to improve Canada's environmental record. As I mentioned in a question earlier, this is something there was general consensus about. SDTC was started up, I believe, in the early 2000s by the then Liberal government, Jean Chrétien and his government. This program survived the former Conservative government. We saw the value in Sustainable Development Technology Canada, despite all of the accusations, which are baseless, that somehow Conservatives do not care about the environment, which is simply not true at all; we are just realistic and practical about the environment, which is what differentiates us from everybody else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790973">The program was maintained all through the tenure of former prime minister Stephen Harper, until the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the people he chose to appoint to oversee these things. It was his decision. The Prime Minister decides who is in cabinet. He decides who is going to lead in those portfolios. He is the one who judges their character, their virtues and their competencies and he is the one who is ultimately responsible for this fiasco.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8790974">The Auditor General found that SDTC doled out nearly $400 million of a $500-million program to contracts that went in some way, shape or form to the benefit of the very board members whom the minister, under the watch of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, had appointed to the board of SDTC, board members who were clearly Liberal appointments. In awarding these contracts, the board members were found to have breached the ethics rules around contracts not once, not twice, not 10 times, not 50 times, not 100 times and not 150 times, but 186 times. In addition, they funded 10 illegitimate projects to the tune of $58 million. These are projects that could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or that they would help with the development of green technology at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790975"> Now, not only do we have 186 conflicts of interest, but we are actually doling out money for which the purpose was not even indicative in any of the contracts that were awarded. The scandal was so bad that the government abolished SDTC and rolled the fund into Natural Resources Canada, or NRC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790976"> There is a word that comes to mind when we hear of a scandal of this size and of this magnitude. It has been said before, and it will be said again. It is a commonplace word, said virtually every time there is a Liberal government in this country, and that word is “corruption”. It is corrupt. The word “corruption” comes from the Latin word <I>corruptus</I>, a past participle of the Latin word <I>corrumpere</I>. The prefix <I>cor-</I> means “altogether”, and <I>rumpere</I> means “to break”. In old Greek, the word is synonymous with decomposing, putrid and spoiled. </ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Blaine Calkins:</B> Madam Speaker, it is too bad the hecklers were not listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790979"> Corruption and decay go hand in hand. As such, when we say that everything feels broken, we say it because we mean it. The country is in decay, and the government's rotten influence is running rampant, spoiling every single thing it touches, including even those programs and services for which there is consensus in all corners of the House. The consensus regarding immigration is another great example of something that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has now destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790980"> My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, said in one of his speeches that this is corruption like we have never seen in Canada. I believe that he is correct in his assessment of the situation, with one exception: There is probably one other prime minister who could rival the current profligate spending and graft, and that is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s father. It seems like every time we have a prime minister with that last name, the country ends up on edge. This Liberal rot extends far beyond the SDTC. It now touches every facet of Canadian society and its institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790981"> Members can take the natural health product industry, for instance, and I will tie that in. The government took a world-leading regulatory regime, implemented by the previous Harper government, and ripped it up as if it meant nothing. It did not bother to consult with the industry, either. That would have obviously been beneath it. Instead of continuing with the existing framework, the government, led by the inept <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, decided to move natural health products into the same regime as therapeutic drugs, contrary to previous parliamentary studies and general consensus that vitamins and supplements are not the same things as doctor-prescribed medications. These changes would devastate the natural health product industry. The IADSA, the International Alliance of Dietary Food Supplement Associations, had this to say about the changes that are being proposed by the current government here in Canada:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790985">Those are probably the most glowing words we could hear from an international organization, touting the regime created by the Harper administration for natural health products as being the gold standard against which every other country is measured. Now it is writing to our committee and to members of Parliament saying that if we pursue the current agenda of the Liberal government, with the support of the NDP, through Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> and the self-care framework that the regulatory framework entails, we will actually destroy the gold standard, the gold star, the institution that the rest of the world should be modelling itself after and designing itself after.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790986">As a response to the illogical and unwarranted attack on the natural health product industry, I did introduce my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12751785" Type="4">C-368</Document>, to bring the industry back to the old regulatory regime, yet the government is not done with its attacks. Let me explain to the people at home why an election is so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790987">In early spring, the government plans to implement its cost recovery framework through the gazetting process. Bill <Document DbId="12751785" Type="4">C-368</Document> may have passed second reading in this place and it may have passed the committee stage, but it is yet to be debated at third reading in the House and passed. It would then have to go to the Senate to go through that same set of steps and processes all over again, all before the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790988">Given that the timeline is probably getting to be fairly unlikely, the government is still free, then, and still has the old legislation it passed in Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="13050012" Type="3">C-69</Document>, to pursue the regulatory environment to implement the self-care framework. This is a self-funding model that is behind the changes to begin with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790989">It is a tax grab on the industry to get the people in the small and medium-sized mom-and-pop shops, which are small businesses that create, innovate and develop all the supplements, such as vitamins, protein powders and things of this nature, under the same cost recovery framework that companies like Pfizer or Purdue Pharma would have to actually be under. Nobody in the industry has this kind of money. It is a death sentence for the natural health product industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790990">Every day that the government has care and control of the Governor in Council, the ability to pass regulatory changes, it is still allowed, notwithstanding Bill <Document DbId="12751785" Type="4">C-368</Document>, to pursue this framework. The <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has said very clearly that he is hell-bent on destroying this institution as well. The government will implement the self-care framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790991"> For the Canadians who are watching, this is very important. There are two parties so far in the House that have voted non-confidence in the government so we could have an election. An election would kill the ability of the government to pursue the regulatory change to the natural health product industry. It would not be able to gazette anything during an election. At the outcome of the next election, hopefully there is a government that will cease destroying the natural health product industry in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790992">This is why it is very important that the one party that continues to support the government be held accountable. It is continuing to support the government, even though it may have supported my bill in some bizarre manners. I might add that a member on the health committee actually tried to move a wrecking motion to destroy the bill at committee. Luckily he was granted a time out, heard from tens of thousands of Canadians and changed his ways, and we managed to salvage Bill <Document DbId="12751785" Type="4">C-368</Document> at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790993">However, every day that the New Democratic Party continues to prop up the government brings us one day closer to a gazetting process for the self-care framework, which will put the cost recovery model burden on the natural health product industry. That is what will destroy the innovation and growth and destroy the gold standard model that the IADSA says is the best one in the world. That is what is at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790994"> We need an election, not just because of all of the other corruption but also because of all the bad ideas. I said that earlier in my speech. Never has there been such a collection of bad ideas, bad judgment and bad leadership in one human being as there is in the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8790995">I use this example because it is a microcosm of what is wrong with the government. The Liberals cannot work collaboratively anymore. They have no friends left. No one is defending them. I cannot imagine why they are staying the course, because nothing is getting passed in this place. It is only to pursue the regulatory power and authority that they still have that they are clutching on to government. Who is the enabler? It is the New Democratic Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790996">One can only conclude that that is the true agenda, even though others might not say so publicly. There is no doubt in my mind that that is what is going on. For those who are watching, what is at risk for the natural health product industry if we do not have an election sooner rather than later is that another gold standard institution will be ruined by the incompetence of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790997"> To get back to SDTC, the crux of the matter is document production. Without documents, how are we to hold the government accountable for anything? We in the Conservative Party have asked for documents numerous times, and not just in this particular example. We have asked for them constantly, in every committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790998"> I happen to be a member of the procedure and House affairs committee at this time. We have asked for document productions many times. We were denied access to documents that members of the media had access to during the foreign interference scandal, for example. Members of the media can see documents that I as an elected member of Parliament have never been able to see, because the Liberal government, propped up by the NDP, whether it is in the House or at committee, always denies Parliament getting access to unredacted documents. It does not matter what the issue is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8790999"> In this particular case, it just happens to be the documents surrounding Sustainable Development Technology Canada. If Canadians are wondering why we are making such a big fuss about it, it is because this is the line in the sand. It has been crossed so many times. It was even crossed in the previous Parliament to the point that an election was called to prevent documents for the Winnipeg labs from being tabled in this place. We had someone summoned to the bar, which I do not think had happened for 113 years, who refused to bring documents when he was here. He was admonished by the Speaker of this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791000">Also, the government, so self-righteous in its determination to keep things secret, actually took the previous Speaker to court. Everybody knows courts have always said that Parliament is supreme in the matters of its own governance, but that did not stop the government from pursuing that matter, so desperate it was to hide what it had done and to keep it from Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791001">Here we are at an impasse. We are several months into it, and there is only one political party in this place that does not want to turn over the documents. It is that of the government. All the other parties to date are allowing this debate to continue until the government does what it is supposed to do and what the Speaker has asked it to do. As the Speaker has said, “The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any and all documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791002">Some $400 million of taxpayers' money was inappropriately spent, and 186 conflicts of interest were identified by the Auditor General. This is taxpayers' money. This is a government program. If this is not a textbook case of documents that Parliament should be able to see, then, frankly, I do not know what else would be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791003"> I will wrap up my comments by saying this. A number of us in this place tonight have been here for a long time. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, if I am not on my feet again by the time I return, I will have eclipsed the 19th anniversary of my first election to this place. I have never seen a House of Commons in this much disarray, and I have never seen a government that has lost complete and utter control of the finances of the country and of law and order on the streets. It has lost control of itself and the ability to follow the rules of this place. Shame on them.</ParaText>

He was talking about this privilege debate, saying it is the longest in Canadian history and he has not seen anything like this in his almost 20 years in the chamber. I have not been here as long as the member has, but it is my understanding that, as my colleague was just mentioning, the only prime minister to have been found in contempt of Parliament was Prime Minister Stephen Harper. That was, of course, as the member was mentioning how long he has been here, a government he was part of.</ParaText>

We are the only political entity in the chamber that is actually on one side of the political spectrum.

              <ParaText id="8791045"> For ineligible projects, there was $58 million. For conflict of interest violations, there was $334 million across 186 projects. Contribution agreements were ignored for $58 million of taxpayer money. Added up, $400 million of taxpayer money was wasted, and the Liberal government would like to avoid any accountability and transparency over it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791046"> I think a lot of Canadians do not know a lot about SDTC, and there are some natural questions to ask about how an organization backed by so much money from the federal government crept away from its mission and core responsibility to the extent that it gave out hundreds of millions of dollars without any accountability and had its mistakes covered by the current Liberal government. I have done a lot of reading and a lot of research on SDTC, and I would like to share some of what I have learned, share some of the distractions and the way that SDTC understood its ethical responsibility to the Canadian people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791047">I read the SDTC code of ethics, document 12.05, and it shows a social activist agenda far outside the scope of what the Canadian public had entrusted the organization to do with taxpayer dollars. I would like to quote from that code of ethics:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791048">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">SDTC recognizes that equity, diversity, and inclusion enable organizations to leverage the range of perspectives needed to address today’s complex challenges. As a result, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is an important consideration for optimal operation of our organization, as well as for Funded Companies.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791049">This is what SDTC thought the ethical management of Canadian taxpayer dollars looked like. It had completely embraced a social activist agenda that had nothing to do with why SDTC was funded, why it was incorporated and what it was entrusted to do on behalf of the Canadian public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791050"> In fact, when we look at SDTC's most recent corporate plan, we find it being very clear of its social activist agenda: “Equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) are foundational to our culture.” Once again, it reiterates the social activist agenda that it put at the centre of the organization's operations, far outside the scope of what it was asked to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791051">It goes much deeper than that, because SDTC was an advocate for and a supporter of one of the Liberal government's most far-reaching social activist projects, the 50-30 challenge. Many Canadians might not know what that is, so I would like to explain it. The 50-30 challenge is about a micromanagement of the race and gender representation of boards of directors and senior managers at companies across the country in a wide range of industries. If we look at the businesses that have been drawn to this, we find that many, though not all, are in industries that are currently doing a massive disservice to the consumers of our country, such as the cellphone companies overcharging people on monthly bills and the banks charging Canadians over-the-top banking fees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791052"> The 50-30 challenge seems to be a light to the moth for companies making efforts to virtue signal and look like they are compassionate and nice and care about people, but at the end of the day, they show very little regard for the Canadian consumer or the Canadian taxpayer. SDTC fits into this group of businesses beautifully. It is a great fit for SDTC, because it was a hustle to create a certain kind of perception and image of what it was doing. However, we know now, because of whistle-blowers and other documents that have been released, what exactly it was doing, which was engaging in corruption and making sure that its Liberal elite insider buddies were given cash.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8791053">What else was SDTC up to? These are important questions for Canadians to know the answers to, because I think we need to understand how an organization turns into the scandal it has become. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791054">There is another acronym that SDTC was very interested in, and obsessed with, in fact, which is ESG, or environmental, social and governance. It embraces an entire framework of understanding as to what an organization's ethical responsibilities are to the public. Through that, we understand exactly the kinds of distractions and priorities that SDTC decided to occupy itself with, while making a series of decisions that led to the mismanagement of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791055"> For those who are unfamiliar with ESG, it is a form of stakeholder capitalism. It is a form of capitalism that asserts that the responsibility of big businesses and well-funded organizations is to engage in social activism outside of the scope of the actual business purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791056"> Just to remind people, what was SDTC's business purpose? Why did it exist? Why was it funded? Why was it incorporated? I will provide its own description from its website, which states, “(SDTC) helps Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies by delivering critical funding support at every stage of their journey”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791057">We know very clearly, based on the numbers, that SDTC dramatically failed to achieve its business purpose. We know that because $58 million of taxpayer money went to ineligible projects that did not meet the purpose of SDTC. We know it failed its business purpose because 186 projects, accounting for $334 million, had conflict of interest violations that went unaddressed by the organization. We know that contribution agreements were ignored in the amount of $58 million of SDTC money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791058">Therefore, instead of being focused on its actual business purpose, which was the reason it received taxpayer money from hard-working Canadians, it was more concerned with ESG. We can find references to ESG in lots of its documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791059"> In its 2022-2023 corporate plan, SDTC says, very clearly, “In keeping with our mission to enable environmental and economic prosperity for Canada, we struck a task force...to look at...(ESG)”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791060"> An SDTC press release from 2021 states, “the demand for #ESG investment products is accelerating the trend of Canada's best cleantech ideas”. In fact, in that press release, it used a hashtag for ESG. It was very excited about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791061"> It goes on, talking about one of its most recent board appointments and explaining why it chose this member. This is the description in her bio, which states, “Her deep sectoral knowledge and expertise in...(ESG) performance and data driven approach uniquely compliments exercising governance best practices and overseeing risks.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791062">It would appear that building an organizational strategy around ESG led to putting people in positions of influence at SDTC, who in fact did not exercise governance best practices and in fact did not oversee risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791063">We are here, in a position of scandal, because SDTC is very exemplary of a broad trend in our economy right now of organizations and powerful businesses, entrusted with either public dollars or the confidence of consumers, that decide they would rather engage in politics and social activism than do what they have been tasked with in our economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791064">SDTC is a glaring example of that trend. Its obsession with ESG and with DEI betrays a real lack of attention to the reason it existed in the first place. All the staff time, the board time and the director time that went to its political agenda may very well, and I would argue that it probably did, contribute to it keeping its eye off the ball, leading to so many disastrous decisions, not only for its organization, but also for our country and for taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791065">Now, I would like to continue on with some observations about the deeper problems with ESG. I think there are many organizations that have bought into this framework and have bought into a way of looking at doing business that is going to pose many of the same risks that SDTC provides us a case study of. The National Review's Andrew Stuttaford has written extensively about the ESG and stakeholder capitalism problem. He has argued that businesses should be focused on their economic objectives and that it is a threat to the democratic order for CEOs to pursue political objectives unconnected to their company's economic objectives, on any reasonable reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791066">With SDTC, we have a very clear example of that. We have an organization that opted to creep away from its actual mission and instead try to influence, through public dollars and its investment in other companies, an entire social activist agenda requiring many other businesses, in order to be able to appeal for the cash that they were distributing, to have a willingness to comply with an ideological framework that had nothing to do with clean-tech innovation, nothing to do with being able to turn a profit and nothing to do with building the technology that many Canadians trusted, over a long period of time, SDTC to actually be interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791067"> Additionally, I would like to share some points on the problem of ESG and stakeholder capitalism, big businesses and well-funded government organizations creeping into this area of social activism.

              <ParaText id="8791071">Mr. Speaker, in 2022, our colleague, the Conservative MP for <Affiliation DbId="278450" Type="2">Calgary Shepard</Affiliation>, made some very important observations about how the Canadian government and elected officials could do more to move economic actors away from a political and social agenda and toward being focused on their economic objectives. I would like to share some of his thoughts, from the National Post. He argued that it should be:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791072">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">considered a breach in the duty of care...to shareholders when directors and officers of a large distributing corporation...make activist statements, including in relation to public policy or social issues, that is not directly related to the business the corporation carries out and that could reasonably be expected to reduce the value of shares.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791073"> He then went on to argue that corporations requiring the firm's board of directors to first consult with shareholders would “make corporations think twice before opining on something beyond their stated corporate purpose.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791074">When I use a lot of that lingo and jargon, I understand that some of it is very dense corporate law stuff, but the reason it is important is that this is about deciding, when organizations are trusted in our society, whether they are large private sector businesses or well-funded non-profit organizations backed by the federal government, how much power the public is actually entrusting them to have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791075">When people with lots of money at their disposal decide to turn their organizations not just into economic actors but also into social activist agencies and political actors, they are representing the will and the interests of well-financed people, to the detriment of the masses of Canadians who work very hard to have their voices heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791076">When SDTC was trusted with hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money and used it to advance a social activist agenda or a political agenda, it was acting against the will of the people, who did not trust them with that power in our society, just as we do not trust many other big corporations to do the same. Instead, what we have seen, over and over again, is a willingness of people with lots of capital at their disposal to become social activists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791077">SDTC is a cautionary tale. SDTC could not do everything it claimed. It is hard enough to grow a business, stay within a mandate and be responsible and accountable to the Canadian taxpayer, as the Liberal government well knows. If someone thinks they can do all of those things well and also be a social activist or engage in political activism on the side, they run the risk of being like SDTC: making poor decisions, destroying their organization and not serving the public in the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791078">I would like to finish with this. Earlier today, the HUMA committee heard from the Liberal government's <Affiliation DbId="300016" Type="4">DEI minister</Affiliation>. What was very revealing about this, as I was preparing for my comments here today concerning SDTC, was just how much the superficiality that is represented by SDTC is really a reflection of a broad approach to governance from the Liberal government itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791079">The Liberals are constantly focused on hollow, superficial and empty virtue signalling. They would love to be able to say whatever they can to make themselves look good and pat each other on the back. However, when it comes to making decisions that are responsible for the good of our country; to showing any kind of humility for the nine years they have been in power and for the various mistakes and scandals they have been part of; or to admitting that they have been wrong, that they have made many things in our country worse and that many of their policies have failed, they are completely obtuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791080">Every day, we stand here to provide the Liberals with evidence, statistical, anecdotal, academic or from news reports or whatever other evidence we can put in front of them, to show just how much they have made life worse for many people in our country. However, they are completely obtuse. The Liberals would rather use a lot of jargon. They want to trot out DEI narratives and distill very serious problems in our country to things that make them sound and feel good, but the reality is that they are failing our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791081">The problem with SDTC, and why I think Liberals are so dug in on not wanting to reveal the scandal, is that it is a bigger reflection of who they are and what they have done for the last nine years. It is a bigger reflection of how they have used power, how they view the people in our country and what responsibilities they feel ,or more accurately do not feel, for the power that has been entrusted to their hands.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791083"> SDTC is not just about the $400 million, although that is very serious. It is not just about the corruption, although those documents should be produced.

That matter is the green slush fund scandal at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. For Canadians watching at home, I will break down the green slush fund scandal into four points. One, through its ever-increasing taxation, the NDP-Liberal government has extracted money from Canadians. Two, the Auditor General found that Liberal appointees gave 400 million tax dollars to their own companies, involving 186 conflicts of interest. Three, representatives elected in the House by Canadians told the NDP-Liberal government to provide the unredacted documents to the police so they could investigate the scandal. Four, the NDP-Liberal government continues to refuse to release the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791116">There we have it. The NDP-Liberal government took money from Canadians and gave the money to their buddies, and now they refuse to provide the documents of the scandal to the police because apparently the government has something to hide. The Speaker of this House, who operates like a referee in our proceedings, has even ruled that the NDP-Liberal cover-up violates the order made by the majority of MPs sent here by Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791117"> What does this latest scandal mean for Canadians? Rather than being focused on developing laws and policies supporting the lives of Canadians, the time of the House of Commons has been focused on trying to resolve the latest NDP-Liberal government scandal. I do not say this to diminish the importance of shining the light of truth to expose what lies beneath the government cover-up, because doing so in this matter is indeed essential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791118">Many Canadians will recall the Liberal sponsorship scandal and that two Auditor General reports and a public inquiry revealed that ad agency executives and Liberal Party officials had corruptly handled more than $300 million, $100 million of which was funnelled from the government to the Liberal Party. Nearly 20 years ago, the sponsorship scandal was exposed because Conservatives forced the matter and insisted on exposing the truth, and today, here we are again insisting on the truth being illuminated in the NDP-Liberal government green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791119"> For Canadians, the green slush fund scandal also means $400 million was wasted or stolen at a time when many Canadians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. It means $400 million was wasted or stolen at a time when communities are struggling to deal with the housing crisis, the opioid epidemic and aging infrastructure that needs to be strengthened to withstand severe weather events and natural disasters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791120">Now, $400 million is a big figure. When I speak with, and receive emails and calls from, the good people of North Okanagan—Shuswap, they are absolutely astonished by this massive amount of money that was misappropriated. They are astonished because there are so many ways that those funds could have been allocated to benefit citizens who earned these tax dollars in the first place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791121">The $400 million could have gone a long way in supporting local governments to increase climate adaptation of infrastructure to protect our communities from the effects of flooding. The $400 million could have helped prevent the destruction by natural disasters like the East Adams Lake and Bush Creek East wildfires that ravaged the North Shuswap in 2023. The $400 million could have gone a long way in capitalizing wildfire training and equipment. Instead, 1,200 residents in the Shuswap had to face the fiery infernos of 2023 and contend with rebuilding 176 destroyed homes and restoring another 50 homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791122">A lingering, lethal threat of wildfires is the persistent threat of landslides. The $400 million could have supported assessments and actions to help the Shuswap with recovery in the short term and prevent more natural disasters in the long term, but the NDP-Liberal government chose to send $400 million to its friends through the green slush fund scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791123">No community in Canada has evaded the ongoing opioid crisis that has claimed over 47,000 lives since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ascended to power with his misguided policies. Conservatives have consistently pleaded for common-sense policies and federal resources for addictions treatment, but the NDP-Liberal government in Ottawa and the NDP government in Victoria have ignored common sense and subjected our communities and vulnerable citizens to dangerous hard-drug experiments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791124">As the House of Commons, and as representatives of all Canadians, we must guard against becoming unaffected by the lives lost every single day in communities of all sizes across our nation. We must resolve to learn from the failures of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Premier Eby. The $400 million could have provided new addictions treatment capacities to save lives, but instead, these dollars were prioritized for the green slush fund, to be delivered to NDP-Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791125">There are also acute needs for increased mental health services in communities across Canada. These needs could have been served if the $400 million provided through the green slush fund had been directed to supporting expansions of mental health services in Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic, government lockdowns and social divisions stoked by the NDP-Liberal government took a toll on Canadians. Inflation and never-ending tax hikes have made life in Canada more expensive than it has ever been. This has taken, and continues to take, a toll on Canadians. While the NDP-Liberal government pats itself on the back for saddling generations of Canadians with unprecedented levels of public debt, Canadians see their standard of living being eroded.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791126"> Home ownership is a mere fantasy for most young adults in Canada. All these NDP-Liberal government policy outcomes are undermining mental health across our country. Let us imagine the mental health services that could have been expanded by the infusion of the $400 million that was sent to the NDP-Liberal insiders through the green slush fund. The ongoing NDP-Liberal government cover-up suggests the government is hiding the documents from the police for a reason. The government cannot explain why it blew $400 million in yet another scandal rather than making a positive difference for mental health services. Shame on the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791127">The NDP-Liberal government talks a big game when it comes to the housing crisis, but it chose the green slush fund scandal over homes for Canadians. In order to accelerate construction of new homes, we need more Canadians certified in the skilled trades. This reality is not a new concept; it has been known for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791128">Let us imagine how many Canadians could have been trained and certified in a skilled trade with the support of $400 million. We are talking about helping Canadians acquire the skill and certifications they need to help other Canadians. Who could oppose this common-sense approach? The NDP-Liberal government will talk the talk when it comes to building new homes, supporting workers and training for the trades, but the green slush fund scandal is proof positive that it will not walk the walk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791129">When given the choice between supporting skilled workers in Canada to build new homes and using the green slush fund scandal, it siphoned off $400 million for its buddies. The NDP-Liberal government chose that. Four hundred million dollars could have supported the training and certification of thousands of skilled workers in Canada, but instead, it chose the scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791130">Across Canada, there are people holding professional credentials from other countries, but they cannot perform the professional work they are trained in because their credentials are not recognized in Canada. There is a lot of professional training and talent that goes to waste every single day in Canada, including in professions and sectors that are desperately needing trained personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791131">Rather than developing creative ways of delivering hundreds of millions of dollars to insiders, why did the NDP-Liberal government not develop creative ways of unleashing this unused professional training? If foreign credentials and training have had parity with those in Canada, why are those credentials not recognized? If foreign credentials and training do not meet Canadian standards, why is the NDP-Liberal government not investing in a system for assessing and upgrading foreign credentials? Let us imagine all of the unrecognized professionals in Canada who could have been moved towards the profession of their training with the $400 million doled out by the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791132">Water and waste-water treatment systems are essential for sustaining our communities and ensuring our waters are protected from untreated sewage. In 2012, the Harper government implemented Canada's first-ever national standards for waste-water treatment: the waste-water system effluent regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791133">As part of the implementation of the regulations, compliance deadlines were set for waste-water systems that did not meet the new standards. The deadlines were set up to allow time for municipalities to plan and budget funds to complete the upgrades and bring their waste-water systems up to the new standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791134">Today, 12 years after the Harper government implemented the waste-water treatment standards, communities large and small across Canada have yet to achieve the standards. Why?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8791135"> First, the Liberal government, propped up by the NDP, pushed the compliance deadlines far down the road. This was done by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278575" Type="2">North Vancouver</Affiliation> when he was the environment minister. Second, the government has failed to prioritize the support for upgrading waste-water treatment systems. The $400 million the NDP-Liberal government allocated to its pals through the green slush fund could have assisted local governments in advancing their waste-water treatment systems closer to compliance. We all know that this is not what the NDP-Liberal government chose to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791136">In addition to representing North Okanagan—Shuswap, I am also honoured to serve as the official opposition's associate shadow minister for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, recreational and west coast, and as vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, FOPO.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791137">My hon. colleagues at the FOPO committee, and each of the six fisheries ministers shuffled into the role by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, know I am a strong advocate for preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species, AIS, in Canada's waters. AIS pose acute threats to fish, wildlife and habitats, and acute threats to biodiversity. Over the past nine years, it has been concluded by FOPO members and witnesses that preventing the spread of AIS must be a priority because the cost of prevention is nothing compared to the permanent harms that AIS can inflict on ecologies, economies and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791138">Earlier this year, the government removed its funding from the B.C. government's invasive mussel defence program that inspects and treats watercraft, followed by cuts to AIS prevention and inspection stations along B.C.'s borders. I pressed the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">fisheries minister</Affiliation> on this illogical and short-sighted funding cut, and she responded that zebra and quagga mussels are present across Canada. This statement was blatantly false and it was shocking; zebra and quagga mussels have not been located in Canada west of Manitoba, which is why we need to protect western waters through prevention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791139">Regardless, the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> cut funding to AIS prevention inspections in B.C. Just last week, it was reported that whirling disease, a parasite causing defects and death in salmonids, was detected in Kootenay Lake. I cannot help but wonder whether the spread of whirling disease in B.C. could have been prevented had the government prioritized AIS prevention. The $400 million in the green slush fund could have helped protect B.C.'s water from the invasive species and parasites that decimate fish populations and habitats, but the NDP-Liberal government chose otherwise.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8791145"> Mr. Speaker, I first posed this question in question period on October 11, and surprisingly enough, I did not get a satisfactory response. By way of background, I was the only member of Parliament who obtained intervenor status in the National Energy Board hearings on the proposed Kinder Morgan pipeline. I think it is safe to say I am the only Canadian who read all of the so-called evidence submitted by Kinder Morgan. I am very familiar with this file, in other words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791146"> I was shocked when we bought and then built the pipeline, at a waste of $34 billion, but through this whole thing, the City of Burnaby was consistent in saying it must not expand. Regarding the Burnaby tank farm, which consists of tanks of diluted bitumen and other fossil-fuel products that are highly flammable, the Burnaby Fire Department was consistent in saying it did not have the capacity to put out a tank farm fire. It also pointed out that for Simon Fraser University and various communities at the top of the mountain, there is only one road out in the event of fire. There is a significant risk to life and limb. In other words, the community of Burnaby had been, maybe one would say, a thorn in the side of this project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791147"> To my horror, of course, the Government of Canada, as I mentioned, bought the project and built the project, and now all Canadians, all of us in this room, share in one thing if nothing else: We own the Trans Mountain pipeline. We have wasted all this money on it, and now, as we discovered the same week I asked the question on October 11, with our tax dollars at work, we have bribed the City of Burnaby to stop criticizing the pipeline and not mention anymore the risk of fire that would threaten the communities of Burnaby, particularly Simon Fraser University on Burnaby Mountain. What Trans Mountain did was offer $21 million over 20 years, and along with that came a gag order on the people of Burnaby not to criticize the pipeline anymore. They are not allowed to say anything about the Kinder Morgan, now Trans Mountain, pipeline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791148">It is astonishing that we would, as a federal government, pour $34 billion into violating indigenous rights and ignoring the various concerns for the environment about what would happen, or will happen because it is more of a certainty than a potential risk, if there were a spill of diluted bitumen, which behaves very differently in a marine environment than even the most horrible of crude oil spills, like <I>Exxon Valdez</I>. We also have the risk of a tank farm fire in Burnaby.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791149"> The answer I got from the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was certainly very generous and nice about my reputation as a climate activist, but it failed to answer the question: Did the government know about this? Did the federal cabinet understand that our Crown corporation, Trans Mountain, was prepared to put $21 million into stopping the people of Burnaby from being protected and their fire department from speaking out about this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791150"> For those who are watching this, I ask them to go to Google and google this: “Only one bear in a hundred bites, but they don't come in order”. This is a very instructive video about the nature of tank farm fires around the world, produced by that old folk singer, my hero, Bob Bossin, who lives on Gabriola Island and knows whereof he speaks.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8791151"> Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the question is no and no, but let me go on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791152">As the hon. member knows, Trans Mountain Corporation is governed by an independent board of directors and not directly by the government. The board has broad authority for corporate governance strategy and nominates several committees to oversee specific specialized areas. Trans Mountain Corporation operates as a commercial entity and has been clear that it is committed to meaningful engagement and effective relationships with communities all along the pipeline expansion corridor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791153">In October, TMC and the City of Burnaby shared a community contribution agreement that will benefit the residents of Burnaby through collaboration on an enhanced emergency response and safety plan. The details of this agreement include, as the hon. member said, Trans Mountain contributing $20.1 million to the city. Burnaby's mayor, Mike Hurley, said that he and any member of council are allowed to speak freely about this project and the contribution agreement itself. I know that those two parties worked closely to determine the details of this agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791154"> Obviously, the government acquired the Trans Mountain Corporation and the Trans Mountain expansion project in 2018, because we knew it was a serious and necessary investment. The pipeline will continue to benefit our economy and Canadians, including those in communities like Burnaby, by providing good jobs, generating significant revenues each year and being an integral part of Canada's long-term energy infrastructure as Canada and the world transition to net zero. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791155">To support this transition to net zero, since 2015, the federal government has committed over $160 billion to build Canada's clean economy and reduce emissions, and has invested significant additional resources to protect the environment and conserve nature. As the expansion project generates cash flow, the federal government will continue to invest in creating good-paying jobs and accelerating the development and deployment of clean energy and clean technology. The project has also created, and is continuing to create, economic benefits for families and many indigenous communities through contracting, financial compensation, and employment and training. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791156">That is all I will have to say about that. However, just to repeat myself, I could have finished that in 20 seconds. The answer to the hon. member's question is no and no. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791157">Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous to imagine that so many millions of dollars can be spent bribing a municipality not to protect its citizens, and no one in cabinet knows about it. However, that is what happens when we have what is called a “non-budgetary transaction” in which, magically, former finance minister Bill Morneau, without approval from anyone, decided that we have this value of $34 billion over here and we are going to convert it to a value of $34 billion over here in a project that is of dubious value and creates fewer jobs than if somebody locally opened a White Spot restaurant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791158"> We have before us a scandal and a shame, and I am sorry for the hon. parliamentary secretary that he has now associated himself with it. He is not to blame, but the Government of Canada has done something egregious in doing something that Kinder Morgan had already decided was not a profitable project, and this can be proven, but not in the 30 seconds I have left. However, Canadians, as a people, paid for it, and I am afraid we will have to pay for it again in environmental damage. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791163"> Carbon pricing is an important tool to reduce carbon emissions in Canada. It is an important tool to reduce carbon emissions in California. It is an important tool to reduce emissions in the U.S. It is true that the federal government has not imposed a carbon pricing scheme in the U.S., but many states have, which is something the Conservatives are a little shy of telling their constituents when they talk about a carbon pricing model.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791167"> Mr. Speaker, my question from November 8 was on the doublespeak on the government's oil and gas production cut. The <Affiliation DbId="311645" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, at that point in time, responded by telling me that “[the] energy sector can increase its production while decreasing its emissions.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791168"> I actually agree with that part, and I point to the decrease in carbon emissions per barrel demonstrated by Canada's oil and gas industry over the past two decades, through investments in technology and efficiencies. Canada's oil sands have decreased their CO2 emissions by over 32% over the past two decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791169">What does the governing party think success actually looks like in this respect? In the world, our democratic allies asked, and are still asking, for more Canadian oil and gas. The <Affiliation DbId="311645" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> told me, at that point in time, that countries around the world are looking to Canada for less polluting energies. I agree again. That is because we are delivering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791170">The <Affiliation DbId="311645" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> then drifted into Liberal sound-bite fantasyland. He said, “Under the do-nothing approach of the previous Conservative government, Canada's imports of foreign oil were two times higher. It failed to promote Canadian energy.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791171">Did the doubling of production that we have had in this country over the last two decades just turn on magically, overnight, when the Liberals were elected? That is just wrong. Did the reduction in emissions per barrel just happen recently? Again, the data directly contradicts that. He then offered me a briefing on climate change. I know the member's depth on energy and climate change, and I guess I am a little surprised that the Liberal government had him read that statement. I recall that he had a tough time keeping a straight face. A golfer would say about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278751" Type="2">Niagara Centre</Affiliation> that he is known to “fluff a putt”, but he will read whatever nonsense is put in front of him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791172">To the point, every credible organization has clearly stated that the cap would cost Canada around one million barrels per day of production, which would immediately be met with less environmentally responsible production from around the world, and 150,000 jobs would be lost. Billions of dollars of GDP would be lost, and there would be a sinking Canadian dollar, with higher deficits and Canadian poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791173">For the environmental result, let me refer to the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development's words on the government's results. Two months ago he said, “The recent decreases to projected 2030 emissions were not due to climate actions taken by governments but were instead because of revisions to the data or methods used in modelling.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791174">This is all make-believe. All these experts that the government has been paying hundreds of millions of dollars to have accomplished nothing at the end of the day. It is about shutting down or about making it more onerous to produce oil in Canada versus every other jurisdiction in the world. Every other jurisdiction is prospering, while Canada is under the boot of the Liberal government to try to produce the resources for the benefit of the whole world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791175">Our emissions are going down. Our production is going up. We need to make sure that we can do more to continue on that path to provide a better environmental result for the world and a better economic result for all Canadians. I ask this to the member across the way again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791176">How in the world can they say that this production cap has anything to do with emissions?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8791177"> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to remind my hon. colleague that we are the only government to have built a pipeline to tidewater, something the previous Conservative governments and the oil and gas promoters on that side have never done. It is funny, because they laugh and scream, but they never were able to do it. We found the right formula. We understood that balance: the environment and the economy go hand in hand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791178">That is why the Government of Canada is putting a cap on greenhouse gas pollution from the oil and gas sector. That is a normal thing to do. Canada will be the first oil and gas producing country to do so. Our government published proposed regulations in November.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791179"> If the opposition members had their way, they would just let the sector pollute for free. We do not agree on this side of the House. They can challenge us on a policy, but they are still light on policy. All they have is five slogans. Until they showcase a policy, we can have an informed debate on this particular issue, but they still have nothing on the other side. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791180">The greenhouse gas pollution cap will ensure that the sector invests in the maximum technically achievable decarbonization in order to achieve significant emissions reductions by 2030 and to get on a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050. This is good for consumers around the world. If we are able to get to net zero, Canada will be able to promote its oil and gas sector, because that is what consumers around the world are asking for. It is possible. Of course, if we use the technology of today it is not possible. However, we have full confidence that the people, and the sector, will be able to succeed in this challenge.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791181">We have faith in the people and the industry to rise to this challenge. On this side of the House, we believe in technology, but we need to challenge the industry. That is why we have set this target.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8791182"> Cap and trade is a proven market-based approach that has been used successfully around the world to reduce emissions. Quebec, California and Ontario at one point had a cap-and-trade system. Quebec and California still have a cap-and-trade system and their economies did not fall. They are doing very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791183">Over time, the government gives out fewer allowances. To comply, facilities must reduce their emissions or buy allowances from other facilities that have reduced their emissions. I am explaining the cap-and-trade system, a mechanism that has been in place for a long time in Canada, especially in Quebec and Ontario, and California.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791184">The government will continue to work closely with industry, provinces, territories, indigenous groups and other stakeholders to set a realistic, technically achievable goal for the sector. We want industries to use better technologies and improve efficiency. This will allow oil and gas producers to maintain or even grow production while lowering pollution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791185">On this side of the House, we believe a cap-and-trade system is the right system and we know the oil and gas sector in Alberta will continue to flourish. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8791186">Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my colleague across the way misunderstood my question, but we are talking about real metrics here, not hoped-for inventions that will come along in the next little while. This is six years down the road the Liberals are talking about with this cap, in 2030 versus 2024, and a million-barrel cut from what we are producing now, which is a significant part of the economy of Canada. Things pay the bills in this country and it is the oil and gas industry that is the biggest taxpayer across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791187">I am going to tell my colleague the response from people around the country to what is happening. His own <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> does not really seem to know much about the environment but is a well-placed mole for the NGOs that are in the environmental organization, making lots of money from what the government has put out. The minister actually said, “Look around the world, no other major oil and gas producer is doing what we’re doing.” Then a fund manager from Canada says, “‘Well, why is that?’ It’s economic idiocy.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8791188">Does my colleague across the way understand and potentially agree with that?</ParaText>

I wonder if Freon would have disappeared in Canada when we had acid rain if Brian Mulroney had just sat on his hands and not worked with the U.S. administration to do something. They did something. They banned Freon. They put a price on CFCs because there was a rationale to do so. </ParaText>
