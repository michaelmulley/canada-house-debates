              <ParaText id="7762707">Mr. Speaker, as someone who strongly supports women's rights, including a woman's right to choose, I was thrilled that our government invested $4.1 million to support organizations that help women receive reproductive health services, and that budget 2023 has carved out $36 million over three years to renew the sexual and reproductive health fund to make abortions and other sexual and reproductive health care information and services available and accessible to more Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762708"> In contrast, the Conservatives are hell-bent on restricting access to safe and legal abortion, under every false legislative pretext they can imagine. The Conservatives have shown us, time and again, that they think reproductive rights are negotiable. The latest example of this is Bill <Document DbId="12174725" Type="4">C-311</Document>. This bill is a transparent attempt to reopen the abortion debate in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762710">Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the famous Vachon snack cakes and their bakery, which is located in Sainte-Marie in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762711">In 1923, Rose‑Anna Giroux started a business by buying a bakery for $7,000 so that her children, who were living in the United States, would come back home. Bread sales were going well, but Rose‑Anna decided to diversify by making some sweet treats on the wood stove of her modest home. The rest is history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762712">The bakery has employed and continues to employ many families in Beauce. Located in the heart of town, the bakery has faced many challenges, including frequent floods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762713">For 100 years, and thanks to substantial recent investments from Bimbo Canada, the bakery has rolled up its sleeves and fired up its ovens again while remaining in the downtown core, just a few hundred metres from where it all began in the little house where Rose‑Anna and Joseph Arcade Vachon lived. I commend the entire team for their achievements and congratulate them on their 100th anniversary. Long live the Vachon bakery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762714">I also want to acknowledge the excellent work of the interpreters in the House of Commons. Today, my speech was interpreted by Émilie Vachon, the great-granddaughter of the founders of the Vachon bakery.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762716">Anyone who has crossed paths with Al would say that it is simply impossible to list all his contributions to our community. His necrology says, “‘Big Al’ was a fixture in the community; much like the local parks, nature trails, hockey rinks and tennis courts he helped build. He was a tireless advocate for Petrie Island, a beautiful oasis he helped develop in the east end.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762717"> As an Orléans resident and its representative, I had the privilege of collaborating with this great advocate of nature, the environment and education. I thank Al for teaching us the importance of caring for our environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762720">Ms. Garceau founded the Festival de contes et légendes en Abitibi‑Témiscamingue in 2003. This fall festival celebrates storytelling and the spoken word, with events held both in Val‑d'Or and on the road in towns and villages across the region. It features both local and international storytellers. The festival will mark its 20th anniversary in 2023. It is thanks to this woman of words and images that many people have had the chance to set foot on the stage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762726">Mr. Speaker, jurors play an integral role in our justice system, often at a considerable personal cost, from being away from family and work to suffering from mental health issues after a difficult trial. Nothing can fully prepare someone for jury service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762727"> Earlier this year, a bill that I championed to better support juror mental health became law, but there is still lots of work to do. The federal government has a key leadership role in working with the provinces and territories to bolster juror supports, and there needs to be greater public awareness. That is why I fully support Bill <Document DbId="11949691" Type="4">S-252</Document> to dedicate the second week of May as national jury duty appreciation week.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762734">Victory is the only option for Ukraine, but it is also the only option for Canada. If we want to stop genocide, global food shortages and global inflation, and if we want to protect our own sovereignty and security, we must ensure that Ukraine achieves a decisive victory. That means that Ukraine wins the war by ensuring that it recovers all of its territory and that it wins the peace, which means that it is secure as part of NATO, that we help Ukraine rebuild, that Russia pays for that rebuild and that there is justice for Russian war crimes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7762737">Mr. Speaker, catch-and-release for repeat violent offenders and decriminalizing hard drugs have boosted violent crime and drug overdoses across the country. In downtown Calgary, I can see the impact first-hand. Property crime is up 65%. Addictions and homelessness are up. Most troubling is that deaths from overdose went up. People have stopped taking the CTrain because it is not safe. Seniors have told me they are more isolated because they do not feel safe on the street. It is simply not working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762738">What is working is the Alberta model, a system of care developed by the Alberta government over the past three years that is centred on transforming addiction treatment to focus on long-term recovery. The world is watching Alberta succeed, and is taking note. Recovery is possible, and everyone should be supported in getting the care they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7762739">The federal government also needs to do its part. The Liberals need to address the bail reform which has been called for by law enforcement and by victim advocates across the country. A Conservative government would reverse easy access to bail and ensure that serious, repeat violent offenders remain behind bars as they await trial.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">WHEREAS: The war on the Tigray region of Ethiopia has led to more than 63,000 refugees fleeing to camps in neighboring Sudan, 2.2 million civilians internally displaced, and over 91% of the 6 million people in need of assistance; The forces of Ethiopia and invading forces of Eritrea and Amhara region have jointly waged another round of atrocities, war crimes, and crimes against humanity on civilians in Tigray; The war on Tigray has resulted in a man-made famine. The World Food Program estimates that 5.2 million people, 91% of Tigray's population, need emergency food assistance. Due to the siege and blockade, the people of Tigray are denied access to humanitarian aid and basic services; Sexual Gender-Based Violence has been systematically used as a weapon of war in Tigray by Eritrean troops, Ethiopian forces, and Amhara regional forces; and Since November 2020, Canada has provided $54.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia for the crisis in Tigray. It is more likely that this assistance will be used by the Government of Ethiopia to purchase military armaments, including drones, instead of addressing the humanitarian needs in Tigray and other parts of Ethiopia. We, the undersigned citizens of Canada, call upon the House of Commons to: Immediately call on the Eritrean government to stop invading the Tigray region of Ethiopia and withdraw its forces from Tigray; Immediately call for unfettered humanitarian access to Tigray. Call for humanitarian discussion under Resolution 2417 (2018); Immediately withhold all non-life-saving funding from Canada to Ethiopia until the cessation of violence is achieved; Provide an update on how funds for humanitarian assistance Canada has been given to Ethiopia in support of the people affected in the Tigray region; and Immediately call to allow the UN-led inquiry commission to enter the Tigray region to conduct its investigation on crimes against humanity, war crimes, and humanitarian and human rights violations committed in Tigray.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="7763050">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), ESDC activities relating to the temporary foreign worker, TFW, program are funded not through fee revenues, but through voted appropriations, for which the government must seek Parliament’s approval annually through an appropriation act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763051">Labour market impact assessment, LMIA, fee collections constitute non-respendable revenues, which are returned to the government’s consolidated revenue fund. The LMIA fee is intended to help recoup costs associated with the administration of the TFW program. This includes activities related to processing of LMIA applications, as well as program compliance-related costs intended to ensure employers are abiding by program rules and temporary foreign workers are protected while in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763052">There are fee exemptions set out for certain LMIA applications, most notably, those made under the program’s primary agriculture stream. Positions in primary agriculture are exempt, given the industry’s long-standing domestic labour supply challenges and the potential downstream effects on national food security. As a result, the LMIA fee, which is exempt from the Services Fee Act, helps the TFW program operate on a partial cost-recovery basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763053">With regard to part (b), as per ESDC’s 2023-24 departmental plan, specifically its consolidated future-oriented statement of operations, unaudited, for the year ending March 31, 2024, the total amount of fees projected to be collected is $129,288,000 for 2022-23 and $133,338,000 for 2023-24.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763054">Revenue forecasts may not ultimately align with actuals. Program revenues are dependent on program volumes, i.e., LMIA applications, which are dependent on labour market trends, i.e., employer demand for temporary foreign workers. Historical indicators are leveraged in forecasting program volumes/revenues. However, given the evolving nature of the labour market and the difficulty in forecasting labour market shocks, i.e., COVID-19, actuals may differ from forecasts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763055">With regard to part (c), LMIA fee collections constitute non-respendable revenues, meaning that the TFW program does not have the authority to spend fee collections. Fee revenues are deposited directly into the government’s consolidated revenue fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763056">With regard to part (d), the LMIA fee only serves to recoup costs associated with the TFW program, including activities related to processing of LMIA applications and program compliance-related costs, e.g., employer inspections. Costs unrelated to the administration of the TFW program are not recouped via the LMIA fee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763063">Mr. Speaker, as the industry pivots towards electric vehicles, anchoring these firms in Canada is critical to the Canadian economy and ensuring a resilient domestic supply chain. This is why the government has committed to making strong investments in this area. As a result, Volkswagen is investing $7 billion to establish its first overseas electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in St. Thomas, Ontario. The plant, Volkswagen’s largest to date, will create up to 3,000 direct jobs and tens of thousands more in indirect jobs. Once complete in 2027, the plant will produce batteries for up to one million electric vehicles per year, bolstering Canada’s domestic battery manufacturing capacity to meet the demand for electric vehicles now and into the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763064">Canada is deepening its investments in EV batteries to position itself as a global leader, with Volkswagen as an important player in the production of EV batteries and supporting the development of a sustainable domestic battery manufacturing sector in Canada.</ParaText>

The Province of Ontario is likewise supporting the investment to establish this greenfield assembly plant with $500 million in direct incentives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763066">In addition, the Government of Canada has committed to providing PowerCo with a production incentive, matching that for which it would be eligible in the U.S. under the Inflation Reduction Act’s advanced manufacturing production credit. Consistent with the U.S. incentive, Canada’s support will be for those battery cells produced and sold and will phase out by 25 percentage points every year beginning in 2030. After 2032, the credit would be eliminated. The agreement also has the flexibility to be adjusted should the U.S. advanced manufacturing production credit change over time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763070">Mr. Speaker, since 2016, to help expand Canada’s electric vehicle, EV, charging network to the scale required, the federal government continues to invest in charging infrastructure through NRCan’s electric vehicle and alternative fuel infrastructure deployment initiative, EVAFIDI. For details, please see https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/transportation-alternative-fuels/electric-and-alternative-fuel-infrastructure/electric-vehicle-alternative-fuels-infrastructure-deployment-initiative/18352. It provided funding to organizations to help establish a coast-to-coast network of EV fast chargers along core routes and highways through NRCan’s zero emission vehicle infrastructure program, ZEVIP. For details, please see https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/transportation-alternative-fuels/zero-emission-vehicle-infrastructure-program/21876. It provides funding to increase the availability of local charging options where Canadians live, work and play, in public places, on street, and in multi-unit residential buildings, workplaces and vehicle fleets. The Canada Infrastructure Bank, CIB, will be investing $500 million in large-scale charging and refuelling infrastructure that is revenue generating and in the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763071">The charging investments fit in the greater, comprehensive approach of the Government of Canada to support this ZEV transition.

The range of speeds of the latter are indicated as being between 50 and 99 kilowatts, kW. These figures are for projects that are already installed or in the very late stages of project completion. They represent 12,153 stations installed or soon to be installed, totalling over $183 million invested by the federal programs to date. Program officials have given the initial commitment for more chargers, although details are still being finalized. Including this latter category, the government has committed to 34,666 chargers and funding of over $277 million.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763076">Mr. Speaker, the GeoCAT program supports the transfer of geothermal project development knowledge to local indigenous groups and community representatives, who in turn will assess community-specific infrastructure and interest for geothermal project development. Given the program provides capacity-building funding, benefits to geothermal energy projects will be indirect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763077">Based on the program description, 50% of the funding will support awareness of community geothermal opportunities and 50% will support the development and delivery of training modules to acquire skills and tools to lead or advance community development opportunities. No funds will be used for other project components.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7763102">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document> on the modernization of the Official Languages Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763103">As members know, this is a historic moment. It has been a long time since we have reviewed this legislation, 35 years to be exact. As the member for Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook, I want to tell my colleagues that I did all of my schooling in English because there was no French school. We did not have this essential protection at the time. My children, however, were able to do all of their schooling, from kindergarten to grade 12, in French. What a change. That was made possible because of the first Official Languages Act in 1969. Thanks to that, my grandchildren will also be able to complete all of their schooling in French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763104">I want to tell my colleagues that this was a very long process. First, there was the Official Languages Act in 1969. Section 23 was added to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982 and changes were made to the act in 1988. Then, as members know, Bill <Document DbId="11420727" Type="3">C‑32</Document>, which sought to strengthen the Official Languages Act, died on the Order Paper. Now, we are back with Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document>, which underwent a number of essential changes in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763105">As I see it, the most important thing is that the act will have to be reviewed every 10 years. We will not have to wait 35 years. The procedure has already been established. The Minister of Canadian Heritage, in consultation with the President of the Treasury Board, will have to undertake a review, a comprehensive analysis of the enhancement of the vitality of the communities. They will examine whether we have achieved our objective of protecting and promoting the French language. They will also examine whether sectors that are essential to enhancing the vitality of Quebec's francophones and anglophones, including health, immigration, employment and French-language education from early childhood to the post-secondary level, have been respected. A report will have to be tabled in the House of Commons. In my opinion, this is a well-regimented procedure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763106">Let us start with the Treasury Board. It is the most important machine in Parliament. Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document> would make the optional powers, duties and responsibilities mandatory, which is essential. The Treasury Board will have some meaningful work to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763107">Other improvements were made in committee. They are very important to mention. Every community across the country asked that there be a central agency, a minister responsible, and we can now check that off the list. What is more, the minister cannot withdraw from their responsibilities or delegate them. The Treasury Board and the minister will have to ensure compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763108">As far as justice is concerned, Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document> confirms that justices of the Supreme Court of Canada have to be bilingual. Still today, the Conservatives do not agree with that and do not want that to happen. I do not understand it. In committee, progress was also made on appointing justices to superior courts and appeal courts. It is extremely important. We have to take into account people's needs in terms of access to justice. The Canadian Bar Association and the Fédération des associations de juristes d'expression française de common law have been asking for that for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763109">Let us talk about immigration. In my opinion, this is the perfect example. When we started working on Bill <Document DbId="11420727" Type="3">C‑32</Document>, having a policy was important. When we moved on to Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document>, ensuring that the policy had some content, some details, was important. Finally, in committee, we determined that not only did we need details, but we also needed to ensure that the demographic weight was restored and increased. It is going to be a game of catch-up and we will have to increase our newcomer target to 8% or 9% and then go back to our target of 4.4% or better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763110">Let us move on to real estate. I am quite pleased because this was a problem for 20, 25, 30 years across Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763111">I can say that now, because of the amendments that were made, the government has to consider the needs of the school community, which was not the case before. It is great to have a charter of rights that recognizes the right to education in French, but if land cannot be purchased, how and where are we supposed to build schools? It is not possible. Now, this will be guaranteed. It will no longer be an option, but an obligation, for the government to do something that is essential. It must consult the school boards about their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763112">I can cite examples such as the Jericho lands and Heather Street lands in Vancouver, Royal Roads in Victoria, Lagimodière Boulevard in Winnipeg, or Oxford Street in Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763113">With respect to the language clause or the positive measures, the Standing Committee on Official Languages has made a lot of progress. It is not perfect, but it made a lot of progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763114">When agreements are being negotiated, those involved, such as school boards or the organizations concerned, must be consulted. It is important to ensure that there is accountability, and that when money is earmarked for a certain organization or a certain location, it ends up there. Major progress has been made in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763115">The Commissioner of Official Languages has been given significantly increased powers. Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> of course gives him the power to impose penalties and to make orders. This does not mean that violators will have to pay billions of dollars in penalties, but the idea is that anyone who has to pay $10, $100, $1,000 or $10,000 will be called out. That is very important. We are also giving the commissioner other powers and additional tools to do his job, which is to protect and promote the French language, and that is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763116">Now, I must say, there are areas where we did not accomplish as much as we would have liked, and that hurts. On enumeration, we were not able to get it done the way we wanted. Nevertheless, we added that question to the short form census two years ago, which means that everyone had to answer it. We still have that data, which will be good for 10 years. I am confident that if the Liberals are still in power in 10 years, we will be able to achieve and cement this. This is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763117">As I mentioned, the language clauses and positive measures are not what I would have liked, but we did make some progress, and I would like to thank the opposition parties for helping us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763118">I also realize that English-speaking Quebeckers have some concerns that deserve mentioning. However, I can assure you that our government is going to defend linguistic duality and the rights of anglophone Quebeckers in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763119">We will continue to provide funding, protect language and culture, and ensure the court challenges program is kept in place and adequately funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763120">I am extremely proud to commend the government and the opposition for doing a great job and for the work done and the progress made on bills <Document DbId="11420727" Type="3">C‑32</Document> and C‑13 at the Standing Committee on Official Languages. It truly is a team effort. I am very proud of the House and, as always, ready to answer questions. </ParaText>

I will tell the House what they did. For the action plan, there was zero increase for 10 years. Under the Liberals, there was $1.4 billion. The Conservatives made cuts to the court challenges program that ensures that rights are protected. They made spending cuts to the Translation Bureau and they even cancelled the long-form census. It is incredible.</ParaText>

I might understand it one day. We know that it was the monarchy that ordered the deportation of Acadians. They are fervent defenders of Canada, even though French is prohibited in almost every Canadian province, except for Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763130">The member is very pleased with the results of the Official Languages Act, which was passed in 1969. This same law has performed so many miracles that the French-speaking population in Canada continues to steadily decline. The number of people whose mother tongue is French and the number of people who speak French at home is declining. In the member's province, Nova Scotia, about one in two people whose mother tongue is French speak it at home. That means that one in two people have already lost their language and cannot pass it on to the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763131">I wonder if the member opposite is deluding himself that the Canadian government is not killing French in North America. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763135">Not only that, but we had no French schools before 1969.

              <ParaText id="7763143">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak on a subject that is near and dear to my heart, namely, official languages, and the French language in particular. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763144">First of all, I hope everyone can hear my Saguenay accent, because I am very proud of it. There are many types of linguistic variations: morphological, syntactic, diachronic. Speakers choose a certain word and not another, and the reason for their choice is mainly due to their age or geographic location. Therefore, I hope that everyone understands that, when I speak, my lexicon is tinged, shaped by my regional roots in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. I am proud to be someone from the Saguenay who says “là là” every once in a while.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763145">No matter where we come from, language unites, brings us together and creates a feeling of community. Regardless of a person's accent, the expressions they use or the words they choose, French speakers are vectors of a true linguistic treasure. This language that we share and love so much is a legacy that has been bequeathed to us and of which we can be very proud. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763146">As members can see, I care deeply about my language. I learned enough English to have a foundation, but there is nothing like proudly carrying the voice of my constituents in Ottawa in French. French has always been a big part of my identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763147">I want to talk a little bit about linguistic identity, because that concept really resonates with me. I have never been embarrassed to identify myself as a francophone anywhere in the country or in the world. If someone were to ask me to describe myself in a few words, one of the adjectives I would use would obviously be “francophone”. Being francophone is part of my identity. It guides me and is part of who I am. Language allows us to express our thoughts and feelings, to communicate with those we love, to exchange opinions, to open up to the world. Language is one of the tools of our trade as politicians. We must use our language skills to debate, to denounce the things we disagree with and to support what we think is right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763148">Language is more than important; it is essential, hence the importance of promoting the richness of our two official languages across the country. That is why I am very pleased to rise in the House and begin the discussion on Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> to amend the Official Languages Act. Specifically, this conversation is relevant and necessary, because the Liberals have proposed a number of amendments. I was actually quite surprised when I saw the list of Liberal amendments, because I thought the <Affiliation DbId="278926" Type="4">Minister of Official Languages</Affiliation> was insisting that the bill be passed as quickly as possible, because it was supposedly ready to be voted on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763149">I even remember that just a few months ago, the minister wanted to remove witnesses from the list of the Standing Committee on Official Languages when it was studying the bill. She did not think it was a good idea to hear from experts on such an important issue. We are talking about linguistics professors from several universities, stakeholders and people on the ground. She wanted to move a motion that was nothing more than a gag order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763150">As a result of the pressure applied by my colleague and friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278452" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation>, whom I would like to thank once more, we fortunately obtained more time for witnesses at the Standing Committee on Official Languages to continue studying the bill. The minister took a strictly political approach and wanted to end debate. As usual, the Liberals make it a priority to advance their political agenda and, this time, it was at the expense of bilingualism and the protection of French in Canada. The minister mentioned several times that she wanted to speed up debate on Bill C‑13 and pass it as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763151">It seems to me that anyone who wants to pass a bill quickly does not move 10 motions. What is more, why move so many motions in amendment if the bill is considered ready to be passed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763152">The <Affiliation DbId="278926" Type="4">Minister of Official Languages</Affiliation> is being very contradictory on this file, but contradiction is not exactly out of character for the Liberals. The good news is that the Conservatives are here to fix the Liberals' broken promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763153">As far as Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document> is concerned, I hope that the minister does not really believe that her bill will slow the decline of French. They keep making things up as they go along. It makes us wonder if the minister truly understands the issue of Canada's official languages. If she went out there to talk to the communities involved, the people who are living in linguistic insecurity daily, she would see that she is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763154">Linguistic insecurity can be described as feeling uneasy, uncomfortable, even anxious about using one's mother tongue in an environment where they are not the majority. Obviously, that concept has become a hot topic for official language minority communities and Bill C‑13 is not exactly going to make them feel less linguistic insecurity. The content of this bill is not a big step forward for francophones outside Quebec or those in Quebec either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763155">Most of the amendments proposed by stakeholders, including the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada and the Commissioner of Official Languages, were not even heard by the Liberals. Ignoring the observations made by the people on the ground who are directly affected by Bill C‑13 shows a complete lack of respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763156">However, the Liberal-NDP coalition is not listening to Canadians. Once again, it only wants to advance its own political agenda. It wants to check Bill C‑13 off the list and move on to the next item.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763157">Let me assure all the stakeholders we met with that the Conservative Party is here. We listened to them, and we have worked hard to incorporate their requests and their demands into this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763158">I would like to remind the House of a few Conservative amendments that were unfortunately rejected. First of all, we wanted to expand the powers of the Commissioner of Official Languages. It is vital to enhance the commissioner's ability to perform the duties of that position. Right now, the commissioner's powers are too narrow. In practical terms, the commissioner has the power to make orders concerning parts IV, V and VI of the Official Languages Act. The problem is that the very core of the act is in part VII. Part VII is the one that talks about the equality of status of French and English and mechanisms for achieving it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763159">The commissioner must have the power to make orders that will ensure that federal institutions follow through on implementing positive measures, and that these measures do not have a harmful impact on official language minority communities. Bill C‑13 contains nothing but commitments under part VII of the act, without any obligation to achieve results. A lack of results is a tendency we see fairly often among the Liberals. For that reason, we wanted a central agency and expanded powers for the commissioner, to ensure that there is a way to meet the equality of status objective, and because we can by no means rely on the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763160">Then, we wanted to add obligations for federal institutions to take the necessary measures to protect and promote both official languages. The Conservatives were asking for regular, proactive reviews of the act in order to ensure that any necessary adjustments are made in keeping with the linguistic situation at any given time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763161">In short, I am disappointed, not only as a Conservative MP, because my party's amendments were not incorporated into the bill, but also as a francophone. I feel that the government is abandoning Quebeckers, official language speakers in minority settings and the French language altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763162">A Conservative government will ensure that we put a stop to the decline of the French language and that it is promoted across Canada. Bring back common sense.</ParaText>

Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms allows for an override of rights where reasonable in a democratic society. Recourse to the clause when section 1 is otherwise available but deemed insufficient by the legislator is by definition a tacit admission that rights are being unreasonably suppressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763185">The timing of Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> unfortunately intersects with the Legault government's heavy-handed approach to a legitimate objective, which is the strengthening of the French language against unrelenting pressures in the proverbial sea of English, pressures heightened by the new Internet-based communications technologies, a challenge our government is addressing through Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763186">I believe Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> and Bill 96 have been conflated and a narrative has taken root that obscures key facts about this legislation and minority-language guarantees in Canada. Anglophones in Quebec have legitimate grievances with aspects of Bill 96, but Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> is not Bill 96.</ParaText>

In fact, there was an attempt to remove the reference, but that attempt was blocked by the opposition parties in committee.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763193"> Preambles, however, are not the substance of a law. They are not normative, nor determinative. In fact, they have not always been included in Canadian legislation. According to an article by Kent Roach in the McGill Law Journal, between 1985 and 1990, only nine statutes had long and substantive preambles. Since then, there has been an increasing trend to incorporate preambles into legislation. As Mr. Roach puts it, “Once departments and ministries saw their colleagues using preambles, this created a demand for more preambles.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763194">The same article outlined different types and uses of preambles. In some cases, preambles are meant as a recognition of “the complexity...of modern governance” and as “an appeal...to embrace tolerance and diversity as part of what it means to be Canadian.” Roach gives the example of the preamble of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, which states that “the Government of Canada recognizes the diversity of Canadians as regards race, national or ethnic origin, colour and religion as a fundamental characteristic of Canadian society”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763195"> He continues by saying, “The symbolic nature of preambles means that they are often concerned with the politics of recognition” and they “frequently recognize goals that are in some tension with each other.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763196">He then adds, “By definition, preambles will be better in securing expressive as opposed to instrumental purposes because they do not impose rights and duties.” Here is a final quote: “courts have frequently been reluctant to give great weight to preambles.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763197">This all sounds a lot like Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>'s preamble. I will quote from the preamble: “the Government of Canada recognizes the diversity of the provincial and territorial language regimes that contribute to the advancement of the equality of status and use of English and French in Canadian society”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763198">In response to those who argue that preambles are interpretive, I would say that this is typically the case only when the body of law in question is not clear, which is not the case with Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>. I will quote British case law in Attorney-General v. Hanover: “It is only when it conveys a clear and definite meaning in comparison with relatively obscure or indefinite enacting words that the preamble may legitimately prevail.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763199">I will quote Ruth Sullivan, from her book <I>The Construction of Statutes</I>, in chapter 14 on page 445: “Preambles must be measured against other indicators of legislative purpose or meaning, which may point in the same or a different direction. If there is a contradiction between the preamble and a substantive provision, the latter normally prevails.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763200">Finally, I will quote former Supreme Court Justice La Forest: “it would seem odd if general words in a preamble were to be given more weight than the specific provisions that deal with the matter.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763201">Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>, in its body, is specific in its language, including with respect to the need to protect the interests of Quebec's anglophone minority. This would avoid any confusion that would otherwise require the courts to rely on the bill's preamble for interpretation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763202">For example, Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> would add, in black and white, the following to section 3 of the Official Languages Act: “For the purposes of this Act...language rights are to be given a large, liberal and purposive interpretation”. The body of the text also reiterates phrasing from the preamble on the federal government's commitment to enhancing the vitality of the English and French linguistic minority communities in Canada and supporting and assisting their development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763203">This brings me to the fear that Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>'s preamble endorses the pre-emptive use of the Constitution's notwithstanding clause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763204">Some contend that the reference to the Charter of the French Language in the preamble of Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> endorses the Quebec government's pre-emptive use of the clause, but the federal government has been clear that it does not approve of the pre-emptive use of the clause, whether against organized labour in Ontario or in both Bill 96 and Bill 21. The Attorney General has said clearly that the federal government will argue the point in court, specifically when Bill 21 reaches the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763205">Parliament also made its view known when it recently voted against the Bloc motion seeking to affirm the legitimacy of the pre-emptive use of the clause. I note that the Conservatives voted with the Bloc to support the motion affirming pre-emptive use. However, both together failed to carry the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763206">These official parliamentary and governmental expressions of opposition to the pre-emptive use of the notwithstanding clause matter. As the Supreme Court said in 2023 in the case of Murray-Hall v. Quebec, “To analyze the purpose of a law, courts rely [also] on...extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates and minutes of parliamentary committees”. This would include, in my view, statements by the government and votes in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763207">As such, there should be no confusion in a future court's mind that the federal government has no intention of legitimizing Quebec's pre-emptive use of the clause by referencing the Charter of the French Language in Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763208">Finally, something that has been lost in this debate is that the notwithstanding clause cannot override minority-language education rights, nor the right to speak English in Quebec in the courts or in the National Assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763209">Some suggest that Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> would allow the Quebec government to ignore obligations to the anglophone community under federally funded programs delivered through negotiated agreements with the province, but those agreements are governed by section 20 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which refers to the right of the public to communicate with and receive services from federal institutions in English and French, and by part IV of the Official Languages Act, which is meant to implement section 20.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763212">There has been some confusion, and the Liberals presented many duplicate amendments.

              <ParaText id="7763213">I would like to thank my colleague for recognizing the work that the official opposition accomplished in collaboration with the Bloc Québécois with respect to what was done in Quebec to recognize that in Quebec, the common language is French. It is a rather unique situation in North America. We need to recognize that in Quebec, the language that is vulnerable is French. I would like to know whether my colleague thinks that English is in danger in the Province of Quebec. That is a big question mark for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763214">I have another example that illustrates the prevailing confusion. My colleague just spoke about the preamble.

The bilingualism rate in Quebec in 1971 was 26%, while in 2021 it was nearly 50%.

              <ParaText id="7763227">Mr. Speaker, French and English are foundational to our nation. The bilingual nature of our country is in our DNA, and we do not want to lose it. Where I am from in British Columbia, as well as throughout this country, there has been a decline in French spoken at home. The French language and French Canadian culture are part of who we are, our tradition and our heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763228">I live in Maple Ridge. Right across from where I live is Fort Langley, which is where the first capital of British Columbia was situated. The French Canadian coureurs de bois, or voyageurs, were very much a part of that. Maillardville in Coquitlam is the hub of francophone culture in the Vancouver area. Every year, thousands come to the annual Festival du Bois, which highlights French Canadian music, dance, art and traditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763229">I am glad there are hundreds of thousands of students, past and current, who have gone through French immersion programs in British Columbia. It speaks volumes about the interest in the language among the non-francophone population.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763233"> I am pleased to have this opportunity today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document>, which modernizes the Official Languages Act. I have had the pleasure of serving on the Standing Committee on Official Languages for two or three years now, with a few interruptions. During that time, as a committee, we had the opportunity to hear from many individuals and organization representatives who shared their expertise and opinions on official languages in minority communities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763234">One thing is clear and unanimous. We need to modernize the Official Languages Act, particularly to address the decline of French in the areas of the country where it is a minority language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763235">I would like to talk a little bit about my francophone roots, my family lineage. What happened to my family happened to hundreds of thousands of other French Canadian families in western Canada who were originally from Quebec. My grandfather was Léopold Beaudoin. He married my grandmother, Alice, in the 1920s. At that time Quebec families had a lot of children. My grandparents had 18.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763236">Like perhaps most people, my grandfather was a farmer. During this time, the population in Quebec was growing. There was less and less land to support the big families and provide enough food. They decided to move to Opasatika, near Kapuskasing, in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763237">As we all know, there is a large francophone community in northern Ontario. My mother was born there. However, after 10 years, they decided to start over in the Rivière‑la‑Paix region in northern Alberta. Many small francophone communities were established in the region, such as Falher, Girouxville, Saint‑Paul, Bonnyville and Morinville, and, beforehand, there were already towns such as Saint‑Albert and Leduc.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763238">My father is Métis. He was born in Joussard. He later joined the Canadian Armed Forces. Whenever my family visited these communities, everyone spoke French. What is the current situation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763239">French is still spoken, but the demographic weight of francophones is decreasing. Farms are much bigger because of technological advances, and families have far fewer children. Furthermore, many of these children move to Edmonton, Calgary or other cities when they grow up. The situation is similar in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and other provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763240">Francophones are proud of their heritage, their culture, their language. We want it to be preserved, but not as an exhibit in a museum. The French language should be vibrant and alive. It is a major challenge. We are in a sea of anglophones. Almost all business transactions and communications are in English. It is the same situation all immigrants end up in when they want to retain their heritage, their culture and their language but still speak the language of the majority, either English or French in Quebec. The difference is that French and English are the official languages of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763241">It is part of our heritage, part of our history as a country. Speaking of our heritage, I am a little disappointed in the Liberal government. I do not think they show enough appreciation for our heritage. For instance, on the new passport that the Liberals are introducing, they have erased the image of the Vimy memorial, where thousands of Canadians were killed during the First World War. It was a foundational battle for Canada as a nation. The Liberals have also erased the image of Terry Fox, a Métis like me and a world-famous Canadian hero. In my view, in their pursuit of wokeness, they are rejecting Canada's traditions and history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763242">I am not entirely convinced that Liberals are committed to protecting and promoting the French language. I say this with respect, and I am certainly not accusing all Liberals. The Liberal government has been talking about modernizing the Official Languages Act to better promote bilingualism in Canada for eight years now. The Liberals promised this when they first came to power, and it was still part of their election platform in 2019 and again in 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763243">We were just about to begin the debate on Bill <Document DbId="11420727" Type="3">C-32</Document> in 2021, but what happened? The Liberals decided to call an unnecessary election during the pandemic, and that killed the bill. We had to start over. What is happening now? The Liberal government just added a dozen amendments to its bill. Why did it not do this during the committee study? It will only slow down the process. That is also what the Liberals did in committee, with 50 amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763244">These motions at report stage are not substantive amendments and could easily have been moved in committee. However, the Liberals once again decided to waste time. I wonder if they really want to pass this bill. We have a minority government, and the Prime Minister could easily call an election, which would once again kill this bill. I hope we will quickly move to third reading.</ParaText>

I gather that there is a segment of the English-speaking community in Montreal, particularly the West Island MPs, who were not happy to see that French was going to gain some more rights in Quebec. In return, they decided to send a lot of money to the English-speaking community to both reassure and silence them, saying that there was no need to worry, because they would continue to anglicize Quebec through their funding.</ParaText>

The beautiful Gouffre River overflowed its banks, washing away many houses, trailers and cottages and destroying roads in our community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763261">It has been a very difficult week in Charlevoix. I spent all last week there with the people, touring the area in my rubber boots. I saw the damage and the devastation, but I also saw the solidarity, the comradeship, the vitality and the generosity of the people of Charlevoix and the surrounding areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763262">Since we are talking about the French language, I would like to quote Charles Aznavour, who sang, “Misfortune brings out the best in people”. I cling to that. I commend the mayors, municipal teams, firefighters, police officers, the Red Cross and the many volunteers, community organizations and donors. I admire them. They are dear to me and are always in my thoughts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763263">Speaking of Charles Aznavour, poetry, songs and literature, I have listened to all the speeches, the rhetoric, the multiple definitions, the amendments and the debates surrounding Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C-13</Document> on official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763264">The cultural aspect of our language, of our mother tongue, was all but forgotten. French is not a language. French is much more than that. French is a door that opens up to what defines us and brings us together. It is not a tool for talking about the weather, talking about a dream or arguing. It is much more than that. French defines us. French is part of our DNA, despite the different times in our history when attempts were made to burn it down along with our homes, to extinguish it by banning it from being spoken at school, a ban imposed by the conqueror. Despite all the efforts to crush it, French persists because it lies at the foundation of culture, and language and culture go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763265">No federal legislation is going to determine whether Quebec, France or any other country or people in the world speaks French. No Canadian federal legislation is going to determine the survival of this language. Our love for our language will keep it alive. That is what will determine whether we survive and whether our language survives. Love for one's language is a vehicle for culture, which intrinsically becomes the primary power for protecting the French language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763266">I suggest that those listening to us start thinking very carefully. Putting the screws to the lovers of a language only strengthens their motivation. I would advise my colleagues not to try to stamp out the French language. Indeed, the more effort they put into doing just that, the more it will get back up again, the taller it will stand and the more we will love it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763323">This is usually a place where we have very passionate debates about things that there are wide-ranging opinions on, and sometimes those debates can be hotter than at other times. I think that this time of year traditionally is a time when the temperature outside is hotter and maybe things in here get a little bit hotter as we are moving towards summer. However, my hope is that today we can have a conversation that is every bit as passionate as the ones we usually have in here, but where we are able to maybe find a little more common ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763324">I will give a little bit of context. My daughter is 23 now, and she just finished her second year of law school. She was six when I got elected, so it has been a while. When she was 13, we did an interview with her brother Jaden, who has autism, when Jaden was 16. He is now 27 years old. When Jenae was 13 and Jaden was 16, we did an interview with Steve Paikin on <I>The Agenda.</I></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763325">Steve knows me and my kids well, and he did not give Jenae a heads-up that he was going to ask her a really tough question. He just said, in the middle of the interview, to 13-year-old Jenae, “Jenae, I'm going to ask you a really tough question right now. Are you ready for it?” She said that she was, and she steeled herself. He asked, “Do you ever sometimes wish that your brother was ‘normal’ like every other kid?” Thirteen-year-old Jenae, without hesitation, responded, “Well, honestly, since Jaden was diagnosed with autism before I was born, I don't exactly know what a ‘normal’ brother is like, so Jaden kind of is my normal, having autism.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763326">Steve asked, “You like him just the way he is?” Jaden was just smiling there the entire time, looking at his sister, whom he loves deeply. Jenae answered, “If he didn't have autism anymore or was cured or something, he wouldn't be the same as Jaden is now.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763327">Obviously, Jenae, being three years younger than Jaden and growing up in the same house, has not known a life without Jaden, as she referenced, so her “normal” has always included Jaden, for her whole life. However, when I am speaking to students or groups around the world internationally, or whatever the case might be, I always use it as an opportunity to draw a connection to the school environment that they both grew up in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763328">They went to a kindergarten to grade 12 school, so they went to the same school for their entire basic education lives. Obviously, Jaden was a few years ahead of Jenae. Jaden was fully included in a regular classroom, and that was right from the time he started. He had a full-time aide working with him. His needs are such that it was really important for him to have that full-time aide. In some circumstances, it might work a little differently; the needs might be a little different, as every kid with a developmental or intellectual disability is in a different circumstance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763329">Because the school made the decision to include Jaden in that school, certainly his life was better, his educational experience was better, and he will be more prepared to participate and be able to contribute his skills and abilities because of having been included in that school. However, for every other student who went to that school with him, their normal included Jaden. Their normal included life with somebody who had autism, somebody with a developmental disability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763330">Surprisingly, when we talk to those students afterwards, to a person, they say that their life was better off because of that experience in school and getting a chance to work with Jaden. Their experience since they left school has also been better, when, for example, they come across somebody who thinks a little differently than they do, maybe not even with autism or a developmental disability, just somebody who thinks a little bit differently. We all know people we can think of when I say that. I guarantee that everybody can think of somebody in their life who thinks a little differently than they do. However, because Jaden had been included in a regular classroom, their lives were better, and they were better prepared to come out into the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763331">The motion has some preamble that is really easy to skip by, but I will focus on just a couple of things in the preamble that I think are really important at a global level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763332">The second point in the preamble reads, “according to the Global Education Monitoring Report, in low- and middle-income countries, approximately 50% of children with disabilities are estimated to be out of school”. This is not about developmental disability or intellectual disability and being included in a different part of the school. They are out of school. Approximately 50% of children with disabilities are out of school.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763337">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) in the opinion of the House, where the federal government spends money on education, domestically or internationally, clear consideration must be given to the maximum inclusion of people with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763338">I am going to explain this a bit because that language is very deliberate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763339">First of all, regarding “where the federal government spends money on education”, in Canada, obviously we get into jurisdictional questions, and much of the funding for education domestically is provincial. However, the federal government does spend money on education. I think particularly of indigenous communities, for example. We have a lot of work to do there. What the motion says is that as we have those conversations, we need to consider people with disabilities, particularly people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763340">I have had great conversations. We have some fantastic leaders in the disability community. I think of conversations I have had leading up to this point with Neil Belanger and Ken Robertson. We have an up-and-coming researcher in Alberta named Grant Bruno, who is doing some fantastic world-leading work on these issues. That is one important component.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763341">Then the motion says, of course, “or internationally”. The federal government just contributed over $80 million to Education Cannot Wait, an international organization that does fantastic work in refugee camps, war zones and those kinds of places. It is an organization that I have had the chance to do a lot of work with. As we are pursuing that work and funding education, we want to make sure that people with disabilities are included.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763342">The motion talks about “maximum inclusion”. I use the words “maximum inclusion” because we want to make sure we are having a conversation in which it is really easy to get into wordsmithing and to get into some important debates about what full inclusion looks like and what inclusion looks like broadly. My view is that whatever the level of inclusion we are at, we can do more. We can move to maximize what inclusion looks like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763343">In Jaden's case, he was included in a regular classroom, but some schools that do great work might have an interactions classroom, where there may be six, seven or eight kids with a developmental disability or an intellectual disability. They are in a separate classroom, maybe because their support needs are so significant. Those schools might be striving to include those kids as much as they can in field trips, lunch, recess, phys. ed., musical theatre or any kind of art program they have. We can imagine a world of opportunities, and ultimately, maybe the goal is to move them to a regular classroom with proper supports. That might be the goal there. “Maximum inclusion” is meant to allow anybody to get a vision for where they want to go with it, depending on their point of view and the work they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763344">The motion then says, “people with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.” It is really important that we have disability-inclusive education, but oftentimes many advocates in the world of developmental or intellectual disabilities say that even in inclusive education conversations, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are excluded or are left behind. The language is designed to create a bridge so that we are working on both and are not leaving anyone behind in the conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763345">This motion comes at a really interesting moment. It is actually a really great moment, I think, for this motion. While it is a motion and some people might think a motion is non-binding or has a bit less action to it in a sense, I believe the opposite. I believe it allows us to have an important conversation on the floor of the House of Commons. We can vote on it as members of all parties and hopefully pass it, and then we can point to the motion as being a driving force or guide for us as we do the important work we do on education.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763346">The timing is important because, in September, the UN General Assembly held the Transforming Education Summit, with a broad approach and countries coming together on the important issue of education, something that both the former Conservative government and the present Liberal government have supported. There was a specific note that came out of it called “A Call to Action to Ensure Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education”. That was at the UN General Assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763347">Coming up in June, there are the annual meetings on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Those annual meetings will take place next month. Governments from both sides of the political spectrum have been supportive of the convention over the years, so that is an important opportunity. Then at the end of June, Special Olympics are happening in Berlin. Around Special Olympics, Tim Shriver, the chair of Special Olympics and the son of co-founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, is putting together a global education summit, where they are going to talk about these very issues at a global level. This is a real opportunity for Canada to play a leadership role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763348">I do want to point out that, in the world of international development, there is a lot of conversation about the hardest to reach and leaving no one behind. These are important concepts in the world of international development, particularly in the education context. When we think about people who are vulnerable, we try to avoid some of the debates that we have, as we do not want to play one group against another group. However, one thing I would quickly remind folks of is that, as we work on, for example, education for people in refugee camps and war zones, those kids would be incredibly vulnerable if they are living in a refugee camp or a war zone, but any one of those vulnerable kids could, on top of their vulnerability, have a developmental, intellectual or physical disability, and then they would be even more vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763349">We talk about girls' education, and we rightly we talk about girls' education. There are tens of millions of girls who are not in school right now who should be. When we think about girls' education and the vulnerability around that, particularly in some parts of the world, we have to recognize that any one of those girls could also have a developmental, intellectual or physical disability, and then we have even more vulnerability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763350">As we build our systems, as we build the structures and the programs at an international level to tackle these issues, we need to make sure that we build those systems to reach that girl, maybe in rural Africa, who is 13 years old and dealing with maybe an early forced marriage, in some countries, and the stigma of having a disability on top of that. If we can reach that girl with an intellectual disability in rural Africa, we can reach every girl along the way. If we can reach a little boy in a refugee camp or a war zone, who is six years old with a disability, if we can wire our hearts and our systems to reach out, find that boy and make sure that boy is included in the education systems that we set up, we are going to reach everybody along the way as we are doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763351">I will finish with a story. I was in Tanzania about eight years ago, and I came across this group of teenage boys. They were intrigued by my iPad. I showed them a picture of my daughter and one of the boys said, “She's nice”, in Swahili, and I agreed. My daughter is very nice. Then I showed them a picture of Jaden, and I explained through the interpreter that he has autism and what he is like. The boys were riveted to my words as I was explaining what Jaden is like. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763352">One of them, who had been quiet up to that point, looked me straight in the eye and said, again in Swahili, “I like him. He's beautiful. I'll pray for him.” This was unprompted. With just a bit of understanding, that 15-year-old boy's heart became attached in a very special way to another young person with autism half a world away from him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763353">This is the time for us to have this conversation. There is a world of impact we can have if we not only have the conversation, but then also activate that conversation. I look forward to the opportunity to hear members from all parties weigh in on the conversation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763356">I just stood today to thank my friend and colleague for dedicating his private member's bill to this, and moreover, for dedicating much of his political career to standing up for people who live with disabilities. His work is exemplary and I thank him very much for it on behalf of everybody in Milton and across Canada who relies on this progress.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763357">Mr. Speaker, it is nice. I am going to zero in on two points the member made. First of all is the incredible importance of connection. He talked about the Special Friends Network. The Special Olympics now has its unified program, where it is having people with developmental or intellectual disability playing alongside people without disability. Building those connections is so important to social health, mental health and all of the different aspects of our health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763358">The second thing is the language we use. It is interesting because he talked about struggling but then talked about strengths. Absolutely one of my missions is to focus on talking about unlocking the potential. There is a world of skills and abilities that reside in the capabilities of people with developmental disability, with intellectual disability, with autism. I see it in my son. We absolutely need to cultivate those skills and abilities, and as a society, we will all be better off for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763359">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for opening up the debate on this very important opportunity, as he just mentioned. I wanted to ask specifically about the indigenous funding and on reserve. The member mentioned in his speech that federally the opportunity to fund education for persons with disabilities is not as vast as it could be. I just wonder if he would not mind just sharing some of the things the federal government could be doing for indigenous children, and also, learning throughout a lifetime.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763360">Madam Speaker, one of the things I did not do particularly in the legislation is call on the government to spend more money on anything. I did not want to get into debate about how much we spend, whether it is enough and all of those different things. Clearly, there are challenges and clearly we need to do more in indigenous communities on a lot of fronts and education is absolutely one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763361">Whatever government is in power, whatever Parliament we have in place going forward, this motion says that when we take steps, when we spend money as a federal government on education, clear consideration must be given to the inclusion of people with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It is absolutely critical in this motion, whenever we have those important conversations, that this is part of the conversation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763366">Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> for his motion, and also for sharing his beautiful story of Jaden. I had a chance to meet Jaden two months ago during the World Autism Awareness Day celebrations on the Hill, and I can tell members that he brought a smile to all of our faces. I also wanted to thank the hon. member for his tireless advocacy on behalf of persons with disabilities, including children and youth with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763367">I have no hesitation in telling the member opposite that we support his motion, fully, unreservedly and with all of our hearts. In fact, one of our government's key priorities is to promote the full social and economic inclusion of persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763368">Canada is working to create a country and a world where persons with disabilities are included in every aspect of society. At the core of this work is implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This commitment connects Canada to the international community with the opportunity to both lead and learn from other nations as we work toward the shared goal of real, meaningful disability inclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763369">Last year, as part of these efforts, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="278928" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> introduced Canada's first-ever disability inclusion action plan, a road map to create a more inclusive country. The Canada disability benefit will be a cornerstone of this plan and has the potential to seriously reduce poverty and improve financial security for hundreds of thousands of Canadians with disabilities. These are huge, progressive steps forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763370">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> seeks greater support for the inclusion of children with disabilities in the education system, tying federal spending to specific measures to achieve that goal, both here in Canada and through our international commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763371">As we know, education falls largely within the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, except for first nations education on reserves, but we do play a key role in building and maintaining a robust system of quality education across the country. We provide significant block transfers to the provinces and territories through the Canada social transfers, including for post-secondary education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763372">We are committed to working collaboratively with provincial, territorial and indigenous partners, disability stakeholders, and persons with disabilities to remove barriers to quality education. As part of that collaboration, we have established the Canada-wide early learning and child care system. Inclusive and equitable access to early learning and child care is built into the Canada-wide agreements with provinces and territories. Federal funding is being used by our provincial and territorial partners to provide supports that can address the unique circumstances of each individual child and family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763373">Furthermore, just last June, we announced a $12.5-million investment under the enabling accessibility fund, small projects component, which supported 225 early learning child care centres to buy specialized equipment for children with special needs, so they can thrive in environments that respect their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763374">Through agreements with the provinces and territories, we are building an affordable child care system that is accessible and inclusive to all Canadians in every region of our country. All of this is in addition to supporting lifelong learning and skills development opportunities for working-age persons with disabilities, through, for example, the workforce development agreements and the opportunities fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763375">Allow me to circle back to Canada's first-ever disability inclusion action plan. The plan has four key pillars, including financial security, so we can lift persons with disabilities out of poverty, through the groundbreaking Canada disability benefit; employment, so we can take action to address long-standing barriers in the labour market and the workforce; accessible and inclusive communities, so we can address barriers that prevent persons with disabilities from fully participating in their communities; and, finally, a modern approach to disability, so we can address challenges in accessing federal programs and benefits. The action plan will help to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal opportunities to contribute to their communities and workplaces. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763376">Furthermore, I am pleased to say that budget 2023 provides funding of $10 million over two years, to help us address the unique needs and ongoing barriers faced by persons with disabilities by investing in capacity building and the community-level work of Canada’s disability organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763377">In the spirit of “nothing without us”, we will continue to engage the disability community at every turn. When Canadians work together, and we have seen it here in the House, we can build a stronger and more accessible country and world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763380">It is to his credit that he has moved this important motion. As the member said, although the motion is not binding, it does give meaning to our action, and particularly to the action that Canada needs to take with respect to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Canada signed in 2007 and ratified in 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763381">Part of the motion reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763382">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities...states that signatories “shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning directed to enabling persons with disabilities to participate effectively in a free society”. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763383">The convention is a human rights treaty that aims to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, to ensure they are treated without discrimination and on an equal basis with others. This convention has three key principles. The first is equality and non-discrimination. The second is accessibility, and the third key principle is participation and inclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763384">As my colleague pointed out, according to a 2021 UNICEF report on children with disabilities, there are nearly 240 million children around the world with disabilities. These children may seem to be at a disadvantage compared to children without disabilities when it comes to education because they are 49% more likely to have never attended school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763385">Of course, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of the motion. We are also in favour of the full and equitable inclusion of people with disabilities in Quebec and Canada. We are aware of the challenges that people with disabilities face and we stand in solidarity with them, whatever their disability may be. People with disabilities are not a homogenous group. All types of disabilities must be considered. I think that we need to put targeted solutions in place for each of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763386">Everyone must have access to a quality education under the principle of equality of opportunity in our societies. An inclusive education system takes into consideration not only accessibility but also the need to provide reasonable accommodation and individual support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763387">Although this was already mentioned, I want to remind members that, in Canada, elementary and secondary education fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces and that Ottawa should only intervene in areas under its own jurisdiction. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities falls under its jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763388">I would also like to remind members that non-visible disabilities are often identified by health care professionals and social services workers. That is invaluable, actually. There too, the government could play a role. It takes dedicated and professional personnel to support these persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763389">I will talk about our schools. Ideally, these young people, these students with disabilities would be included in regular classrooms as much as possible because diversity in school is an asset for education. We also have special schools and classes, but support is required, as is the capacity to make the right diagnosis to get some follow-up. Health care professionals and psychologists play a major role. On that, we take issue with the federal underfunding of health through the Canada health transfer to the provinces and Quebec. This is a serious problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763390">That being said, internationally, the government has the full authority and legitimacy to impose standards and conditions on international aid. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763391">We recognize that a greater global effort must be made to better integrate people with disabilities into education systems around the world, in line with the UNESCO and UNICEF findings in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763392">Global efforts in favour of inclusive education are consistent with advocating for the rights of other groups, such as the rights of women and girls in general and the right of girls and women with disabilities to education, specifically. According to a UNESCO study, there are approximately 130 million girls between the ages of six and 17 who are not in school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763393">The government needs to recognize this motion—it is good that it has been fully welcomed—and come up with a concrete plan to ensure that the money it distributes internationally will help improve education around the world, particularly in poorer or low-income countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763394">Compared to Canada's international aid to improve women's rights, according to a report by the Auditor General, this is pretty significant. The 2023 report was lackluster with respect to Canada's international feminist strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763395">The audit sought to determine whether Global Affairs Canada had implemented Canada's feminist international assistance policy by funding projects that supported gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in low- and middle-income countries and by demonstrating that the projects were producing the intended results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763396">Unfortunately, although objectives were set for Canada's feminist international assistance policy, it did not yield tangible results. Global Affairs Canada was unable to show how the policy contributed to improving gender equality in the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763397">If we want Canada to pay special attention to the new criteria for helping children with disabilities access education, then Global Affairs Canada must absolutely come up with new processes and new ways of working to achieve measurable results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763398"> We have an obligation to ensure that education is a reality both in fact and in law for all children with disabilities, whatever that disability may be, and their loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763399">We know that some countries in the world need this assistance. In that sense, the last part of the motion, which invites Canada to do more, is consistent with the convention that was signed. We think that is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763400">Once again, I thank my colleague for this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763401">Madam Speaker, just before I begin this debate on educational support and inclusion for persons with disabilities, I start by reminding the government that it has outstanding disability commitments. I am referring specifically to Bill <Document DbId="11826019" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the Canada disability benefit bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763402">The government promised this income support bill years ago and one million Canadians who need it are still waiting. With the rising costs of living, the situation is past dire and the government should immediately enact a disability emergency response benefit to offset the rising costs of food and housing for persons with disabilities living in poverty in Canada. Bill <Document DbId="11826019" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the Canada disability benefit act, will be coming back from the Senate soon and the government needs to get it on the House agenda immediately after it arrives from the Senate; there is no time to waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763403">Let me talk about the motion in front of us, Motion No. 78, brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>. I thank him for carrying on this conversation in this House. The motion states the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763404">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...where the federal government spends money on education, domestically or internationally, clear consideration must be given to the maximum inclusion of people with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763405">Today, the member talked about why that wording is so important. Of course, the NDP supports this. Where we are disappointed is that it is not already a reality in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763406">Canada, like other signatories to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has an obligation to uphold the right to education for persons with disabilities outlined in article 24, but currently it is not doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763407">In my riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam, Anmore and Belcarra school boards and teachers are doing that work without a federal partner to ensure the adequate funding, education and supports to fully meet article 24. I was at our school board meeting recently applauding the work that the school board is doing, along with its staff, teachers, EAs and administration. They are doing that work to try to optimize their limited resources and supports to address the needs of students with disabilities, including those with learning disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763408">The number of students with disabilities who are not getting their needs met in Canada's education system is growing and parents and guardians are coming to me, at my office in my riding, asking for help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763409">Another reason I rise today is to stand up with the voices of students, parents and guardians in Canada who are telling me that it is imperative that Canada adhere to this article.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763410">Education is a fundamental human right and is essential for the full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in society. Adhering to article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities means that Canada must ensure that persons with disabilities have access to inclusive and quality education at all levels of their life learning journey, without discrimination and on an equal basis with others. This includes removing barriers to education, providing reasonable accommodations, and ensuring that teachers and other educational staff are trained to support the needs of persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763411">In Canada, it has been said tonight that education is primarily funded and administered by the provincial and territorial governments. What has the Liberal government done to ensure it is supporting provinces and territories to adhere to article 24? I can say right now that they are not doing enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763412">With the provincial and territorial governments responsible for funding and administering public elementary and secondary schools, as well as public colleges and universities, they need a federal partner so they can set curriculum standards, and oversee certifications and professional development that supports our commitments to article 24. Right now, they are on their own doing all this work and not getting the financial support, administration or education support they need from the federal government to meet the convention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763413">The federal government does provide some funding for education through transfer payments to the provinces and territories, as well as through specific programs and initiatives. However, there is not a specific focus on funding to ensure provinces and territories have the financial capacity to meet the obligations that Canada makes on the international stage.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763414">This is especially true for indigenous students. The federal government provides funding for research and development in higher education, and supports programs aimed at improving outcomes for indigenous students. This is their obligation, yet even for indigenous students, the funding for disability supports in on-reserve education does not align with provincial standards, and that is unacceptable. It must be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763415">In Canada, every student is entitled to a barrier-free education. It sets them on their path for life. Furthermore, ensuring that persons with disabilities have access to inclusive education that meets their needs is not only a matter of human rights, but also has significant health, social and economic benefits. Education leads to better employment opportunities, better health outcomes, increased social participation, and enhanced self-esteem and confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763416">We know that investing in education for persons with disabilities promotes inclusivity by ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities for learning and personal growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763417">I just want to make a note here, because the member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> mentioned field trips. In my riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam, Anmore and Belcarra, there are times when field trips are not accessible to everyone because of the funding limitations, because of the fact that they do not have the supports that are required. We can imagine kids having to go to school and seeing all their friends go on the field trip while they do not. That needs to be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763418">Investing in education for persons with disability promotes inclusivity by ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities. It helps to break down barriers and promotes a more equitable and diverse society. It also promotes independence and self-determination by providing education and training opportunities. I know that the Liberal government is investing right now in those education and training opportunities. How about starting earlier? How about supporting the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, article 24, in provinces and territories? How about doing that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763419">We know that it promotes independence and self-determination by providing education and training opportunities. With supportive education, persons with disabilities could acquire the skills and knowledge they need to live more independently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763420">Education is also linked to improved employment outcomes. Investing in education for persons with disabilities could help to improve their employment prospects and reduce their risk of living in poverty. Right now, a million Canadians with a disability are living in poverty because they live in an ableist country that does not allow them full access to employment. How about the Liberal government fixes that? Education is an important driver of economic growth, and investing in education for persons with disabilities can contribute to the overall economic prosperity of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763421"> For all the reasons above, the government needs to support provinces and territories with the funding and the education required to uphold article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. UN Conventions are not pieces of paper. They are rights, human rights, and they need to be adhered to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763422">I am surprised to see, for the second year that I am here as the NDP critic for persons with disabilities, that the government does not have a Canadian delegation going to the United Nations in June. For the second time, I am standing here and not seeing any coordinated Canadian effort to have a delegation at the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is unacceptable. Why are we not there?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763423">In closing, as we look outside of Canada, we see that the federal government provides funding to Canadian organizations that apply for international assistance, which could include educational projects. The Liberal government says those projects must align with the feminist international assistance policy, advance human rights and advance sustainable development goals. Yes, that is good. However, there are insufficient directives to ensure that people with disabilities are included in Canadian international assistance projects, so the government must restore the international assistance funding it cut and do better to meet its international commitments to human rights.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278535" Type="2">Mrs. Tracy Gray (Kelowna—Lake Country, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7763424">Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. It is an honour to speak in favour of the motion brought forward by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>. That member has long been an advocate for persons with disabilities and is well respected for his many different efforts on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763425">The motion before us would allow this House to set a key reminder for government to remember those too often forgotten in our world: people with disabilities. Canada's work, whether here at home or abroad in developing countries, in aiding children's education is vitally important. While it is essential to help fund the books, pencils and computers needed for education, we would fail in our ambition for better education for every child if we did not consider the need to ensure the inclusion of all children, regardless of circumstances beyond their control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763426">A 2021 Statistics Canada study found that young Canadians with disabilities between the ages of 15 and 34 still encounter a wide range of difficulties in attending school, such as limitations on learning, social exclusion or a lack of accommodations. The study found that among the participants, 21.1% of women and 33.7% of men had yet to complete a high school level of education. Of those interviewed, 29% said they had discontinued their education because of their condition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763427">Though we recognize education as primarily provincial, there is a role the federal government can play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763428">As the Conservative shadow minister responsible for disability inclusion, I was involved in helping to advance the Canada disability benefit. We know for that piece of legislation that the government was working for years on it and finally tabled legislation in the last Parliament. The snap election of 2021 cancelled the legislation from moving forward, and it was reintroduced in this Parliament, though not as a priority piece of legislation for the government, as it was not one of the first bills to be introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763429"> Surprisingly, it was the same legislation as this, and in fact it is well documented through testimony at committee that there is much uncertainty. What it would actually mean for people as to the parameters, to whom it would be applicable and what they would receive would all be done through regulation. I will continue to hold this government to account for this unacceptably slow pace of delivery. Still, by that bill's unanimous passing in the House, we know this chamber is committed to seeing all persons with disabilities reach their highest potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763430">When it comes to our federal role in education, in situations such as indigenous education or social transfers, keeping in mind the specific needs of all children as they study is vital. Our goal must be nothing less than, as the text of this motion states, "maximum inclusion of people with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.” We should want no less for our children living with disabilities around the world, whom we seek to aid in our efforts to alleviate poverty in developing countries. Without access to education, poverty is not alleviated in the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763431">It is indisputable that a good education can help make people's lives better. What we see needing improvement in the developing world is a clear commitment to the consistent consideration of the millions of people worldwide who face unique physical, developmental and intellectual challenges in achieving their best lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763432">Globally, children with disabilities face significant barriers that result in exclusion from education and schooling. According to UNESCO's “2020 Global Education Monitoring Report”, at least 50% of children with disabilities are excluded from education in low- and middle-income countries. In some contexts, the figure is closer to 90%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763433">The reasons for this are varied, whether they are a lack of transportation options to reach schools, inaccessible school or classroom buildings, the lack of proper teacher training to educate children with varying intellectual and developmental challenges, or poor curriculum design. The denial of primary education leaves many of these children with the poorest life outcomes imaginable, with poor adult literacy or social skills condemning them to hard labour, extreme poverty or worse. Socially, these children can often be deeply misunderstood, with their conditions treated as burdens or even death sentences.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7763434">In some areas of the world, prejudice surrounding what we in Canada would regard as basic conditions sadly leads to the lives of children being harmed and given up on. According to the same report I cited earlier, adapted infrastructure and materials for students with disabilities are lacking in developing countries. Canada undoubtedly has inclusion challenges to overcome as well for those with disabilities. Still, we can take some fulfillment in the tireless efforts of our many education leaders, teachers and support workers who help to provide educational benefits for children who, had they been born in too many other places around the world, would have never received those efforts. I thank all of those who work in this field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763435">Similarly, we can take pride in Canadians seeking to address that gap in the developing world. Canada has a long history of commitment to helping developing countries. For example, one project looks to advance inclusive higher education for young adults with disabilities, develop new occupational therapy programs and foster research for inclusive education and community-based rehabilitation in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763436">Hearing of Canadian efforts to help with projects like this is no surprise. Canada has always prided itself on its capacity for humanitarian work. We are proudly home to tens of thousands of charities, not-for-profits, faith groups and individual miracle workers pursuing similar aims in regions around the world. The same consideration they give toward ensuring a good education for every child must be kept front of mind. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> is very purposeful in the wording of his motion calling on the government to take action. He does not want persons with disabilities to be forgotten. In fact, he wants them to be top of mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763437">He is also drawing attention to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. When people think of persons with disabilities and their extra needs, they may have to help minimize or overcome challenges with their diverse abilities. Often, we may think of physical accessibility needs. For example, physical infrastructure, like building a ramp or having an accessible washroom, may come to mind, and people get a check mark for being inclusive when considering those with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763438">However, this motion also adds in purposeful wording to include people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. This is important because the check mark may not be quite as easy. Those with intellectual and developmental disability needs need to be top of mind when considering educational funding in order for us to be truly inclusive and to make a difference through education for those who may not be considered now. This elevates the importance of not forgetting those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763439">I call on all members of this House to put aside partisanship and come together unanimously in passing this motion. Doing so will send a clear message of commitment to those in need of a better life through education who may currently be denied it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763440">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and friend for his guidance and leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763441">It is a very good example of where the real experience is lived in a diverse House of Commons. We are making the best policies and we are making progress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763442">That is an excellent example. On behalf of all the families in Milton living with a person with a disability, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7763443">I would like to stand up today and talk about how this motion really leverages a lot of our collective work on our disability inclusion action plan. It is fantastic that we can work together and find ways to improve the lives of Canadians and work across party lines, as I have with this particular member for as long as I have been here. He definitely represents the best of this place and, again, I want to commend him for that effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763444">The first pillar of our disability inclusion action plan is our employment strategy. The motion would definitely leverage this and ensure that it is as effective as possible. Last year, we launched a $200-million employment strategy for people with a disability. Ensuring that more of these funding programs are directed to persons living with a disability is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763445">The second pillar, which this motion would leverage, is the Canada disability benefit. The member and I have spoken one-on-one before, and I have spoken with many members of my community as well, about people who are now children or are young people who will age out of care, as well as people who have a disability of any form whose support network will leave them one day. We need to ensure that there is support for those individuals and groups when their support network leaves them, and they do not have support they had relied on for so many of their lived years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763446">The third pillar is all about eliminating barriers in physical spaces. I know that many programs in my community have applied to the enabling accessibility fund. This is for building physical structures that eliminate barriers, such as ramps, elevators and various other devices that support disability inclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763447">However, I also want to acknowledge that the things that we can add to our society to correct for curbs, stairs and other barriers resulting in inaccessible physical space include far more than just physical things. I want to mention one of my neighbours, Carly, who is currently engaged with the town of Milton in building a new kind of playground for kids with various sensory differences. She is also raising a flag for Disability Awareness Month. I want to commend everybody in Milton who is working on that particular project. It will mean kids can go to the park and experience the fun, the laughter, the enjoyment and physical activity that they deserve. They will not have to make those accommodations themselves within their families, because there will be a park built for them. That is really fantastic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763448">The fourth pillar, last but certainly not least, is a modernized government. A modernized government in the context of a disability inclusion action plan is all about easier access to benefits. This would ensure that we are not creating an environment where applying for these programs or new resources is going to cost a lot of money or where business owners have to hire somebody new or special in order to do that. A good example of that is automatic tax filing, which was in budget 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763449">Once again, I want to thank and commend my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278530" Type="2">Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> for this extraordinary work.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7763456">Madam Speaker, my question to the Liberals is regarding their failed, ineffective and ever-increasing carbon tax. The Liberals have misled Canadians on their carbon tax, not once, not twice, but many times. Government members must be held accountable for their misleading carbon tax claims, and they must answer to the Canadians they are supposed to represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763457">Let us take a walk down memory lane. First, the Liberals promised not to raise the carbon tax, and then they tripled it. Then the Liberals promised Canadians they would get more money back than they had paid, but the government’s own Parliamentary Budget Officer proved the government wrong. In fact, we now know the average family in 2023 will pay between $402 and $847 even after the rebates. Then the Liberals claimed the carbon tax would reduce emissions, but guess what, emissions went up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763458">Now we know the government misled Canadians once again on its failed carbon tax. Let me explain. In 2019, the Liberals announced a program called the MUSH retrofit stream. MUSH stood for municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals. It was a bureaucratic government program designed to return the carbon tax back to the public institutions it was charged to so they could afford energy-efficient retrofit upgrades. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763459">One may be wondering why on earth the government is forcing a carbon tax on our hospitals and schools in the first place, or how this reduces emissions, and trust me, I wonder the same. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763460">Despite this, and despite promising to return the money the Liberals took from our hospitals and public institutions, no money was returned to hospitals, no money was returned to municipalities and no money was returned to universities. Not one dime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763461">The Liberals took millions of dollars to Ottawa, created their own bureaucratic program, promised to return it and never did. Even the commissioner of the environment pointed this failure out in a recent report, and local governments across Canada were wondering where the millions of dollars they were promised went. We would never have known this if it were not for an Order Paper question I submitted because the Liberals took the money and secretly shut down the program without telling Canadians. I guess we will never know where the money went. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763462">My question to the Liberal government is very simple. Why did the Liberal government mislead Canadians and not return any carbon tax revenue to hospitals, municipalities or universities through its own MUSH retrofit program? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763464">On that particular point, I have to make mention of the fact that there were 338 Conservative candidates in the last federal election who knocked on doors with an election platform.

              <ParaText id="7763467">The <Affiliation DbId="278509" Type="2">former leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party campaigned on the policy that a price on pollution, or a carbon tax, is a good thing. The member stands up and says we are misleading Canadians, yet he campaigned on a platform that made it very clear to Canadians that, if the Conservatives were elected into government, they would put a price on pollution. I think the member needs to reflect on the issue of misleading Canadians, because there is no doubt about that. We could show him the platform position of the Conservative Party, the platform that he himself has raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763468">The member also made reference to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. He said the Parliamentary Budget Officer said there was a net loss. However, the Parliamentary Budget Officer also indicated that when we factor in the rebate portion, 80% of the population will receive more money than they are paying in the tax. One might argue we should factor in this and that, but I would suggest that if we factor in this and that, like floods, forest fires and all the other factors, they would also have to be calculated in. The bottom line is that the same Parliamentary Budget Officer has made it very clear that, dollar for dollar, there is a net gain for 80% of the population. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763469">When we talk about other jurisdictions, we now have Atlantic Canadians seeing the benefits of having the rebate structure we have in place. Those provinces are now moving to the federal program, which is something they opted to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763470">I would suggest that one of the best ways of dealing with emissions and being sensitive to our environment is to recognize what many governments around the world have done, including this government, which is to assign a price on pollution. Interestingly enough, members might be surprised to know that the first legislative government to ever do something of this nature was the Alberta Conservative Party many years ago.</ParaText>

A part of that explanation should also incorporate that they will be getting rid of the rebate. The benefit of the rebate is that 80% of people are receiving a larger rebate than they are paying into the program. In essence, they would be taking more money out of the pockets of 80% of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763477">Madam Speaker, I rise today in favour of an independent public inquiry into sports. The issue has become more important than ever and it is disappointing that the <Affiliation DbId="278932" Type="4">Minister of Sport</Affiliation> thinks that this issue still requires nothing more than internal audits as cases come up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763478">We all saw the leniency in the audits since, in less than a year, funding for Hockey Canada and Gymnastics Canada was restored. In the case of Canada Soccer, it is total silence. It is incomprehensible that after more than 35 articles on separate cases involving several dozen victims tied to allegations of sexual assault and harassment in sport, there has not been more outrage in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763479">For more than a year, the Bloc Québécois has tirelessly and clearly called for an independent public inquiry into sports. Today, the NDP MPs, and I commend them, also took position in favour of an inquiry. The Conservatives and the Liberals remain, in my opinion, divided on this issue. I ask the question. If it was our own children, would we hesitate on whether or not to shed light on the allegations of abuse in the world of sports?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763480">The silence of the Minister of Sport is as disconcerting as her absence thus far from the discussions taking place in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. She has been invited on more than one occasion. None of the testimony—all of which was very well researched and relevant—spurred her to act responsibly and transparently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763481">I want to talk about different aspects. There is the outsourcing of safe sport cases. It was the Liberal government that implemented the idea of contracting out complaints from athletes who have been abused or mistreated. This is a highly lucrative arrangement for these private sector firms, which the government calls “third party investigators”. Currently, these firms are paid by federations and there is no assurance that victims are treated fairly in the process. There are no quality standards in place, and Sport Canada does not conduct any verifications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763482">Many victims testified that they were mistreated by these investigators. These investigations should be conducted by people who have the well-being of the athletes at heart, and, above all, who have no conflict of interest. Even worse, the process results in non-disclosure agreements that silence the victims. This tacit endorsement by the government prevents victims from speaking out or they risk being prosecuted. We absolutely need to consider changing this paradigm so that victims can really have a say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763483">A non-disclosure agreement must be the prerogative of the victim because only they can make that decision. These non-disclosure agreements raise another concern. Coaches dismissed by these federations for allegations of abuse will be protected by these very agreements. A public and independent inquiry will shed light on these elements and lead to action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763484">The financial audits ordered by Sport Canada are a financial framework that requires the tabling of detailed financial statements in order to obtain funding. However, it seems that no one analyzes these results year over year or asks questions about the objectives of these sports organizations. It is as though it were just a box to be checked. That does not work. Some corporations in Canada are not in compliance with the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act. We see these situations of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763485"> The study being done by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage has found that sports organizations have benefited from government largesse without sufficient accountability and transparency. Less than 5% of these organizations are in good standing with the federal registry of corporations. They are violating the rules for federally chartered corporations. The government is clearly not taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763486">Everyone has an obligation to report abuse in sport. However, it seems quite clear that the priority for Sport Canada is not to act on this information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763487">In closing, I would say that establishing a public and independent inquiry in the field of sports is imperative in order to conduct spot checks, rather than the light—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7763508">Madam Speaker, I am rising tonight to follow up on a question I earlier asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with respect to the Liberal-McKinsey scandal. In particular, at the time I was asking about the role McKinsey played in the opioid crisis and what the government is doing in response to that, recognizing that the government gave over $100 million in contracts to McKinsey, recognizing by now that the Treasury Board has acknowledged that all rules were not followed in the awarding of those contracts, recognizing that at the time this was going on McKinsey had a relationship with a company called Purdue Pharma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763509">McKinsey was led by Dominic Barton up until midpoint in the government's mandate. During that time and previous to that, under the leadership of Dominic Barton, McKinsey was working for Purdue Pharma, giving Purdue Pharma advice on how to supercharge opioid sales, something that drove the opioid crisis. Incredibly, McKinsey's advice to Purdue Pharma included things like paying bonuses to pharmacists in instances where there were overdoses and developing a system for circumventing traditional pharmacies in order to circumvent the checks that were in place in order to prevent people who struggle with substance abuse challenges from being able to access those kinds of opioids. McKinsey was advising Purdue Pharma on how to sell more opioids, how to circumvent checks in the system and, incredibly, giving advice on how to give bonuses to pharmacists in instances where there were overdoses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763510">McKinsey and Purdue Pharma have been the subject of much criticism here in Canada, as well as the United States and elsewhere. McKinsey has had to pay over half a billion dollars in compensation in the United States. In the United States, there are Democrats and Republicans in various jurisdictions suing McKinsey and Purdue for their role in the opioid crisis and using the money from that to support treatment and recovery. This is precisely the policy that has been put forward by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, which is, as part of a suite of measures, to combat the horrific ongoing opioid crisis, to hold accountable those bad corporate actors that are responsible for it, to sue them directly federally as well as to join provincial class action lawsuits, to sue them for the full range of damages and to put those resources into treatment and recovery, recognizing that McKinsey was a critical player, and that is why it had to pay over half a billion dollars in compensation in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763511">The contrast is quite stark because in the United States there are people across the political spectrum who have stood up to McKinsey and Purdue and others to try to hold them accountable. In Canada, the government gave McKinsey over $100 million in contracts. I find this striking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763512">More recently, it was revealed in a response to a petition I received that the government said it is actually going to now join British Columbia's litigation against McKinsey. I have asked various figures in the government if they are prepared to confirm that and I wonder if the <Affiliation DbId="293762" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> is prepared to confirm that tonight or not. If this is the case, this is quite a stark shift. I think the government has to account for the fact that, on the one hand, it was giving massive levels of government procurement to McKinsey, not following the proper rules in the process, while McKinsey was fuelling the opioid crisis and, on the other hand, now it is effectively acknowledging McKinsey is complicit in the opioid by saying it is going to join B.C.'s class action lawsuit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763513">I want the government to clarify whether it is planning to sue McKinsey. Is it planning on following the policy recommendation that Conservatives have been putting forward for months? Will it try to hold McKinsey accountable for the full range of damages, not just joining this lawsuit but other damages as well? Why did it have such a close—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7763515">Madam Speaker, the member across the way is trying to connect some very important issues. Talking about the opioid crisis, I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="293763" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health</Affiliation> could have expanded on the degree to which we, as a government, need to continue to work on that particular situation. A good part of that is recognizing that Canada, as a country, cannot do it alone. We need to work with provinces and municipalities, as well as first responders and others. There are many different stakeholders who are out there trying to deal with the opioid situation. That is an issue in itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763516">The other issue the member is trying to raise and make a connection to is McKinsey. That is kind of tacked on. McKinsey has a contract, but the member is trying to build the case that there is a wonderful, special relationship between an individual at McKinsey and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763517">Tying the three issues together is not very responsible, because there is no direct connection among them. The opioid crisis is there; it is real and tangible. The government is doing what it can and working with a multitude of different stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763518">In regard to the contracts, if we listen to the Conservative Party on this particular issue, we would think that if they were in power, they would change the process of procurements and contracts that are being let out through the public service. The Conservatives are doing that process a disservice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763519">The Liberal government, through transparency and accountability, has ensured that these contracts are done through the public service as much as possible. This should not be a surprise, because these types of contracts are done at all different levels of government here in Canada. Internationally, around the world, governments always look for those independent contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763520">The issue is how those contracts are awarded. I have no problem comparing Canada's procedures with those of any other country. Often, we get other countries looking to Canada for the way our public service lets contracts out for tender. We can all take comfort in and have confidence in our public service in getting out those important contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763521">Now, on the connection between McKinsey and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, this is one of those fishing trips by the Conservative Party. No matter what, they put on their tin hats and start asking questions like these: Where is it all connected? How could it be connected to the Prime Minister? They do this so they can dump all over the Prime Minister. That is the logic behind it.</ParaText>

McKinsey did not pay $600 million in compensation to victims of the opioid crisis because somebody was saying things about it on Reddit. McKinsey paid that massive amount of compensation because the facts were clear and its complicity was clear. Moreover, there have been multiple stories in The New York Times detailing the way in which McKinsey fuelled the opioid crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7763526">While these stories were being written, Dominic Barton, who was managing partner of McKinsey, claimed he was unaware. He said that he only found out about what happened with McKinsey and Purdue after the fact. That just does not hold water.</ParaText>
