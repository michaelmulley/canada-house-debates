          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Gerretsen" id="12827557">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8494675"> Madam Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document>, which we are continuing to debate today, is a very important piece of legislation. This bill would establish an independent commission dedicated to reviewing miscarriage of justice applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494676">Specifically, Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> would amend the Criminal Code by reforming the existing miscarriage of justice review process in two ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494677">First, it specifies accessibility criteria. It specifies the investigative process, in particular the legal threshold to conduct investigations, powers of investigation and provisions of investigation reports. The bill also specifies the decision-making process, specifically the legal threshold to refer cases back to the courts for a new trial, hearing or appeal. In addition, on that decision-making process, it would change the relevant decision-making factors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494678">The second area Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> addresses is additions to the Criminal Code to establish the commission: mandate, composition, appointment process and qualifications specifically, as well as the powers, duties and functions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494679">Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> is named after David and Joyce Milgaard. David Milgaard was convicted of a crime he did not commit and spent 23 years in prison before being released in 1992 and finally exonerated in 1997. Joyce Milgaard, David's mother, spent decades advocating for her son's release and compensation for the injustices he faced. Mr. Milgaard's experience revealed the flaws that can exist in our justice system. Joyce and David Milgaard were forceful advocates for the wrongfully convicted. They called for changes to Canada's wrongful conviction review process, including the establishment of an independent commission. We are all very proud to honour their work and their vision for a more just Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494680">I want to reflect on that last bit for a moment. Just imagine for a second being a parent who has one of their children convicted of a crime, or, first of all, just being accused and charged with a crime and the time they spend. I am reflecting on my own children, if I were in this position. I have a 20-year-old son, and I imagine if something occurred and he was put in a position like this. I just think to myself, from a parent's perspective, what would one do? A parent would go to all ends, especially if they knew their child was innocent, to protect them and to make sure they get the proper justice they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494681">The inspiration of this bill and who the bill is named after is an example of that incredible deep passion that people bring, in particular, when trying to find justice for their children. We are very fortunate. I know there are many people who have been wrongfully convicted who did not have advocates like their parents fighting for their release. We need to use the example of what happened here, this particular dynamic with the child and their parents fighting for them, and in particular their mother, as a standard for the way we should be treating matters like this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494682">This is a very important bill. This bill would address the injustices that unfortunately can occur within a justice system that is intended to hold accountable those who have committed crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494683">I know, as a matter of fact, after listening to this debate in the House during the times when the bill has been up for debate, that everybody in the House supports this bill. This is a bill I have heard Conservatives speak in favour of. I have heard the NDP, the Bloc and certainly Liberals speak in favour of it. This is a bill that has unanimous consent. This is a bill that anybody who has children, who knows somebody wrongfully convicted or who fears that one day somebody else could be wrongfully convicted should support.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8494684"> Knowing that we have unanimous consent for a bill like this, that we all believe that this is so important, that we all know that people who have been wrongfully convicted continue to sit in prison today, knowing all of this, and knowing that we all support it and that we all believe that justice is just as important for the wrongfully convicted as it is for the rightfully convicted, one would think that a bill like this could pass through the House very quickly, that it could get to the Senate and the Senate could do its thing with this and adopt this bill just as quickly. This should be a completely non-partisan issue. There should be no need for anybody in the House to try to slow down the process and the speed at which this bill moves through the House, especially when we hear and we know that everybody supports it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494685">Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Despite the fact that Conservatives said they support this, and they get up in their speeches and talk about how much they support this, they have intentionally slowed the passage of this bill through the House. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278480" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation> put forward 20 amendments to the bill, a bill that he supports, a bill that Conservatives will vote in favour of. Does one think these were meaningful amendments that he brought forward? They were not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494686">The first amendment that he brought forward was that we delete the short title. He then went on to bring forward amendments that would consecutively delete each clause of the bill, one by one. What he is doing is putting forward these amendments and, by the way, as soon as one puts forward an amendment to a bill, it resets the speaking order and everybody can speak again. He will effectively, unless the Conservatives change course and decide to apply the votes or do something at the last minute, make 20 votes out of this simple bill that everybody supports and just absolutely slow down the process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494687">I understand that there are issues we disagree on. I understand that the main tool of an opposition party, His Majesty's loyal opposition party, is to affect the amount of time it takes to do things in the House. I respect that. I understand that. It makes sense that, from time to time, Conservatives want to use those tools for issues that they passionately disagree with. I get it. On contentious issues, it makes sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494688">However, on a bill like this, which everybody supports, which literally will allow justice to be served for those who have been wrongfully convicted, the Conservative Party played games with the bill and continues to play games with the bill now. We had to bring in a motion of closure to force the Conservatives to vote on this bill and to stop delaying it. That is where we are now. We are on the final few hours of this, because we had to force the Conservatives into this position. It is absolutely shameful that Conservatives would act in this manner with respect to a bill like this. This bill deserves the unanimous support that the House has already said it gives it. This bill deserves to be passed as quickly as possible. It is extremely unfortunate that Conservatives continue to play their games with such an important piece of legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494689"> Madam Speaker, indeed, at second reading, we thought it was a pretty good bill. There were some drafting errors that we were pretty convinced we were going to be able to convince other committee members to amend. They disagreed with that, and what happened to the bill is that it came back worse than it went in, unfortunately, because, originally, an applicant for a judicial review of what they thought was a wrongful conviction would have to have exhausted all the appeal procedures that were available to them. The Liberals unfortunately took that out. We are saying that it is creating a competing criminal justice system, which is just not necessary. David Milgaard's problem was never that the appeal process was not there, but that the system was too cumbersome. Fix that and we would agree with it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494690">Madam Speaker, does that warrant deleting the short title? Does that warrant putting a separate amendment on the floor just to delete the short title? It is the short title of the bill. It is not even the full title of the bill. It is literally the short version of what we refer to the bill as.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494691">If the member is genuine and genuinely says there is a concern about the bill, then he should explain to Canadians why he wants to delete the short title of the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494692">Madam Speaker, we live in a society where the justice system is based on rehabilitation. We also have a justice system and society that believes, as Voltaire did, that “It is better to risk saving a guilty person than to condemn an innocent one”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494693">However, we are dealing with heartbreaking cases of miscarriages of justice. One example is the case we have been talking about, that of Mr. Milgaard. There are also cases in Quebec. Take, for example, the Jolivet case, which was also highly publicized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494694">If this is one of our values, why did the government wait so long to react and to create something that will make it possible to correct miscarriages of justice within a much more reasonable time frame?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494695">Madam Speaker, this bill attempts to correct that. I agree with the member in that Liberals believe, and I believe the Bloc and the NDP also believe, in the rehabilitative process. It is called Corrections Canada. It is not “lock them up and throw away the key” Canada. The Conservatives do not believe in corrections. They do not believe in rehabilitation. They believe in locking people up and throwing away the key.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494696">With all due respect, I know this very well, coming from a riding that has six prisons in the area. Kingston is known as the prison capital of Canada. I have heard stories from when the Conservatives were in power, about the double bunking that was going on and the absolute catastrophe of what was happening in the prisons. The Conservatives are not interested in rehabilitation. They just want to lock people up and throw away the key.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494697">Madam Speaker, I certainly agree with the speaker across that there is a fundamental difference in terms of how we treat people in this world and how we truly see them as people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494698">With that in mind, the NDP is concerned about the fact that robust financial supports need to be provided to the commission to ensure it gets running quickly, considering a lot of these cases are so urgent. Could the member speak to the need to ensure funding for the commission?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494699"> Madam Speaker, if we do not give the commission the tools that it needs to do its work, then we are basically setting it up for failure. What those supports are exactly and how much it needs, in terms of resources, is to be determined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494700">I would agree with the member that the supports and resources, financial resources in particular, to do the work the commission needs to do, to do the investigative work, and to ensure that people have access to the appeals process, need to be properly funded.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494701"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494702">Before I begin my speech today, I would like to mention that we will be rising soon, in this place, for the summer. I want to wish everyone a safe summer for travelling. I also want to thank all responders who might be out there, helping to save lives and keeping our communities safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494703">I am rising today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document>, the miscarriage of justice review commission act, David and Joyce Milgaard's law. This is an act to amend the Criminal Code, to make consequential amendments to other acts and to repeal a regulation, miscarriage of justice reviews, which will establish a commission dedicated to reviewing miscarriage of justice applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494704">The current criminal conviction process is handled by the Criminal Conviction Review Group within the Department of Justice Canada, which then advises the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> on cases with grounds for review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494705"> The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> was mandated, in 2019 and 2021, to work toward the establishment of an independent criminal case review commission to improve access to justice for people who have potentially been wrongfully convicted to have their applications reviewed. Of course, myself and the Conservatives are very sympathetic to people who have been wrongfully convicted, like David Milgaard, whom this bill has been named after. No one wants innocent people to be convicted and to be in jail. We also do not want guilty people on our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494706"> It is important to have a wrongful conviction review procedure, which Canada has had for a very long time. The problem with the current system is that there is political intervention. It is cumbersome and bureaucratic. We were very optimistic that Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> could be the answer to addressing some of these issues. As is on the record, at second reading, Conservatives were in favour of this legislation, and it was sent to committee to look at potential amendments. There was one part in the legislation where we genuinely thought there was a drafting error, which can happen on occasion, and it was looked into at committee. I want to thank my Conservative colleagues who sit on the justice committee for their detailed work and their expertise on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494707">The threshold for getting a review is very low. Right now, it is worded as if it has “likely occurred”, referring to a miscarriage of justice. This bill would change that to “may have occurred”. Conservatives on the committee thought that they could convince the other members of the committee to keep the higher threshold, which did not happen, so now, it has come back to the House at third reading. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494708">One of the good parts of the bill is that it would take the political realm out of the process, which Conservatives like, to make it purely administrative. If that was all the legislation did, then we could very easily support it here in its present form. However, we believe that the lower threshold would open the door to all kinds of cases. We know that the court system is already very clogged and backlogged, but we were unable to convince members at committee to make the changes. The legislation that has come back to the House from committee is more problematic than what had been sent to committee. We think there are genuinely some clerical administrative errors with respect to the writing of the legislation. The original Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> application for review would use all available appeal avenues, such as a provincial court of appeal.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8494709">I do want to bring up a couple of quotes that I think are relevant to what we are talking about here today. David Lametti's speech, at second reading, on the miscarriage of justice review commission act, was on June 12, 2023, so it was almost exactly a year ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494710">He stated, “It is important to note that the miscarriage of justice review process is not an alternative to the judicial system, nor is it another level of appeal. Rather, it provides a post-appeal mechanism to review and investigate new information or evidence that was not previously considered by the courts.” We agree with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494711"> As well, in the press release entitled, “Minister of Justice introduces legislation (David and Joyce Milgaard’s Law) to establish an independent Miscarriage of Justice Review Commission”, it stated, “The proposed new commission would not be an alternative to the justice system. Applicants would first need to exhaust their rights of appeal before requesting a miscarriage of justice review by the commission.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494712"> We also agree with this. However, this is not what the legislation does. In addition, <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister Virani</Affiliation>, at committee, in October of 2023—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8494715"> The <Affiliation DbId="299999" Type="96">minister</Affiliation>, in October 2023, stated, “I think there are built-in factors to avoid them getting all the way through the floodgates. You still need to meet the threshold criteria. You need to have exhausted your appeals, at least to a court of appeal or, in some instances, all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494716"> However, since that date, in October 2023, the government has changed its approach. It has removed that requirement altogether. What it originally stated last year, with this legislation, was in fact not what we have before us today. In particular, the amendments made at committee are very far apart from the original comments that were made in the original tabling of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494717">As I mentioned, Conservatives did support this at second reading to go to committee. The Liberals made amendments at committee. They are really going around the appeal system, and this makes it very difficult for us to support the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494718"> One other thing I want to mention is that unlike the current process where the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> decides whether a miscarriage of justice has likely occurred, this new commission would decide whether a miscarriage of justice may have occurred and whether it is in the interest of justice to direct a new trial or to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494719">Wording does matter. That is why it is very important that in legislation, especially when we are talking about judicial legislation, every word is really thought about very carefully. Some of the issues that I have brought forth are really problematic. There really is quite a gap from the statements by the minister, the statements that were originally from the government.

We have citizens being traumatized in our communities by the revolving door of people breaking the law. On the other side, there are people being convicted whom we want to help, and of course within our jurisdiction, it would be in the federal penitentiaries. If we do not help them while they are in those penitentiaries, the recidivism and the revolving doors just continue. My legislation, the <Document DbId="11540753" Type="4">end the revolving door act</Document>, would have been one way to genuinely help people.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8494729">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C‑40</Document>. This bill seeks to modernize the Canadian justice system by creating the miscarriage of justice review commission to address shortcomings in the processing of miscarriage of justice applications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494730">We are all aware of this issue; it has been rather well documented. The minister at the time, David Lametti, commissioned a study in 2021 to examine the issue because the processing times for the applications of people claiming to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice were completely unreasonable. In some cases, people who managed to complete the process had already spent many years behind bars, part of their lives, before being found innocent and released from prison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494731">The issue clearly needed to be addressed. The Liberal minister at the time, Mr. Lametti, commissioned a study and launched consultations, after which all the experts agreed that the minister needed to be stripped of one of his powers that might be characterized as absolute. Traditionally, under our laws, the minister alone had the fairly significant power to decide whether a person who claimed to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice could have a re-trial. That put a lot of power in the hands of one person, the person holding the position of Minister of Justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494732">Although the minister worked with a team, it was still necessary to create a quasi-judicial commission made up of commissioners independent of the government apparatus in order to restore public trust. These commissioners will be able to take over from the minister to expedite the process of analyzing applications from people who believe they have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. This should also serve to increase public trust in the fact that the people analyzing these applications are neutral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494733">There is one thing we find hard to understand. The Liberals have been in power since 2015. The Minister of Justice, Mr. Lametti, commissioned this study back in the day, and it had fairly unanimous support, yet he waited until 2023 to introduce his bill. Why is it that today, in June 2024, we are using an expedited legislative process to get this bill adopted? Two years ago, certain people could have benefited from a new miscarriage of justice review commission. We find it hard to comprehend why, all of a sudden, the Liberals are rushing to pass this bill even though it has been in the works since 2021 and has unanimous support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494734">When the bill was studied in committee, our justice critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278276" Type="2">Rivière-du-Nord</Affiliation>, said that this commission was necessary and that he supported the bill. Naturally, the Bloc Québécois is going to vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C‑40</Document>. We hope, once the bill is passed, that the government will promptly implement all necessary measures to allow the new commissioners to get on with their work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494735">Now, there is another question we are asking ourselves. Minister Lametti commissioned this study in 2021, but he also made a big decision in 2021, one that is hard to understand. I read another article today in the investigative section of La Presse. Former justice minister David Lametti is still being asked why, for example, he ordered a second trial in the Jacques Delisle case. Jacques Delisle is a former judge who was found guilty of murdering his wife. It is hard to understand why the minister did that. It is not just me, the member for Salaberry—Suroît, who is saying this.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8494736">As of March, Quebec's director of criminal and penal prosecutions still did not understand why the minister had ordered a new trial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494737">With the powers the justice minister held at the time, Mr. Lametti set in motion an entire legal process to retry Jacques Delisle, which obviously led to further investigations. The minister could only order a new trial if new and relevant information had been brought to his attention, if it could be demonstrated that evidence had not been presented at trial or if new evidence had come to light. To this day, Quebec's director of criminal and penal prosecutions is asking former justice minister and lawyer David Lametti to explain himself. Obviously, certain decisions were made as a result of the minister's decision. The Delisle trial has concluded, but not to the satisfaction of Quebec's director of criminal and penal prosecutions, which is understandable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494738">Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C‑40</Document>, which we are debating, may rectify what has been a willingness to concentrate power in the hands of a single individual who holds the position of minister of justice. It is hard not to agree with that. We have every reason to question this. To the Bloc Québécois, it is important that the public and the citizens the minister represents have confidence in our system and that the victims also have confidence in the process and trust beyond a doubt that their case will be studied in a neutral, fair and equitable manner, based on the facts and any new evidence they might present.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494739">During study of the bill in committee, there were debates, including one that surprised us in the Bloc Québécois. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278276" Type="2">Rivière-du-Nord</Affiliation>, who is our justice critic and a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, introduced a single amendment. To us, that amendment made so much sense that we assumed its adoption was a mere formality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494740">The purpose of the amendment that the Bloc Québécois introduced in committee was to require judges, who play a quasi-judicial role in this miscarriage of justice review commission, to be bilingual or at least comfortable in both official languages. I would remind the House that Canada's two official languages are English and French. These two languages are governed by Canada's Official Languages Act. To ensure that the cases of francophones and anglophones are assessed fairly, the commissioners assigned to the case must be able to listen, ask questions and analyze evidence in both official languages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494741">To our great surprise, the amendment was defeated by a vote of six to five. A Liberal member who serves on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights opposed it. Did his party use him as a scapegoat? I have no idea. He is an Ontario MP. We were very disappointed by that because the amendment made a lot of sense. Canada has an Official Languages Act, and it seemed very obvious to us that this was the way to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494742">That will not prevent us from voting in favour of Bill C‑40, but once again, we are dealing with a total lack of understanding about the importance of French and the importance of guaranteeing Quebeckers and Canadians access in both official languages to the people who will be assessing their case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494743">I hope that Bill C‑40 will be passed quickly and that the commissioners can get to work soon.</ParaText>

I think about the people who were wrongly convicted and who could not afford high-priced lawyers, more often than not women and other marginalized groups, who need reform to the justice system. This miscarriage of justice bill represents a critical step in our ongoing efforts to reform the system and to address the systemic inequities that have plagued it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494760">For the better part of a decade, New Democrats have called for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate wrongful convictions. In 2021, we supported expediting Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> in return for the Liberals' promise to create this commission, which Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> would finally deliver on. Justice delayed is justice denied, so we must act swiftly to ensure that those who are wrongfully convicted have a pathway to justice, free from delays and limitations in the current system. </ParaText>

They work tirelessly to improve the system and, with regard to Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document> at committee stage, the NDP supported amendments that would ensure applicants could apply to the commission without having to receive a verdict from a court of appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. This would remove a significant barrier for those who are wrongfully convicted but lacking the resources to continue lengthy legal battles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494762">New Democrats also proposed amendments to empower the commission to make recommendations addressing systemic issues that lead to the miscarriage of justice. This proactive approach could help prevent future injustices. Additionally, we ensured that Correctional Service Canada and the Parole Board of Canada would be informed of the importance of not obstructing applicants from accessing programs and services due to their review applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494763">Indigenous women, in particular, have disproportionately suffered miscarriages of justice. They are often charged, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned due to systemic failures within the criminal justice system and the broader societal failure to protect them from racism, sexism and violence. This is a critical issue that strikes at the core of justice inequity in our society. I ask why people living in poverty have higher rates of wrongful convictions in Canada? It certainly highlights the disparities in our legal system and challenges our collective commitment to fairness and justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494764">To understand this issue, we must first acknowledge that socio-economic status currently influences outcomes in the criminal justice process. From the moment suspects are identified, their financial status begins to shape their journey through the legal system. Unfortunately, for those without adequate funds, this journey often leads to a higher likelihood of wrongful conviction due to several intersecting factors: lack of adequate legal representation, systemic biases and the pressures of plea bargaining. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494765">One of the most significant factors contributing to wrongful conviction is inadequate legal representation. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right to counsel, but in practice, the quality of legal representation a defendant receives can vary drastically based on their ability to pay. Consequently, poorer defendants frequently find themselves under-represented in court, lacking thorough investigation, expert witnesses and comprehensive legal strategies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494766">Systemic biases play a crucial role in the higher rates of wrongful convictions among people with limited financial means. The justice system, which should be impartial, is not. It is not immune to the biases and prejudices that permeate society. Socio-economic status can influence the perceptions of judges, jurors and law enforcement officers. Poorer defendants often face these implicit biases, as their lack of resources and lower social standing can be subconsciously associated with criminal behaviour. We have heard it in this very House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494767">This bias can lead to harsher judgments, weaker defences and, ultimately, wrongful convictions. It is proven in convictions that the intersection of race and poverty affect outcomes. Indigenous peoples and racial minorities, who are disproportionately represented among poorer Canadians, face compounded biases that increase their vulnerability to wrongful convictions. Studies have shown that indigenous and Black Canadians are more likely to be wrongfully convicted than their white counterparts, highlighting a deeply rooted problem of racial and economic inequality in our justice system. I note that the Conservatives do not understand this. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8494768">Another critical aspect contributing to wrongful convictions is the pressure to accept plea bargains. Plea bargaining, intended to expedite the judicial process and reduce caseloads, often places an undue burden on poor defendants. Faced with the prospect of prolonged pretrial detention, high bail amounts they cannot afford and the uncertainty of a trial, many low-income defendants feel compelled to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit in exchange for a reduced sentence. This coercive aspect of plea bargaining leads to a troubling reality where innocence is sacrificed for expediency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494769">Let us add that probation requires admittance of guilt, so the wrongfully convicted are forced to make unjust choices. Furthermore, wrongful convictions have devastating consequences beyond the individual. They erode trust in the legal system, perpetuate cycles of poverty and fail to address the real perpetrators of crime. When an innocent person is convicted, the actual offender remains free, posing a continued threat to society. This failure to deliver true justice undermines public confidence and perpetuates the belief that the system is rigged against the marginalized. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494770">The Conservatives are fine with this reality. They say to just appeal. With all of the barriers I just outlined above, it is obvious that appeal is neither equitable nor just. Expanding access to post-conviction review and innocence projects can provide a safety net for those who have been wrongfully convicted. Organizations such as Innocence Canada work tirelessly to investigate claims of innocence and exonerate the wrongfully accused. By supporting their efforts and facilitating the review of questionable convictions, we can rectify past injustices and prevent future ones. It should not have to be that way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8494771">In conclusion, the higher rates of wrongful convictions among lower-income Canadians highlight profound inequities in Canada's legal system. From inadequate legal representation and systemic biases to the pressure of plea bargaining and resource imbalances, the odds are stacked against those with limited financial means. With respect to Bill <Document DbId="12237277" Type="3">C-40</Document>, miscarriage of justice, it is incumbent on all of us to have a justice system that functions well and does not put innocent people behind bars. </ParaText>

It would do two critical things. One, it would impose a mandatory minimum penalty under the Criminal Code for perjury before a House of Parliament; and second, it would allow Parliament to impose a fine of up to $50,000 for a contempt against a House of Parliament. This is incredibly important in the context that we have seen of the Prime Minister's $60-million arrive scam and contempt that has been found before the House.

              <ParaText id="8495086">Mr. Speaker, the following reflects a consolidated response approved on behalf of Global Affairs Canada ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495087">Maintaining international peace and security and protecting human rights are central to Canada's foreign policy. Canada has one of the most rigorous export control systems in the world, harmonized with those of our allies and partners under the major export control regimes. Canada’s accession to the Arms Trade Treaty, ATT, in 2019 has further strengthened this approach. Canadian residents wishing to export items on the export control list, ECL, must apply for, and be issued, a permit prior to export. Items listed on the ECL include a wide variety of goods and technology intended for both civilian and military purposes, destined to a broad range of end-users. Examples of items include forest and agricultural products, telecommunications equipment, decontamination equipment, cryptographic equipment, protective equipment, simulators, imaging equipment, electronic components, firearms, and ammunition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495088">All permit applications for controlled items are reviewed on a case-by-case basis as part of a robust risk assessment, including against ATT criteria, which have been enshrined in the Export and Import Permits Act, EIPA. Permits for the export of controlled goods and technology from Canada will not be issued if there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international human rights law or international humanitarian law, to undermine peace and security, to facilitate international organized crime or terrorism, or to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children. Pursuant to EIPA amendments made in 2019, the government must table, no later than May 31 of each year, annual reports with respect to the administration of the EIPA and the export of military goods over the course of the preceding year; these had previously been tabled on a voluntary basis since 1990. The 2023 annual report on the export of military goods was tabled in Parliament by May 31, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495089">GAC does not comment on individual permits or permit applications, as the specific details of controlled items requested to be exported are protected commercial information. Furthermore, the disclosure of such information would be counter to the principles set out in the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act, as well as other legislative and legal obligations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495092">In response to part (i), the Canada dental benefit, CDB, has two eligibility periods from December 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, and from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495093">We note that one application may include multiple children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495094">During period 1, from December 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, the CRA received 206,290 applications for 323,350 children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495095">During period 2, from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, as of April 24, 2024, the CRA has received 219,430 applications for 348,710 children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495096">Between both periods, since December 1, 2022, 441,180 unique children have been supported through the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495097">In response to part (ii), due to the upfront validation program design of the interim CDB, the number of applications approved equals the number of applications received. Consequently, the CDB volumes stated in response to part (i) are the same for part (ii).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495098">In response to part (iii), the CDB payment was designed to provide upfront financial assistance in which the applicant attests that they have incurred, or will incur, costs related to dental care services. Consequently, the CRA is not in a position to provide the requested number of Canadians who have received dental care paid for through the benefit, as the CRA does not have the data available.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495100">Mr. Speaker, in response to part (a), developing and maintaining good-quality Canada-wide data on how plastic moves through the economy is necessary to transition towards a circular economy in Canada. The federal plastics registry, the registry, will provide critical data that will identify opportunities for the government to take further action to reduce plastic waste and pollution, as well as help monitor progress over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495101">The cost to government to collect data for the registry is $7,294,154 projected over five years to establish the registry, and $600,756 each year after for maintenance. The cost of inaction against plastic pollution in Canada is very high. As an example, the regulatory impact analysis statement for the single-use plastics prohibition regulations, SUPPR, determined that the SUPPR alone will save Canadians $581 million over 10 years in avoided terrestrial litter cleanup costs. Canadians want to see more concrete action, like the SUPPR, from governments and industry to tackle plastic pollution. The registry is a stepping stone for future actions that tackle plastic pollution and cut costs for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495102">In response to part (b), reporting requirements for the federal plastics registry will be introduced in phases to allow time and flexibility for those obligated to report. Phase 1 reporting will start in September 2025, requiring reporting on plastic placed on the market in three categories, electronic and electrical equipment, packaging, and single-use or disposable products, for the 2024 calendar year. Phase 2 reporting will start in 2026, adding reporting requirements for resin manufacturers and importers, as well as reporting on plastic placed on the market for the remaining categories: tires, transportation, construction, agriculture and horticulture, fishing and aquaculture, apparel and textiles. In 2026, reporting on plastic waste generated at industrial, commercial, and institutional facilities, plastic collected at end-of-life, as well as plastic sent for diversion and disposal for some categories, will also be introduced. In 2027, additional reporting requirements on plastics collected and sent for diversion and disposal for more categories will be added. Details of the reporting schedule appear in schedule 5 of the “Notice with respect to reporting of plastic resins and certain plastic products for the Federal Plastics Registry for 2024, 2025 and 2026”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495103">In response to part (c), Environment and Climate Change Canada, ECCC, has consulted extensively on the development of the registry, and no company has quantified the cost of reporting or signaled how these costs would impact the price of food or consumer goods. ECCC continues to work with companies on the development of a technical guidance to reduce the administrative tasks and costs associated with reporting and assist them in fulfilling their obligations. ECCC has also created category-specific working groups to better understand supply chains and develop targeted reporting methodologies to further assist companies in fulfilling their reporting obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495104">The federal plastics registry, the registry, is the most comprehensive registry of its kind. Other registries are usually limited to a few categories like packaging or electronics and electrical equipment. These registries differ from the registry by including provisions for extended producer responsibility and assigning costs to producers for the plastics they put on the market. Note that the registry assigns no charges to food or consumer good companies and does not regulate food or consumer products in any manner. It only aims to create an inventory of data on plastics throughout their life cycle and across several sectors of the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495106">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada recognizes the need for political parties recognized in the House of Commons to have access to information that can help them protect themselves from threats and has undertaken a range of initiatives to contribute to this important objective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495107">As part of the plan to protect Canada's democracy, the Privy Council Office provides security clearances to representatives of political parties recognized in the House of Commons. These clearances give political party representatives the opportunity to attend briefings during pre-election and election periods, including recent by-election periods. The briefings, provided by the security and intelligence threats to elections, SITE, task force, range from unclassified to secret-level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495108">In addition to offering to sponsor clearances for representatives of political parties recognized in the House of Commons in the context of elections and by-elections, the Government of Canada also provides security clearances that allow parliamentarians and representatives of political parties recognized in the House of Commons to view documents intended for a readership beyond the government itself. This includes classified reports such as the independent special rapporteur's first report with its classified annex, which was published in May 2023, as well as the rapporteur's classified final report, completed in June 2023. Recently, Commissioner Hogue, who leads the public inquiry into foreign interference in Canada's federal elections and democratic processes, published her initial report in May 2024, which also contained a classified annex. The Privy Council Office is responsible for facilitating the necessary security clearances at the required level for those representatives from political parties recognized in the House of Commons who need to access these classified reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495109">Another key component of the government’s commitment to meaningful engagement with parliamentarians on national security is reflected in the 2017 establishment of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, NSICOP. The committee's mandate includes reviewing the legislative, regulatory, policy, administrative, and financial framework for national security and intelligence. It also covers any activity related to national security or intelligence conducted by a government department, except for ongoing operations where the appropriate minister determines that a review would jeopardize national security. Additionally, NSICOP can examine any matter pertaining to national security or intelligence that is referred to it by a minister of the Crown. NSICOP comprises 10 parliamentarians who hold top secret-level clearances and are bound by the provisions of the Security of Information Act, which requires them to maintain strict secrecy. Currently, NSICOP consists of three members from the Liberal Party of Canada, two from the Conservative Party of Canada, one from the Bloc Québécois, one from the New Democratic Party, and three senators. These individuals play an important role in conducting independent reviews and providing oversight of national security and intelligence activities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495110">Additionally, the government has recently introduced Bill C-70, an act respecting countering foreign interference, which proposes to update existing laws to better equip the government to detect, disrupt, and protect against foreign interference threats.  Amongst other measures, this legislation would enable broader disclosure of Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, information to key partners beyond the Government of Canada, with appropriate safeguards, to help partners build resiliency to threats.  </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495113">Since 2014, Canada has sanctioned over 3,000 entities and individuals in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova and imposed numerous other measures in the financial, trade of goods and services, energy and transport sectors. These measures aim to denounce Russia’s breach of international security and those who support it, limit the Russian government’s ability to finance its illegal war against Ukraine, and pressure the Putin regime to change its behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495114">On February 21, 2024, Canada marked the two-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by imposing a number of new sanctions, including, among other measures, the listing of 10 individuals and 153 entities known to provide support to Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495115">Any person in Canada or Canadian outside Canada is prohibited from dealing in the property of, entering into transactions with, providing services to, transferring property to, or otherwise making goods available to listed persons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495117">The Government of Canada respects privacy and commercial confidentiality and does not comment on permit applications made in the context of the Special Economic Measures Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495118">While the government does not comment on specific permit applications, from a general perspective each application for a permit or certificate that is received is reviewed in depth on a case-by-case basis. This review involves extensive analysis, applicable intra- and interdepartmental consultations, and significant due diligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495119">Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering, demonstrated through its leadership in sanctioning strategic Russian industries complicit in the Putin regime’s ongoing breaches of international law. Canada stands with Ukraine and will continue to impose severe costs on Russia until it puts an end to its illegal, unprovoked, and unjustifiable war. Moreover, Canada shares this conviction with its allies and partners who, together, will continue to increase international pressure on Russia in support of Ukraine.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should designate the first day in October every year as National Canadian Seafood Day in recognition of the significant contributions of Canada’s fish harvesters and their families from coast to coast to coast, all the processors who help deliver world-class products that are enjoyed domestically and internationally, and all those who work in the seafood industry, which is a vital employment and economic driver in so many coastal communities across Canada.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495157"> He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House today and introduce Motion No. 111, which would establish a national Canadian seafood day on the first day of October each year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495158">National Canadian seafood day would recognize and promote the rich and diverse nature of the safe, high-quality and delicious seafood we produce here in Canada. We are long overdue in having one day a year dedicated to this very important industry. Canada is uniquely defined in its extensive network of lakes, rivers and wetlands, as well as its geographical positioning, bordered by three vast oceans: the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Pacific. We are also home to one of the world's largest and most diverse supply of marine and freshwater fish. We have the world's longest coastline, which is home to many coastal communities in Canada. We are also recognized by and proud of our iconic fish and seafood, which are synonymous with taste, quality and sustainability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495159">If someone is from Quebec, the Atlantic provinces or Northwest Territories, lobster and crab are their most popular product. British Columbia and Nunavut produce salmon and Salmonidae respectively as their number one products. As we move inland, processing takes over. Manitoba and Ontario count frozen fish fillets as their number one seafood product. Even landlocked Saskatchewan last year produced $7.2 million worth of farmed trout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495160"> At the heart of Motion No. 111 lies a profound acknowledgement of the significance of fish and seafood to Canada's society and our blue economy, particularly in many rural, coastal communities. In supporting this motion, we would signal to Canadians our deep appreciation of the people involved in the sector and bring attention to an industry that sustains millions across the country and around the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495161">Our coastal communities depend on Canadian fisheries for jobs and prosperity. This point was illustrated in 2022 when commercial sea and freshwater fisheries landings alone were valued at an impressive $4.8 billion, with aquaculture production contributing an additional $1.3 billion to our nation's economy. The total contribution to GDP from the Canadian seafood industry was more than $9 billion in 2022, a figure that is growing annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495162">These figures underscore the substantial economic impact of this industry in providing nutrition and delicious products not only here at home, but also around the world. More than just representing the products we ship abroad, this data represents the bread and butter put on Canadian tables through the hard work of those in this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495163">At home, Canada's fish and seafood industry is composed of a vast network of individuals whose livelihoods depend on factors ranging from climate, weather and ice patterns, to the health of fish stocks and the state of global markets. From fish harvesters navigating the icy waters of the Atlantic to processors meticulously preparing seafood products for markets, over 72,000 Canadians are directly employed with this sector. This includes more than 50,000 individuals in commercial fisheries and more than 20,000 in seafood product preparation and packaging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495164">Fish and seafood also play a vital role in the economic livelihoods of many indigenous communities. Commercial fishing, subsistence harvesting and processing provide employment opportunities that generate income for indigenous fish harvesters, processors and entrepreneurs. Across our country, hard-working individuals engage in meaningful employment within the sector, sustaining livelihoods along the supply chain and fostering economic growth in communities from coast to coast to coast, while also playing a critical role in ensuring the quality, sustainability and safety of our seafood products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495165">Beyond those roles, countless others are employed in spin-off industries such as transportation, retail and tourism, all of which are sustained by the demand for sustainable harvested fish and seafood products. The overall economic impact of fish and seafood reverberates far beyond the shores of our coastal communities, extending into urban centres and rural areas alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495166">These individuals are the backbone of our fish and seafood industry, and their dedication and resilience deserve to be celebrated and honoured. Canada's position as one of the world's largest exporters of fish and seafood on the global stage is a testament to the quality and competitiveness of our products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495167">In 2023, our nation's exports of fish and seafood amounted to an impressive $7.6 billion, showcasing the industry's ability to thrive in international markets. In 2023, we sent a whopping $4.9 billion worth of fish and seafood to our largest trading partner, the United States. Our friends to the south of the border love our fresh or processed lobster, fresh crab, salmon, halibut and scallops. The Chinese market is fond of Canadian lobster, cold-water shrimp, fresh crab and frozen clams.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8495168"> The European Union imports over $400 million worth of tasty Canadian fish and seafood a year, becoming our third biggest importer, and it continues to grow. Rounding out the top Canadian seafood importing jurisdictions last year are Chile, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Norway, Japan, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. We should be proud of the billions of dollars we export annually in fish and seafood, and we are working to expand those markets even further. This past February, we opened Canada's first-ever agriculture and agri-food office in the Indo-Pacific region in Manila. This office will help us make connections in the region and share knowledge that will make our partnerships in food, including seafood, stronger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495169">With a diverse and delicious array of sustainably harvested products, Canadian seafood is highly sought after in global markets. Canada is proud to be a trusted and reliable trading partner to the world. Canada exports its fish and seafood to 115 countries around the world. These exports not only contribute to Canada's overall economic growth but also strengthen our trade relationships with key partners, and enhance our position in a global marketplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495170">Our fish and seafood products matter, as do the livelihoods of those working in the sector. Supporting Motion No. 111 matters. In Canada, we already have a designated Agriculture Day, which we celebrate in February. We also celebrate the Saturday before the first Monday in August as Food Day. Furthermore, the United States celebrates October as National Seafood Month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495171">By designating a day to celebrate Canada's fish and seafood, we can put a spotlight on this unique and important sector and those who work in it by celebrating their significant role in our economy. As we look forward to potentially celebrating the first annual national Canadian seafood day, let us continue to buy, cook and eat Canadian seafood products. Let us take part in the celebrations, enjoy the catch of the day and try new recipes using Canadian ingredients. Let us seek out exciting products that highlight the diversity of cultures' cuisines that make up our great country. Let us recognize those behind the scenes, our fish harvesters and food entrepreneurs, who are working hard and putting forth their best ideas to solve some of the world's most pressing food security and environmental challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495172">Our hard-working Canadian seafood producers and processors are leaders in innovative technologies, and their products meet the highest standards. That is what makes Canada a trusted supplier around the world for seafood that is both high quality and sustainable. It does not hurt that it is really delicious too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495173"> In supporting Motion No. 111, we have the opportunity to provide national recognition to an industry that not only sustains livelihoods, but drives our economic growth and prosperity. From the rugged shorelines of Newfoundland to the Canadian Arctic archipelago to the pristine waters of British Columbia, the economic impact of this industry is felt in communities large and small. This motion is not merely about saying we support setting a date on the calendar; it is about marking a moment of national acknowledgement for the resilience, innovation and enduring spirit of an industry that is unquestionably Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495174">By designating the first day of October each year as national Canadian seafood day, we affirm our commitment to honouring the contributions of fish harvesters, processors and all those who labour tirelessly in this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495175">In conclusion, the quality of Canadian fish and seafood is unlike anywhere else in the world. Canada's fish and seafood sector is a vital engine to our economic growth. Let us seize this opportunity to foster a brighter and more prosperous future for all Canadians involved in this sector. Let us celebrate the pride, passion, resiliency and hard work of all those who bring fish and seafood onto the plates of consumers here at home and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495176">I am incredibly proud to stand here to introduce this motion. I look forward to seeing members' support to realize the vision of celebrating a national Canadian seafood day in the coming years and for generations to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495181">Mr. Speaker, this is a very important issue and a very touchy issue for the fishermen, even in my riding. Some of my family fish, and I hear all about the seals all the time and the amount of fish they are eating. I did attend one of the committee meetings that the hon. member was attending, and the Maritime Fishermen's Union, I believe, was at the table, and we were having this discussion. It becomes a very tricky situation when we have the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States, and that is where the conversation led. We need to do more with the U.S. in regard to the seal, because we all know what happened in the mid-1980s. Our lobster fishery almost collapsed because of the feedback and negativity that surrounded the seal-processing hunt.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495194"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278141" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>'s motion to create national seafood day on the first day of October. I note, it is numbered Motion No. 111, which is a great number for it. I would have been happier if it was Motion No. 1, but Motion No. 111 is a good substitute, because three times, four times or five times, this is the most important industry in our rural coastal communities on all three coasts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495195">We will be supporting this motion, but I would like to make a few comments about it. As I said a little earlier, I represent a very large fishery riding, the riding of South Shore—St. Margarets. There are more than 5,000 commercial fishermen in my community. Every possible species one could think of that is commercially harvested is harvested in the South Shore of Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495196">Of course, the most lucrative one is the best lobster in the world from Lobster Fishing Area 33 and Lobster Fishing Area 34, a winter fishery. Seafood, and lobster in particular, is our number one industry in Nova Scotia. It drives our GDP. There would not be any government jobs in Halifax if it was not for the wealth generated by fishing for the food Canadians eat in the South Shore of Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495197">As much as I support this motion, as much as we support this motion, I believe it is, after nine years, the first time the government has actually done anything positive for the seafood industry. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278141" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation> went through the numbers financially of what it does, province by province and species by species. I would say that some of those are declining numbers because the government has pursued policies that have actually harmed the industry, when it has pursued any at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495198">I will start maybe with something I have raised quite frequently over the last year, which is the elver fishery. I know everybody knows what an elver is. It is otherwise known as a glass eel, a baby eel. After being born in the Sargasso Sea, they swim back to the rivers of Maine, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. They go up the rivers to become full-size adult, grown eels that live for about 25 years before they migrate back out to the ocean to reproduce. These are the most expensive fish we harvest in Canada, and arguably in the world, at $5,000 a kilogram. That is the cost of the glass eels, or elvers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495199">This industry has been under attack. Elvers are exported, by the way, live to China, where they are grown into full-size eels for food. This industry has been under attack because of the incompetence of the government. In particular, fisheries minister number four, whom I defeated, closed this fishery in the year 2020 in hopes that the poaching would end, and then, the poaching increased. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495200">Fisheries minister number five, last year, closed the industry halfway through the season in hopes that the poaching would stop, and it increased. <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">Fisheries minister</Affiliation> number six, this year, did the same thing. The ministers have done the same thing three out of the last four years and have expected a different result. That is the definition of insanity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495201">The best way to enforce the law is to arrest the people on the river who do not have a licence, and 74% of the rivers in the Maritimes, where there are poachers, are not licensed rivers, so it is easy to identify where they are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495202">The government has ignored many great reports. I mentioned the issue of pinnipeds earlier. Those are seals, sea lions and walruses. The House of Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans did an excellent unanimous report on that, and I will tell the House what some witnesses said. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495203">Trevor Jones, who is a fish harvester, said, “Leadership within DFO, in its wisdom, seems to think that closing a commercial fishery [that being seals] to harvesters will save and help rebuild fish stocks, but the truth is that it does not.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495204">When the fishery was closed 31 years ago, the cod fishery, the groundfishery, there were about three million seals in Newfoundland. Now, there are over eight million seals, with no harvest, and the expectation is that the fish will come back. Even though 97% of the unnatural mortality in the Atlantic Ocean of fish is caused by seals, the government sits on its duff and does nothing. It only just acknowledged, after 31 years, last year, that seals eat fish. That was a revelation to the Liberals that seals eat fish. I guess they were enjoying Alberta beef like the rest of us do. The Liberals have a record of inaction on almost every file.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495205"> Recently, only a few weeks ago, there was an issue with the endangered right whales. There is a great policy that when a right whale is discovered swimming by Nova Scotia or into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, there is what is called a dynamic closure, a closure for 15 days of the area where the whale is spotted. If the whale is not spotted again, it opens up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495206"> Right whales cannot swim in less than 10 fathoms of water. Nonetheless, the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, only a few weeks ago, closed a fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence right up to the coast, right up to the sand, to the edge, in less than 10 fathoms of water, throwing crab fishermen and lobster fishermen in that area out of work. Of course the massive protests were so bad that the Liberals' own <Affiliation DbId="278104" Type="2">member</Affiliation> from northern New Brunswick criticized the minister of fisheries for yet again failing to understand the basics of the fishery. The minister had to back down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495207">The simple, basic closure is estimated to have cost the community a considerable amount of money. The cost, apparently, for the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s mistake was $40 million to the industry and to the people in the community. Martin Mallet of the Maritime Fishermen's Union did say that it is difficult to put a price on the closure cost-wise, but for two weeks, depending on the number of fishermen, it can easily go into a few million dollars' worth of lost revenues. The whales do not go into water less than 10 fathoms deep, yet the minister thought, “Well, let's close that and put people out of work.” Yet again it was another failure by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495208">The list goes on. There has been an issue of poaching in the lobster fishery. Some members will remember that it, most famously, was in the news again in St. Marys Bay in the riding of West Nova in 2020. The minister refused to implement and enforce the law. That is the basis of our society: enforcing law. The fishery cannot work unless the law is enforced. It is sort of like saying, “You know what, the Trans-Canada Highway has a speed limit, but there'll never be any police on the road.” Do members think everybody would do the speed limit? That is what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495209"> DFO, in large parts of the province of Nova Scotia, between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. has absolutely nobody on duty. DFO does not meet boats when they come off the wharf, does not monitor the catch as it comes in, and allows illegal fishing. In fact DFO does not even have any idea of the food and ceremonial fishery of first nations with respect to how much is caught. There has been testimony at committee from DFO enforcement officers who said that 90% of that in Nova Scotia is an illegal commercial fishery. DFO does get catch data for the FSC fishery in B.C. but does not get it in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495210">There has been failure after failure by the government with respect to the fishery, to the point that I would be surprised, out of the fishing ridings in Atlantic Canada, to see any Liberal survive the next election, given the anger towards the government on fishery management, with its six incompetent fisheries ministers over the last nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495211">Again and again, when asked by the committee unanimously for the government to act, the government ignores what it does. We have raised the issues with the parliamentary secretary, who I see is in the House, but still nothing seems to happen on the elver fishery, the lobster fishery enforcement and the many other fisheries that our communities depend on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495212">I would say that while we do celebrate the fishery, one day is not enough. I would like the government to celebrate the commercial fishery every single day and do its job. Its job in the oldest department in the government is to ensure the sustainable growth of a commercial fishery for generation after generation, yet the government is introducing marine-protected areas in areas where nothing needs to be protected, and it cannot even produce the science in those areas that would show that something is endangered and that the cause of endangerment is actually the commercial fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495213"> I have asked the government questions on that. I have asked it to provide the documents on these things, and it cannot do it, because it is making stuff up as it goes along. As it does so, it harms the day-to-day fishery and the rural communities in our country that depend on the fishery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495214">Therefore while we support the motion, we would ask the government to start doing a better job and pay attention to what fishermen are saying and what needs to be done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8495216">The Bloc Québécois would especially like to acknowledge the demanding and difficult work that our fish harvesters take on every time they go to sea to serve our communities and provide Quebeckers with products that make us proud. In many ways, these men and women embody the resilience, solidarity, and mutual support at the very core of the fish harvesting trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495217">We also want to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by the temporary foreign workers who sustain the commercial activities of many independent fish harvesters and processors in Quebec. Without them, the challenges facing the industry would be all the greater, even to the point of forcing many businesses to close or go bankrupt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495218">As for the commitment of our many communities, the reeves of RCMs and the processing companies in these areas are vital allies and partners in spreading the word about this coastal economic reality. People here confront multiple challenges, including climate disturbances that are dramatically disrupting our marine ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495219">Historically, the Bloc Québécois has always vigorously defended workers in the primary sectors of our economy, because they are the very first link in the chain, but unfortunately, they are often the last to be recognized. From the boat to the dock, from the factory to our plates, our hard-working local fishers provide us with world-class products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495220">Establishing a national Canadian seafood day would not only be a gesture of recognition, but also an opportunity to bring to the forefront the important issues that affect this industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495221">I want to discuss a reality that needs to be clarified and that shows why the importance of further decentralizing fisheries management. The reality is that successive governments have always neglected Quebec's marine fisheries. Ottawa constantly uses the division of powers and its exclusive jurisdiction over the protection of stocks as an excuse to impose arbitrary decisions. I could name many other areas where this is the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495222">This situation is hindering the development of Quebec's fisheries. Let us not forget that the sector faces unique realities dictated by geopolitical events. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is not being transparent, and that is hurting this sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495223">The Bloc Québécois will ensure that fishers' concerns are heard in Ottawa and will always be there to stand up for their interests. Whether it is about the wharf in Cap‑aux‑Meules or the wintering yard in Grande‑Rivière, the federal government's conspicuous indifference is getting in the way of the fisheries sector's ability to reach its full regional development potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495224">I will paraphrase Jean Garon, a former minister of agriculture under the René Lévesque government who summed up the situation like this: no other aspect of Quebec's economic and social life has been or continues to be as mistreated by our belonging to Canada than the fisheries. I can say that nothing has changed since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495225">Let us talk about the cod and shrimp that are at risk or the way the department sped up their disappearance. These species have many natural predators, such as seals and redfish, not to mention exposure to the warming and oxygenation of the waters. The government does not even know in what proportion each of these factors contributed to the disappearance or mortality of these species.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495226">However, we can identify decisions the department made that have harmed these species, starting with its determination to maintain the redfish moratorium that was imposed in 1995. This moratorium was put in place to discourage the use of factory trawlers in the gulf and because redfish was particularly endangered at that time. However, it should have been lifted long before now. It was in place for a long time. The government took far too long to see the obvious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495227">The other reality is the complete lack of a strategy to promote seal products, which are still being boycotted by the United States and the European Union. It is really outdated to support what could be called the “Bardot effect”, but unfortunately, people still have a negative image in their minds. Let us be clear. The killing of baby seals has been banned since 1987, and methods have obviously changed a lot since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495228">The Bloc Québécois recently organized a seafood event in New Richmond. Our party's participation in the Salon Fourchette bleue trade show and in the working groups held in La Malbaie also shows the Bloc Québécois's firm commitment to fishers and coastal communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8495229">Let us talk about shrimp again for a moment. The federal government is telling shrimp and cod harvesters to transition to redfish, since there is an abundance of them. Just to remind everyone, this is just one small consequence of the poorly managed 1995 moratorium. Fishers will make do with it, but the equipment and processing plants still have to be adapted. The <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, however, is not considering any financial assistance or licence buyouts for the shrimp industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495230">Daniel Côté, the mayor of Gaspé, and Patrice Element, the director of the Office des pêcheurs de crevettes du Québec, a shrimp non-profit, believe that for this decision to be truly meaningful, shrimp harvesters would have to be able to catch 60,000 tonnes or 80,000 tonnes of redfish or else change their licence. Obviously no one has thought about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495231">The member has moved a motion to celebrate the fisheries sector, its artisans and processors. That is all well and good. However, his party's mismanagement of the sector is partly responsible for the problems these workers and their families are currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495232">Yes, this government did increase shrimp quotas for redfish by 10%, but what it does not want to talk about is the fact that it granted more than 60% of the quotas to offshore trawlers, those out on the high seas. As the environment critic, I have to talk about this, because their impact on the marine environment is significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495233">Offshore trawlers are huge vessels that scrape the seabed to catch groundfish, along with many other species, plants and fish that get swept up in their nets. Moreover, this industrial fishing gear creates bycatch, which is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495234">It is good that fishers were offered compensation when the cod fishery closed, but offshore fishers are still allowed to fish cod, in addition to all the bycatch. All other fishers have to return the fish to the water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495235">To show how offshore fishers think and how little they care about bycatch, consider this statistic: Redfish sells for about 35¢ a pound, whereas halibut sells for $5.50. Obviously, bycatch is profitable. These big vessels are masters of bycatch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495236">The government allowed the Atlantic Groundfish Council, which is mostly made up of offshore fishers from eastern Canada, to get a mapping contract. The ship that is being used is 60 metres long and it is sailing in the Canadian zone of the Atlantic Ocean. Given how big the ship is, there is a good chance that it will damage the sea floor and destroy some ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495237">Why was that contract granted? Let us ask ourselves that question. The Canadian Coast Guard has the experience and expertise. The government could have asked the Coast Guard do that work, but it cannot because the Coast Guard's vessel was built in 1982 and it is undergoing repairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495238">The Bloc Québécois wants the maritime regions of Quebec to be better developed with a focus on food sovereignty. The Bloc Québécois regularly meets with stakeholders from maritime Quebec, and we will not waver in our support for them.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278788" Type="2">Ms. Lisa Marie Barron (Nanaimo—Ladysmith, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8495239">Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise today on a topic that very much impacts all of us across Canada. I am happy to be the NDP critic for fisheries and oceans, to participate as a member of the fisheries and oceans committee and to reinforce the importance of us taking the time to acknowledge the important work of fishers across Canada. For those reasons and many others, I am more than happy to support a motion for us to move forward with declaring that the government should designate October 1 as national Canadian seafood day. Who can disagree with that? We will be supporting the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495240">We know that fishers, harvesters, processors and other sector workers across the country deserve to have the recognition of a national Canadian seafood day. It is an industry that supports communities, contributes to food security, and generates economic opportunities and well-being for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495241">I have mentioned this before in the House, but I think it is particularly applicable to what we are talking about today. I am originally from St. John's, Newfoundland. I am now honoured to live in Nanaimo, British Columbia, on the west coast. They are two coastal communities very much impacted by what is happening in the fisheries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495242">The reason my family ended up moving from St. John's, Newfoundland to the west coast, where our home is now, was because of the cod moratorium. Although my family were not fishers, we were very much impacted economically by the implications of the cod collapse. I wanted to reinforce that because I know that my story, and with it the reasons why my family packed up our car, sold everything and drove from one side of Canada to the other, is not an individual one. I have heard from so many across the country who are deeply impacted by what is happening along our coasts and who want to have the ability to participate in a highly sustainable food source for Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495243"> Fishers across the country do so much to support us in providing us with sustainable food choices. We need to be doing all we can to support them. We know that our fisheries are particularly hard hit right now with the climate crisis and with waters warming. There are so many species around Canada that are impacted. We need to be ensuring that we are doing all that we can to not be adding more barriers and challenges for these species that need to be protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495244"> Days fly by quickly in these roles, so I cannot remember exactly when this was, but within the last two years, I met with a group called Fishing for Communities in Victoria, British Columbia. It is a network of “Indigenous and non-Indigenous fish harvesters, small businesses, fishmongers, chefs, restaurateurs, fishing families, and community organization” who are deeply concerned about the future of the seafood system and fisheries-dependent communities on the west coast of Canada. I will pull a piece right off of the website because I feel that it has a really good way of summarizing what is going on on the west coast of Canada, specifically. It says, “Decades ago, fisheries policy changed on the West Coast [when DFO] privatized fishing access rights making fishing licenses and quota available to the highest bidder on the open market.” Since then, B.C. fish harvesters, first nations and coastal communities have struggled to continue their way of life. Unable to compete with corporate and global interests in the fishery, fishing and processing jobs have declined and disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495245"> One particular example of this occurring is highlighted in an article in The Northern View. One community that has been particularly hard hit is Prince Rupert. I spoke directly with commercial fisherman Joel Collier and his wife, the co-owner in their harvesting business, Melissa Collier. This is what was talked about in a story dated July 2022.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8495246">The article came out a while ago, but it is still so applicable to what we are seeing today. It states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495247">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Commercial fisherman Joel Collier was shocked when he docked in Prince Rupert this past summer, seeking a shower and shops to restock on supplies, only to find that many of the services and businesses he expected had disappeared. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495248">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">“Prince Rupert being a huge fishing hub in the past, it was a pretty alarming change,” Melissa Collier, Joel’s wife, a fellow fisherman and co-owner of their harvest business, said.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495249">The article talks about the fact that when Joel, who is a fisher, and his then partner stopped at Prince Rupert to shower and to be able to access the basic necessities, it had all suddenly shut down. It also talks about how they were looking for a part for their board, which they would normally be able to access in a business in this town. I believe it was a marine antenna. They were unable to access this particular piece of necessary equipment in order to continue on with the fishing. They went to another dock and, again, similar problems occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495250">This is the story we are hearing from many in these coastal communities and from the fishers who rely on them; because of the fact that we are seeing so many local fishers being hard hit right now, there is an impact on coastal communities. It impacts not just the people who are out on the water but also the communities themselves that rely on the fishing industry to thrive, to bring income into the community, which is how we see vibrant communities that are flourishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495251"> The issue here around the particular ownership model on the west coast actually came up in the fisheries committee prior to my being a member of Parliament. I was elected in 2021. In 2019, the fisheries committee put together a report called “West Coast Fisheries: Sharing Risks and Benefits”. The committee had a list of clear recommendations for the government as to how to best move forward to address the following issue: Currently, there is a system set up on the west coast that disproportionately benefits large corporations and negatively impacts local fishers. The report is asking for the benefits to be provided to those who have boots on the boats, as they like to refer to them. It states that those who are actually out and fishing should be accessing the benefits of the fishing industry. Instead, on the west coast, we see an overabundance of profits going into large corporations that are not only seeping the benefits out of coastal communities but also sending the investment elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495252">We have a tremendous amount of resources here along the coasts of Canada as well as in the Great Lakes and rivers. The fishery is an industry that needs to be benefiting Canadians here at home. Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing on the west coast. We need to see the government taking the actions required to move forward with addressing this. To make matters worse, approximately 85% of Canadian-caught seafood is exported while we import 63% of our seafood. It makes no sense. We have a system that contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions, disempowers small-scale fish harvesters and may affect the future of our fisheries and oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495253">There is the Fisheries for Communities group and, as I mentioned before, there are many different people who are part of this work. They are asking for the government to give fishing access back to fish harvesters, first nations and coastal communities. They go on to say that only first nations and people who work on fishing boats should be able to own a licence and quota, as I was talking about with respect to the boots on the boats, and that there should be policies in place that phase out big business, investors and non-domestic ownership. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495254">With that, I would like to say I am happy to see that we have the motion coming forward, and I hope the government will implement real policies to support fishers here in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8495255">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to stand here in full support of Motion No. 111, which calls for the designation of the first day of October every year as national Canadian seafood day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495256">First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278141" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>, in Prince Edward Island, for introducing this very important motion. The motion represents more than just a symbolic gesture. It embodies a profound acknowledgement of the cultural heritage and significance of fish and seafood within Canadian society, our culinary traditions, our health and our blue economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495257">The cultural and traditional value of fish and seafood in Canada, quite frankly, cannot be overstated. From the serene shores of the Pacific to the rugged, windswept coasts of the Atlantic, and from the icy, pristine waters of the Arctic to the rich, biodiverse expanse of the Great Lakes, fish and seafood are important sources of sustenance and are deeply embedded in the cultural fabric and the spiritual life of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495258">Fish and seafood have served, and continue to serve, as the tidal pulse of many communities and local economies. They have been central to the social structures and the ceremonial practices of so many communities. From Atlantic lobsters and Arctic char, to Pacific salmon and farmed shellfish, Canadian seafood is both delicious and healthy. I can personally attest to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495259">Canada's fish and seafood products are celebrated for their exceptional quality, freshness, variety, nutritional value, sustainability and, most importantly, taste. Therefore, it is unsurprising that our fish and seafood continue to be highly coveted in the global marketplace. In fact, last year alone, Canada exported $7.6 billion worth of fish and seafood to 115 countries around the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495260">The United States continues to be our largest and most important trading partner, accounting for nearly two-thirds of our exports. To put things in perspective, in my province of Nova Scotia, the biggest export by far is seafood; a distant second is tires. So much is dependent on it. By supporting the establishment of the national Canadian seafood day, we are celebrating not only an iconic Canadian industry, but also the enduring connection between Canada's people and the waters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495261">Further, we recognize that just as our coastal waters connect us physically to the rest of the world, our sustainably harvested fish and seafood products connect us commercially with trading partners near and far. Our trading partners look to us for that exceptional product quality that few can deliver worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495262">The contribution of Canadians who harvest and process these outstanding products deserves Canada's attention, acknowledgement, appreciation and celebration. In supporting this motion, we can take a step in the right direction. We also embrace a valuable opportunity to educate and promote the value of Canadian fish and seafood products as a nutrient-rich source of food harvested in our waters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495263">A 2023 Dalhousie University study found that almost 80% of respondents in Canada regularly consume fish and seafood. This is indicative of a strong appetite for fish and seafood products. However, the majority of fish and seafood consumed in Canada is imported. Canada, with its vast and pristine coastlines and waterways, is endowed, no doubt, with an abundance of marine life. Our country is one of the world's largest seafood suppliers, yet much of our premium seafood is exported to satisfy high demand abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495264">Support for Motion No. 111 can also encourage the consumption of local fish and seafood products by Canadians, and support for local harvesters and local coastal economies. We should all be taking advantage of the sustainable products harvested in our waters by our local fish and seafood sector. Motion No. 111 recognizes this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495265">I do want to take a moment to highlight and promote some of the health benefits of fish and seafood consumption. In particular, fish and seafood offer a treasure-trove of nutrients, offering Canadians a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, high-quality proteins, and essential vitamins such as vitamin D and vitamin B2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495266">Omega-3 fatty acids are particularly crucial for cardiovascular health, and are known for reducing inflammation and potentially lowering the risk of heart disease. By promoting Canadian fish and seafood, we not only provide Canadians with increased awareness of the merits and benefits of our products, but also point to the nutritional value these products have to offer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8495267">Much of what I talked about speaks to the motion's high value to our personal health and to our communities' health. Beyond health benefits, promoting Canadian fish and seafood supports our efforts to address food sovereignty and security. Food sovereignty involves people's right to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecological, sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agricultural systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495268">By promoting consumption of Canadian fish and seafood, we would be helping to bolster the resilience of food systems, acting locally against global market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. Local sourcing, for example, can reduce the reliance on imported foods, which can be vulnerable to external pressures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495269">Promoting Canadian fish and seafood can also enhance domestic food security, which is particularly crucial in remote and coastal communities where access to fresh produce and other staples, quite frankly, can be limited. For example, locally sourced seafood can provide a reliable and accessible source of nutrition, helping to reduce dependency on imported goods that may be less fresh and more expensive. In addition, fish and seafood are recognized as having a relatively lower carbon footprint compared to other options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495270">By promoting Canadian fish and seafood, Canadians would become increasingly aware of the domestic and local options available to them. With this awareness, Canadians could also recognize that choosing to enjoy a locally sourced, delicious and nutritious fish and seafood meal can also contribute to a reduction in the national carbon footprint, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495271">Environmental sustainability is another cornerstone of this initiative. Canadian fisheries are managed with a commitment to sustainability that is recognized and valued worldwide. National Canadian seafood day would provide an excellent platform from which to showcase our sustainable practices and to educate the public about the importance of supporting sustainable managed fisheries. In doing so, we would also be promoting the merits of choosing Canadian seafood sources, under sustainable fisheries management processes, not only for our health and well-being, but also for the health of our oceans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495272">This is an important motion. It is something to recognize. It is something to embrace. It will educate Canadians, and I am very pleased to have been the seconder of this motion. I look forward to its safe passage.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8495273">Madam Speaker, Conservatives will be supporting this motion. I am a member of Parliament from the west coast and, obviously, seafood, the fisheries and fishing have been part of British Columbia's history from the time it began with the first nations and for the past couple of hundred years with fishers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495274">It is fine to have a motion, which Conservatives support, on a national seafood day, but it really camouflages, I would say, the inaction of the Liberals, backed by the NDP, on the fisheries front. They are really not getting anything done. They put forward this motion to show what they are doing and say it is a love fest because we all agree about the importance of the fishing industry, but their policies have really been targeted to reduce fishing and the fisheries. They have mismanaged the whole sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495275">I have visited different communities where the fishing industry is really important. I have met with industry officials, owner-operators, those trying to make a living, and the frustration is palpable with the Liberal government. They feel that this industry and their livelihoods are under attack. It is a growth industry for the Liberals, but in what sense? While they put $300 million into the industry on the west coast, almost all of it is allocated toward 200 new bureaucrats. They are inflating and building up the bureaucracy and not really making any difference on the ground. They are actually making things worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495276">There are different issues that are a big deal and that are having a negative impact. For example, the marine protected areas are basically closing down very significant areas of the coastline to fishing. There have been Order Paper questions on some of the different issues with these marine protected areas, as well as with the southern resident killer whales in the no-transit areas. There have been questions about how many whales go through this area, what times of the year and whether there has been a difference. It is sealing off areas for harvesting and fishing. The Liberals' response has been that it is a good question but they do not know what is going on. Basically, they are implementing their policies willy-nilly and destroying the livelihoods of many British Columbians by their insane and unscientific policies, which are taking significant areas away from fishing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495277">One of the biggest issues with regard to protecting the fisheries and seeing growth in the industry, on which there is almost unanimous consent, has to do with seals. We need to realize that 97% of unnatural deaths of salmon are not by fishing. That is 3%, but 97% is by seals. A councillor from one of the first nations in my region said that seals are destroying the salmon catch, and there is nothing being done about it. Liberal ministers sit on their hands, not doing anything, and then they blame it on climate change or whatever, when it is just bad policy and bad management of the fisheries.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8495278"> We need some grown-ups, some adults managing the fisheries. I am looking forward to a Conservative government, which would bring some common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495279"> Another issue that is of great importance is that of owner-operators. Conservatives, under the Harper government, made it so that those who operated the boats had to be the owners. It was not just going to be the big corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495280"> The Department of Fisheries just seems to be lazy. It would rather deal with two or three big companies than a lot more of the smaller owner-operators who live in the community, provide jobs in the community and actually bring the fish back to the community to get processed. DFO prefers corporations that process the fish on the ships or take it up to Alaska. It is very frustrating for the fishers because they feel that their communities are being undermined by the Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495281"> There needs to be some changes. That is what the Conservative Party supports, to put the power back into the owner-operators. Right now, the packaging plants have moved. They have moved to Washington and Alaska. They are not in Canada. They are not in British Columbia because of the Liberal policies. We want to empower the owner-operators, the small business people and the fishers to have the livelihoods that would help the first nations and coastal communities that are dependent on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8495282">The Liberals and NDP, including the provincial NDP, are at war with the workers. We want to support working-class Canadians.</ParaText>
