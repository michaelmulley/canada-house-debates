At first feeling intimidated—and God knows that he was intimidating—I called him Mr. Duceppe. More recently, often eager for his advice, and now—I dare believe it and flatter myself—a friend of Mr. Duceppe, I have taken to calling him Gilles, and that is a privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873478">As I have gone from admirer to appreciative friend, I must also extend my heartfelt thanks to Gilles. He managed to pass on his diligence and passion, as well as a lot of his charisma, to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>. In that respect, he will have to share at least half the credit with Yolande. In sharing their son, they also gave me the chance to make a dear friend.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873486">While the verbal harassment and physical abuse Shak experienced were despicable acts on their own, what made this incident even more heinous was that it was racially motivated. Ms. Edwards was sought out, berated and assaulted because she was a young Black woman. She was told to go back to where she came from. Shak was born and raised in Canada, in Simcoe County.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873487"> No person should ever be subject to such racist and derogatory statements and acts. I would encourage Shak to keep doing her great work. I and the people of Barrie are behind her every step of the way.</ParaText>

Ever since, we have continued to be there to help the seniors who need it most, especially through the challenging times of this pandemic. We will continue to be there for seniors, and they know the Liberal government can always be counted on.</ParaText>

That is why we are working together on delivering massive investments to counter the housing challenges that Canadians are facing across the country. Whether it is by cracking down on speculatory or predatory practices that take advantage of homebuyers, by limiting the impact of foreign buyers in our housing market or by investing $4 billion for municipalities to accelerate the construction of affordable homes, these are the kinds of things we are doing. We look forward to working with all partners in the House to get it done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873720">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your intervention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873721">We have carefully read the text tabled by the <Affiliation DbId="278913" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation>, and we have noticed that efforts are being made. However, these efforts to find an appropriate solution are many months late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873722">Let us recall that there were two positive votes at the former Special Committee on Canada‑China Relations, as well as two votes here, in the House, in favour of our proposal to order the production of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873723">The will of Parliament is therefore clear and, aside from a few details, the September election did not change the seat map to such an extent that one could expect a different result if, by any chance, there were a fifth vote on this request.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873724"> My counterpart cited the handling of Afghan detainee documents as an example that we could follow, so allow me to add a bit of context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873725">An ad hoc committee of parliamentarians was created as a solution forged by necessity given that a 2009 Liberal opposition motion recklessly ordered the public release of some 40,000 pages in their original and uncensored form, despite the fact that this could have prejudiced the interests of Canada and its NATO allies where our troops were at risk on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873726">In his widely celebrated April 27, 2010, ruling, Speaker Milliken, recognizing that there was support across the House to address the Liberal motion’s shortcomings and ensure sensitive information was protected, invited senior figures in the House to find an “interest-based solution to this thorny question” of reconciling the House’s role as grand inquest of the nation and the executive’s role as defender of realm, before he would turn the matter over to the House for its adjudication. Those discussions yielded the ad hoc committee, whose processes built upon the good-faith efforts of the government of the day, begun well ahead of any Speaker’s rulings, to have a trusted, independent review, at arm’s length from the government, determine what information could safely be placed in the public domain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873727">Unlike the situation in 2009–10, the motions adopted by the Special Committee on Canada–China Relations and the House included mechanisms to strike a balance between parliamentary accountability and protecting sensitive information in the 546 pages in question, which represent only about 1.4% of the volume of the Afghan detainee documents, and foster ongoing dialogue on the issue, as the Speaker acknowledged in his ruling on June 16, 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873728">The very basis of the government's argument against our point of privilege is that when the Conservatives were in power, they applied the solution that the Liberal government now wishes to apply to the situation at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. However, this is like comparing apples and oranges. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873729">The situation in 2009–10 involved the production of 40,000 pages of unredacted documents to be released to the public. We are proposing that 546 pages be released. That is not the same thing at all. In addition, we would like the documents to be analyzed by table officers to prevent any sensitive information that could compromise public safety from being released. Evidently, it is apples and oranges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873730">It is also important to remember, with respect to the Afghan documents of 2009-10, that our country was involved in a military operation on enemy territory. Soldiers from our army, Canadians in uniform, were fighting the Taliban enemy in Afghanistan. Their health, their safety, and their lives were at risk, whereas with regard to the Winnipeg issue, what we are talking about is analyzing the work of public servants to see what they did with respect to other public servants. This involves a few people, a few individuals. These are two completely different things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873731">I wish to remind the House that it is also important to keep in mind that the majority of the House voted to have the law clerk and parliamentary counsel conduct a reliable, independent review at arm's length from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873732">To that end, Mr. Speaker, in your June 2021 ruling, you stated the following: “It is, however, not up to the Chair to judge the extent of the measures taken, but to note that they were considered. There is thus no reason to allow an additional delay.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873733">Regrettably, delay was the name of the game for the government. Its approach this spring was not to accept the reasonable compromise set out in the motions, nor to negotiate workable amendments to those arrangements. Instead, its approach was to deny, then to deflect and then to finally litigate, in an entirely shocking and unprecedented court application against the House of Commons. Members will recall I argued last month that that also constitutes contempt against the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873734">We must unfortunately note that this is, to our knowledge, the only time in Canadian history and in Commonwealth parliamentary history that the government has gone to Federal Court to challenge the voted will of the House of Commons. The executive branch used the judicial branch to prevent the legislative branch from doing its job. The government is knocking on the Federal Court's door to prevent the House of Commons from doing its job. This has never happened in Canadian history, nor, as far as we know, has it ever happened in Commonwealth parliamentary history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873735">The only event that comes to mind happened in June, July and August 1974 at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., when the President of the United States went to the Supreme Court to prevent the release of documents as requested by the U.S. Congress. The executive branch knocked on the door of the judicial branch to prevent the legislative branch from doing its job. That was the Watergate scandal. Need I remind the House that the government or executive branch at the time, meaning the President, resigned a few days after the Supreme Court decision?</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6873736">Surely, members can appreciate that Conservatives are worried about the government's sudden 180° turn. Indeed, the official opposition has serious concerns, to say the least, that the government's proposal represents an actual change in any way, shape or form to the government's approach, given the Liberal's pattern of behaviour concerning parliamentary accountability over the past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873737">Furthermore, I must also take note of the government House leader's words on the floor of the Commons last week, which were not in the letter that was shared with journalists, on how his proposition was conditional, when he stated, “If the matter is revived again in this new Parliament by way of substantive motion”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873738">Therefore, if I am to understand his position correctly, it is not actually an effort to address my question of privilege, which is currently before the Chair, but rather, I would say, distract from it. It will follow that, for the House to achieve any forward progress in obtaining the documents, which have already been ordered four times to be produced, you must deliver your ruling, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873739">The government House leader's parliamentary secretary recently rose in the House to distract us from the principle that a Parliament may punish the contempts committed against its predecessor by discussing imprisonment in the Tower of London five centuries ago. I would remind you of the recent citations of several Canadian speakers' statements on that matter, all from our own lifetime, and all delivered by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278390" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>, who is also the deputy House leader of the official opposition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873740">Nevertheless, in the interests of finding an adequate solution that addresses the concerns of all the parties, I think that the response could actually be found in the June 21 letter and in the speech given in the House by the former government House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278398" Type="2">Honoré-Mercier</Affiliation>, who said, and I quote:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873747">Therefore, I would propose that the government deposit the documents with the law clerk, as previously ordered, and together, along with other representatives of the acting national security and intelligence adviser to the Prime Minister and/or the director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, to suggest what, in their professional opinions, ought to be redacted and why, in order to assist the law clerk in discharging his duty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873748">As for the other unspecific “appropriate safeguards” the former government House leader referred to, I believe these should be simple, incontrovertible matters, such as ensuring that in camera discussion of the documents does not take place on Zoom or allowing the meeting to take place at a secure facility away from Parliament Hill. These could be easily negotiated in a unanimous consent motion to supplement the existing sound and responsible measures already adopted by the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873749">That is what Conservatives believe to be a reasonable resolution to the situation. It would allow the government's concerns to be addressed while vindicating the authority of Parliament to order the production of documents. Hopefully, the Liberal government will voluntarily table the documents, so we can get on with the redaction process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873750">Otherwise, you will have to make a ruling to allow the process to move forward, and if you find a prima facie case of contempt, I remain prepared to move an appropriate motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873785">Mr. Speaker, it has been only 12 days since Parliament was recalled and the 338 parliamentarians in the House were called to debate legislation. This is the second time in just 12 days that the government has imposed time allocation on a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873786">This is an important bill that deserves careful attention and serious parliamentary work.

              <ParaText id="6873787">The only reason we are in a hurry to pass bills is that the government decided to call an unnecessary election that Canadians did not want and that cost taxpayers $620 million. All this to end up with a Parliament that looks very much like it did last June. Today we are in a hurry because the government dragged its feet for more than 60 days between election day and our return to the House. The government has only itself to blame for the fact that we are in a hurry.</ParaText>

Both of these items are things that I think we have shown we are supportive of, but it seems like an abuse of process for the government to not only be moving closure but, prior to that, lumping together unrelated items. </ParaText>

We know that if they have to quarantine, it is the amount of time that will inhibit the spread of the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873836">If we are looking at two weeks, it is roughly 10 working days, which is why we landed on 10 days. Six days is not enough. Seven days is not enough. Ten is the magic number and it is a number we need to start moving on now. The sooner we do that, the better. We start with those in federal jurisdiction and we move on to talking to the provinces and territories again on an accelerated basis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873842">First, this bill deals with two very distinct issues. I was hopeful, and remain hopeful, that it could possibly be split up to be studied in the two separate committees where it would best fit. Question number one is whether he would be willing to proceed in that manner and take leadership on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873843">Second, specifically regarding the paid sick leave, I have asked a number of times exactly how many workers this would affect. Are we talking about thousands? Many workers within federally regulated sectors already have extensive sick leave provisions, either under union contracts or whatever the case may be. How many workers would this actually affect and to what extent would it affect them? Would it affect the contractor who is contracted to work for a sector that may be federally regulated?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873844">There are a lot of questions surrounding this that I have not received answers for yet, and I am hoping the <Affiliation DbId="278925" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> can clarify some of those things.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873846">I will disagree humbly with the hon. member, just to say that while I understand we are looking at two issues contained within this bill, what they very much have in common is, first of all, our fight against this pandemic. While that may seem fairly broad, it is not broad when we talk about our imperative to move quickly on it and our ability to act fast and assure workers in this country that they can stay home, should stay home and must stay home if there is any suspicion or question that they may have it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873854">Madam Speaker, I will provide those names to the member. There are some companies that have yet to provide the full two weeks. In fact, about 63% of employees in federally regulated industries do not receive the full two weeks, so the vast majority do not. Again, and I cannot say this often enough, the two weeks is what is important here. The 10 days is what is important. We all know that, because it is the amount of time it takes to quarantine safely, if someone has been affected by the virus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873855">It is important that we reach that number, and it is important that we do that as soon as possible as we enter the winter months. We know that when more people are staying inside, their ability to contract the virus increases exponentially. We need to make sure those numbers remain down. Canadians, time and again, have stood up. They have become vaccinated. They want to make sure we are all doing the right thing, because bit by bit, we are getting there and defeating this virus, but we need to get over this hump.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873876">Madam Speaker, as I was saying, we have commended our health care workers through efforts such as the nightly banging of pots and honking of horns at 7 p.m. Health care workers have been true heroes working on the front lines tirelessly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873877">Calling health care workers heroes and commending their bravery, while entirely deserved, is not enough. We need to provide real protections for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873878">The amendments to the Criminal Code in this bill would afford health care workers security against obstruction from accessing their workplaces safely. Unfortunately, we have seen terrible incidents where doctors, nurses and other health care practitioners have been intimidated, threatened and in some cases spat on or threatened with violence, all because they are saving the lives of COVID-19 patients. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873879">I would like to take a moment to give my very personal perspective on this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873880">My wife is a doctor at a hospital that was declared a COVID hospital at the outset of the pandemic. During the first week of the pandemic, we updated our wills, not knowing what dangers we faced. We slept on different floors and took extra precautions to sanitize, when we could actually find disinfectant materials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873881">Some doctors moved out of their private homes to protect their families and moved into private accommodations. Many extra precautions were taken to launder clothes to make sure the virus did not come into our personal homes. Challenges continued wave after wave. Then throw in a heat dome and another wave, and we have a health care crisis and a system stretched to the breaking point relying on the goodwill and moral fibre of the people who work in the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873882">I would like to thank my wife and her colleagues at Surrey Memorial Hospital and other hospitals across the country, the specialists and technicians, the nurses and the aides, the cleaning staff, food services and everyone else in patient care who all worked to keep the rest of us safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873883">Now protesters are trying to threaten these workers and to prevent them from accessing their places of work. I feel especially for the emergency room doctors but also the paramedics, who are understaffed, underfunded and need to shepherd their patients past rabid anti-vaxxer protesters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873884">Our health care workers are facing moral distress. No one should feel unsafe at their workplace. This legislation would provide health care workers the confidence and legal protections needed to safely access their workplaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873885">We know intimidation can also manifest through online forums as well, not just in person. We would be protecting health care workers here as well. In the age of social media and digital technology, we know online threats can be just as real and devastating as those faced in front of a workplace. No individual should be able to use fear to stop health care workers or those who assist them from performing their duties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873886">Our legislation would not only protect health care workers but those accessing health care as well. In many cases, those accessing health care are the most vulnerable, particularly during this pandemic. This summer, an individual went to Toronto from Prince Edward Island to wait for a lung transplant. They were leaving the hospital after a physiotherapy session. They had to be escorted by police to protect them from an unmasked group blocking access to and from the hospital. We have heard story after story of this kind of behaviour across the country. We cannot accept this behaviour, which is placing our most vulnerable at risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873887">This legislation would clearly ensure Canadians have the freedom to voice their concerns and protest in a safe and peaceful manner. It would also ensure workers’ freedom to take labour action, including picketing. These would be respected by these proposed changes to Canada’s criminal law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873888">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a number of issues facing Canadians in their workplaces. Too many health care workers, those who assist them and Canadians seeking medical care have experienced or feared intimidation while attempting to provide or access health services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873889">In normal times this type of harassment and intimidation is disagreeable, but during a worldwide pandemic, this type of behaviour is abhorrent, which is why legislation is needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873890">I will now shift my focus to another aspect of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873891">Too many Canadians have been forced to choose between staying home when they are sick or being able to afford rent or groceries. This legislation's other change, which is the provision of 10 days of paid sick leave, would protect the well-being of Canadians, support them economically and avoid pressures on our health care system. While this would only apply to federally regulated workers numbering almost one million workers at this point, it would contribute to a wider discussion about paid sick leave across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6873892">The pandemic has demonstrated the effect that illness can have on our economy and the cost for individuals and families. With isolations and quarantines lasting up to two weeks, workers need to know that if they contract COVID-19, they can take the necessary time off work without risking a loss to their income and without exposing others to the risks of COVID. Not only will this ensure that workers do not need to choose between their income and their well-being, but it will also avoid spreading COVID-19 or other contagious illnesses in the workplace. There have been too many stories of outbreaks in workplaces that happened because individuals felt they had to come into work because they could not afford to take unpaid time off. This often results in negative economic effects for companies as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873893">Not only will this legislation help workers, but it will be a preventive measure for our health care system. We have all experienced lockdowns throughout the last 20 months to help our hospitals avoid being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. This is another measure to prevent the outbreaks in workplaces from driving up case numbers and putting our health care system at risk now and in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873894">For Canadians not employed in a federally regulated industry, our government will be engaging in consultations with federally regulated employers and workers on the implementation of this legislation. Additionally, the government will convene the provinces and territories and other interested stakeholders to develop a national action plan to legislate paid sick leave across the country, while respecting provincial and territorial jurisdiction and clearly recognizing the unique needs of small business owners. Ten days of paid sick leave is another tool in creating a more resilient economy as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873895"> For all the reasons I have outlined in my speech today, I will be supporting this bill. I welcome any questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873899">Madam Speaker, a very important right we need to maintain is the ability to have legal protests within a workplace to stand against employers and stand up for the rights of workers. This legislation does address that. It respects the constitutional rights of workers to defend their rights and negotiate with their employers. It also makes sure that workplaces will remain accessible despite protests, so it is about free passage to obtain necessary health care. I believe the bill strikes the right balance, and that is why I am supporting it. </ParaText>

We want to make sure that health care workers and patients are protected, but also that as a result of the pandemic, federally regulated workers have 10 days of paid sick leave.

              <ParaText id="6873904">Madam Speaker, my question is about urgency and being in a pandemic. The member mentioned that this needs to happen very quickly because we are in a pandemic, so he will not be surprised when I ask him why he feels it has taken the government 18 months to move forward with these 10 days of sick leave. The government has known since the very beginning, of course, that the New Democratic Party would be very supportive of allowing these 10 days. We have been calling for that, really, since the beginning of the pandemic.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873910">I must admit that this bill is a little strange because it deals with two completely different topics. It would amend the Canada Labour Code and would also amend the Criminal Code. The bill's scope goes in two completely different directions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873911">First, the bill would amend the Criminal Code to increase penalties on people who intimidate health care workers or patients or who obstruct access to a hospital or clinic in order to impede people from obtaining health services, such as vaccination. It is hard to argue against virtue, so it is relatively easy to support this part of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873912">Second, the bill would force federally regulated employers to grant up to 10 days of paid sick leave to their employees. As I just said, it is hard to argue against virtue, so we will support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873913">I would like to raise an important point about the part involving protests outside health care facilities. We are being told the bill is not intended to infringe on the right to peaceful protest and is therefore not intended to affect workers' rights, but that is not made perfectly clear in the wording.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873914">This will require clarification. As usual, the Bloc Québécois will be thorough in asking questions, checking the facts, seeking confirmation and possibly proposing any amendments needed to protect this basic right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873915">The Bloc Québécois always stands up for workers' rights. Of course, we defend collective rights, but defending workers' rights is one of our core values. It is of the utmost importance to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873916">In Quebec, workers' rights during a dispute are particularly well protected compared to the rest of Canada. Think, for example, of the anti-scab legislation in effect in Quebec. It is important that close attention be paid to this part of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873917">Furthermore, paid sick leave is a step forward for federally regulated Quebec workers, even though there are not that many of them. It is a step forward for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873918">As history has shown, progress for one group of workers is always progress for all workers. A rising tide lifts all boats, and measures like this create momentum, which is always positive even if it is just for a small group of people. The Bloc Québécois will definitely support this measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873919">I want to comment on the prohibition of protests. The bill would give prosecutors added powers to charge people who impede others in the performance of health care duties and interfere with access to a clinic or hospital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873920">Under the present circumstances, because of the election campaign and anti-vax protests, people have been thinking about access to health care facilities a lot. It is these events, in large part, that led to the creation of this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873921">Over the years, we have also seen protests by people preventing access to abortion clinics. Recognizing that every woman has the right to do what she wants with her own body and that nobody can interfere with that is one of our core values. In that respect, this measure is good because it goes some way toward ensuring that people will not be hassled while accessing health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873922">This part of the law is important because it distinguishes between “freedom of expression” and “aggression”. Unfortunately, in our society, some individuals or groups often confuse the two concepts. Some think that because they have the right to express themselves, they have the right to prevent others from doing something. This is not at all the case, and such behaviour should never be tolerated. This is a fundamental and very important point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873923">As parliamentarians, we have a duty to protect people from all forms of aggression. This is what we started to do in the last Parliament before the unnecessary election that everyone knows about. We were working on Bill <Document DbId="10630862" Type="4">C‑205</Document>, which concerned the agricultural sector and would have prevented vegan activists from trespassing on livestock farms and other farms.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6873924">Assaulting someone or coming onto their property to express a political opinion or a point of view is unacceptable. This is a democratic country, and democracy is expressed in a peaceful and respectful way. There are public spaces for demonstrating. Once people start to be bullied, it becomes very important to intervene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873925">This also deals with intimidation, and that is important. When people head out to a certain place and find a threatening group there, they may turn back. The example of vaccine-hesitant folks comes to mind. This is not a judgment of someone's opinion. I am not saying that one group is more right than another. However, in order for us to get out of this miserable crisis, our duty as parliamentarians is to encourage people to get vaccinated. That means that any demonstration that might interfere with that goal obviously must be prevented without stopping people from expressing themselves. Once again, “expression” does not mean “aggression”. This is a very important point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873926">In my former life as a high school teacher, I fought against bullying and intimidation for many years. It was a fundamental issue that was very important to me. I will continue that fight as a parliamentarian, because our civil society must not accept that kind of behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873927">Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C‑3</Document> is quite severe, providing for prison sentences of up to 10 years, depending on how the offender is charged. They could get 10 years or two years less a day. This could be a good way to make people think twice about assaulting others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873928">As for the rest, the bill also contains other clauses, such as release orders for people charged under the amended law, potentially with conditions. That is fairly standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873929">However, I would like to highlight one very important point for my colleagues. Under Bill C‑3, any criminal offence committed against a health professional in the performance of their duties would now be considered an aggravating factor. I think this is a great approach, because it confirms the almost sacred nature of health care work. It also protects access to care for the general public, which I think is a very good sign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873930">The last part deals with paid sick leave, and it is positive, as I said earlier. However, the majority of federally regulated private sector workers already have access to 10 or more days of sick leave. We are talking about roughly 63% of those workers. Getting that number up to 100%, or in other words, giving everyone access to those sick days is great, but there is one aspect of Bill C-3 that could prove to be problematic, and it needs to be addressed. I am referring to the fact that the employer can require a medical certificate within 15 days of the employee's return to work. I wonder about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873931">Consider the example of someone who has been sick for two days and returns to work, then after another five or six days is asked by their employer to provide a medical certificate. I think it would be hard to prove one's illness by that point. The right questions need to be asked, and I am counting on my esteemed colleague, who is the critic on this issue, to dig into the matter, but I think it is important to clarify that aspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873932">As I have been saying from the start, we cannot be against this bill, despite the fact that it changes very little. It feels like the Liberals are trying to prove that they are with the times and following the trends. We are being asked to vote on this bill after we were forced to urgently vote on a time allocation motion. As a colleague from another party said earlier, however, this was brought up a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873933">Why was this not done at the beginning of the crisis when many people may have needed it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873934">Why wait 62 days to recall members to work and then shove bills down their throat?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873935">Many areas need our swift action, such as the cuts to the guaranteed income supplement for seniors, which is a major injustice. When will we see some movement on that? I am being told that Bill C‑3 is urgent, that it needs to happen by tomorrow morning, but we sounded the alarm about the cuts to the GIS before the election campaign.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6873958">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to join the debate on Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document>. Although this is not my first opportunity to rise in the 44th Parliament to give a speech, this is my first opportunity, not just in this Parliament, but since I was elected in 2019, to deliver a speech with my fiancée, Danaka, watching live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873959">I wanted to acknowledge that and acknowledge Danaka for her continued love and support, especially through the turbulent times of election season. I have to say that going through two elections in two years is more than enough for an MP, but it is also important that we recognize the impact it has on our loved ones, so I thank Danaka for her continued support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873960">There are two very important aspects of the bill. It really is two bills in one, with amendments to the Criminal Code and to the Labour Code. It is very important that we talk about both of these things separately, considering how different they are. I will, time permitting, have the opportunity to touch on both of those aspects, but I also want to acknowledge the tremendous work of our shadow ministers on this file. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278115" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation> has done a great job representing our position and working with our colleagues to move forward on this. As well, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278416" Type="2">Parry Sound—Muskoka</Affiliation> on the labour side ensured that our party was well represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873961">When it comes to the Criminal Code, of course Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document> would make it an offence to intimidate health care providers or impede individuals from obtaining health services, and this is something I do not think anyone in this chamber would take issue with. I think we would all support that and the idea behind that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873962">We know health care workers face incredible hardships at the best of times, especially in northwestern Ontario, where they have limited staff, limited resources and policies that do not adequately account for our unique needs in rural and remote northern Ontario. These are challenges I have heard of first-hand from constituents across the riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873963">Of course, this has all been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the pandemic we are continuing to fight through. Hopefully we are at the tail end of. We have seen more clearly than ever before how important our frontline workers are. They are our doctors, our nurses and those who went to work every day, risking their own safety, to ensure that all Canadians would remain safe and have the service they need. That is why so many people in the Kenora riding, across northern Ontario and across this great country were outraged by the news when they saw these protests and the harassment of health care workers throughout the course of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873964">I wish I could sit here and name everybody, but there are a couple of health care workers in particular I would like to make note of, one of whom is Dr. Sean Moore at the Lake of the Woods District Hospital in Kenora. Dr. Moore has been a champion for our region throughout the course of the pandemic. He helped organize and arrange all of the COVID protocols and the COVID response at the Lake of the Woods District Hospital. With many concerns around the availability of beds and shortages of PPE, he remained steadfast in his commitment to ensuring everyone had the support they needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873965">He continued to also keep me up to date on what was happening on the ground and offered advice to me to pass on to the government and my colleagues on how to best move forward through the pandemic. I would say as well that his consistent public advocacy for best practices in ways to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe has just been incredibly beneficial for everyone across our region, which is something he continues to do.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6873966">I want to make a quick mention of a health care provider who is very important to me, my mother Charlene. My mother is a nurse at the Lake of the Woods District Hospital and I know first-hand from her the challenges during the best of times at the hospital in delivering health care services in the Kenora riding. Having to deal with the additional protocols and challenges that COVID-19 brought on was difficult for her and her colleagues. Not once did any of the health care workers in my riding, or across the country, hesitate. They were always there to continue to serve and work for everyone's safety. I am happy to share that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873967">There is another side to this. It is not just the health care providers. It is not just the doctors and nurses. It has also been a very difficult time to be a patient. I know many people who have had to bring their children to a hospital and only parent has been able to be with them or their loved ones. It has been incredibly difficult for families to deal with challenges to their health given the COVID restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873968">I know the thought of any of these individuals being harassed or targeted in a protest that could be happening outside of a hospital would not sit well with anybody in the chamber. We need to look at that important aspect of the legislation as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873969">As I said, apart from the Criminal Code side, there is also the labour side of the bill, which is very important as well, with the proposed 10-day medical leave in federally regulated sectors. Frankly, many companies are already going above and beyond that, as many members of the House have noted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873970">I believe the <Affiliation DbId="278925" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> has noted that the change he believes the bill would make would be minimal. It is important to note that, in many ways, this could be seen symbolically, but it is an important floor to work toward. However, we cannot take away from the great work that so many companies are undertaking already. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873971">Although it is viewed as a minimal change, I do not think we should accept that without proper scrutiny. We all know there are huge labour shortages across the country. We see that in my riding at the Lake of the Woods Brewing Company, for example. It has not been able to stay open all days of the week. Many restaurants have been forced to close or are only open for short periods because they cannot find staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873972">When we are talking about changes to the Labour Code, it is also very important that we have a wholesome examination of it, so we can understand all the potential impacts the legislation could have. That is why I want to see the bill get to committee. I want to see both sections of it get to appropriate committees, because they are quite different, the Criminal Code side versus the Labour Code side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873973">I hope we will see that from the government, that these sections will be examined separately and thoroughly. That is part of the concern I have with the time allocation motion. We have two very important sections in the legislation that need to be discussed and examined, and the government has unfortunately decided that it would rather not have those discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6873974">I look forward to any question or comments my colleagues may have, but I appreciate the opportunity to share some thoughts on Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document> this evening. I want to reiterate that there are two very important sections to the legislation. We need to examine them. Let us get them to committee.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6874004">Mr. Chair, today I am pleased to talk about the supplementary estimates (B) for 2021-22. I want to start by saying that I am a big believer in the principle of transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874005">Canadians and the parliamentarians who represent them have the right to know how the government intends to spend public funds and to hold the government accountable for its actions. Our government takes that responsibility very seriously. That is why this conversation about the estimates is so important, especially as we are emerging from the COVID‑19 pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874006">Today I am happy to have the opportunity to talk to the committee of the whole about the supplementary estimates (B) for 2021-22. As hon. members know, every year the government tables up to three supplementary estimates detailing proposed spending in addition to the main estimates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874007"> On November 26, the <Affiliation DbId="278907" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> of Canada tabled the supplementary estimates (B) in the House of Commons. The budget includes a summary of the government's incremental funding requirements and an overview of the major funding requests and horizontal initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874008">These supplementary estimates seek a total of $8.7 billion in voted budgetary expenditures. For information purposes, these estimates also include $4.7 billion in budgetary statutory expenditures, mainly due to the extension of the Canada recovery benefit and the forecasted requirements for the Canada recovery caregiving benefit and the Canada recovery sickness benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874009">That said, I would like to provide my hon. colleagues with a breakdown of some of the more significant expenditures. Over the past year, many Canadians have had to deal with the hard truth of our country's historical treatment of indigenous peoples. This has been a year of listening and soul-searching. It has also been a year in which indigenous voices have been louder than ever, and our government is listening to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874010">That is why these supplementary estimates (B) provide a total of $1 billion for the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs and $2.1 billion for the Department of Indigenous Services. This includes $725.2 million for critical infrastructure such as housing, schools, health facilities, water and waste water. This funding will also support the transfer of infrastructure to indigenous-led organizations and fund the operation and maintenance of indigenous-owned infrastructure. This amount also includes $412.2 million for the specific claims settlement fund. As my colleagues know, these are claims by a first nation against the federal government which relate to the administration of land or other first nation assets and to the fulfillment of historic treaties or other agreements. The settlement fund is used to provide compensation to first nations in accordance with negotiated agreements. Finally, we have allocated $361.3 million for prevention and protection services to support the safety and well-being of first nations children and families living on reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874011">The COVID-19 recession is the steepest and fastest economic contraction Canada has seen since the Great Depression, and it has had major repercussions on Canadians across the country. Nevertheless, we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. More than 85% of Canadians age 12 and up are now fully vaccinated. Businesses are reopening and travel has resumed across the country. What is more, we have now started to vaccinate children between the ages of five and 11. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6874012">Important programs like the Canada emergency response benefit, which helped millions of Canadians during the toughest days of the pandemic, were only possible because of the hard work and dedication of our public servants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874013">The government appreciates its public servants and has the greatest respect for its obligations to them. That is why these supplementary estimates include $1.5 billion for the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for the salary adjustments included in the recently negotiated collective agreements, as well as for changes to the terms and conditions of employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874014">Among the other funds set out in these supplementary estimates, I would like to mention the $375 million for the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development for COVID‑19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostic products for developing countries; the $327.7 million for the Department of National Defence to fund the pay increases in the Canadian Armed Forces; and the $253.4 million for the Department of National Defence and the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Heyder and Beattie class action settlements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874015">These estimates reflect our government's continuing commitment to get better results for all Canadians, including those who live in indigenous communities, and to continue to contribute to the global COVID‑19 pandemic response effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874016">I want to be clear. The estimates process is guided by the principles of transparency, openness and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874017">We have taken several measures to ensure transparency. For example, departments regularly account for their expenditures through quarterly financial reports, and the Department of Finance provides monthly financial updates on the government in the “Fiscal Monitor”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874018">Furthermore, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and the extent of pandemic-related spending, the government provides additional reports. This includes the spending authorities associated with the government's response to the global COVID‑19 pandemic in the supplementary estimates, as well as the spending authorities and expenses for each of the COVID‑19 pandemic measures, through the Government of Canada's InfoBase and open government portal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874019">These reporting tools make it easy for Canadians to see the spending authorized by Parliament and the money spent by the government on its pandemic response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874020">We also release a reconciliation between these two estimates documents to provide greater clarity on the relationship between the figures therein.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874021">Hon. colleagues, these supplementary estimates provide for essential investments to build an economy that works for everyone, fight climate change, continue on the road to reconciliation, and ensure that our communities are safe, healthy and inclusive.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874179">Mr. Chair, I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in this session of the committee of the whole of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874180">In the recent federal election, Canadians made it clear: Housing affordability is one of their top issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874181">The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and worsened Canada's serious housing challenges. Far too many Canadians cannot afford an adequate and affordable place to call home. This puts at risk the well-being of Canadian families, our communities and also our economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874182">It is why our government continues to strengthen and extend the national housing strategy, our 10-year, $72-billion plan to give more Canadians a place to call their home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874183">Today I am pleased to have the opportunity to demonstrate how investments in two important programs under the national housing strategy will benefit Canadians. I will discuss these programs and how, with additional funding, they will ensure that more Canadians have an affordable home where they can safely get through this pandemic and plan for a better future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874184">One program provides much-needed rental housing for middle-income Canadians in cities with some of the most expensive rents. We all know them. The other serves more vulnerable Canadians, ensuring they have safe, well-maintained housing with subsidies, to help them make ends meet at the end of every month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874185">Let us start with the rental construction financing initiative. This program has seen incredible uptake since it was launched five years ago, and it is making a real difference for middle-income Canadians and people in my riding of Hull—Aylmer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874186">It is a well-known fact that there is a shortage of purpose-built rental supply in Canada. Many of our cities have extremely low vacancy rates. This has driven up prices to the point where the very people who make our cities run, like nurses, shopkeepers and teachers, can no longer afford to live in them. We just cannot keep pushing the middle class to the suburbs if we want vibrant, inclusive and inspiring cities that meet our climate goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874187">One of the barriers to more rental supply is that many developers feel there are too many financial risks and obstacles to building rental projects. Simply put, they have told us these types of projects are not economically feasible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874188">The rental construction financing initiative, delivered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or CMHC, addresses this problem. It gives developers low-cost loans during the most risky phases of construction. This helps developers to better predict costs, and they are more incentivized to build rental projects, all while meeting important criteria in terms of affordability, accessibility and energy efficiency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874189">I had the privilege of taking part in two announcements in Hull—Aylmer, one at the Zibi island development and the other in the village of Aylmer with the British Square, where precisely we are looking to incentivize builders to build affordable rental housing as part of their larger rental stock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874190">From the beginning, the program generated great interest from the housing sector. To meet growing demand, we increased our investments to $13.75 billion. Already, as of just the end of September of this year, over $12 billion has been committed to create more than 34,000 rental homes. This will make a huge difference for so many Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874191">As uptake of the program continued, we saw a need to make further investments in it. We committed an additional $12 billion over seven years, and we will use $300 million specifically to help the conversion of vacant commercial property into housing. The funding requested this year represents the first part of this new commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874192">It is estimated that when the rental construction financing initiative comes to an end in 2028, the $26 billion invested will have created more than 71,000 new rental housing units across the country. In other words, 71,000 more middle-income families will be able to find housing they can afford in the cities in which they live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874193">This is a win-win-win for Canadian families, and it is a win for our cities. It makes them more inclusive, cuts down on transportation-related costs and emissions, and attracts more employers.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874194"> I would now like to draw the committee's attention to the second program that I want to address during this discussion, the federal community housing initiative. While the previous program I mentioned focused on the needs of middle-income Canadians, this one supports some of our most vulnerable populations. Currently, thousands of low‑income Canadians across the country live in federally administered community housing. They receive rent subsidies to help them make ends meet at the end of the month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874195">When our government began its first term, many of the subsidy agreements were about to expire, which would have been disastrous for the families affected. That is why, in 2017, we launched the federal community housing initiative, a program that provides $500 million over 10 years to protect tenants and stabilize the operations of more than 55,000 units of federally administered community housing projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874196">During phase one of the initiative, we gave community housing providers a two‑year funding extension so that they could continue to provide much‑needed subsidies to their tenants. This phase, which ended in September 2020, supported over 26,700 households with a total investment of over $42 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874197"> We are now in phase two of the program, which makes rental assistance available to community housing providers for their tenants. By September 2021, we had already provided over $29 million in rental assistance to nearly 6,000 low-income households for over 27,000 units across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874198">The additional funding requested for 2021 started with a top-up of $105 million over seven years proposed in budget 2021. This top-up will help community housing providers offer an additional 2,700 units to low-income households. Again, this has a big impact for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874199">The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly had a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable families. I should mention that some of those families belong to minority communities across Canada. They are the most vulnerable when we take an intersectional approach. Now more than ever, they need access to affordable housing. That is how they will get through this pandemic safely, and it is essential if they are to be part of an economic recovery that gives everyone in Canada the chance to thrive and prosper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874200">At the same time, with the skyrocketing cost of home ownership, we also need to provide low-income Canadians with affordable rental options. Instead of building apartments only in the outer suburbs, we need to ensure that people are able to live close to work, school and the centre where they spend their time. This will keep our cities resilient and better able to recover from the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874201">Canadians have sent us a message that could not be any clearer. They care deeply about housing affordability. They want us to work together to provide them with affordable options, no matter what their housing status is.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6874202">Since I am almost out of time, I would like to conclude with the issue of affordability and the other forms of financial support we have provided to Canadians, such as the Canada emergency response benefit and the Canada emergency wage subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874203">The rental construction financing initiative and the federal community housing initiative are proven, safe and reliable programs, programs that are consistent, programs that have helped Canadians, especially the most vulnerable. They are delivering results. They have made a real difference and will continue to do so. With additional investments, they can benefit even more families across this great country of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874204">Before I ask our <Affiliation DbId="278904" Type="4">Minister of Tourism</Affiliation> a question, I think it is very important to say that the range of support measures that were put in place to help Canadians get through the pandemic was extraordinary. As the minister mentioned in his last exchange with a member of the opposition, Canadians have been counting a lot on their government, which reflects the Canadian population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874205">The government is a reflection of the people. We know that Canada is a northern country, a country where the strongest, richest person cannot survive alone with our long, hard winters. We have to work together. This attitude has been part of the Canadian spirit for centuries. It certainly began with indigenous people welcoming the Europeans who came to Canada. They clearly demonstrated the importance of working together to survive our long winters. Generation after generation of immigrants to Canada have learned the same lesson.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874206">That is why it was only natural for the Canadian government to come up with support programs when we were backed into a corner when the pandemic first emerged in March 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874207">Mr. Chair, could you let me know if I can ask the minister my question now?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874311">Mr. Chair, it is wonderful to see you, a fellow Nova Scotian, up there in the chair tonight. I am thankful for the opportunity to speak before this committee of the whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874312">Last night, the Government of Canada outlined some of the many measures the health portfolio has been leading to protect Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures are a critical part of our response to the pandemic, and while we all wish we could put the pandemic behind us, we know that it is not quite over yet. Maybe we see a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is not over. With the omicron variant now circulating in Canada and other countries, we must continue to be vigilant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874313">As we have seen, the parameters of the pandemic can change quickly. We have to be ready to respond with measures that are both effective and appropriate. The budgetary needs reflect, in my opinion, a flexible approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874314"> Last night, the Government of Canada provided us with a financial overview for 2021-22. Through the supplementary estimates (B), the Government of Canada is seeking $185.7 million on behalf of the health portfolio, which includes Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. This increase over the 2021-22 main estimates and the supplementary estimates (A) will complement work already under way in a number of important ways, and it will address gaps in our health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874315"> Even as the response to COVID-19 has dominated the work of the health portfolio over the past 22 months, Health Canada has also continued to perform its core mission to protect and promote the health of Canadians. We are seeing how the ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the coping capacity of Canada's health care systems. It has exposed a number of long-standing gaps that need to be addressed, including strained public health and health care systems, a long-term care system in need of reform, social and economic inequalities and, of course, increasing rates of mental illness and substance use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874316">As difficult as it has been, the pandemic has served as a catalyst in finding solutions to many of these pre-existing challenges. For example, the Government of Canada has made progress toward providing accessible digital tools and virtual health care to people across Canada. Through bilateral agreements with the provinces and territories worth approximately $150 million, the Government of Canada is providing support to expand virtual health care services across the country. This has been especially beneficial for Canadians in northern, rural and remote communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874317"> In addition, our government has committed up to $1 billion through the safe long-term care fund to help the provinces and territories improve infection, prevention and control in long-term care. Through this fund, the provinces and territories can receive support to hire additional staff and top up their wages. They can also invest in new or renovated infrastructure, including ventilation and readiness assessments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874318">Early in the pandemic, the Government of Canada recognized that enormous mental health needs were going unmet. Last year, Health Canada launched a new online portal for mental health and substance use support. Wellness Together Canada provides free 24-7 services and resources to people in need across Canada, including one-on-one counselling. As of November 29, more than 1.9 million people have accessed this portal. This means that on a weekly basis, anywhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people in Canada turn to Wellness Together Canada for mental health and substance use support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874319">The pandemic has also had an impact on the opioid overdose crisis, which continues to devastate families and communities across the country. We are focusing on providing communities with the support they need to save lives and improve the quality of life for people who use drugs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="35">(2035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6874320">Last summer, Health Canada invested an additional $116 million through the substance use and addictions program to build up successful community-based programs that prevent, treat or reduce the harms associated with substance use. The government is also working with experts and the provinces and territories on developing national standards for access to mental health and substance use services so that Canadians can get the support they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874321">Just this fall, we appointed Canada's very first federal <Affiliation DbId="278900" Type="4">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions</Affiliation>. The creation of this new role shows how committed our government is to giving mental health and substance use the attention they deserve. These ongoing health care issues continue to be a priority as we finish the fight against COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874322">The supplementary estimates (B) will see the Public Health Agency of Canada transfer $12.4 million to the Canada Border Services Agency for the ArriveCAN digital service. The agency is also transferring $7 million to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to expand research into understanding the nature of immunity following COVID-19 infection and vaccination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874323">For the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Government of Canada is requesting a total of $23.7 million in voted appropriations and $495,000 in statutory appropriations. Of the voted appropriations, $17.8 million will help establish the Centre for Research on Pandemic Preparedness and Health Emergencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874324">Finally, the government is seeking an additional $181 million in funding for Health Canada. This will increase the department's voted spending authorities by close to $180 million and its statutory spending by just over $1 million. In addition to addressing pressures associated with Canada's response to COVID-19, this funding will go toward some of the ongoing health care crisis issues discussed today, including improving mental health supports and services, addressing the opioid crisis and problematic substance use, and supporting access to sexual and reproductive health care information and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874325">In recent days, we have experienced some of the turbulence we were told to expect as we enter our second winter of the pandemic. As daily case counts creep up and we learn more about the omicron variant, we must continue to be both cautious and vigilant. As usual, our best line of defence is to take individual public health precautions, such as wearing a mask and getting vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874326">I believe the supplementary estimates (B) that the Government of Canada has presented reflect the balance between addressing the challenges of today and planning for a brighter future. Even as we continue to take the necessary precautions to stay safe in the present, we must also consider the future. If we look ahead with optimism, we can start building the future we want to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874327">I had the distinct honour of being the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health in the last Parliament, and I saw first-hand what our amazing public servants did day in and day out to keep Canadians safe.

              <ParaText id="6874587">Madam Chair, before I begin, I would like to say it is wonderful to see you back in the chair again. I want to acknowledge that I am speaking from the unceded territory of the Algonquin people. I will be speaking on the topic of residential schools.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874588">Many indigenous people in this country either went to or had family attend a residential school. It is essential to listen to indigenous people's experiences from all over the country. We must move away from paternalistic and discriminatory practices. With the knowledge and wisdom of elders, families and indigenous leaders across the country advising and guiding us, my hope is that we are on the right path. The recognition of the duty to honour indigenous rights will keep steadily flowing through Canada, bringing out a more fair and equitable society for us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874589">The schools' legacy haunts the present. It has affected indigenous communities over the long term, leading to significant gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous people. We continue to work with partners on addressing these gaps and putting an end to the ongoing negative impacts of colonialism. The location of unmarked graves at former residential school sites across Canada are tragic reminders of the mistreatment of indigenous children. Our thoughts are with those indigenous children who are missing and who never returned home, and with the survivors, families and communities as they mourn and heal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874590">I would like to take this opportunity to give some background on the history of residential schools and their ongoing impacts. Canada had a system of residential schools, starting from the 1830s until the last school closed in 1998. The aim of the schools was to assimilate indigenous children and erase their indigenous identities. These schools caused intergenerational trauma, which has long-term, negative impacts for indigenous people and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874591">Survivors of the system organized a class action lawsuit in the 2000s. The lawsuit, as well the research from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, brought even more attention to the issue of abuse in the residential school system. In 2006, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement was signed. It established a multi-billion-dollar fund to assist former students and their families on their healing journey. As part of this agreement, the government also launched a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874592">I visited the Mohawk residential school located near me in Brantford. The students there referred to it as the “mush hole” because of the mush they were served to eat. It operated from 1831 to 1970. This former residential school, now known as the Woodland Cultural Centre, received federal funding from the investing in Canada infrastructure program in the amount of $7.6 million in July of this year. I was pleased to attend the announcement, which completed phase three of the centre's fundraising and moved it one step closer to its goal of becoming a cultural heritage site.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874593"> This past summer I joined the “Walk for Joe” on its journey from the Mohawk Institute to Pikwakanagan First Nation. Joe and Rocky Commanda were removed from their home in the mid-1960s and taken to the Mohawk Institute. The brothers ran away twice in an attempt to get home. On their second attempt, they got separated. On September 13, 1968, Joe, only 13 at the time, was struck and killed by a train in Oakville, Ontario. Rocky, who joined the walk this summer, was a year older and was apprehended by police and put in a Toronto jail. This story of Joe and Rocky is sadly not unique.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874594">In its final report, the commission laid out an important question: Now that we know about residential schools and their legacy, what do we do about it? The commission provided a way to reconcile with the hard truths of the past. In its summary report, it provided 94 calls to action urging various governments and key players to repair the harms caused by residential schools. These calls to action have given us a foundation guiding our government and partners as we work to address the injustices of colonialism and advance reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874595">With a better understanding of the harm and the ramifications of the residential schools for indigenous communities today, we must move forward with action to drive change, led by indigenous people. One of the most concrete tools that we have to address the past and positively affect the present and the future is by fully implementing the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. There are 94 calls to action, which ask all levels of government, educational and religious institutions, civil society groups and Canadians to take action toward reconciliation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874596">They are comprehensive and require effort from a variety of stakeholders to work with indigenous partners on a new type of relationship: one that is based on respect and recognition of rights. Issues that the calls to action address include child welfare, education, language and culture, commemoration, health, missing children and burial information, justice and many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874597">Our government committed to fully implementing the changes recommended by the calls to action. We have made progress, but we recognize there is much more work required. Of the 76 calls to action that are the responsibility, or shared responsibility, of the federal government, 80% have been completed or are well under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874598">We have made great strides in areas such as education, where we codeveloped improved funding models and supported full-day kindergarten programs in first nations schools. On language, we have funded language preservation and appointed a commissioner of indigenous languages. On commemoration, we have legislated the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation and provided funding for a national monument commemorating the legacy of residential schools. I was pleased to work with Commissioner Marie on that monument.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874599">There are many other things we have done, but I have questions for the <Affiliation DbId="278922" Type="4">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874600">This year was the sixth anniversary of the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, which called on government, educational and religious institutions, civil society and all Canadians to take action on the 94 calls to action laid out in the truth and reconciliation report.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874604">Most notable, in light of what we have all seen over the last four months with the devastating discoveries and rediscoveries of unmarked graves and with more to come, is the sobering realization about the pace of this progress. As a part of that reaction, our government has committed $320 million to accelerate the pace, particularly with calls to action 72 through 76, which are about getting to the truth of this and continuing to get to the truth of this, because it does come before reconciliation. We are working with communities to support them in their quest for truth at their pace and on their conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874605">With those sums, I am happy to report that over a couple of dozen projects have been funded, with many more to come. In that light, Canadians need to brace themselves for the discovery of more findings and more reckoning, with the triggering and traumatization that has had a ripple effect on all indigenous communities.

However, throughout that, we have heard the cry from indigenous communities, from survivors and those who are courageously speaking out, but also from those who are courageously still suffering in silence, regarding the mental health supports in communities.

The law itself provides a one-year period where communities put forth their set of laws, which then will take precedence over every other law in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874618">This is a difficult process with coordination with provinces so that children do not fall through the cracks.

              <ParaText id="6874625">First, I would like to talk about housing. In its budget statement, the government allocated $6 billion over five years to be invested across Quebec and Canada. After the announcement, the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador, or AFNQL, indicated that this was a step in the right direction but that it was not enough to build, repair and maintain housing in indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874626">In 2018, the AFNQL determined that Quebec alone needed $3.9 billion for five years. Not to speak for the first nations, they are saying so themselves, but the Bloc Québécois used the AFNQL projection and determined that a $4.3‑billion investment over five years was needed for Quebec communities alone, including $400 million for Inuit communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874627">With inflation and the growing problems resulting from the housing shortage, which we saw in indigenous communities during the COVID‑19 crisis, we can expect that estimate will need to be even higher.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874638">Overall, the AFNQL is representative. It represents its members and knows what is going on. It has an excellent view of what is happening in communities, and it knows what they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874639">Is the government not concerned that by under-investing, it is deferring expenditures that will become even more significant in future? We spoke about northern communities. Construction is an issue in the north, whether it is on the territory of the Naskapi in Quebec or in Cree and Inuit communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874640">At the same time, the reality is that indigenous communities are very young. There are many families and many children, and we are unable to house them. It is not necessarily about geography, but about demographics. With money, I would hope that we can do it. We are not fighting the climate but a dire lack of funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874641">There is already a shortfall. In the minister's view, if we fail to make sufficient investments now, will we be further postponing investments of even greater amounts in housing for indigenous communities?</ParaText>

If there is one lesson we must learn from the pandemic right now, it is that housing means more than just a roof over one's head.

              <ParaText id="6874647">Madam Chair, I would remind the minister that I am glad that $6 billion has been invested, but that amount was for all of Canada. Quebec alone needs more than $4 billion over the next five years, as I mentioned earlier. The amount of federal funding is $6 billion, yes, but so far only $2.8 billion has gone out the door for all of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874648">Quebec therefore has a $4‑billion shortfall. We must also consider what this could mean for Canada and remember that the $6 billion covers only the next five years. Nothing is planned for after that, which means we will have another shortfall. That amount is simply not enough, and I wanted to point that out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874649">People will correct me if I am wrong, but according to everyone I have spoken with, housing is a cornerstone of first nations development and well-being. Nevertheless, I would like to raise some other issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874652">That $320 million was announced five days before the federal election was called.

Then I will have some questions, in particular, for the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278907" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. The topics I want to bring up with them today specifically relate to health and our public service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874675">On health, I really want to understand where we are with vaccines in the country right now, but, most important, what we are doing to fight some of the misinformation on vaccines. Unfortunately, a lot of people are vaccine hesitant because of a lot of misinformation. We saw this start well before vaccines were even introduced and brought into the country, and were widely available. This has continued. This is misinformation does not just come from fringe groups, but also from some people who, in my opinion, we would not expect to hear that kind of rhetoric.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874676">One of the key roles the government has to play in the fight against COVID is to inform people about the safety of the vaccines as well as how to treat a lot of that misinformation. The questions I have today for the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, when I get to them, really focus on what we are doing about this and what recommendations have come forward from public health with respect to fighting the misinformation on vaccination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874677">I also want to talk specifically about the people in our public service and the incredible work they have done. Our public service has stepped up. Quite often, these people are in the background, doing the work that has been set out through the direction of the government and this Parliament on behalf of Canadians. We saw the way they stepped up at the beginning of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874678"> I really hope we take the opportunity to reflect back on March 2020, when there were so many unknowns out there. We did not know how the pandemic spread. We did not know what tools or resources would be needed time to fight it. However, the people in our public service went above and beyond at the time to ensure that they did everything they possibly could to support Canadians throughout the pandemic, both from the various financial programs that were put into place and made available, but also through the reassurances that the government had the backs of Canadians, that the government would be here to ensure that vaccines were available despite some of the misinformation that was spread by the other side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874679"> I think back to when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> said that we would not have vaccines until 2030. I cannot imagine how that would make any Canadian feel good when a person in a position of leadership stands up and makes those kinds of comments. Back then, we were really looking for a team Canada approach, of everybody coming together to help fight this pandemic, along with the requirement and the need for everybody to work together, to have information like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874680">My first question is for the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>. Could he elaborate on what we have been doing as a government to help fight and combat the false information that is out there that vaccines are not safe and that people should not be taking them?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874796">Madam Chair, I am pleased to rise in committee of the whole. This evening, I will speak to Global Affairs' international assistance and the estimates as they relate to the international development portfolio before asking questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874797">The international development landscape has evolved significantly in the last two years. The pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated inequalities and reversed decades of development gains. Meanwhile, the global community also faces serious conflicts and humanitarian crises in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Haiti and elsewhere. These crises demand our immediate attention. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874798">At the same time, climate change is having alarming impacts on the least developed countries and small island developing states. We are seeing increases in drought, flooding, heat waves, crop failure and biodiversity loss. As we near the pandemic's two-year mark, we must keep these challenges in mind and look ahead to shaping a more sustainable, green and prosperous recovery. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874799">Globally, there have now been more than 260 million cases of COVID-19 and five million deaths. New and worrying variants continue to emerge. The pandemic has had many wide-ranging socio-economic impacts, greater social inequality, disproportionate economic vulnerabilities and burdens, and strained health systems. Many of these impacts are expected to be long-lasting worldwide, but especially in developing countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874800">While 76% of Canadians are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccination rates in lower-income countries are severely lagging. Across the African continent, only 7.5% of the population is fully vaccinated. We are already seeing how vaccine inequality increases overall inequalities. It is reversing development gains, particularly for women, girls and marginalized populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874801">After five million deaths worldwide, there is growing recognition that a stronger preparedness and response is critical to countering future pandemics. This calls for the highest level of political engagement, with a strong focus on accountability, transparency and equity. Canada is acting on the findings and recommendations of COVID-19 review bodies. We are part of multisectoral and multistakeholder discussions on how to strengthen the global health ecosystem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874802">Even before the pandemic, humanitarian needs had been increasing. Driven by protracted conflict and the effects of climate change, the number of forcibly displaced people had reached over 82 million worldwide by the end of 2020. It is a number that has not been seen since World War II.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874803">The world also saw the single largest increase in global hunger ever recorded, with an estimated 41 million people on the brink of famine. In recent years, we have since a widespread rollback in respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. This poses a serious obstacle to sustainable development. The pandemic has laid bare long-standing governance challenges in all regions of the world, but particularly in developing countries that lack the public sector capacity to deliver services sustainably and equitably. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874804">Canada is committed to improving the effectiveness of its international assistance to address these challenges. We will work with a diverse range of partners to take a whole-of-society approach that leaves no one behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874805">Since February 2020, Canada has committed more than $2.6 billion in international assistance in response to COVID-19. More than $1.3 billion of these funds went to the access to COVID-19 tools accelerator, more commonly known as the ACT accelerator, to facilitate equitable access to COVID-19 medical countermeasures. We are strongly committed to the ACT accelerator and its pillars, including the COVAX facility and its advanced market commitment. Canada will donate the equivalent of at least 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the COVAX facility by the end of 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874806">Canada supports global efforts to stabilize developing economies and to bring about pandemic recovery. Through the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s collaboration with the Prime Minister of Jamaica and the Secretary General of the United Nations, Canada is working with the international community to develop practical responses to the pandemic's socio-economic and financial impacts. This work builds on Canadian leadership in financing the sustainable development goals over the last decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874807">Canada has also committed to doubling its global climate finance contribution to $5.3 billion over the next five years. We will continue to explore ways to use these funds to mobilize additional financial resources to tackle the climate crisis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6874808">Canada recognizes the pandemic's disproportionate impact on women. We are leading the call for greater attention to the matter of paid and unpaid case work. Canada recently announced $100 million to develop programs to address this issue in low- and middle-income countries. Throughout the pandemic, Canada's feminist international assistance policy has proven to be a robust strategic framework focused on supporting the poorest and the most vulnerable populations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874809">In parallel to our COVID response, we have continued to implement our pre-COVID core international assistance commitments to achieve results and impacts. For example, our women's voice and leadership initiative supports more than 400 women's rights organizations in over 30 countries and regions. Many of these organizations received fast responsive funding to help them adjust to the pandemic's impacts. We will continue to support this important work, including by doubling funding to women's rights organizations. We are also funding Canadian organizations that work in partnership with local organizations through the small and medium organizations for impact and innovation initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874810">These and other initiatives are reinforcing the resilience of local communities and supporting our wider sustainable development efforts. We are committed to implementing the feminist international assistance policy and to increasing our international assistance annually toward 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874811">Before I conclude, I would like to turn to the supplementary estimates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874812">In the 2021-22 supplementary estimates (B), Global Affairs Canada is seeking an increase of $683 million, bringing our total authorities to $7.6 billion. This includes investments announced in budget 2021, such as $375 million to continue supporting Canada's international COVID-19 responses, $165 million for international humanitarian assistance and $68.8 million for Canada's response to the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874813">Also included in the supplementary estimates is $75 million for the strategic priorities fund, which has enabled investments for unpaid and paid care work of $10 million; $50 million for the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust; and $15 million allocated to the COVAX Manufacturing Task Force to support the establishment of the South Africa technology transfer hub. With the recent spread of new variants of concern, these strategic initiatives will help build capacity to enable development and production of mRNA vaccines and technologies in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874814">In addition to the investments already mentioned, Global Affairs Canada has allocated $59.9 million in support for the Venezuela migrant crisis and pledged $300 million for the Global Partnership for Education. Through these efforts, we are achieving results and generating positive impacts, helping to build a more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874915">Tonight's debate comes at a key moment for Canada and its recovery. Bit by bit, businesses are safely reopening. Employment has recovered to prerecession levels.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874916">All of the 3 million jobs lost when the crisis was at its peak were recovered faster than in any previous recession. Canada's economic recovery is on the right path, and the pandemic's impact on our economy is fading away. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874917">This has been possible because our government was there to support Canadians and Canadian businesses through the worst of this pandemic. Programs such as the Canada emergency response benefit, the Canada emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency rent subsidy, lockdown supports and the Canada emergency business account kept businesses from closing their doors and kept Canadians from losing their jobs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874918"> At its height in the spring of 2020, the Canada emergency wage subsidy supported 27.6% of all employees. Our performance was better than almost every other country's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874919">Thanks to our solid policy and support, we recovered all the jobs. We recovered the 3 million jobs lost during the crisis. Just last week, we got great news: 154,000 jobs were created in November.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874920">According to the OECD, Canada was one of the first countries to recover all of its hours worked by March 2021. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874921">As good as all this news has been, we know there is more work to be done. We know that not all sectors have fully recovered, and we know that risks remain from new variants of this disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874922">Before the House are two key matters to help get us through the end of this pandemic. The first is tonight's supplementary estimates and the second is Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874923">Through the supplementary estimates, the government is seeking parliamentary approval for $8.7 billion in new voted spending. Approximately $1.2 billion of the proposed voted spending in the supplementary estimates (B) is for the government's ongoing response to the COVID‑19 pandemic. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874924">This is so we can continue the work we have been doing since the start of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874925">Federal support also included significant financing for the provinces and territories through top-ups to the Canada health transfer as well as through the safe restart agreement, the safe return to class fund and the essential workers support fund. All told, more than eight dollars of every $10 spent to fight COVID‑19 and support Canadians has come from the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874926">As outlined by the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> last night, in the supplementary estimates (B), the Public Health Agency of Canada is transferring $12.4 million to the Canada Border Services Agency for the ongoing development of the ArriveCAN app. This service helps travellers crossing the border comply with COVID‑19 public health measures before, during or after crossing the border by storing proof of vaccination, for example.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874927">In addition, the Public Health Agency of Canada is transferring $7 million to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research so it can support additional research to better understand the nature of immunity after an infection and a COVID‑19 vaccine. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874928">Finally, for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, there is approximately $23.7 million in voted items and $495,000 in statutory credits in the supplementary estimates (B).</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874929">As I pointed out earlier, the economic recovery is uneven, and public health measures, although essential to our health and safety, continue to restrict some economic activities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874930">In budget 2021, the government promised that if additional flexibility was required based on public health considerations later in the year, it would continue to do whatever it takes to be there for Canadians. That is why in October we announced the Canada worker lockdown benefit, which I would like to spend some time on in my remarks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874931">This proposed new measure was first announced on October 21 and is part of the legislation we are debating today. To ensure that workers continue to have support and that no one is left behind, this benefit will provide $300 a week in income support to eligible workers should they be unable to work due to a regional lockdown until May 7, 2022, with retroactive application to October 24, 2021 if required. It will continue to offer support to those who still need it if the pandemic requires further public health lockdowns in any part of the country, including workers who are both eligible and ineligible for employment insurance.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874932">Assistance would be available in all regions of Canada designated by the government for the duration of the lockdown. This measure could be obtained quickly to support affected workers in the event of a lockdown in the region where they work.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874933">Temporary lockdowns are still a possibility in the months to come. While the government hopes it will not be needed, the Canada worker lockdown benefit offers peace of mind and some economic certainty in these uncertain times.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874934">With children aged 5 to 11 now eligible to get vaccinated, we know that this increased immunization coverage brings us one step closer to a situation where restrictions and closures will no longer be necessary.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6874935">Further down the road, we are also looking forward to loosened restrictions on hospitality, travel and tourism, and arts and culture. This new measure and the other targeted supports, such as the tourism and hospitality recovery program and the hardest-hit business recovery program proposed in the bill we debated today, will help bridge Canadians to full recovery in hard-hit sectors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6874936">Canada is now well on its way to economic recovery. Thanks to one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world, many businesses are safely reopening. Employment in November was higher than it was in February 2020, prior to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874937">In the coming months, Canada's economic recovery will continue, because our vaccine successes and the safe reopening will allow Canadians to return to what they have been missing most for almost two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6874938">However, we must remain vigilant, especially with the arrival of the omicron variant, which we continue to monitor.</ParaText>
