              <ParaText id="8563049">After an incredibly well-decorated 2023, Maskwa has done the unthinkable and, for a second year in a row, was victorious in the Canoe Kayak Canada Sprint National Championships.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563053">Our railway workers keep our economy moving. They keep Canadians moving. More importantly, they keep Canadians safe.

              <ParaText id="8563061"> Philippe is a real bookworm. If someone asks him about the great classics of Quebec literature, philosophy or sociology, he can make recommendations without even batting an eye. This champion of publishing, this knowledge-sharing literary scholar, has been a breath of fresh air for all readers in Saguenay with his great recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563062">I would urge everyone to go and meet him. His overwhelming enthusiasm is enough to turn anyone into an avid reader. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563063">This is the third time that Librairie Marie-Laura has won this prestigious award. Once again, my region is showing that, when it comes to literature, we are no dummies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563064">As Dany Laferrière said, “Reading is not necessary for the body, only oxygen is, but a good book oxygenates the mind.” I hope Philippe will help us oxygenate our minds for a long time to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563071">I spoke with many of my constituents over the summer and the overwhelming message for the Liberal government was to call an election. Why? These are some of the issues they brought up. There are skyrocketing prices for basic items like food and other groceries. Folks mentioned the price of gas, which keeps going up and up. In my riding, a car is a necessity, not a luxury. They said that taxes were making it impossible to pay the bills. With respect to the carbon tax, everyone wanted the horrible tax scheme scrapped. People were worried about paying for housing, which has doubled over the last nine years. They mentioned the rising levels of crime, car thefts and drug addictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563072">Canadians want an election where they can choose a strong, majority Conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>

Just last month, a serial rapist was granted day parole only four years after he was convicted of sexually assaulting five women while working as a nightclub promoter. Is it any wonder that sexual assaults are up 75% over the past nine years? However, the NDP continues to prop up the Liberals and their soft-on-crime agenda.

              <ParaText id="8563389">Madam Speaker, the extraordinary display of hypocrisy that just occurred in the House has never before been seen on a level like that in the history of this country and in the history of this austere chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563390"> What happened? The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> knew he was going down. We had a great candidate. I was at doors with him many times. Colin Reynolds is a construction electrician, a guy on the executive of his local IBEW union board who grew up in the area and who really connected with the residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563391">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> knew he was going to lose the by-election. What did he do? He said that he was ripping up the agreement and that he was done with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Unfortunately, the people of Elmwood—Transcona deserve better. They deserve better than having the leader of the NDP try to fool them into thinking he is a man of principle. He is not, and that was established today. In front of the entire country, the man who said he was ripping up the agreement got up, taped it back together and said that he believes in the Prime Minister and is voting with him. In fact, he said he has confidence in the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563392">The height of hypocrisy is on a level never, ever before seen on the floor of the chamber. Canadians will not forget it, and the people of Elmwood—Transcona will not forget it come the next election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563393">Regarding the issue of the report, as I said, I sit on the committee. Conservatives really are the only members on the committee who are doing their best to hold the government to account. We had some great ideas for the report that our colleagues from other parties on the committee would not support. Therefore, for the people watching, I will explain that we attached a dissenting report to the report, which we are allowed to do. Anyone can look it up online and read the dissenting report. I want to go through some parts of it, but before I do, I want to just circle back for a second to look at part of the Liberal government's record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563394"> In 2015, in order to fool Canadians into voting for him, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to balance the budget by 2019. Of course that never happened. In fact he doubled the national debt in nine years. It is hard to get one's head around that, but just to put it in perspective, in 2015, when the Prime Minister first was elected to office, the national debt was $616 billion. Today it is over $1.2 trillion. The Prime Minister has gone more in debt than all other prime ministers from 1867 to today combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563395">Today the interest on the debt is $52 billion a year, which is more than we spend on health care, more than we spend on defence and in fact more than we actually collect in the GST. It is important for people watching to know that when they go out and buy something in the store and the store adds on the GST, that money is going directly to paying the interest on the massive, historic debt that the Prime Minister has managed to rack up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563396"> Therefore at committee, Conservatives made a number of common-sense recommendations that were rejected by the NDP and Liberal members. One of the recommendations we made, which we had hoped would be a recommendation in the report, was to axe the carbon tax. The reason we wanted to axe the carbon tax is pretty straightforward, and I will go through some of those points. For example, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Tiff Macklem, came to committee and told us that the carbon taxes are inflationary and that by cutting the carbon tax, inflation would come down by 0.6%, bringing the CPI back into the bank's target range.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563397"> The government has an opportunity now to start with the carbon tax on farmers. The common-sense Conservative bill, Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, should be passed immediately in its original form to take the tax off farmers to help lower food prices. I know it has been said many times in the House, but when one taxes the farmer who produces the food, taxes the trucker who ships the food and taxes the grocer who stocks the food, the food costs more. What is the result? It is two million Canadians lining up at food banks, and a historic number of homeless encampments across this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563398">Earlier this year, as part of the finance committee's housing study, Mayor Cam Guthrie from Guelph was a witness. He was elected in 2014. I asked Mayor Guthrie how many homeless encampments there were in Guelph the year he was elected. He said there were zero. I asked how many there are today, and he said there are 20.

              <ParaText id="8563399">I made a speech about this the other day in the House and went through the litany of housing-hell stories across this country as a result of the apocalyptic, historically terrible housing policies of the Liberal government. With $82 billion on the national housing strategy, never before has so much been spent to achieve so little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563400">It is time to axe the failed and inflationary carbon tax that makes gas, groceries and home heating more expensive, and to bring down inflation so Canadians can once again earn powerful paycheques so they can afford nutritious food and a home in a safe neighbourhood. It seems like a simple ask, part of the Canadian dream, but that dream has been broken by the failed policies of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563401"> We said to axe the tax, and we also talked about building more homes. There is a housing crisis in this country. There is an affordability crisis, and we need to build millions of homes. However, the Liberals and the NDP voted against our common-sense Conservative bill, the building homes, not bureaucracy act, a bill that would have gotten houses built. Instead they just got in the way. They are the gatekeepers of the House of Commons, and they got in the way of a common-sense bill that would have helped Canadians. Of course, we also need to fix the budget and stop the crime. Let us bring it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563422">The Standing Committee on Finance has a very important job. In fact, it is a rare committee because, in our Standing Orders, it actually says that the finance committee must travel and hear widely from Canadians as it does its deliberations. As we have heard from the<Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2"> leader</Affiliation> of Canada's common-sense Conservatives, Canada has a problem. We have a gatekeeper economy, which means that there are many people who are seeking prosperity and opportunity, but they cannot do so because of the various gatekeepers that are closing in. I was previously a member of the finance committee, and we would sometimes travel to remote locations to hear testimony. I took great pride in the effort to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563423">One of the key problems we have is that the average citizen does not have a lobbyist here in Ottawa. Oftentimes, lobbyists are the ones coming to the finance committee, and the number one recommendation they always make is to spend more money. When we talk about the costly coalition of a mainly NDP-Liberal government, sometimes supported by the Bloc, it is because there is never a dollar for which they could not find something to spend it on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563424">Let us hearken back to the first majority the government had. The President of the Treasury Board at the time said they were going to do a spending review. From the spending review, they found that they needed to spend more money. That is the kind of situation we have: There is no leadership or priority except to spend others' money. When I speak about this issue, I often say of the government that Ottawa has a spending problem; it does not have a revenue problem. Nevertheless, there is not a tax that the government will not look to increase. Every April 1, we see a hodgepodge of different taxes, starting with the carbon tax. It does not matter what province one is from; with the exception of Quebec, we see the NDP-Liberal government raising the carbon tax again every April 1. In fact, if we go to the B.C. NDP government's own budget documents, on page 75, they actually say that the federal government is responsible for having to raise the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563425">I want to take a quick moment to point out that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278374" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> has asked the government about carbon tax 1 and carbon tax 2. Yes, we have ended up with a series of regulations. Of course, they have been fully costed by both the government and the parliamentary budget office. By the government's own analysis, when each respective tax is combined, it is a tax on the economy of up to, if not higher than, $40 billion per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563426"> Let us be mindful that the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> has always advocated for more taxes to come to Ottawa. He has talked about not supporting carbon taxes, but we shall see; he also talked about not supporting the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> anymore. In fact, he famously tore up the agreement for confidence and supply. He said that the Prime Minister should not be Prime Minister. However, the NDP leader came to this place today, and what did he and his caucus do? They supported the government. It will be really interesting to see what happens next April 1, when we have such things as the carbon tax and excise tax on alcohol set to increase. We will see what happens at that particular juncture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563427">I am going to go back to the gatekeeping economy, the lobbyists and whatnot. The lobbyists always come and they present something. When I speak to my constituents, they say that they are barely able to keep up with what they have, including affording nutritious food. Sylvain Charlebois, the food professor at Dalhousie, has said that people are making the very difficult choice between food's nutrition and cost, and they are siding more with the cost.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563428">We should be concerned that many of our constituents are going to food banks because they cannot afford to pay their carbon tax, their income tax and all the taxes the government continues to raise. Who speaks for those people? They do not have a lobbyist. We are supposed to speak for them. We are the ones who are ultimately responsible for either giving the government supply or denying it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563429">We had a confidence vote today where we saw both the Bloc and the NDP side with the Liberal government. I believe we need to be looking more to our constituents rather than the recommendations of lobbyists who show up at the finance committee and others. We also need to consider that the average John Smith or Jane Doe is facing critical shortages of housing, especially if they are younger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563430">The Liberal government has said during every single fall economic update and every budget that it will address that. It has not. It has not addressed such things as chronic homelessness or the fact that young people cannot get into the market, even when they save and scrimp to get there. Liberals keep talking about all the different programs they offer and how that is going to alleviate the issues in the system. However, going back to that gatekeeper economy, we have city councillors who are choosing not to build housing in sufficient quantities in many municipalities, particularly in those large urban centres and census metropolitan areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563431">Housing demand has only gone up because of the policies of the government. If there is a massive demand for housing and we continue to allow gatekeepers, such as municipal councils, to basically stop the investment of new housing, that is going to create an affordability challenge and a crisis. In B.C., in the past year, we have seen housing starts drop by 34%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563432">Government members, and politicians who support them, constantly talk about the housing crisis, yet there is very little discussion about putting pressure on municipalities. In fact, the government's own so-called housing accelerator, which I called a slush fund for municipalities, is essentially allowing municipalities to not increase housing stock by writing them cheques. This happens even in part of my riding in Kelowna. The housing accelerator plan talks about how they can actually invest the dollars they are given from it into such things as bike lanes, bridges and sewers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563433">There is no onus on the City of Kelowna to help build a single house. There is not an actual commitment for that. This is the problem: We have a government that fails to acknowledge that municipal councils are those gatekeepers. Instead of putting up a set of incentives that actually reward those that are building and punish those that are not, they have essentially written out blank cheques to these municipalities. They have also been picking winners and choosers. I know the City of West Kelowna, the District of Summerland and the District of Peachland all applied for the same funding and did not get anywhere with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563434">This scattershot approach is not working and, again, I want to focus on those young people. All of us here love this country; I really believe that we do. The problem is, if we continue to deliver the same kind of results, those young people are going to feel alienated. They are either going to opt out and not vote or vote for very extreme choices.</ParaText>

We also brought in pharmacare, and diabetes medication. I have talked to many people who have to spend thousands of dollars every year on diabetes medications and devices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563450">Can the member explain to us, if he is truly concerned about affordability, why he and his party voted against those two measures, which take thousands of dollars of expenses off some of the lowest-income Canadians and would obviously ease their affordability issues?

              <ParaText id="8563451">Madam Speaker, I will give the member a practical example. My understanding is that, in the Similkameen and in Penticton proper, there have not been any sign-ups for a dentist. Maybe there has been one now, but the NDP is touting this program as being widely available and accessible to people. I have had people in Kelowna tell me they have tried to go to a different dentist, but the new dentist requires a number of X-rays that cost hundreds of dollars. They cannot afford that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563454">We just finished having a confidence vote. The Conservatives, in their great hunger for power, will do whatever it takes, period, end of story, to get what they want, not necessarily what Canadians want but what the leadership of the Conservative Party wants. It is unfortunate, because there is a substantial cost to the behaviour we are witnessing day in and day out from the Conservative Party. Its single focus is nothing more than to cause an election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563455">Fortunately, other political entities in the House of Commons recognize we are not here to serve the Conservative Party. We are here to serve and provide for Canadians in all regions of our country. In the last election, all parties were given a mandate, and that mandate was to work co-operatively in looking for ways to provide the supports that Canadians want and expect, not only the government of the day, the Liberals, but also the New Democrats, members of the Bloc and, in fact, Conservative members of the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563456">The Conservative Party has been consistent since day one after the last federal election. One only needs to look at the actions Conservatives have taken. It was greatly amplified over the summer, to the degree that they are even getting a little giddy, I would suggest. Unfortunately, adding to that giddiness, some serious issues are flowing out of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s office, and that really concerns a lot of Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563468">In fact, a couple of weeks back, and I cannot really recall when it was, I was on a CTV panel where there was no Conservative representative. I am told Conservatives do not want to participate in panels. Yesterday, I was on a CBC panel, and Conservatives do not participate on CBC panels. Yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and Conservative Party members made a decision that they do not like CBC and CTV. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563471">Madam Speaker, now the Conservatives are saying that they do not want to be accountable through media like the CTVs or the CBCs of Canada because they do not have confidence in those national news broadcasters. It is because they do not want to answer the questions that are being posed to them. Instead, they want to rely on social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563472">There is a reference to the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> being very similar to Trump. That might be a bit of a disservice to Donald Trump. Quite frankly, I am very disappointed in the direction the far-right Conservative Party is going today. There is also no sign of its members changing their attitudes. Look at the attitude of hate that Conservatives are promoting and the information they are providing to people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563473">Today, Conservatives brought forward a motion, and that motion is in keeping with their slogans. I will give them that much. Darn, they are good at slogans. They have slogans; they have bumper stickers. They are ready and itching to get them out there. The problem is that everything is based on a foundation of sand. At the end of the day, there is nothing to it but slogans and bumper stickers, which are supported by misinformation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563474">One of the examples I could give is related to what Conservative members have been talking a lot about already today. If someone were to do a Hansard search, how many Conservative members of Parliament would we find who have actually said anything about cutting the carbon rebates? I suspect we would not find any. How many have said, “cut the carbon tax”? I suspect, on average, each one has said it 10 times. Some have said it a couple hundred times, and others have not said it because they have not spoken.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563475"> I can suggest to members that, when Conservatives go to Canadians and say that they are going to save Canadians money, as they have said inside the chamber, by cutting the carbon tax, that is not true. More than 80% of the constituents that I represent get a carbon rebate. That rebate amount is more than the carbon tax that they pay. That means that their net income, their disposable income, is increased. That is the reality. Members do not have to believe me. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is independent, will tell us that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563476">Conservatives will spread misinformation because it sounds good. Some provinces do not even have the carbon tax, yet they will go to those provinces and say that they are going to cut the carbon tax, giving a false impression. The other day in debate, there was one member in the Conservative Party who stood up and said that a 34% cost increase on food is a direct result of the carbon tax. What a bunch of garbage. That is absolutely ridiculous. I challenged the member on that statement, and then I challenged a couple of other members on the statement this particular member made. They do not change their opinions on it, even if they are confronted with facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563477">They do not change their opinions because they are so focused on that thirst for power. At the end of the day, they are not concerned about what is happening for Canadians, the day-to-day living that Canadians have to put up with, let alone the important issues that the House of Commons deals with on a daily basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563478">Today, we were supposed to debate Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>. Bill C-71 is a bill to ensure that individuals who should have never have lost their citizenship will be given their Canadian citizenship. Every political party, except for the Conservatives, supports that legislation. Conservatives do not even want to debate it now. They will not allow it to be debated. They do not want it to go to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563479">Members will say that the Conservatives do not support that one, but they do support Bill <Document DbId="12960457" Type="3">C-66</Document>. They say that they support it. That bill takes sexual harassment and rape victims who are going through military courts and transfers them into civil courts. Every member of the House of Commons, the Conservatives, the Bloc, New Democrats, Greens and, of course, Liberals, supports that legislation. Members would think that the Conservatives would allow that bill to go to committee, but no. Instead, they want to filibuster. They brought forward another concurrence report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563480">They say that they are concerned about the economy. Members can take a look at Bill <Document DbId="12062671" Type="3">C-33</Document>, which we were supposed to be debating last week, to enhance our trading opportunities. What did the Conservative members do? They did not want to debate that either, so they brought in another concurrence report, which prevented the government from being able to debate that legislation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563481">The members opposite, in criticizing the government today, were talking about issues of crime. They say that this is what they want to talk about. I will remind them of Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act. That is to protect children being extorted, being bullied. The whole issue of exploitation of our young children, we were supposed to debate that last week, but no, the Conservatives said no to that too, and they brought forward a concurrence report. The Conservative Party is going out of its way to prevent any legislation from going to committee. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563482">Prior to getting up, I had a member of one of the opposition parties approach me, asking why we do not just move to orders of the day. I think there was a great deal of effort and thought to move towards orders of the day because then maybe we could get on with actually providing movement on some of this legislation. The problem is that we are a minority government. In a minority government, we cannot go to orders of the day unless we get an opposition party that says it will support the government moving to orders of the day so that we can get rid of the games that the Conservative party has been playing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563483">Let there be no doubt that, no matter how critical the Conservative Party is, how much of a roadblock the Conservatives want to present or how much of a character assassination that they are after for those in the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government will continue to be focused on the interests of Canadians in all regions of our country. That is something we will continue to focus on day in and day out. That means that, whether the Conservatives want it or not, we will continue to develop policy ideas that will transform into budgetary measures and legislative measures. There will come a time when Canadians will, in fact, evaluate and take a look at what the Conservative Party has been doing between now and whenever the next election is, and what other political entities have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563484"> I think there is a sense of responsibility for all of us to be able to accomplish good things for Canadians. That is what I liked about the agreement that was achieved between the Liberals and the New Democrats. I have always been a big fan of the pharmacare plan. I have always been a very strong advocate for a national health care system that supports our provinces, which administer health care. For over 30 years as a parliamentarian, those are the types of issues that have been important for me. As a government, those issues have been important for us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563485">We were able to get support from the New Democrats to advance a number of wonderful health care initiatives. That is what it means to put people first, putting the constituents of Canada ahead of partisan politics. By doing that, the government has invested $198 billion over 10 years in health care. That is for future generations. We have developed a dental care program. To date, over 700,000 people have had access to it. Members can think of diabetes, or of contraceptives, and how, as a government working with an opposition party, we are, in fact, making a difference. In fact, I have suggested that one of the other things we should possibly be looking at is shingles and how pharmacare might be able to deal with that particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563486">These are the types of ideas that we are talking about within the Liberal Party to build a stronger, healthier health care system, while the Conservative Party wants to tear it down. That is a part of the Conservative far-right hidden agenda. People need to be aware of that. By the time we get to the election, I believe that throughout that election, we will see the Conservative sand fade away. There is no foundation to what they are saying. It is just bumper stickers and slogans. That is all they have. We can contrast that to the many progressive measures we have taken as a government, in good part because of the cooperation of opposition parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563487"> I ask the Conservatives to stop playing the games, stop bringing in Conservative motions of concurrence and allow debate on government legislation. A responsible Conservative opposition could still bring in the motions it wants, while at least allowing debates to occur on legislation. Allow these important pieces of legislation to go to committee where they can be studied, where they can come back and where they can provide hope for many. That is the very least that Conservatives can do: put Canadians ahead of their own political party.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8563515">Madam Speaker, I was surprised to learn this afternoon that we were going to discuss the Standing Committee on Finance's report on the pre-budget consultations from February.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563516">Although the report was tabled in February, most of the work was done the previous fall. We worked very long hours in committee, where we heard from many witnesses so that we could take all aspects and needs of Quebec's economy and, of course, Canada's economy into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563517">We even toured the provinces during the two break weeks. During the first break week, in October 2023, we went to the Maritimes, and during the break week in November, we visited all the other provinces, starting in Quebec and ending in British Columbia. There is nothing like going out into the community and hearing directly from the people. It gives groups and witnesses a chance to take part in the discussions and tell us about their needs and their realities. It makes our work easier so that we can better sense and understand what is happening on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563518">Members may be wondering what a member of the Bloc Québécois could possibly be doing travelling all over Canada and listening to organizations in other provinces. First, their needs may overlap with those of Quebec. Second, we also invited all of the organizations that defend the rights of francophones in all of the provinces of Canada. That gave us the opportunity to make contacts, gain a better understanding of francophones' realities and see how they are often isolated and have to fight to continue speaking one of the two official languages. There is still a lot of work to be done. Obviously, we continue to stand in solidarity with Franco-Canadians and always will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563519">From our consultations, we developed a series of recommendations that we presented to the government. Obviously, we are in constant contact with the government. The minister even has staff who follow the work in committee and who can see what recommendations may be made in the future. It is an important job to keep the minister and her team informed of the needs of the Canadian economy and also of Quebec's economy, which is what matters to the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563520">The report begins by noting that all the recommendations must be read and considered “in accordance with the powers of each jurisdiction”. This is an important show of respect in regard to interference. It serves as a reminder to the government that, when the political system was developed, the decision was made to create a federation. That was the compromise. In fact, we know that John A. Macdonald and his friends wanted a legislative union where everything would be decided in Ottawa, but others disagreed. For Quebec to get on board, there had to be levels of government that were equally sovereign in their own areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563521">However, what I have seen in the House since 2015—and this was also the case in previous years—is that the government is clearly tempted to constantly grab new powers, to centralize power, to want to make all the decisions. This goes against legal instruments and, more importantly, it flies in the face of respect for my nation, the Quebec nation. The very beginning of the report, therefore, reiterates the importance that all recommendations be made with respect for each government's areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563522">When my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> and I asked the parliamentary secretary questions, we brought up a recommendation that we care about in the report currently under discussion. A majority of elected members in committee, including the Liberals, passed this recommendation. I would like to quote it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563523">It recommends that the government: </ParaText>

In its report, the Standing Committee on Finance advised the government and all members to support this bill. That is very important. In fact, all the parties supported the bill. The problem is that the government must give the royal recommendation to allow the bill to be studied further.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563526">The Bloc Québécois told this government, which is now a minority government, that if it wants our support for the next few months, it has to support Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> by giving it a royal recommendation. That is very important. It is a very important measure. It is about dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563527">We look forward to hearing the government's response, which will tell us whether we will continue working in the House for the well-being of seniors and young retirees in Quebec and across Canada, or whether we should hop on our buses and go talk to everyone and find out how many Liberal members will be left in the House after the election. The choice is up to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563528">We are talking about seniors aged 65 to 74 because the government increased old age security for seniors aged 75 and over. That is great, but if the pension had been increased starting at age 65, I would be clapping with both hands. However, since the increase is only for 75 and up, I can only clap with one hand, because the job is only half done. Now a significant inequity needs to be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563529">Why do we want to enhance the OAS? It is a federal support program, and there are not a lot of those. This is a jurisdictional matter. When the program was created, the idea was to index it annually to the average wage. For decades, that did not happen. The pension ended up being too small to enable seniors to live with a modicum of dignity. A top-up was required, and one was provided for seniors 75 and up, but there is still a huge gap for those 65 to 74. Now seniors are divided into two classes: those who are entitled to dignity and those who are not. Why is this happening? It is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563530">My parents are 71 and 72. The physical health, well-being and financial security of people who are between 65 and 74 varies quite a bit. That is where the idea for a universal program came from. Under this program, those who earn a lot of money do not get the full pension because they have enough money. However, the program is there to help those who have needs. That is the point of a social program. The OAS should be indexed to the increase in the average wage to allow seniors to retain that dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563531">There may be some people in that age bracket who had very physically demanding jobs and who are physically unable to continue working. They need to rest, and that rest is well deserved. We need to be there for those men and women. I mention women here because, quite often, the people who do not have a private pension plan, RRSP or employer pension plan are women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563532">Often they are women because, when we ask people to be caregivers, to lend a hand and to make a contribution, unfortunately, in our society, there is still a lot of inequity. Too often, women are the ones who are asked to make sacrifices for the well-being of others. When elderly parents need a caregiver, very often, it is a woman who quits her job to help her parents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563533">During that time, she is not contributing to the Quebec pension plan, if she lives in Quebec, or to the Canada pension plan. She cannot contribute to a private plan either. Then, if her husband gets sick, she is the one who will once again sacrifice her job and her career to take care of him. It is often the same thing with children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563534">Quite often, it is women who make these sacrifices and have to forgo the more dignified retirement they might have had. Social programs such as the OAS are there to support them. Statistics show that senior women who live alone are overrepresented among the poor. It is important to restore fairness and justice.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563535">Women often give of themselves to support the well-being of others, so the least we can do is restore some balance with a social safety net to catch them. We need to give seniors aged 65 to 74 something. We need to increase the OAS, which was not indexed to inflation or the average wage. It is a matter of dignity. It is one of the federal government's core responsibilities, so we are asking it to take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563536">All parties supported the measure, and it is up to the government to give royal assent. The Bloc Québécois sees this as a matter of confidence in the government. Is the government there to help people? Is it there to help people in need within the limits of its jurisdiction? If so, this is a golden opportunity to prove it. Our confidence in the government will depend on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563537">I am the finance critic and my counterpart is the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. Like most of her colleagues, she is particularly talented at extending congratulations, boasting, networking and maintaining good relations. While that may often save time, it does not result in any serious work or specific commitments. That is why, this morning, my leader, together with the party officers, announced that we are setting a deadline. If this bill is not in force by October 29, if it has not received a royal recommendation and royal assent by that date, we will work with the other opposition parties to discuss whether we still have confidence in the government. It is a matter of dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563538">Furthermore, the Minister of Finance told me that this bill would cost an estimated $3 billion a year. She said that it is expensive, that it is a lot of money. Well, that is what governing is all about. Governing means making choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563539">We have resources. How do we allocate them? What do we spend them on? Three billion dollars a year is expensive, yet the Trans Mountain pipeline cost $34 billion. That is very expensive for a heavily polluting industry whose companies earn record profits, astronomical profits. Most of the dividends paid out by these companies leave Canada and go to other economic interests. It is an industry that does not need money, but the government gives it $34 billion to help it out. However, $3 billion is apparently too much to spend on seniors aged 65 to 74, who are often women living alone. Does the government work for the oil lobbies, or does it work for people in need? That is what we are wondering, and its decision on the royal recommendation will give us an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563540">I talked about the $34 billion for Trans Mountain, compared to the $3 billion a year needed to increase the OAS. I would also like to talk about the Minister of Finance's plan for what she calls a “green economy”. We see right through that. We know this government's newspeak. In its newspeak, “green economy” means “support for fossil fuel industries”. Its plan to provide $83 billion over the next few years has multiple components, but it essentially involves programs made to measure for the oil and gas industry, which, I repeat, has no need of government support, is highly profitable and rakes in record profits year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563541">Catherine McKenna, the Liberal Party's former environment minister, said it better than anyone, I think. The oil and gas industry needs no support. We paid $34 billion for Trans Mountain and $83 billion for programs like carbon capture. Does the industry need that? The government says that it does and that this $83 billion is more important than $3 billion for seniors, who, as I said, are often women living alone who need this money to maintain a modicum of dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563542">Governing is about making choices. The government is now a minority government. If it wants to dance with us, it needs to stop serving this extremely profitable industry that does not need support. Instead, it needs to focus on the people who actually need support, as we are proposing in Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>, which will be debated shortly, within the limits of its jurisdiction. That is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563543">The $83 billion includes carbon capture. The oil sands industry is getting help to set up small modular nuclear reactors to heat the sands, which will help it save on gas. The gas could be exported, because that is so environmentally friendly, using the new Coastal GasLink pipeline. It could also be used to make hydrogen, because that $83 billion also includes a tailor-made plan to transform the gas saved thanks to the nuclear reactors into hydrogen, which can then be exported.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563544">Is that the government's vision for the future, its green vision?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563545">Meanwhile, it says that investing $3 billion a year for seniors aged 65 to 74 who need it is too expensive. Among the OECD countries, which are basically the 30 richest countries, Canada is near the bottom in terms of the gap between pre- and post-retirement income. This is called the replacement rate. This means that Canada is basically the country where a person's income drops the most when they stop working and retire. That has to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563546">The reason Canada is doing so poorly is that the existing social programs were not indexed. The government needs to ensure the dignity of its citizens within the limits of its jurisdictions. In this case, we are talking about the OAS, which falls under federal jurisdiction. Past governments failed in their duty by refusing to index the OAS, gradually undermining seniors' dignity. The government topped up the payments for seniors aged 75 and up, but it decided to abandon another class of seniors, those aged 65 to 74. This is now a matter of confidence for the Bloc Québécois. It is a matter of dignity. The OECD data remind us that Canada has fallen very far behind and is doing very poorly in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563547">Three billion dollars a year is a fair amount of money, but baby boomers are about to retire in droves. Given the very low replacement rate, their income will drop, which will have an indirect impact on the entire economy. What will their consumption levels look like? If they have access to a decent income, they will be able to maintain minimum consumption levels and help keep the economy running smoothly. If not, then we could experience an economic slowdown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563548">In this regard, I would like to remind members of the situation in Japan. Japan's population has been aging at a faster rate than in other countries. The economy has stagnated faster than elsewhere, with sluggish growth rates and deflation, because seniors, who no longer need to buy new cars and new homes, will limit their consumption. It is partly a cultural choice, but that does not always explain it; Japan also has poverty issues that have led the entire economy to stagnate since the nineties. That needs to be looked at. It is a matter of dignity, but it is also a matter of ensuring a well-functioning economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563549">I will stop here for the part of the report that supports our Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>, which we will debate in exactly 18 minutes from now. However, I will make one last point in the minute I have left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563550">It concerns another recommendation in the report that has to do with supply management. That recommendation, which was supported by the Liberal members who form the government, reads as follows:</ParaText>

While the Liberal government was cutting all social transfers to the provinces in order to balance its budget, we decided to roll up our sleeves and forge ahead.

We even set up child care centres, which are day care centres with a strong educational program. We did that in the late 1990s, more than 25 years ago. Quebec did not wait for the federal government.</ParaText>

What is being proposed, and what he is talking about in his speech, is about making sure that those who are 65 to 74 will get the same benefit in the OAS as those who are 75 and over. In that way, we would not have a two-tiered seniors benefit. I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563566"> When we look at the corporate tax rate, back in 2015, the PBO calculated that it generated $2.6 billion per 1% of tax for corporations. That would be roughly about $3 billion today, so that would equate to a 1% increase in corporate taxes. Instead of choosing corporate welfare, because we have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7, how is that playing out? Big oil, big banks and big grocery are having record profits. Meanwhile, seniors are living in poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563567">Would my colleague support a 1% increase in corporate tax, or a windfall tax, on big oil, big grocery and big banks? Because we know that we did it to the big banks, which generated billions of dollars. There was a report done by the PBO that said big oil, with the same taxation, would generate $4.2 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563569">My personal fight in the House is a fight against tax havens. How do we make unlawful that which is immoral? Why is it that the banks, by using obscure clauses written in fine print and buried among tens of thousands of pages, are allowed to get away with paying less tax by artificially, virtually, declaring the profits they earn in Canada through subsidiaries in the Caribbean Islands or elsewhere? That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563570">Equity must exist across the entire economy and throughout society as a whole. For example, if oil companies are making record profits while severe poverty is creating problems, we have to ask whether something can be done to redistribute wealth in a better way. The Scandinavian example has shown us that a better distribution of wealth benefits everyone in the end. Solidarity generates economic growth. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563580">Madam Speaker, the federal government's 2024-25 budget included an important reform to the taxation of capital gains. Changing the way we tax capital gains is something that has been called for by progressive voices in this country for decades. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563581">Capital gains occur when an asset is sold for more than it costs to acquire and maintain. However, there are a number of very important exceptions to this rule, including Canadians' principal residences and other types of assets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563582">Capital gains are generally heavily concentrated among high-income Canadians, more so than any other form of income. Making matters worse, they benefit from lucrative tax preferences. Until this year and this change, recipients only had to declare half their capital gains on their income tax, which is the so-called inclusion rate of 50%, and the other half was entirely tax-free. Therefore, if a person bought an asset for half a million dollars and sold it for a million dollars, half of that $500,000 profit was completely tax-free. This could be a second home, a building or stocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563583">In contrast, other forms of income, such as wages and salaries, must be fully reported on a tax return. I think Canadians are well aware of that. In other words, the inclusion rate for salaries and wages is 100%. Teachers, waitresses, firefighters, truck drivers, plumbers, office workers and cleaners have to declare and pay tax on 100% of their income, as does pretty much every person who goes to work every day and has a job. However, people who are trading stocks, selling secondary residences or selling large assets do not. They only have to declare half of their profit, and the other half goes in their pocket tax-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563584"> The federal budget announced a change in the capital gains inclusion rate. As of June 24 of this year, it rose to 66.7% for capital gains inclusion declared by corporations. This means that, instead of sheltering 50% of their profits, corporations can now only shelter one-third. However, they still get to shelter one-third of their profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563585">The inclusion rate for individuals remains at 50%, the way it has always been for many decades, for all capital gains under $250,000. It will be increased to 66.7% for any capital gains declared above $250,000 in a single year. In other words, half of the capital gains for an individual is still tax-free under $250,000, and a third of their capital gains above $250,000 is still tax-free. Therefore, the tax benefit to capital gains in this country is still lucrative, just modestly less so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563586"> Now, the number of individuals directly affected by this change is very small. Canada Revenue Agency data indicates that only about 0.1% of tax filers, which is about 40,000 people in this country, report over $250,000 of capital gains per year. The proportion of Canadians who would declare over $250,000 in capital gains in any year in their lives is also very small. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563587">While the number of Canadians significantly affected by this change is small, these Canadians are mighty. This reform, which has been advocated for many years by tax specialist and equality advocates, as I said, will primarily have an impact on the richest Canadians. They are very powerful, as are their allies and advisers in the financial sector. Therefore, this new policy is being aggressively resisted by an alliance of wealthy Canadians, financial advisers and Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563588">The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation> has promised to reverse these capital gains tax reforms, and he is trying to start a broader revolt against taxes in general and the public programs they pay for. The campaign against capital gains tax reform has relied on scare tactics and outright misinformation about who will be affected, how much extra they will pay and even why capital gains are taxed at all. In fact, the reason we are here tonight is that the Conservatives have decided to move a motion with some 360 recommendations. These were made to the finance committee before the last budget, the one that was introduced here in April. These come from recommendations that were made in February as a way to stall the introduction of a ways and means motion that would pave the way for these capital gains inclusion changes. That is why we are here tonight: The Conservatives are stalling tax fairness.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563589">New Democrats believe, as the Carter commission in the 1960s found, that a buck is a buck is a buck, and that is how taxes should work. It should not matter whether one gets their income in the form of a dividend or a capital gain, or through their hard work in a salary or wage; it should be taxed the same. That is the principle that came out of the royal commission in the 1960s.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563590"> However, the Conservatives are doing the bidding of the wealthiest people in this country, people who have capital gains over $250,000. They do not want that money to be taxed the same way that wages are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563608">I want to make it clear that, when I talk about Bill C-319 and age discrimination, this is something that I care a lot about. Perhaps there are people who do not know this about me, but before I became an MP, I worked for over two years at a community organization as a project manager responsible for raising awareness of elder abuse and intimidation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563609">I wanted to take my work on the issue of discrimination and prejudice against seniors even further. That is one of the reasons I decided to go into politics. I am not the only one who wanted to work on this issue. When I decided to go into politics, I gave it a lot of thought. I remember very well that, leading up to the 2019 election campaign, I was not the only one who wanted to do something to help seniors. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">Beloeil—Chambly</Affiliation>, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, wanted to bring this issue to the table in the House of Commons. While we were hoping that the Bloc Québécois would make a comeback in the House at the time, the Bloc leader already intended to bring the issue of seniors before the House, because he had noticed that the House had not talked about that issue for a long time. The House was not talking enough about seniors. Helping seniors is really part of the Bloc Québécois's DNA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563610">I also remember that, before I was asked to take on this campaign and bring the issue of seniors back to the forefront in the House of Commons, I worked as an assistant to a Bloc Québécois member from 2007 to 2011. I was in charge of constituent cases. I realized that the most frequent questions were about the guaranteed income supplement and the fact that it was not completely automatic and not easy for seniors to access. Bloc members were the ones who worked on this issue, determining how to make the GIS payment automatic, how to ensure that more of our eligible seniors would get it. Seniors were already on the Bloc's radar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563611">I took a break from politics and worked in the community. As I said, before I was elected, I worked with groups, round tables and seniors' groups. We were already talking about this discrimination against seniors back then. We were talking about how too many seniors are financially vulnerable. That topic was already being discussed. It is nothing new. We were talking about it before the Bloc Québécois came back with a vengeance in 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563612">I will briefly give some background. During the election campaign, the Liberals were already talking about increasing pensions by 10% for people aged 75 or over. I remember that we stood out early on in campaign debates because we were already arguing that creating two classes of seniors was wrong, that it was not done, and that we had to increase old age security, the universal program for everyone, starting at age 65. That is how the program operates. That is the base amount provided at retirement. This issue became the focus of the first questions we asked when the House returned in December 2019. Even then, we were asking the government about this legislation, about its plans to discriminate on the basis of age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563613">When we came back in early 2020, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> and I met with the Fédération de l'Âge d'Or du Québec, or FADOQ, at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal as part of our pre-budget meetings. One of FADOQ's demands was to increase old age security, but for all seniors, starting at age 65. FADOQ members had also heard rumours that the government was thinking of increasing pensions for people aged 75 and over. They were the ones who asked us to champion this demand, which was a priority for them. We made it a condition for passing budget 2020.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563614">We have made it a condition every time a budget has been tabled since the 32 Bloc Québécois members have been in the House, going back to 2019. We have made this issue a condition. Regardless of what my Conservative colleagues may think, it is also one of the reasons we did not support the government on budgetary matters. We voted against the budgets because we had set conditions. It was not just that one. We had also set conditions regarding funding for oil and gas companies. We set a lot of other conditions for various budgets over the years, but this one was always among them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563615">Then, the pandemic happened. Assistance was announced for everyone, except seniors. Even though they were isolated, they had to continue to pay their bills, and they, too, were affected by what was known as the COVID-19 tax, the additional fees that started being charged. Many companies had to start charging delivery fees. Seniors were affected by the pandemic too, but the government did not announce any assistance for them. We had to come back to the House. I remember those somewhat strange times at the beginning of the pandemic when we came back to Parliament. There were not very many of us here. However, we came back to ask the government to provide assistance for seniors, who had not received any help. It was good that the government helped families and businesses, but it forgot about seniors, and we had to come back to the House. In the end, what the government proposed at the time was to give seniors the much-touted one-time cheque for $300, or $500 in the case of those who were receiving the GIS. That was a partial win for seniors. They did not get as much assistance as everyone else, but at least they got something because we had come back to the House to talk about it. However, the fact remains that it was just a one-time cheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563616">Time went by and the pandemic wound down, but the government did not announce any other assistance measures for seniors. We raised the issue again and proposed increasing the OAS pension for all seniors aged 65 and up. In 2021, we once again included that in our list of conditions for supporting the budget. We then tabled a first petition in the House. What is interesting is that this is an intergenerational concern. It affects all generations. A young man in his 20s, Samuel Lévesque, had contacted me to say that he did not think this discrimination was fair. His grandparents had told him that their friends who were 75 and up were getting help, but that they were not. He understood the situation and he wondered what more he could do. He ended up starting a petition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563617">Then an election was called, but right before that, once again, one-time $500 cheques were sent out to people aged 75 and over. Although this should have made people happy, I received emails from seniors who said they felt used and exploited. They said that these were purely vote-seeking cheques and that this one-time assistance, which consisted of a single cheque, was not what they needed. What they needed was a complete overhaul of assistance measures for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563618">That is why we, once again, made this a key issue in the election campaign. We proposed that assistance be provided to all seniors who receive the pension starting at age 65. In early 2022, we dedicated an opposition day in the House to this issue. The Bloc Québécois used one of its opposition days to discuss this topic, to say that the government had to reconsider its plan to increase OAS only for people aged 75 and over. In the end, in the summer of 2022, only seniors aged 75 and over received the 10% increase. We did not let up. Another petition was launched calling on the government to correct this unacceptable inequity. In 2023, we even held a symposium in Granby, where people from across Quebec and civil society organizations came to share their thoughts. Once again, it became clear that the growing economic inequalities among seniors needed to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563619">Then, last year, we came up with Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>. It was introduced in March 2023, and the first hour of debate at second reading took place in May 2023. The last hour of second reading and the vote were held in the fall of 2023. I spent the entire month of August last year touring around. I went to Amqui, in the riding of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278406" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563620">I went to the riding of Beauport-Limoilou. I also went to meet the people of Thérèse-De Blainville and many others. Finally, we came back to the House after that tour motivated us to take action. The tour pushed us to move forward with this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563621">That was not the first time. To go back a bit, in 2021, I remember attending some of my colleagues' nomination meetings in the Abitibi‑Témiscamingue region. There were some seniors chatting around a coffee shop. It was nice. They came to meet me and we talked. They said that we absolutely needed to eliminate this age discrimination. We also need to start removing barriers seniors face when they want to stay in the workforce. These two considerations are reflected in Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563622">Last fall, we won a majority vote in the House. That is quite something. It was a majority vote in which I even managed to convince my Conservative colleagues that the extra 10% should also go to people aged 65 to 74. People who wanted to work should be able to earn a little more without having their guaranteed income supplement clawed back. So the bill had to increase from $5,000 to $6,500 the amount people could earn without having their GIS reduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563623">We had that majority vote and referred the bill to the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. I appeared at committee for an hour. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278672" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation>, who sat on the committee, questioned witnesses. Thanks to that hour of testimony I had with the witnesses and my colleague's work, which I would like to commend, we managed to get a unanimous report from the committee. Even government members recognized that this unacceptable inequity had to end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563624">I have given a bit of the background. I have talked about the bill. Third, just quickly, I would like to say that the sums requested for this initiative are neither exaggerated nor outrageous. We have presented a bill that is realistic and achievable. The famous figure of $16 billion over five years amounts to barely $3 billion a year. At that point, it is a question of political will. The money can be found. The government can give royal recommendation by the end of third reading and acknowledge that it has the money and is capable of investing in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563625">This is about fairness for seniors. This is about aging with dignity. This is a baseline amount. This is what seniors start their retirement with. This is the universal amount. It is unfair that there are two classes of seniors. It is unfair to classify them as “young old” and “old old”. It is not fair that these people are not on a level playing field when they retire. Of course, this is not going to solve everything. The Bloc Québécois would never claim that the bill before us is going to be a panacea and fix everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563626">We hear all kinds of things. For example, we have heard that some people may not need it. Keep in mind that this is the taxable portion. The GIS is not taxable, but the OAS is. It means that people who need it less will spend a little more in their local economy and pay a little more in income tax. It gives them a little extra help. While $80 a month will not make a huge difference, some people do need it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563627">We have to be careful. Fully 36% of seniors are living on the GIS and the OAS. That is nothing to sneeze at, and it would be wrong to say that every other senior has no need of the extra help. It is not true that people living above the poverty line, set at a meagre $22,000 a year, are able to grow old with dignity. When a person is just above that line, they fall into a grey area where they have to wonder what help is available to them to cope with inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563628">Another factor we have to keep in mind is that seniors live on fixed incomes. These people do not see their pensions increase at the same rate as salaries, so that is problematic. Salaries are increasing much faster than retirees' fixed incomes. I want to point out that I have been touring ridings, including Liberal ridings, for two summers now. Before I even got a chance to speak, people were telling me that they went to see their MP to send a clear message that having two classes of seniors was unacceptable. I even went to Chicoutimi, to the riding of a Conservative Party member. Regardless of which party represents the riding, when I went to meet with seniors' groups, there was unanimous support for this bill. More than that, groups across Canada are writing to thank the Bloc Québécois for speaking up for seniors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563629">I will wrap up by saying that perhaps what these people are asking for is recognition that they are a grey force. They are tired of all the prejudice and, above all, they are tired of being seen as an economic burden. They want to be recognized as the grey power that they are.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563634">Some say that the GIS is welfare for seniors. Personally, I do not like that, but it is a fact. Increasing the GIS helps only a few people. Those are not my words. Experts at the conference said that. We can make numbers say what we want, but there are some people who are just above the poverty line, who are not entitled to the GIS and who are not entitled to the 10% increase in OAS either because they are 67. The thing is, illness does not wait until 75, poverty does not wait until 75 and grocery bills cost the same whether we are 67 or 77.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563635">As I explained, we voted against this because of the demands we made of the government in the budgets. We are not against the guaranteed income supplement. We can give it more thought later, but for now the main problem is that there is a disparity in the base amount of the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563636">I invite the government to review this because unlike other programs the government tries to meddle in, OAS is its responsibility. It is one of the rare programs that is the federal government's responsibility. It is in charge of pensions, which fall under its jurisdiction.</ParaText>

As the leader of the Bloc Québécois made clear, there is no room for compromise on this issue. We are going to hammer home the message. We do not want half-measures. We want 10% for people aged 65 to 74. That is our specific request. There can be no compromise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563643">I would like to extend an invitation to everyone, including my Conservative colleagues. If the Liberals deny our request and insist on going against the will of their own members as expressed in committee, they will have some explaining to do during the election. They will have to say why they made this choice, despite repeated requests, despite pressure from organizations on the ground, despite what we have heard, despite the testimonials from citizens that have piled up over the years as we have repeatedly made this request, and as the government stubbornly refuses to give this 10% increase to people aged 65 to 74. The Liberals will have to bear the brunt of this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563655">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and talk about an issue facing seniors. I can tell the member that Liberal members of Parliament have been very supportive of seniors in Canada through the years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563656">When I was first elected to Parliament, one of my colleagues had conducted a white paper on seniors in regard to how we could move forward as a political party. A number of years ago, I was sitting not far from where the member for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> is sitting today, when Stephen Harper was in Davos and made the decision to increase the age of retirement from 65 to 67. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563657">To answer the question the hon. member has put to members of the Liberal caucus, I can assure her our response at the time was immediate. We understand and appreciate the retirement age of 65. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, when he was leader of the Liberal Party, made a very clear indication that we would restore the age of retirement back to 65. A number of months passed, and ultimately we were afforded the opportunity to form a government. One of the first actions of the Liberal government was to bring forward the change that reduced the age of retirement from 67 to 65. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563658">We are also very aware of the issue of poverty, of having a fixed income with limited resources, and how we could help seniors living in poverty. Another initiative the government took up was to try to lift seniors out of poverty, which it did by making a dramatic increase to the guaranteed income supplement, the GIS. I believe seniors were going to receive an increase somewhere between $800 and $950 per year. That initiative alone literally lifted thousands of seniors out of poverty, including hundreds from my own constituency. As I pointed out, members of the Bloc voted against it. That is why I posed the specific question in regard to the GIS and how the Bloc voted back then. I think it is a valid question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563659">How do we maximize tax dollars to support our seniors? I believe it was a good decision back then to dramatically increase the guaranteed income supplement, and the numbers clearly show that we were right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563660">The member asked about the age of retirement being 65. As I say, we reduced it from 67 back to 65, and then we also went to work negotiating with provinces to deal with the CPP. Those in the workforce contribute in a very significant way, as all members of society, whether they are working or not, will ultimately contribute. We put an emphasis on increasing the CPP. To do that, unlike the previous government, we had to work it through a number of the provinces and build the support to do so. We were successful in doing that. A lot more people will be retiring in the coming years, and they will have better retirement savings as a direct result of actions we took nine years ago. That is another initiative the government has taken.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563661">Going back to the fixed income issue, during the pandemic, as has been pointed out, there was a need to provide extra support for seniors. Liberal members of Parliament and others were hearing in their constituencies about the different types of benefits. We came out with all sorts of programs, but we came out with something separate and unique for seniors. We gave two amounts. One was for OAS and an additional amount was for seniors who were collecting GIS, in recognition of the issue of their finances. That was during the pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563662">Then the election followed and the Liberal Party of Canada made it very clear, which we heard through representations in many different forms, that as people age, they often require additional needs, such as medical assistance. They may be more fragile, on average, as they age. Their savings may dwindle over time or their ability to earn additional income might be diminished, so the Liberal Party of Canada made an election platform commitment to deal with the three specific factors I just raised. We said we would increase, for those 75 and over, the OAS by 10% because of what I just indicated. Canadians were very much aware of it. Seniors were aware of it. We won the election and fulfilled that election commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563663">There have been huge investments to support seniors. For the dental program, the first people who were eligible to receive the dental benefit were seniors, and seniors in all regions of the country took advantage of that program, as they should. That was the purpose of the program, contrary to what members opposite might say. One of the biggest factors in developing the dental program was seniors, but the pharmacare program was also important. When we think of diabetes and the costs related to it, seniors will benefit from that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563664">As a government, we have made tangible commitments to deal with long-term health care facilities, and we are working with different levels of government to improve those conditions. We have made investments in housing to both non-profit agencies and different levels of government. We have come up with enhanced financing for support programs such as the New Horizons for Seniors and other organizations that support seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563665">The bottom line is that, from day one until today and going forward, I can assure members of the Bloc, Canadians and others that the government is very much in tune with the needs of seniors, and we will continue to look at ways to support them. That is the way we started, and I can assure the members opposite that we will continue that going forward. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8563666">Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. Today I am here to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act. I have spoken on this issue in the past and appreciate the opportunity to do so again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563667">Our seniors deserve respect. Seniors have raised families, teaching their beliefs and values; founded businesses, employing people; taught and taken care of people; volunteered; built our country; and served our country, fighting for the freedoms we have today. Time and time again, I am told remarkable stories by seniors in Kelowna—Lake Country. There are few areas of life not touched positively by our seniors. It is clear that Kelowna—Lake Country, and really all of Canada, would not be the same without the hard work of seniors and all they have contributed over their lives and still do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563668">Seniors are mentors and leaders in our communities. That is why it is so unacceptable that seniors are facing the challenges they currently are. I have talked to many seniors who are very stressed and concerned. The cost of living has ballooned after nine years of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, causing seniors to struggle like never before just to pay for basic necessities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563669">Seniors in my community have reached out about how they are struggling to pay their heating bill. Many have sent me pictures of their heating bill, which includes the carbon tax. The minimum amount for the tax is set by the federal government, and the government is increasing it every year to be on track to increase it to 61¢ per litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563670">Local seniors have also commented on how GST is being charged on top of the home heating carbon tax, which is a tax on a tax. This is wrong. A resident, Grant, wrote to me about his heating bill and all the taxes. He said that he used $50.18 worth of gas, yet owed $316.65. He then went on to say that he has worked since he was 12 years old, non-stop, and has paid his fair share of taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563671">I have talked to retirees who have had to go back to work and who feel sad that they cannot spend as much time volunteering or cannot donate as much to their favourite charities as they used to. I hear from seniors who are afraid to walk around their own neighbourhood that they have lived in for many years due to crime and concerns over their safety. I have talked to many seniors who are worried about their adult children making their mortgage payment and about their grandchildren who will have a tough time ever owing their own home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563672">Seniors have reached out to me who were just about to retire, and because of the Liberal capital gains tax increases, they have told me they will have to work longer. Seniors who are looking to retire on modest savings are finding that this is no longer possible in Canada, especially with the new Liberal tax changes. It is untenable that seniors are finding themselves priced out of the country they have built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563673">Here is the situation of many seniors: They worked their whole life providing for their family and contributing to this country. They have contributed economically through their job and through creating businesses. They have raised a family and volunteered in their community. They have contributed by being a good citizen by following the rules. They have saved for their retirement. However, now the golden years for many have melted away. This is not the reality that seniors deserve, yet it is the one that many of them face due to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his partners in the NDP, the costly government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563674">Many seniors in my community struggle to make ends meet, and many are forced to choose between paying for necessities such as food and medication. One senior reached out to me and said that there is absolutely no hope for those on fixed and low income as they are being taxed to death, literally. The senior went on to say that every time they go to the grocery store, prices are going up. A senior couple from Kelowna—Lake Country reached out to me to say that living on their pensions is becoming harder and harder all the time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563675">This is a result of the reckless, inflationary spending of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who is propped up by his partners in the NDP and, now, apparently also the Bloc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563676">Liberal policies have led to record inflation, with millions of Canadians now struggling to simply keep their heads above water. The standard of living continues to drop in Canada, which has experienced the worst decline in per-person income out of all the G7 countries over the last five years. Seniors on a fixed income are uniquely at risk from inflation, as fixed incomes are unable to keep up with the cost of living, which keeps growing because of all the increased spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563677">It is not just in my own community that seniors are struggling, but across Canada. According to the Salvation Army, 75% of Canadians currently face challenges managing limited financial resources. Moreover, 25% of Canadians continue to be extremely concerned about having enough income to cover their basic needs, such as food and shelter. Not all seniors have paid off their mortgages, and this has led to even more stresses. The Bank of Canada recently confirmed that Canadians will see a steep jump in payments as millions of Canadians renew their mortgages over the next two years. This is just one more area in which seniors, especially those on fixed incomes, are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563678">This legislation provides equity for all seniors, ensuring that old age security is available to those between 65 and 74 years old. Seniors aged 65 to 74 should not be treated differently than seniors 75 or older, something that has occurred under the Liberal government. As such, Conservatives support this measure as part of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563679">The legislation also serves to safeguard seniors from potential clawbacks within the guaranteed income supplement. It seeks to increase the exemption amount for employment income that is taken into account for eligibility. Increasing the GIS earnings exemption would minimize some of the clawbacks seniors may experience. Seniors should be able to continue to work or go back to work, if they choose to and are able to, without the loss of federal retirement GIS. Especially considering that rising inflation has had a disproportionate impact on seniors, they should not be penalized for working if they choose to and want to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563680">To be clear, however, I must say that the legislation will not fix the cost of living crisis or the devastating situation caused by the Liberal government. Conservatives will continue to focus on fixing the budget to get the government spending under control, as well as axing the tax and stopping the tax increases during this unprecedented cost of living crisis, which has affected seniors in my community and communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563681">In stopping the broken policies of the Liberals, along with their NDP and Bloc partners, common-sense Conservatives will bring back the promise of Canada: If one works hard, one should be able to get ahead and live and retire in a safe community.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Mr. Gord Johns (Courtenay—Alberni, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8563682">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act. I want to thank the sponsor, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> for moving this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563683">The bill before us today is about increasing old age security by 10% for those who are between the ages of 65 and 74. These people were initially excluded by the Liberal government when the government decided to increase the OAS for seniors. The government decided to create a two-tiered system of seniors, those who were over 75 and those who were under 75. Those aged between 65 and 74 were going to be penalized and not get the increase. This is similar to what the Conservatives did when they raised the retirement age from 65 to 67. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563684">We are seeing a pattern of both Liberals and Conservatives wanting seniors to work longer, and this was no different. Seniors deserve better. Many seniors across the country do not have the resources to deal with the high cost of housing and the increase in inflation, especially those who are on fixed incomes. They are the ones bearing the brunt of this. I would argue that seniors and people living with disabilities are feeling the pinch the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563685">Increasing the exemption for income from employment or self-employment is also important in the calculation of the guaranteed income supplement, from $5,000 to $6,500, which is also incorporated into this bill. We want to make sure seniors who do wish to participate in the workforce are not being penalized. We know we need to do more, which is why the NDP put forward a dental care plan and a plan for pharmacare, so seniors are not making the choice of whether they are going to buy food or take the medicine they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563686">We are going to continue to work on ideas to help lift seniors out of poverty and ensure they have the best retirement possible, and a retirement with dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563687">In 2021, when the Liberals brought in the 10% bonus for seniors 75 and over, they decided to leave some seniors out, and they created those two categories I discussed earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563688">I am hoping we can move this bill forward quickly. This is a minority Parliament. To make this minority Parliament work, this is clearly a really important aspect of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563689">I also want to speak about the cost of this. I have raised this in the House of Commons many times since the Liberals brought in this two-tiered benefit for seniors and neglected those who were over 65 and under 74. I have raised this also at the government operations committee, where I have asked the former president of the Treasury Board and the current <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> to re-examine this. I helped her break down the numbers, because we know that she knows we have the lowest corporate taxes in the G7. That was something the Harper government did. It did not do that for small business. It lowered corporate taxes by 5%. We have seen corporate taxes drop from 28% to 15%, from the Chrétien era to today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563690">The Liberals have maintained that low corporate tax rate while oil and gas, big grocery and big banks have had record profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563691">The Liberals have also failed to tackle the issue around tax havens. The Parliamentary Budget Officer, in 2019, calculated that between $21 billion and $26 billion a year was being lost to tax havens. The ultrarich get these tax benefits, but seniors who are trying to retire with dignity are being targeted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563692">In 2021, it was projected that $31 billion was leaking from the Canadian economy so the ultrarich and CEOs could get off the hook again while seniors struggled to make ends meet. What did the government do? It hired more people at CRA, but the people at CRA are focusing on small business people, on people struggling to make ends meet and seniors. Seniors in my riding have come to me and told me that the government is coming after them for small amounts of money, when in fact the government could have hired auditors at CRA to target those who are manoeuvring around the tax system to benefit themselves, the super rich and these big corporations. Instead, the government is focused on everyday people, and that needs to change.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563693">This is an excellent bill and an excellent start. I have some ideas on how we can cover it because it is projected to cost $3 billion. Back in 2015, the PBO projected that a 1% increase in corporate tax would be about $2.6 billion. I would argue that that would be around the same amount today. Therefore, a 1% increase in corporate tax would cover the costs of taking care of our seniors. What will the government do? We know the Liberals and the Conservatives. They are always going to be there for the big corporations and their friends and are not going to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563694">The NDP was able to apply pressure to increase the excess profit tax on the big banks. That was a 15% tax on profits of over a billion dollars. That generated billions of dollars, that windfall tax. The PBO did an analysis of the government applying that tax to big oil and gas, which would generate a profit of $4.2 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563695">We know that Conservatives in the U.K. charge an excess profit tax, a windfall tax, on oil and gas. We cannot even get the Liberals to do that in Canada. The oil oligarchy here is always arguing in the House of Commons about who can build more pipelines between the two of them. I can tell members that they are both good at building pipelines, but they are not good at tackling climate change. They are also not good at taking care of seniors. We know that right across the country. We are seeing that constantly. Therefore, I urge the government to look at an excess profit tax, at closing tax loopholes for the super-rich and for tax havens, and at possibly increasing the corporate tax rate. It should not be like this for seniors.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278672" Type="2">Ms. Louise Chabot (Thérèse-De Blainville, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8563706">Madam Speaker, with the little time I have, my first words will be for my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>. I am proud of her, just as I am proud to be a member of the Bloc Québécois, which has been calling for fairness for seniors since 2019. The main takeaway from Bill <Document DbId="11437666" Type="4">C‑319</Document> is that it is about two things: fairness and dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563707">Why is it about fairness? My colleagues have talked about this. Old age security is a universal plan that applies to people aged 65 and over and falls under federal jurisdiction. By discriminating, as the government has done, on the basis of age—that is, by increasing the pension for those aged 75 and over—it has turned its back on people aged 65 to 74, even though they are part of the universal program. This is an infringement. In labour relations, we would call this an “orphan clause” or a clause that discriminates on the basis of age. That would be unacceptable, yet that is what the government did. The government can correct this inequity. This is an infringement that needs to be corrected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563708">We heard from witnesses in committee. We are talking about millions of people who are affected and what we need to keep in mind is that 30% to 40% of them live only from old age pensions. I will give an example. When it comes to the Fédération de l'âge d'or du Québec, or FADOQ, and the Association québécoise de défense des droits des personnes retraitées et préretraitées, or AQDR, half their members, including 39% of Quebeckers, live on an income of roughly $21,000 or $22,000. That is what they get from OAS and GIS. It is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563709">It is true that seniors groups are not homogenous, but there is no more homogeneity among seniors 65 to 74 than there is among those 75 and up. We need something universal. People who retire at 65 need an equal and fair OAS increase. Not increasing it is totally unacceptable. That is why we are calling on the Liberal government to correct this injustice, to work on giving seniors dignity. We had support in committee and we will have support in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563710">We are being told it will cost $3 billion, but is that an expense or an investment? When people are left in a vulnerable or precarious situation, their whole standard of living is negatively affected. Financial insecurity is a form of isolation. One witness told us that a person who earns $21,000, $22,000 or $23,000 will come up with excuses not to go when they get invited to the movies because they do not have any discretionary income. That is the situation. If we want people between the ages of 65 and 74 to be healthy, then we need to make sure that they have a decent quality of life, which will also help them when they are aged 75 and over. As the Conservatives would say, that is common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563711">The Government of Canada does not have very many social programs. Employment insurance and old age security were created to protect vulnerable people. In committee, I heard government members saying that seniors aged 65 to 74 do not need this assistance. There is something really shameful about comments like that. This could make a big difference for people who are living on a fixed income, given the cost of housing, groceries and health care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8563712">We cannot forget about women. A majority of these people live alone and are women. It is no coincidence that those over the age of 65, our generation, are in this situation. Often, women have chosen to stay at home. They have had odd jobs. They did not contribute much to the Quebec Pension Plan, or QPP, or could not afford a private pension plan. Maybe there was no group plan. Essentially, the system has made their situation even more precarious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563713">The AQDR rightly reminded us that in 1927, when old age security was introduced, it was seen as a major step forward. We were seen as an example. Now, we rank 13th among OECD countries in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563714">Increasing the baseline level of OAS—we are not talking about the GIS here—from the age of 65 will permanently benefit these people who have contributed so much to society.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563717"> Madam Speaker, tonight, I have a chance to revisit an exchange I had in question period at the end of May. Sadly, it was an exchange about the economy. Things have not gotten any better since May here in Canada, and we find ourselves dealing with a continuing economic crisis brought on by the policies of the Liberal government following, of course, the failed Trudeau economic plan of the seventies and eighties. Now, in successive Liberal governments led by that family, we have run 24 deficits in 25 years and had a constant stream of crises: housing crises, energy crises, unity crises and the like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563718">My question back then was about how the most incompetent, reckless government in Canadian history was undertaking radical experiments with objectively terrible results. Of course, it has been supported by the NDP and now the Bloc. Back then I referenced an RBC report that talked about “a slow bleed over the last 2 years [that] left per-capita output back at 2016 levels”, and I asked about that falling per-person income in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563719">The response from the <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> at the time was kind of interesting. He did not defend the government, talk about the successes that the government had or refute any of my claims. He took issue with the fact that I would use GDP per capita, or growth per capita, as a measure. He said it was “not a particularly useful one, as most economists will say.” Therefore, I did a bit of digging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563720">This was not very hard, actually, to find on the Statistics Canada website, so I am not sure whether the Liberal government is anti-Statistics Canada right now. However, this year, Statistics Canada had this to say: “Slower economic growth over the past year and near-record population increases fuelled by temporary and permanent immigration have put the spotlight on recent trends in Canada’s gross domestic product...per capita.” It went on to say, “Recent reports...have all stressed the trend towards weaker per capita growth, highlighting its negative implications for living standards and wage growth.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563721">This Statistics Canada document quotes information that the <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, on behalf of the government, says is not credible or supported by economists. A little later in the same document, Statistics Canada said, “GDP per capita is widely used to gauge differences in living standards across countries. Higher levels of per capita output are generally found in more developed economies with advanced infrastructure, better health care and education systems, and higher levels of access to technologies and innovation.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563722">As such, whichever parliamentary secretary is going to answer the question today, I would like them to correct the record if they could or clarify the Liberal position on whether rapidly declining GDP per capita is bad. My assertion is that it is bad for Canada. The <Affiliation DbId="311618" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> said it was not necessarily bad. More importantly, I want to hear something about a plan. We have four minutes right now; I hope we will hear something about a plan, moving forward, to reverse the economic devastation being inflicted on our country by the Liberal, NDP and now Bloc coalition.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563723">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for this opportunity to defend our government's responsible economic plan, which has left Canada in an enviable fiscal position. Let me begin by stating some facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563724"> Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is well below that of our G7 peers, and we are one of only two G7 countries rated AAA by at least two of the three major global rating agencies. This has been achieved through our government's responsible economic plan. It has enabled proactive investments to support Canadians and Canada's long-term prosperity, which will have a direct and lasting impact for future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563725">In budget 2024, we provided an economic plan that makes generational investments by raising revenues through an increased capital gains inclusion rate. This will make life cost less for Canadians while making our tax system fairer for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563726">Transformative investments in clean energy, in opportunities for workers, in innovation and to improve housing affordability will support a business environment that gives investors confidence that Canada's workforce is ready for more opportunities. This will enable our economy to attract more investment and will create more jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563727"> Budget 2024 also supports fairness for every generation by sticking to the fiscal objectives laid out in the fall economic statement, setting deficits and the federal debt burden on a downward track. Moving forward, we are committed to keeping deficits below 1% of GDP beginning in 2026-27 and in future years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8563728">Since the April budget, Canada's economic indicators have also remained positive. Canada was the first G7 country to lower its interest rates and to do so three times. This is good news for homeowners with mortgages up for renewal, as well as for first-time homebuyers. It is also good for businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563729">Canada's inflation rate dropped to 2% in August, marking eight consecutive months of decline and the lowest inflation rate since February 2021. In addition, Canadian workers are earning more on average than they were before the pandemic, even after accounting for inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563730">Overall, the Canadian economy, under our government's leadership, is strong and resilient. For Canadians, this means more jobs and better wages. Our government's fiscally responsible economic plan is delivering an economy that works for everyone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563731"> Madam Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary talked about the enviable position we have in Canada. She touted good news for property owners renewing their mortgages. However, because of the policies of the Liberal government, a Canadian renewing, say, a five-year fixed-term mortgage in September today versus someone who had a mortgage in September 2019 could be paying between $500 and $1,000 more in monthly mortgage payments for the same house. That is for an average house in Canada, depending on where someone lives. I do not know that this is good news for anybody, and it is in a context of record food bank usage and unemployment that is 1% higher than it was five years ago at the same time. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8563737">Madam Speaker, on April 29, 2024, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> to explain to Canadians why an individual convicted five times of criminal charges facing a deportation order upheld by a Federal Court managed to get ministerial intervention to stop his removal. Ministerial interventions are for serious, extreme circumstances, often life-and-death situations. I asked the minister if it was his intention to make a mockery of our legal and immigration systems, or if his intervention was guided by a political calculation to get more votes for his party. Regrettably, the minister responded by stating that these are not matters that we talk about publicly, much less on the floor of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563738">Given the total mess of the immigration system under the government's watch, I do not blame the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> for not wanting to talk about it. For the record, the minister was not asked to divulge protected, private information. I was asking him why he personally intervened in such a clear case of deportation, as it was upheld by his own department and the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563739"> It is worth giving the background on this case as there are important questions that any reasonable Canadian would ask as to why that particular deportation was not carried out. First and foremost, why did a five-time convicted person receive preferential treatment? What warranted special consideration by the minister to personally overrule not only his own department but also the Federal Court?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563740"> I have constituents who have been waiting almost three years for family sponsorship and others with loved ones who have been waiting over a year for visitor visas, but a person with five convictions who blocked the building of national pipeline infrastructure, someone who was sentenced to two weeks of imprisonment for criminal contempt of court, who has also served time for blocking the main road to Vancouver's international airport warranted the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s special attention and his personal intervention. Is there something Canadians do not know about that person which made him so special to the minister that he was willing to throw out the rule of law and the integrity of our immigration system?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563741">At a time when Canada is still struggling to deal with the full scope of foreign interference in our country, the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4"> minister</Affiliation> personally intervened to stop the deportation of a five-time convicted person who boasted about having $170,000 U.S. in foreign money to fund illegal blockades of roads, bridges and highways in B.C.'s Lower Mainland. At a time when the immigration system is leaking like a sieve, where literal terrorists are being granted citizenship after taking part in ISIS terror videos dismembering the bodies of people who were murdered, that was what the minister thought deserved his intervention. What was the criteria? Thousands upon thousands of applicants would love to know. Is there a new Liberal two-tier immigration policy? Does the new Liberal policy have a limit on how many criminal convictions is too many? Clearly, five criminal convictions were not a problem for the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563742"> It is no wonder that the government has been such a doormat for foreign interference when people who boast about being foreign funded as they block key roads, bridges and other infrastructure are saved from deportation. Therefore, I am going to ask my question again. Now that the <Affiliation DbId="311647" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> understands what I am asking, was the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s intervention intended to make a mockery of our legal and immigration systems or was his intervention politically motivated to get a few more votes?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563743"> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for raising this important issue. In general, applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Decisions are made by highly trained officers who carefully and systematically assess each application against the criteria set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or IRPA, and its regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563744">IRPA sets out the core principles and concepts that govern Canada's immigration and refugee protection program, including provisions relating to refugees, sponsorships and removals, detention reviews and admissibility hearings, and the jurisdiction and powers of tribunals. A decision to remove someone from Canada is not taken lightly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563745">I would like to add that IRPA authorizes designated officers to issue temporary resident permits, or TRPs, to inadmissible foreign nationals when it is justified in certain circumstances. A TRP allows the holder either to enter Canada or to remain in Canada during the validity period of the TRP. A TRP provides the foreign national temporary resident status in Canada. If the TRP is valid for at least six months, the foreign national may apply for a work or study permit. Upon cancellation or expiration of the TRP, the foreign national must leave Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563746">TRPs allow officers to balance the objectives of the IRPA to meet Canada's social, humanitarian and economic commitments while maintaining the health and security of Canadians. Clear records of decisions allow for the monitoring and research necessary for the preparation of the annual report to Parliament. The number of TRPs issued is included in the annual report, and they are categorized according to the grounds of inadmissibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563747">I would like to point out that, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a foreign national who, in the opinion of an officer, is inadmissible or does not meet the requirement of this act becomes a temporary resident if an officer is of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances and issues a temporary resident permit, which may be cancelled at any time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563748">The <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship</Affiliation> is authorized by legislation to exempt foreign nationals, including those who may be under a deportation order, from any applicable criteria or obligation of the act, where he deems it is justified on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The minister takes this authority very seriously, as well as his responsibility as minister to ensure that he is executing his duties in a fair and objective manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563749">Due to privacy reasons, I will not speak on any individual cases. However, I assure members that he assesses each case brought to his attention to ensure that he exercises his authority in the best interest of Canada, Canadians and the people who use our immigration system.

That is more people than we lost in World War II, yet we are not seeing a war-type effort to save lives in this country and to fight this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563757">We have heard from the experts: the First Nations Health Authority; the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police; the chief medical health officers of both British Columbia and Ontario; the chief coroners of Alberta, B.C. and Ontario, the provinces where the highest number of deaths are happening; the Canadian Expert Task Force on Substance Use, which was made up of a wide spectrum, including law enforcement; Moms Stop The Harm; and the Canadian Mental Health Association. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563758">They have been consistent and unanimous in saying we need to stop criminalizing people who use substances; we need to replace the toxic street supply with a safer supply of drug replacement therapy; we need to have treatment on demand, no-wait treatment and no-wait stabilization beds, so when people want help, they get help; and we need to invest heavily in recovery and prevention focused on our youth and, of course, in enforcement, so law enforcement can go after the manufacturers of the substances and those trafficking, especially those at the high levels. Most importantly, all of them have said we need to treat this crisis like the emergency it is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563759">The government has spent less than 1% responding to this crisis than it did on COVID-19. Why? It is because of stigma. We know who is dying. It is mainly men. Those living in my home province are 5.9 times more likely to die if they are first nations; in Alberta, it is eight times higher. The Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in my riding, just declared a state of emergency. It is losing so many members. The Ahousaht First Nation has lost over 100 members because of the mental health and substance use crisis just in the last few years. I know many of them. It is very painful to see what is happening. Also, the big-city mayors have been calling for help. They are saying that not enough resources are being applied to respond to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563760">We have seen countries do this. Portugal saw a 77% drop in chronic daily users because it got the politicians out of the way. That is what we need to do. We need to support the experts with evidence-based policy and provide the resources. The government put forward its drug strategy, and it is great. It uses the same language we see in Portugal, a compassionate, coordinated, integrated plan, but guess what it is missing. There is no timeline, and there are no resources, regarding how it is going to respond to the crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563761">The government had an auto theft summit. I am not saying that is not an important issue, but it has still not had a summit on the toxic drug crisis. In the substance use assistance program on Vancouver Island, only one riding, Victoria, got funding. Everybody else was shut out. There are first nations that needed that money. Greater Waterloo region, as my colleague was saying, got nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563762">We need action. We need the government to treat this with the war effort that it requires. Nobody is not feeling this right now. No community is being left. This is what I would call an emergency, and the government is not treating it like that. </ParaText>

We are committed to examining all tools at our disposal, and evidence, to respond to the tragic increase in overdoses and to help save lives, while supporting a balance between public health and public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563765">We know that a comprehensive approach is needed to address the crisis. This includes efforts across the continuum of care to prevent drug use, reduce harms and support people in accessing treatment and recovery services, as well as enforcement efforts to maintain public safety. It also includes ensuring that people have access to critical supports such as housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563766">The government of Canada has invested almost $200 billion over 10 years to support provinces and territories to deliver services, in addition to the $1 billion we have directly invested to address the crisis. Regarding the member's question, the minister has been clear: Officials are working to reconstitute the expert task force so our response can be driven by evidence, not by ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563767">The government remains committed to addressing substance use and addiction as a health issue and not a criminal one. People struggling with addiction are not criminals. They need health care, not to be in jail. We changed the legislation and issued guidance to make sure that in cases of simple possession, police and prosecutors must now consider referring the person to health and social services, issuing a warning or taking no further action. As a result, they can consider both public health and public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563768">We know that we cannot act alone. All partners must work together to make health and social services available and accessible so people can be diverted from the criminal justice system into health care. As with any policy, these efforts must be made with a comprehensive plan for implementation. An exemption can be one piece of the puzzle, but we know that the changes need to be complemented by a range of other actions to have their intended impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8563769">We will continue working in partnership with all provinces, territories, municipalities, indigenous communities and experts to determine the best ways to support the health and well-being of people who use substances. We remain committed to taking a public health approach to the crisis and keeping everyone in our communities safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8563771">The Liberals have spent less than 1% of what they did during COVID in responding to the crisis. They keep saying jurisdiction is a barrier, but they found a way through it during COVID. They need to listen to local communities and indigenous peoples on how to work through it. We need to get politicians out of the way. Let experts lead with evidence-based policy. We need to debunk and fight back against the Conservative disinformation, and the Liberals need to stop the incrementalism.</ParaText>
