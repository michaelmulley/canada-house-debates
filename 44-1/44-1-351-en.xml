              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Motion for concurrence</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="8597364">Mr. Speaker, I move that the 11th report of the the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities presented to the House on Tuesday, April 25, 2023, be concurred in.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597365">I am rising in the House today because I want us to debate the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities on the impact of commercial shipping on shoreline erosion. I am rising today to talk about this issue because this report was tabled in the House about a year and a half ago, on April 25, 2023, and nothing has happened since. It has been radio silence. It is as though the committee never even wrote a report. Yes, there was a response from the government, and I will come back to that. However, people are still dealing with the same problem. Our shorelines are continuing to erode, and the government has not acknowledged that nor has it taken any further action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597366">The committee tabled a report in the House, but the response that it got was unsatisfactory, because nothing has been done. I figured that, if the House were to concur in this report, then we would be sending an even stronger message to the government that it is time to take action and consider the reality that people are facing on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597367">I will therefore provide a brief history of events because, despite the government's failure to follow up on this report, the people on the ground continue to deal with erosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597368">Why is reference made more specifically to erosion caused by commercial shipping? In the 1950s, the St. Lawrence Seaway was built to enable larger vessels to reach the Port of Montreal. As we know, ships have only gotten larger and they carry even more containers, petroleum and cargo. This is the way international shipping achieves economies of scale. Because the seaway was built to allow larger ships to pass through, the St. Lawrence River is no longer in its natural state. It is not the same river as it was 100 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597369">Needless to say, bigger ships cause bigger waves, and the wake from passing vessels causes erosion, which little by little eats up people's land each year, so people started to protest a little. Although people could agree that increased river freight traffic creating economies of scale would boost the economy and be in the interest of regular folks who purchase these goods, there were negative consequences for some. Having recognized this in the 1960s and 1970s, the government set about building structures to protect against shoreline erosion caused by commercial shipping.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597370">In the 1990s, as we know, the Liberals began making cuts everywhere. Wherever they could, they made cuts, cuts and more cuts. Among these cuts, the Liberal government of the day officially did away with the shoreline protection program in 1997, which means that for over 25 years now, the St. Lawrence shoreline has been completely neglected. Most of the structures built in the 1960s and 1970s are now over 50 years old. They have fallen into disrepair and are no longer effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597371">In unprotected areas, erosion continues. In areas that have some protection, the structures are crumbling and are increasingly ineffective, if they even remain at all. In the 1990s and even before that, the government wrote a letter to shoreline residents, abdicating its responsibility. It told these residents that the protection structures it had built no longer came under its responsibility, and that henceforth it would be up to them to maintain their land, because the government would no longer be doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597372">That is a bit odd given that it is the federal government that manages the waterway. It was the federal government that expanded the St. Lawrence River to allow boats to pass through. It is the federal government that regulates the St. Lawrence River and waterways in general. However, citizens are the ones who have to foot the bill. That is a bit of a problem. There are huge economic benefits to transporting goods on the St. Lawrence River. Between these efforts and this report being produced, no one, not even the citizens affected by this situation, are asking that boats no longer be allowed on the river. That is not the idea. The idea is that there are people who suffer the consequences, and they should be protected and compensated. They should not have to face the repercussions this transport has on their private property all by themselves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597373">The government acknowledged responsibility for changing the river, which is no longer in its natural state. The ships using the waterway are getting bigger and bigger, and they are affecting the shoreline. Even so, the government avoided taking responsibility and told the public that it wanted to save money by making them pay. The thing is, government scientists did not necessarily agree with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597374">Two scientists who worked at Environment and Climate Change Canada—federal government scientists—conducted a study in the 2000s. They studied 1,600 kilometres of shoreline from Cornwall, Ontario, to Montmagny, in the Lower St. Lawrence. They studied 1,600 kilometres of shoreline, which is a lot. They found that 70% of all the erosion between Cornwall and Montmagny occurred between Montreal and Sorel-Tracy. Worse still, 86% of erosion attributable to commercial ships occurred there as well. In other words, controlling for other factors, such as tides and winds, scientists found that 86% of all erosion caused by commercial shipping occurred between Montreal and Lake Saint-Pierre. That is serious. That is a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597375">What is the explanation for this? It is fairly straightforward. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the river is wide. There is plenty of room. Ships can navigate without any problems or impact. However, approaching Montreal, the river gets narrower and shallower. Even though the river is narrower and there is less room to navigate, the ship does not get any smaller. It stays the same size. The ship's impact is far greater in places where the corridor is narrow than in places where it is wide and waves have time to subside before reaching the shoreline. In certain areas, the effect of the waves could even be said to be marginal, since there are so many other factors that have a far greater impact than vessel traffic. For the area between Montreal and Lake Saint‑Pierre, however, the scientists' research and data are clear. The main erosion factor between Montreal and Sorel‑Tracy is commercial shipping. That is significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597376">This is the exact area where my riding is. The people of Verchères, Varennes and Contrecœur suffer the consequences of this problem on a daily basis. They live with this all the time, and it is stressful for them. We conducted a survey, which some members of the public worked on as well, and it found that half of shoreline property owners in and around Verchères, Varennes and Contrecœur are seeing serious erosion problems. This issue is affecting hundreds of people and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. For these people, the stress is not only psychological but financial as well. As the protective infrastructure crumbles, it is taking land with it. Sometimes bits of land fall into the water, so people are afraid to walk along the edge of their property because the river might swallow it up. Holes are appearing all over their land. Some people even worry that their house will fall into the river. That is how bad the erosion is. Despite all of that, they are the ones who would have to pay for a fix. That does not sit well with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597377">I was elected in 2015, but we really got down to work on this issue in 2017. Seven municipalities sent us resolutions calling on the federal government to acknowledge the situation and reinstate a shoreline protection program. We received support from the cities of Varennes, Verchères, Contrecœur, Sorel-Tracy, Lavaltrie, Lanoraie, and Repentigny. All of these cities took a stand and insisted that the issue was important and urgent, that a problem existed locally, and that the program had to be reinstated. The letter was sent to Mr. Garneau, but despite media coverage, he simply never answered it. My constituents were pleased to see their MP taking charge of the issue, and these events whetted their appetite, leading them to wonder whether he could help them even more, so a short time later, in 2018, I wanted to find out where things stood. I decided to hold a town hall meeting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597378">We rented a hall in Verchères and it was filled to capacity, with no seats to spare. Over 150 people showed up and there were no empty chairs in sight. It was standing room only. Everyone agreed that this problem had to be solved. It is not a problem that I made up. When rooms are full to overflowing and people come together to support a cause, it is because they have problems that they want solved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597379">We therefore presented a petition to the House of Commons and formed a citizens' group that exists to this day. The group is working hard to raise public awareness of this issue. Our petition netted 2,300 signatures. When it was tabled in the House, we held a press conference. We were accompanied by elected officials, mayors and various groups.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597380">The then transport minister, Marc Garneau, did not even respond to the petition. The House's rules state that the government has 45 days from the tabling of the petition to respond, but the minister never responded. I wrote to the Speaker of the House, but Mr. Garneau got off scot-free. The Speaker did not reprimand him because an election had been called, meaning that the minister was no longer required to respond to the petition. It was dead and buried.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597381">The election took place. Unfortunately for the Liberals, I was re-elected. The same minister was re-elected as well. This forced us to table another petition in February 2020. We also filed a notice of a motion in 2020 at the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, calling for a study to be conducted on shoreline erosion, for the committee to hear witnesses and for people to be allowed to come talk about what they were experiencing. This time, we did hear back from the transport minister. It certainly took some time. Basically, he said that erosion was caused by several natural factors and that he was aware of the problem and was working hard on it. He never really saw the light, so to speak. We were told that they were aware of the problem but that they would not be doing anything more about it, that it was not caused solely by ships but by other factors as well. That is what they said, despite the scientific data I spoke of earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597382">By 2021, residents had had enough. They were really unhappy. They launched a $50‑million class action suit against the government, authorized by the Quebec Superior Court. When citizens take their government to court, things must be really serious. In February 2022, my motion for a proposed study was adopted by the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. In the fall of 2022, we heard from witnesses, and they were unanimous. The experts, scientists, residents, cities and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative all agreed. It was not just experts from Quebec, by the way. The consensus included experts from Ontario as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597383">Everyone agreed that it was Ottawa's responsibility to take care of this and to compensate people and protect them from damage, especially in areas where the erosion is mainly caused by shipping due to the channel being narrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597384">In the spring of 2023, the committee's report was tabled in the House. Not only did all the witnesses who appeared before the committee agree unanimously, but all the parties seated around the table also agreed unanimously. The Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities produced a unanimous report. I was pleased. I was really excited. I thought we had reached the goal and that Ottawa would finally get it. I thought the unanimous committee report would make something happen. Everyone was in agreement. This is not about partisan politics. These are facts, and it is about being sensitive to what people are going through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597385">There were six recommendations in the report. They were all very good, but I want to focus on one recommendation in particular. It is the most important one and reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597386">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the Government of Canada re-establish a shoreline protection program in areas of the St. Lawrence River where erosion is due in large part to shipping, in particular where the channel is narrow and more exposed to wake, in conjunction with provincial and municipal governments, Indigenous groups, industry and scientific experts.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597387">It was the government that wanted to add that last part, after “wake”, but we can live with that. We have no problem working with other groups. What is important is that the federal government take the lead, since it has a responsibility to do so. That is what the motion said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597388">The report contains five other recommendations that are all very interesting. I will read them quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597389"> The second and third recommendations state, “That the Government of Canada continue to invest in research that focusses on providing technical guidance to help assess best solutions to shoreline erosion” and “That the Government of Canada draw up an inventory of the areas affected by erosion along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Waterway”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597390">The fourth recommendation says, “That the Government of Canada support research aimed at finding the most appropriate way to protect the banks and to protect their ecosystems from damage caused by vessel traffic.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597391">The fifth recommendation says, “That the Government of Canada evaluate the effectiveness of current voluntary speed reduction measures for commercial vessels and consider applying them on a larger scale through formal regulations.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597392">The sixth recommendation says, “That the Government of Canada explore the possibility of setting up a fund for the restoration and enhancement of riparian environments affected by erosion that would be financed by the commercial users of the river corridor.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597393">Those are the committee's six recommendations and, as I said, the report was adopted unanimously.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597394">What was the government's response? The government basically said that it was taking the six recommendations under advisement and would be getting back to us about what it was already doing. Which means it was thanking us for our work, it would not be listening to us and it was already taking action. What is it doing? There are some research projects here and there, and there has been a voluntary reduction in ship speed. Meanwhile, the people on the ground still have to contend with the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597395">The sad part is that things never change. People have been fighting this since the program was abolished, of course, but as far as I am concerned, I started in 2017, which means we have been fighting this battle for nearly eight or nine years and telling the government to listen to these people who have been living with a problem that the government itself recognized at the time. Why is it no longer able to recognize it now? Its reasons are shortsighted. It wants to save some money and pinch pennies at a time when people are in financial distress because it would cost them a fortune to repair their land. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars per landowner. It is unconscionable to expect a handful of people to bear the brunt of this entire problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597396">They tell us the same thing all the time: The erosion is caused by multiple factors, they are working hard, it is a shared responsibility and so on. I am fine with the part about shared responsibility, but most of the problem is due to shipping, which is causing most of the erosion in this section of the river.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597397">It is not normal for citizens to have to drag their government to court in order to be heard. It is not normal that petitions must be tabled, citizens mobilized and resolutions adopted by municipalities and sent to the minister, nor is it normal that the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities issue a unanimous report only to see the government drag its feet. This is not normal. It is not normal for the government to dismiss reports prepared by its own scientists who are telling it that the problem is in its own backyard. It is not normal for Ottawa to wash its hands of its constitutional responsibilities. Commercial shipping and navigation in general comes under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597398">The government, however, says that it is not its job to take care of it. There is a problem. If it is not the government's job to take care of it, let it offload the responsibility to another government, or let us declare independence. Perhaps the Quebec government will take care of it, because as we can see, Ottawa is not interested in doing its job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597399">In conclusion, I expect the federal government to respect the people in my riding. I expect the study tabled by the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, which was carried out in a serious way, with witnesses, and whose findings were unanimously accepted, to be acknowledged by the government and taken seriously. I expect the House of Commons to confirm the work done in committee so that it has more weight, so that the government really listens to what the people want and solves the problems happening on the ground. Most of all, I expect the government to implement the recommendations set out in the report. In my opinion, that is the starting point. I am totally baffled that this short-sighted government is trying to avoid taking the problem seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597400">However, I am still pleased, because there were Liberals on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities who heard the witnesses and what they had to say. They saw the facts, and they voted with the rest of the committee members. They understood that there was a problem that needed a solution. They agreed with the solutions that were proposed. If these Liberals agreed with the proposed solutions when they were in committee, I think they will be able to convince the government. If the government is really serious about the problem, it has no choice but to agree with the facts I have stated. It can only act responsibly, right?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597401">The whole purpose of the House is to hold the government accountable for its actions and to highlight the everyday problems faced by our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597402">We are doing our job. I can say that I am doing my job. Now it is up to the government across the aisle to do its job.</ParaText>

I cannot recall offhand, and I have been here for quite a few question periods, whether the Bloc has ever raised this issue in the form of a question during question period; the member can correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe he has ever stood up and asked such a question. Why has the Bloc made the determination today to use this particular concurrence report? I guess it takes us off the Conservative filibustering, but I am curious as to what rationale was used 18 months ago when this report was tabled. </ParaText>

When Quebec has a problem, Ottawa does not seem to think it is serious or important. The government seems unable to listen to Quebec. Unfortunately, that is one of the reasons Quebeckers think that they would be better off in their own country. This government does not work for them.</ParaText>

Obviously, I understand their point of view. They want to limit spending. They simply say that they have no problem with investing in this, but that the money needs to come from somewhere else, so spending in other areas will have to be reduced.

I think that there is a lot of waste, particularly when it comes to the money going to the oil industry. It is unnecessary, especially since we are investing in an obsolete industry that should not get any more of our money. Instead, we should turn toward the economy of the future. Unfortunately, when we invest money in a sector with no future, it only delays the work that needs to be done. We need to focus on a zero-emission economy for the future. It would be far more productive and profitable. This is an example of where we could get the money. Our shorelines will still be there in 50 years, so it is important that we take care of them.

              <ParaText id="8597437">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to rise and speak on the St. Lawrence River and just how important that river has been, not only for us today, as a nation, but also for tomorrow and the days before. I think of the history of Canada and the important role the St. Lawrence River played to our overall development as a nation. My ancestors came from that whole area of the St. Lawrence River, and many of them would have been on the St. Lawrence and witnessed, even back then, issues related to the shoreline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597438">The point is that, whether it is my ancestors who lived close to the St. Lawrence River and used the St. Lawrence river or today, there have always been concerns in regard to the shoreline. However, I think that the overall support in the general direction of how the St. Lawrence has contributed to Canada being the nation it is today is overwhelmingly positive. We have seen economic development and community development that has been to the great benefit of all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597439">It is interesting that the member opposite said that this is completely a federal responsibility, yet if we take a look at part of his argument, it was that commercial vessels are using the St. Lawrence. He referenced speed as one of those issues that causes a problem, and the wakes are a problem. I acknowledge that, but one of the actions that was taken by the government a while back was to recognize that the province and Ottawa needed to work together, and that is why they put together a committee of both provincial and federal reps. I will go into a little more detail on that shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597440">I wanted to pick up a bit in terms of why this is, and that is why I posed the question I did to the member. This has been an issue for a long time, as I have talked about. I do not question that at all, but the report itself was tabled almost a year and a half ago. If we take a look at the Order Paper, what we will see is pages and pages of reports that have been brought to the standing committees. If one wanted to, they could stand up every day for the rest of the session until the next election and bring forward concurrence requests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597441">I question whether that is the most valuable use of the time here on the floor of the House of Commons. It takes nothing away from how important this issue is for all of Canada, because it is a trading corridor. Products that come in through the St. Lawrence are distributed throughout the country. All of Canada benefits if we have a healthy St. Lawrence River, so I do not question the importance of the subject matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597442">I am surprised, as the member made reference, that he has raised it in question period. I do not know how I would have missed that, because there are not very many question periods I have missed over the years. I will have to wait and see, but I am glad he raised the issue during question period, and hopefully he will continue to do so, because it is an important issue. That is one of the reasons there is such a detailed response to the report from the department, and I am going to talk about that response, but before I do that, the question I had posed to the member was this: “Why today?”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597443"> Since we have been back in session, I think it is fair to say that there has been marginal time on government legislation. Initially, the Conservative Party would go into the Order Paper, look through the pages and pages of reports, and start taking out concurrence reports in order for the government not to be able to talk about legislation. Now, if we were not talking about the report today, we would be talking about the privilege issue that was raised by the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597444"> Yesterday, I posed a question, and I think it is a legitimate question, in terms of the St. Lawrence and the many issues in the reports that are on the Order Paper. Yes, they are important issues, and there are many ways they can be dealt with, but is there a concentrated effort to prevent legislation from being debated? Whether it is the Citizenship Act that the Bloc, NDP and Liberal members support and the Conservatives oppose, or the military court that every member inside this House supports, the legislative agenda is being held up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597445">I am debating whether or not it is actually a privilege issue, which is supposed to be supreme in terms of the order of debates.

However, I will expand upon the topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597450">Just like the St. Lawrence River is important to all of Canada, especially the province of Quebec, the issue of water erosion goes far beyond the St. Lawrence River. I would argue that talking about the shores of our oceans, rivers and lakes, as well as the impact of our commercial, residential or recreational activities along them, would be a wonderful debate to have. I would also argue that the St. Lawrence River is a very important part of our lives. If I were in opposition, I would encourage a debate of that nature. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597451">I will give an example. The Red River and the Assiniboine River are two rivers that connect in the city of Winnipeg. To our communities and our cities, our rivers are so very important. Our Red River, our Assiniboine River and our Seine River are some of Winnipeg's greatest assets, but we are, unfortunately, seeing riverbank erosion taking place. There has been a big push, in which I have ultimately argued the opposite of what the member opposite was saying about who has responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597452">I will give a tangible example. In Winnipeg, my suggestion was to have a water authority deal with all aspects of our waterways, including the Red River, the Assiniboine River and the Seine River, because the city of Winnipeg needs those rivers. In many ways, that would help the development of our city. The same principle could apply to the St. Lawrence River, along with the many other rivers that flow through our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597453">In Winnipeg, to a certain degree, we have a good starting point, which was put in place a number of years ago, with The Forks and its development. Prior to The Forks development, there was virtually no traffic going down to The Forks, where the Red and the Assiniboine rivers meet. As a direct result of the federal government, the provincial government and the municipal government, today, The Forks is Manitoba's number one tourist attraction. I suspect that, if members have been to Winnipeg, chances are they have been to The Forks. That development, including the protection of the shorelines, were investments made by not one level of government, but by all levels of government, as they recognized just how important our rivers are to our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597454">We do not have big ships bringing in all sorts of transport and products or exporting products. It is not the economic hub of the St. Lawrence River, but I can tell the member opposite that our waterways are of great importance to the city of Winnipeg. I suspect that, whether we are talking about cities such as Winnipeg or Edmonton, it is an importance issue, just as it is for the St. Lawrence River, in British Columbia, around Vancouver Island in the ocean, and around Halifax.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597455">These are all important waterways, not only to the immediate communities, but also to all Canadians. Another example is the port of Churchill in Manitoba. It might not be unanimous among all politicians, but I would definitely like to see more activity taking place in the Port of Churchill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597458">Let there be no doubt, the St. Lawrence River was the lifeline for generations. As I have pointed out, my ancestors lived close to the St. Lawrence River. If it was not for the St. Lawrence River, who knows if I would even be here because of the role that it played in the development of the province of Quebec, not to mention all of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597459">As members of government, we have recognized the harm that is caused, and that is one of the reasons why we have invested financial resources and have taken some budget and legislative actions, as we have in the past, to recognize and take actions where we can. That means also working with other levels of government. One can get a real understanding and appreciation in the change in attitudes from this government compared to Stephen Harper's government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597460">I suggest to the person who moved the motion to take a look at infrastructure dollars. Contrast the infrastructure dollars spent by this government to previous governments, in particular the Stephen Harper Conservative government. As a government, Liberals have spent more to support Quebec on infrastructure, in all likelihood, than any other government in generations. I would like to think that a good amount of those infrastructure dollars was to support the St. Lawrence River, either directly or indirectly. We are talking a great deal of money. That is why I say there have been budgetary measures, some more direct than others. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597461">That is why I would suggest to my colleagues that this is an interesting report to read through. I was provided with some thoughts to share, and I will try to get into that right away. Before doing so, I would suggest to the members opposite that, in debating the issue, there is no reason why we could not have expanded that discussion in the form of an opposition day motion. With an opposition day motion, we would be able to get members to broaden the debate, to ensure that we are not only talking about the St. Lawrence. Members could represent, either directly or indirectly, aspects that need to be discussed. In my case, it would be a long family history that takes me back to the St. Lawrence that piques my interest in this particular river. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597462">This is not something that is just in the province of Quebec. As I pointed out, it could be in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick. One can ultimately go to the territories, to Churchill and so forth. All of these have an interest in not only what Ottawa is doing, but also how Ottawa can work with other jurisdictions to be able to make a difference. I would think that would be a more productive debate because, as the member himself has made clear, this is a debate that took place well over a year and a half ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597464">In 1988, there was a joint initiative between the governments of Canada and Quebec, so the two governments, to create the St. Lawrence action plan, which “aims to conserve, restore, protect, and enhance the St. Lawrence ecosystem.” It has all sorts of initiatives. The government's response to the committee report also reads:</ParaText>

When we take a look at it from a volunteer perspective, it was 90%-plus higher with the people or the commercial vessels that were actually obeying or following that. However, we still have other regulations and laws that are now in place, as recent as 2020, to ensure that, if there are additional things we could do, at least we would be open to it, and we have laws in place and regulations that can be supported.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597469">The first thing that bears mentioning is that he said this might not be the most pressing issue of the day and that we could discuss something else. I hope that is not the government's actual response or position, because there are hundreds of people in my riding who have been fighting for this for years. They find the government's inaction discouraging. Now that we are talking about it, we are being told that the government does not want to talk about it today. I do not think that is the kind of response my constituents want to hear from their government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597470">The second thing is that the Liberal member said he did not remember hearing me speak of this during question period. I am going to list three dates and I would like to know where he was on each of them. Where was he on May 30, 2019? I think he was a member of the House then. On November 24, 2022, I am pretty sure he was a member of the House then too. The same goes for March 20, 2023, because he is very often in the House, as he has stated. This all means that he has the opportunity to be here. We know he is here. I would like him to take a look at those three dates, because I was in question period on those days and I spoke to the shoreline erosion problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597471">The member complained that I never talk about other places, apart from the St. Lawrence, affected by the same phenomenon. The fact is that there are various causes. Tides are the main cause of erosion in the Magdalen Islands and British Columbia. In the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, navigation is the culprit. Even the experts from the Great Lakes and Ontario area who appeared before the committee said that the most pronounced effects occur on the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Montreal. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597473">I am glad the member realizes it is an issue. I am going to go to the first part of the question. The member talked about hundreds of individuals in his riding who are interested. I can assure him that thousands of his constituents would have been interested in Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms act.

              <ParaText id="8597475">What would the member's constituents want? Would they want the legislation passed today, or would they rather have another day of debate on this specific issue? That is why I would encourage the members of the Bloc to look at an opposition day. Let us talk about shorelines but also allow for some of the important legislation, some of which even the Bloc party supports. However, it is participating in supporting the Conservatives by allowing concurrence reports.</ParaText>

It ultimately led to a reduction in speed, which is administered in a volunteer fashion. I believe that 98% of people are actually following it. That is pretty good, I would suggest.

An additional issue of concern, from my perspective, regarding commercial and recreational vehicle traffic is the issue of noise and its impact on the marine ecosystem. Our government has taken a lot of measures and made a lot of investment through the ocean protection plans, but I believe more needs to be done to study the impact of noise on the marine environment.</ParaText>

Quite frankly, the best place to have that discussion, at least in great detail, is likely in a standing committee.

              <ParaText id="8597493">I want to clarify something. The concurrence debate was brought by one of my fellow members. We hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> consistently say that this is somehow inappropriate. He says that it should have been brought up in question period, which evidently it was three times; that it should have been an opposition day motion; or that it should have been brought up in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597494">It was studied in committee. It is completely legitimate within the process, and it is a debate that needs to happen. While I may not agree with my colleague 100%, it is a completely legitimate debate that is important not only to folks in his riding but also to people up and down the St. Lawrence Seaway. Shoreline erosion, ironically, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> raised, is an issue that is from coast to coast, with various rivers, lakes and otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597495"> In 2019, which happens to be the year I was elected, I spent a particularly large amount of time talking to residents in my surrounding neighbourhoods. There was flooding taking place. The highest recorded level that Lake Ontario had ever been at was in 2019. This was right on the heels of the record-setting flooding in 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597496">I was with a resident who was literally in ankle-deep water, who told me that their yard, where they played with their grandchildren, extended 50 yards farther out, so they lost 50 yards of their property. I spoke to another lady who was well into her 80s, who told me that she had not had a good night's sleep in weeks because she did not know whether this would be the night that her basement or her house flooded, as she could hear the lapping of Lake Ontario drawing closer and closer. She lived in terror, thinking that her house would soon be flooded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597497">Therefore, shoreline erosion is a real and significant issue that merits debate, and I thank my colleague for bringing forward the concurrence debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597498">I will talk a bit about the importance of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Of my wife's two grandfathers, one started on the lakers in Thunder Bay, and the other one started in Gaspé. They travelled up and down the waters, eventually settling down in Niagara. That gave them the opportunity to work at a job, see the world and eventually start a family. I am, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, or my children are at least, here because of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the tremendous importance it has in our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597499">Let us look at what the study says. It confirmed what we knew already: Shoreline erosion in Lake Ontario, the Great Lakes and many places elsewhere in the country is a significant issue. Let us look at the facts. It was a Liberal government in 1998 that cut the shoreline protection program, so it is a consistent theme that Liberal failures have created problems. It was just like when the Liberals cut health care in the 1990s under Jean Chrétien and then Paul Martin, yet somehow they provide the misinformation, and I would rather use the other word, to be candid, that they are not making cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597500">However, it is the reality that Stephen Harper dramatically increased funding for infrastructure following the 2008 economic crisis. It is also a reality, a fact, that Stephen Harper increased health care funding. According to all of the misinformation we hear repeatedly from the other side, we would think the opposite were true.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597501"> When we look at the problem of shoreline erosion, I think there is agreement on all sides that we need a multilateral partnership. It is particularly complicated because, as one of the other members said today, it also involves the United States of America. We need to have our American partners, the federal government, the provinces and municipalities on board. We also need private stakeholders, such as residents, communicating what they want to get done, as well shipping. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597502">I would agree with my colleague. It is undeniable that shipping causes shoreline erosion, or a part of it. Shipping, and let us call a spade a spade, is important to our economy as well. We all need to look at everything and come up with an approach to move forward to protect the residents, protect our economy and to grow a better and bigger Canada as we go forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597503">The shoreline erosion problem has been discussed for years and years, yet there has been no action by the Liberal government. One of the things I disagree with my colleague from the Bloc Québécois on is that he seems to believe the Liberal federal government can solve this problem. I would like to take the member down memory lane and look at some of the problems it tried to fix over the the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597504"> The government told us that housing was too expensive and that we needed more affordable housing. What has happened? The price of housing has doubled and even tripled in some parts of the country. It told us that there was too much addiction and drug use and that it would tackle that. What do we see in our streets today? Crime and chaos. It told us it would balance the budget, that it would be “a teeny-tiny little deficit”, as former prime minister Stephen Harper said, and now we have a massive deficit and debt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597489">Do members, and not just my friend and colleague from the transport committee, really believe that after nine years the government can fix anything? Former U.S president Ronald Reagan said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help.” Far be it for me to change a quote of the great Ronald Reagan, but we do need to Canadianize it to “The 10 scariest words in the English language are: I'm from the Liberal government, and I'm here to help.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597490">I can imagine a world where the government were to authorize itself billions of dollars to fix the shoreline erosion problem. What would happen? Just like every other problem it tried to fix it would get worse. There would also be Liberal insiders, consultants and a lot of paperwork. A lot of Liberal insiders would get very wealthy, just like with SDTC and a myriad of other programs, the consulting scandals, all of these scandals. However, nothing would actually get done, because this is a government of mismanagement, overspending and a complete and utter lack of results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597491">I have a little secret. The difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives is that Liberals judge the success of a program by how many billions of dollars they can spend and how long it can last, whereas Conservatives judge the success of a project or a program by whether there is success. When Conservatives cut the carbon tax, we will also fix many different problems. We will have a carbon tax election and elect a common-sense Conservative government that will restore powerful paycheques, make Canada the freest country on earth and ensure that the promise of Canada is restored. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597508"> Mr. Speaker, this may be a bit off topic, but definitely relevant to the speech the member just gave. He indicated that Stephen Harper increased health care costs. I have heard a number of Conservatives say that. That is somewhat misleading, because it was Paul Martin's government that got the health care accord, which secured 6% increases for a 10-year period of time. The Harper government just happened to take the reins of power after the health care accord was signed, which is why we have record-high health care payments today. It was not because of Harper. In fact, when the health care accord expired, the first thing he did was to reduce the percentage increase, I think from 6% to 3%. The member can confirm that, but I am sure that is fairly accurate. </ParaText>

In fairness to Chrétien, the reason he had to cut that was because of the massive debts and deficits, driven up by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. We have these repeated patterns of Liberal spending over and again. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8597516">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to talk about this important study by the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities that addresses the St. Lawrence River, where I have lived since I made my home in Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies. I was raised in La Pocatière, along the St. Lawrence River. I have spent my entire life along the St. Lawrence River. I have watched the St. Lawrence River's shoreline, especially the south shore, change over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597517">For years and even centuries, the shoreline has been transformed by nature, by the tides—because we have very high tides back home—and by ships. Obviously, whales and the entire coastal environment are also impacted by maritime operations. Maritime operations were very extensive during certain years a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597518">The shoreline has long been eroding. Let us be clear. I understand that mayors were consulted for the study that was carried out. I was mayor of La Pocatière. One way or the other, municipal officials of the past and present can attest to the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597519">I will give a few very clear examples. In my riding of Montmagny, shoreline erosion is a serious problem in Cap-aux-Oies, home to the Pointe-aux-Oies campground. In fact, the city of Montmagny worked with Fisheries and Oceans Canada to begin stabilizing the shoreline. If no action is taken, the campground may not disappear, but it will inevitably lose some of its sites in the long run because of the serious shoreline erosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597520">Despite Montmagny's ongoing relationship with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Quebec government, the matter has still not been settled. In fact, our situation in Quebec is unique. We have always wanted more autonomy, and we have it when it comes to the environment, so, inevitably, the environmental specialists in Quebec and the environmental specialists in Ottawa do not always agree on the situation or the potential results of certain efforts. For that reason, we often find ourselves in situations like the one in Montmagny, where we cannot find a solution. We are trying—I got involved to some extent—to put the pressure on to find a solution, since there is already money available in the grant programs for Montmagny to do the work. Money for the work, therefore, is not an issue here, and neither is it an issue in many other cases because the money is there. Consider the federal government's climate change adaptation program or the green municipal fund. A lot of work is already paid for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597521">I would like to note that a few years back, not that long ago, there was the Projet Résilience côtière, led by Université du Québec à Rimouski. The laboratory involved focused on the dynamic behaviour and integrated management of the coastal zone. Obviously, the coastal zone includes the part of the St. Lawrence that runs in front of my colleagues' ridings, in the Sorel region, among others. I will take the time to read the description of the laboratory to give members an idea of what was done in the past.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597524">The project ran from January 2017 to December 2021. It ended nearly three years ago. It helped develop a tool enabling the coastal municipalities to collect information to eventually carry out the work.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597525">I am raising this point because work to build coastal resilience and counter the effects of shoreline erosion has been ongoing for several years. I served as the mayor of La Pocatière from 2005 to 2009, and even back when I was the vice-warden of the Kamouraska regional county municipality, I can guarantee that we were already having problems with shoreline erosion. We still do, and always will. However, work and research were already under way at the time. A lot of money has already been invested in research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597526">The problem here is not a lack of funding for research. The problem is that the Liberal government, which has been in power since 2015, never takes action. It does research and it funds research. That is not a problem. However, when it comes time to to implement the solutions proposed based on the research findings, the government cannot seem to get anything done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597527">The problem is not a lack of funding. The federal budget has increased by $151 billion, with 100,000 new public servants being hired. That is not the issue. There are people who can do that. It is not really a problem. I think that the problem we are having right now is that the public service has grown so large that the relationship between Ottawa and Quebec, in particular, has become a lot more complicated when it comes to environmental issues, and Quebec and Ottawa do not always have the same solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597528">Let me give another very clear and important example. There are about five marinas on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, from Berthier-sur-Mer in my riding to Île Verte. The north side of the St. Lawrence does not necessarily have erosion problems, because it is much deeper. The rocks are right there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597529">On the south shore, however, there are large, very flat, muddy stretches. Marinas get mud coming into the area. As members likely know, these areas are often surrounded by rocks to protect the boats from the waves and turbulence of the river. As a result, a lot of silt accumulates inside these marinas. In Rivière-du-Loup, in particular, there is an extremely short period in which to dredge the silt, which is a problem. It is a very significant problem because it is a question of protecting beluga whales and other marine species. The silt does not come from the sky, it comes from the St. Lawrence River. It is in the river. It just collects in certain places. What is more, most of the boats in marinas are sailboats. They cause little or no pollution, so the silt is not contaminated. It can be put back in the river.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597530">All the issues are like that. The war between the Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada, with Fisheries and Oceans imposing such major restrictions, is costing boat owners a fortune. They want to be able to take out all that silt and put it back in the river. Dredging, that is what I am talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597531">Anyway, about the St. Lawrence River shoreline, it is not nearly as wide there as it is where I come from. In our region, the river is 12 to 15 kilometres wide. The closer it gets to the ocean, the wider it is. It is even wider in the gulf, so there is a little less impact, and those impacts are naturally occurring, not caused by ships. I understand that, in my colleague's riding, in his region, erosion is caused mainly by passing ships and their wake. I understand that my colleague wants to improve the situation and protect the shorelines in his region. Of course he does. It is also part of his job to listen to the people in his riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597532">I believe that, as we speak, money is available and proposals are out there. If we want to do research in this area, universities are willing to do it. Funding is available. All these things are already available. I do not think we should be adding new committees and new business. I also think we need to work with Quebec to get projects going as soon as possible, but those projects have to be easy, quick and efficient.</ParaText>

Over 150,000 tonnes of goods move through it annually. I think the seaway brings in enough revenue that we can afford to help and take care of the people who live along its banks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597536">Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with my colleague's statement. A study entitled “Coastal Resilience Project: developing tools for adaptation to coastal erosion for municipalities in Quebec's maritime regions” looked at 24 regional county municipalities, or RCMs. We would have to confirm which RCMs were involved, but it covered 123 municipalities and 10 indigenous communities. The only indigenous community in my riding is the Maliseet nation in Cacouna. This inevitably goes beyond the territory of my riding. The member is absolutely right to say that if you intervene in one place, it can cause collateral damage somewhere else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597537">What I am saying is that this challenge already exists. Maritime Quebec already exists. No one is reinventing this. It already exists in Quebec City, where there used to be a ministry responsible for it. I think it is still there. There are ways of working collaboratively with Quebec, with Fisheries and Oceans, and with local stakeholders, such as municipalities. The solutions are there, but the government has never wanted to implement them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597546"> The report sheds light on an important issue, an issue that impacts not only the environment but also the livelihoods and safety of thousands of Canadians living along the shores of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The erosion of our shorelines due to commercial shipping is a serious concern in communities, and witnesses who appeared at committee made it clear that action is required to protect our natural ecosystems and that the people who live and work on these waterways deserve protection.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8597547">For decades, the waters of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River have played a central role in our economy, supporting commerce, transportation and industry. However, this same activity, particularly commercial shipping, is now one of the main factors driving shoreline erosion. The narrow passages of the St. Lawrence River and other parts of this corridor are particularly vulnerable to erosion caused by wakes from ships and other human activities.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8597548">I think it is important to remember that erosion is not just about losing land; it is about the loss of infrastructure, homes and livelihoods. It is about communities like Saint-Ignace-De-Loyola, where residents are witnessing their properties crumble away year by year, due to waves created by commercial vessels. The impact of the commercial shipping industry is not just an environmental issue; it is a public safety issue and it is a threat to their way of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597549">The report makes one thing abundantly clear: The federal government has failed to take a leading role in addressing shoreline erosion. Many witnesses from various communities, municipalities, indigenous communities and environmental organizations pointed out that we need a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach that involves all levels of government, but the leadership must come from Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597550">New Democrats echo the calls in this report for a shoreline protection program. This program was cancelled in the 1990s. Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to re-establish the program, which provided critical support to shorelines along the St. Lawrence. By reintroducing this program, we can bring together provincial and municipal governments, indigenous groups, industry leaders and scientific experts to develop real, sustainable solutions to erosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597551">I want to take a moment to recognize the important initiative introduced by my colleague the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. His bill granting rights to the St. Lawrence River is an important and bold step when it comes to rethinking our relationship with nature. By granting legal personhood to the river, we would acknowledge the intrinsic value of our natural ecosystems and their right to thrive. This bill is not just symbolic; it represents a fundamental shift toward environmental justice. If passed, it would give the river a voice, empowering communities and environmental advocates to take legal action on its behalf when ecosystems are threatened. The St. Lawrence is the lifeblood of our environment, our history, our communities and our future. We must recognize its right to exist, flourish and regenerate. The bill is a critical piece of the broader movement to protect the river from the very threats outlined in this report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597552">Despite the urgency of these issues, however, the Liberal government has dragged its feet. Year after year, we hear promises of environmental action, but its cancellation in the 1990s of the shoreline protection program, which was not reinstated under the current government or under the Harper government before it, is just one example of its failure to protect our vital ecosystems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597553">The Liberals have failed to act on erosion, failed to regulate commercial shipping and failed to listen to the communities that are most affected. On the west coast, I have been calling on the government to enact a mandatory 1,000-metre vessel buffer for endangered southern resident killer whales and to address the dumping of waste and effluent by commercial ships. The government continues to speak about environmental action and about climate action, while failing to implement critical protections for our waterways and shorelines.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597554">We can no longer afford half measures, patchwork solutions or more studies with no follow-up. The time for action is now, and the federal government must be held accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597555">Many of the solutions to protect our natural environment and protect our communities are outlined in this report, and they are not in opposition to economic growth or to industry. It is about striking a balance between development and environmental sustainability. That is why the NDP will always work to ensure that workers in industries like commercial shipping are part of the solution, and why we believe that the companies themselves, the industries that benefit from the river, must contribute to preserving it through programs like the recommended fund for riparian restoration, which would be financed by commercial users of the corridor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597556">We know that the Conservatives are always pushing for deregulation and cuts, and they show a disregard for long-term environmental impacts and the failure to invest in future sustainability. The Conservatives claim to be in support of fiscal responsibility, but how can we be fiscally responsible if we ignore the environmental costs and the costs to communities that will continue to grow, putting communities and ecosystems at even greater risk?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597557">To wrap up, I want to re-emphasize that we need action, not just more studies. I want to re-emphasize that this report is not just about studying the problem; it is about the action that is needed by the federal government. Now is the time to take that action. Re-establishing the shoreline protection program, passing the bill to grant rights to the St. Lawrence River, investing in research and sustainable solutions, regulating ship speeds and holding industries accountable are all necessary steps for protecting our shorelines and protecting the communities along them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597565">Mr. Speaker, Liberal members always want to throw everything at climate change, as in the forest fire example the Liberal member just brought up. The Liberals forget that they did not give $500 million to add more firefighters and do more forest prevention exercises. In Jasper, the brush was not cleared the way it was supposed to.</ParaText>

We heard from witnesses just yesterday about the recruitment and retention problems related to paying wildland firefighters $22 an hour and not giving them health benefits or cancer coverage.

              <ParaText id="8597574">Mr. Speaker, I am extremely glad to speak to this very important motion on shoreline erosion along the St. Lawrence River. Quebeckers and Montrealers have a very strong connection to the St. Lawrence River. It is a huge part of Quebec's identity, and we are attached to the river and all its tributaries, all the rivers that flow into this very large and beautiful river. I am from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, so the Richelieu River was obviously part of my childhood and my teen years. The Richelieu and other rivers feed into the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597575">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> pointed out that I introduced a private member's bill to recognize the St. Lawrence River as a natural entity with legal status. The goal is to better protect it and enhance our ability to protect the environment, the ecosystems and the biodiversity connected to such a massive entity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597576">I just want to mention that I am a map aficionado. I love maps. I am a big fan of geography, and I recently noticed that, if we take the St. Lawrence River and superimpose it over Europe, placing the head of Lake Superior over the French city of Brest in Brittany, the beginning of the gulf would end up in Warsaw, Poland. That illustrates the considerable extent of what we are talking about today. Its length would cover almost all of western Europe, excluding Russia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597577">It is really important that we have this discussion to see how we can protect shorelines, banks, species, and ecosystems at risk. Multiple groups are concerned about the threats facing certain species, including the copper redhorse. Port expansion projects like the one in Contrecoeur could harm locations of strategic importance to the species' reproduction. This study is important not only for economic reasons, but also for biological reasons, including ecosystem protection. Personally, I am very pleased to participate in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597578">As I said, I introduced a private member's bill to give legal status to the St. Lawrence River. Given today's climate, I consider it all the more important precisely because of climate change. While preparing this bill, I had the opportunity to visit, travel around and meet with stakeholders in the northern and southern regions of the river. I clearly remember that people in the Lower St. Lawrence told me that Highway 132 was being threatened by shoreline erosion that is steadily eating away at the road year after year, and that Highway 132 might have to be moved at some point. If Highway 132 has to be moved because of the increasingly large waves hitting the banks of the St. Lawrence, or because of higher water levels or increased marine traffic, it just shows the impact that climate change can have on quality of life and regional development.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597579">It is important to look at the situation from a broad, holistic point of view. People on the ground told me that this was very important to them, because it also means that some residents will have to move and leave their homes. It is a whole restructuring and redevelopment of the entire highway, along with certain towns and cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597580">The bill I introduced is a novel idea. This is the first time in North America that a bill has been introduced to give legal status to a natural entity. This is a new idea in North America, but it has already happened other places in the world. In Central America, South America and Spain, for example, certain natural entities such as lakes and ponds have been given legal status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597581">The constitutions of some Central American states, as well as Ecuador, recognize that nature can have rights. I think we need to consider that here as well. The federal government needs to be able to work in a way that recognizes the value of the environment. It must also be able to work with Quebec and the municipalities, as well as first nations, to protect the banks of the St. Lawrence River, its ecosystems and the species that live there. That is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597582">The bill I introduced about the St. Lawrence also talks a lot about reconciliation and the need to think of the first nations and the indigenous peoples as guardians of our ecosystems, the environment and the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries. The bill also seeks to set up an oversight committee that would consist of 11 people appointed by the governments of Quebec and Ontario, and also by the Quebec's and Ontario's assemblies of first nations. The goal would be to monitor the St. Lawrence and have the capacity to act when necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597583">The bill would not only recognize the St. Lawrence as a legal entity and provide for an oversight committee, but it would also give us the ability to represent the river in court. This would allow for lawyers to be hired to argue on behalf of the river, just as people can argue on behalf of a company, a municipality, their family or themselves. It is a novel concept. Their case could truly be argued during a consultation or before a tribunal, by having someone say, I am representing the interests of the St. Lawrence River. The mandate would be conferred by the oversight committee that would be made up of five parts, because there would also be representatives from environmental groups who would defend the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597584">This is extremely important if we want to be able to guarantee future generations a healthy river that is full of life, where we have preserved the ecosystems, species and biodiversity for generations to come. It is also extremely important to look at this from an economic development perspective to ensure that any developments at the port of Quebec, the port of Montreal or the port of Montreal at Contrecoeur are done in a way that respects the river system as a whole.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597601">This issue means a lot to me. The Lac-Saint-Louis riding covers the westernmost part of the Island of Montreal, known as the West Island, nestled among a network of major rivers and bodies of water. These days, crossing one of these bodies of water via the Île-aux-Tourtes bridge is a little difficult, not because the bridge is under construction, but because a new bridge is being built. In the meantime, travelling from my riding to the riding of Vaudreuil—Soulanges is very hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597602">My riding is effectively surrounded by bodies of water on three sides: the Rivière des Prairies to the north, the St. Lawrence River to the south, and Lac des Deux Montagnes to the west. The Ottawa River flows into the Rivière des Prairies and Lac des Deux Montagnes and then into the St. Lawrence. This can be problematic at times because of sediment carried in by the Ottawa River. Some water in the St. Lawrence River turns brown at the point where it reaches my riding because of the Ottawa River sediment. The other part is fairly clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597603">As a member of Parliament who pays close attention to what is happening around his riding, I have seen water levels change from one year to the next for natural reasons. An order was issued not long ago concerning water regulation. The order states that natural phenomena should be what determines water levels. There are at least four or five boating and sailing clubs on the St. Lawrence River in my riding. The water is low some years and higher other years. That is a problem for people who have boats, who sail and engage in all kinds of other recreational activities. I am therefore very familiar with the situation on the river.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597604">The river is not the same as it was 300 years ago. We sometimes forget, but the river has changed a lot. Think of the construction of Notre Dame Island at the Expo 67 site, when an artificial island was built right in the middle of the river. Obviously, the seaway has changed the river dynamics a great deal. The changes can be seen in a wonderful film by Quebec animation director Frédéric Back. He made an extraordinary film about the St. Lawrence River that shows the changes that have taken place over the years. There were no hydroelectric plants along the river 300 years ago. There have been a lot of changes, and what is currently happening with shoreline erosion is a more complex phenomenon than one might think.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597605">By the way, I would like to acknowledge the work of the marine pilots. I know several. As members know, these pilots board a ship and pilot it along the river all the way to the Great Lakes. Once it reaches the Great Lakes, other marine pilots take over. They do extraordinary work navigating this river, whose contours can be rather tricky at times. What is more, the river is not very deep. Flying between Montreal and Toronto, we can see the bottom of the river from the plane. That may be one of the reasons waves have an impact on the shoreline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597606">The river has evolved a lot. It is an economic driver, and several members have raised that fact in their speeches. It is a waterway that has a huge economic impact, not just on Montreal and on Quebec's economy, but also on Ontario's economy and that of the rest of Canada as well. Accordingly, when we make decisions about navigation on the river, we have to consult the economic stakeholders. That obviously includes Quebec. The Government of Quebec has an interest in making sure its voice is heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597607">We have also heard that shoreline erosion is not necessarily very easy to explain. It is not just a question of ship speeds or size. As I just said, the marine pilots do extraordinary work to ensure that passing ships have as little impact as possible on the shoreline and the natural environment of the river. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597608">Incidentally, I would like to remind the House that the government, in co-operation with the Government of Quebec, asked that voluntary measures be implemented to reduce ship speeds. One might think that those measures would not have any impact because they were voluntary. However, I read that 98% of ships are complying with the new reduced speeds, which is quite something. Ships, guided by marine pilots, are doing what they can to minimize impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597609">I mentioned this earlier in my question to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. When we were discussing the forest fires in Alberta at the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, we heard that we never used to get the kind of winds that we are seeing today in the forests and on the river. That all goes back to climate change. We are in an unpredictable situation. It is unprecedented. We have to assess what is happening in the river because of human factors, such as shipping, but also because of environmental factors, especially those related to climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597610">The government assesses what is happening in the river to carefully target the right solutions. Let me give an example of a case where, thanks to sound scientific research, we avoided spending billions of dollars for nothing. Everyone is familiar with the Experimental Lakes Area, a natural laboratory in Ontario. It is home to experiments on pollution issues, which are conducted in real lakes. At one point, it was determined that nitrogen levels in waste water needed to be reduced and that billions upon billions of dollars would have to be spent to that end. Scientific research in the Experimental Lakes Area concluded that it was not nitrogen that was causing the problem. In the end, the billions of dollars did not need to be spent. We must be careful to arrive at the right scientific conclusions before taking action.</ParaText>

Along both the Yamaska River and the Rivière Noire, shoreline erosion is problematic. The people of Saint-Hyacinthe, Saint-Pie and Saint-Damase have been telling me about this for years.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8597628">Madam Speaker, what we are talking about today is serious. Some people do not seem to realize what residents have been going through, and I do not mean lately, I mean since 1997. They watch big ships go by every day. It is a privilege they would not want to give up, because it is wonderful, but they are suffering the consequences. Year after year, they are seeing their land crumble away, but their property tax is not going down. They pay taxes and even though the land is smaller, they are not paying less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597629">They want to intervene. Most of them are even prepared to pay a lot of money. However, intervention is extremely complex and highly regulated. They would have to apply for permits. They would have to talk to one department and then talk to another department. They can intervene on their own land, but if the neighbour does not do anything, the water will get in through that neighbour's land and get underneath the structure. At the end of the day, the work will need to be redone or it will be completely ineffective. Worse yet, this can even harm a third neighbour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597630">A waterway is an ecosystem. It is a whole. If the riverbank is developed in one municipality, that development may have an impact three municipalities away. That is why a collaborative approach is needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597631">That is why the Bloc Québécois has a hard time understanding how the federal government can so easily wash its hands of its responsibilities. Navigation is a federal responsibility. This is the government's responsibility. It established a program. It built structures in my riding in the 1960s and 1970s. Take the retaining wall in Berthierville, for example, which is now on the verge of collapsing into the water. The federal government built it. Then, in 1997, it said it would start being hands off and the community would just have to deal with it. As science and studies have evolved over time, we now know that these structures, known as grey infrastructure, may not be the best solution. They can speed up the flow of water, leading to repercussions elsewhere. This is common knowledge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597632">How can a G7 nation suddenly decide that, since cuts have to be made somewhere, this program should be cut and the people should be left to fend for themselves? What is more, the people being left to fend for themselves are Quebeckers, because the effects are being felt around Montreal and Lake Saint‑Pierre. That is the message we are getting. Earlier, another member asked if there would be a stronger response if the effects were being felt in Ontario. I hope we are wrong in saying that, but the current situation certainly leads us to that conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597633">Can the government take responsibility and coordinate a response? That is what this is all about. It is about coordinating the response so that we do not abandon our constituents and our small municipalities, which do not have a lot of financial resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597634">I will talk about the event that led me to be so interested in this file and why there is now a Lanaudière‑Mauricie St. Lawrence shoreline protection committee in my riding of Berthier—Maskinongé. It was created on the initiative of a constituent named Roy Grégoire. I thank him very much for his work. He launched the petition and brought people together. That was how the committee came about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597635">However, Berthier—Maskinongé was not the first to tackle this issue, because another member had already been working on it for many years and had done some of the work. I want to take this opportunity to commend my very esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278741" Type="2">Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères</Affiliation>, who has done a remarkable job. He demonstrated that earlier in his 20-minute speech. We could give him another 20 minutes and I am sure he could fill that time. We might even give him a third speaking slot of 20 minutes to fully explain to the people in the government what we have to do and what the problem is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597636">I cannot imagine how two opposition members found the time to meet with people, talk to them and conduct studies. We met with scientists at the universities in Montreal and Laval, in Quebec City, to understand how they are studying shoreline erosion, what new technologies are out there and what erosion control measures could be implemented. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597638">A government leader asked me if we asked questions about this, as if it were our fault. Honestly, the committee worked very hard on this.

Now we are being criticized for moving concurrence in this report in the House. I am sorry, but something has to be done.</ParaText>

Without pre-approval, once the work is done, there is no chance of getting any money. It is just not possible. In his case, the road would have fallen into the water if the repairs had not been done.

              <ParaText id="8597653">I thank André Villeneuve, mayor of Lanoraie.

              <ParaText id="8597654">Allow me to explain why this is important and why there is erosion. Structures have been built upstream to control the flow of water. Some of these structures are built near populated areas in my riding. They are called control weirs, and they are basically stone walls that were built to keep the water in the river, raise the water level and keep it high and constant by controlling the upstream dam and combining it with the Ottawa River. The water is always at the same level, and erosion occurs always at the same level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597655">No one can tell me that the St. Lawrence Seaway is not the cause of these major erosion problems. The two are directly related. These are structures. Government was asked to help with the work, but it said no because it cannot just throw money away like that. However, the government has the money to come in and work on the control weirs. Workers came this summer, and our mayors did not even know what was happening. These workers were working alongside the municipalities and, when asked, they said that Fisheries and Oceans Canada had sent them. The mayors then wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation> to ask why these people were doing work in their municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597656">The St. Lawrence Seaway is very important. The federal government is going to do some work there, but the mayors have to deal with the secondary repercussions and the hundred-year-old trees falling into the water. They can cry about it all they want, but no one cares. The workers and the government do not care. That is the situation right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597657">Another minister, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>, is currently looking at creating two reserves in the Lake Saint-Pierre archipelago, where ship speeds would be reduced, which is not a bad idea. Maybe those two departments could talk to each other? Maybe they could also talk to the third department, Transport Canada, about making ship speed restrictions mandatory rather than voluntary?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597658">There are all kinds of things that can be done, but everyone needs to work together to implement a comprehensive response to ensure that interventions in one place do not have a disastrous effect on the neighbours. That is why the federal government needs to step up, stop trying to take over provincial responsibilities so it can feel important, and just do its own job, in its own areas of jurisdiction, to support our citizens and our municipalities in protecting their shorelines, because they urgently need them to be better equipped to withstand erosion. Climate change is just getting started. It is far from being resolved. The climate will become increasingly irregular. People need help, and it is our responsibility to help them.</ParaText>

Instead, we are being told that it is our fault and that all we had to do was put it back on the agenda sooner. Come on. Give me a break. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8597678">I would like to speak to the transportation committee study for a bit and talk about the government's response to it. Then I will share some of the factors that are affecting shoreline erosion and the urgency of the situation in my own riding. As always, I will come with helpful solutions that might be a good path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597679">First, the study identifies that the speed of vehicles is a factor, which is true. My riding of Sarnia—Lambton certainly experienced that, when the Coast Guard sped through the channel, broke the ice and broke the whole Sombra ferry. Instead of fixing it for $2 million, the government, the member at the time, who is now in charge of public safety but was in charge of DFO, decided not to fix it. Instead it was decided to lose $4 million a year of CBSA revenue, lose a border crossing and eventually lose $6 million in a lawsuit over the whole thing. Speed is an issue and it needs to be brought down. Not everyone complies with the speed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597680">With the other factors, the government's response was delayed by 18 months. This is typical of the government. It does not really know how to do the business of government well. In the response, it is talking a lot about research and studies that need to be done. However, when the House is on fire, that is not the time to begin research on the accelerating factors in burning of different materials. That would be the time to take urgent action to put the fire out. That is where we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597681">All day long we have heard members from different ridings talk about the urgency of shoreline erosion in their areas, and the government has been very deaf on this point. I hear all the time that it is climate change. When we talk about climate change, we need to understand what part of that is playing into shoreline erosion. From my engineering background, water levels increasing and decreasing makes a big difference in shoreline erosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597682">In design engineering principles, we look at the 100-year cycle of water levels in places like the St. Clair River and the St. Lawrence Seaway. We look at 100-year storms. The problem is now we are seeing 100-year storms every couple of weeks, so that has greatly exacerbated the problem. In addition to that, we are not able to deal with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597683"> In the Great Lakes area, we have the infrastructure in place in Niagara that is supposed to maintain the water levels in the Great Lakes. However, that infrastructure only has the capacity of changing the level by one inch per month. With the inches and inches of rainwater that we are seeing and the fluctuations there, we just do not simply have the infrastructure to address water levels, and that is making the situation worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597684">In addition to that, there is not always good engineering design put in place. In my riding of Sarnia—Lambton, there is a stretch of beach between Canatara Park and Brights Grove. It is all very homogeneous. In the stretch from Canatara Park to the midpoint at Murphy, the shoreline protection has been properly engineered. The groins are 100 feet apart. They are long enough, tall enough and made of adequate materials, so there is no shoreline erosion in evidence there. However, what has happened on the next stretch of beach is that people, as they built their property, decided to put something in place that was not properly engineered. They have huge issues to the point that in Brights Grove the road was falling down right next to Lake Huron. They had to close it and do an emergency repair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597685">Since 2015, when I was elected, I have been trying to negotiate to get the $150 million that is needed in Sarnia—Lambton to address its issues. With three levels of government, the revolving door of ministers who have handled infrastructure and the lack of funding that somebody could actually apply for and get funding for shoreline erosion, the government has been all talk and no action on this file.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597686"> There are issues downriver in my riding, in St. Clair township, with a lot of low-level housing getting flooded. It is not just a St. Clair township thing. We see it in Gatineau every year with the Gatineau floods. There is a huge issue there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597687">It is not that the solutions are unknown. We know how to put in aggregate rock. We know what the better things are to put in some areas versus others and what to do for people, but we need to have a holistic solution. In one area in my riding, which is a rather wealthy area, landowners are losing 30 feet to 50 feet of their land every year from shoreline erosion. Owners are spending $50,000 and $100,000 apiece to put in their own seawall, but then that passes the problem down to the next neighbour. What is needed is a holistic solution, which could be funded jointly with municipalities, individuals and the federal government. The province has a role to play, but doing nothing and letting this piecemeal thing continue to happen is certainly not a solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597688">When it comes to what we ought to do, we oftentimes hear the Liberal government say that it is “seized” with this solution. Again from an engineering perspective, a motor that is seized means it is not moving. That is exactly what we are seeing from the Liberal government, which is that it is not moving and not taking any action. It is not acceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597689">If we look to the solutions that the Liberals want to put in place, they have decided, again, that we need another committee to distribute another fund. I do not know how many times they have to repeat the same behaviour before they recognize that putting a whole bunch of Liberal appointees onto a committee to administer a fund is a disaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597690">Let us start with the Infrastructure Bank: $35 billion of infrastructure money was taken from municipalities and put into a committee to administer it. No projects came out the other end, but everybody was getting a great salary. It was a terrible idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597691">On the sustainable green fund, the Liberals wanted another committee to distribute the billion dollars in funds. Here we are today not able to do any government business because of the scandalous 186 conflicts of interest, people giving money from the committee to their own companies, as well potentially to the companies of cabinet ministers. It is a disaster. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597692">The suggestion that we should do this is a bad idea. The Liberals are suggesting the same thing for Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>. Instead of addressing the exploitation of children online, which is a serious offence, they want to create a parallel Liberal-appointed committee that would look at these issues. The committee would not have the ability to do anything in terms of criminal consequence, but it would make everybody feel better, and everybody would get better paid. That is not a solution, and I do not recommend it here at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597693">This increase in people does not necessarily give us a better result. We have seen a 40% increase in public sector employees, but we do not see a corresponding improvement in response times from CRA or from immigration, from any of these things. In fact, we actually see worse results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597694">None of the solutions that have been put forward are the right ones. There is urgency, not just in my riding. We heard of other ridings for which this is urgent. I would be remiss if I did not speak up for former MP Bill Casey, who, when he was here, always talked about the linkage between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. This is critical infrastructure, and it is going to be washed away. This will be a huge issue for all the people living in those regions, and it is not being tackled with the urgency needed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597695">We need to use the funds we have. We have an infrastructure fund. Could we use it to build things? Could we use it for shoreline erosion? Every time someone applies for one of these funds, it is like the fund is a little boutique, where people need to have this, that or something else. Each riding has its own needs and each riding knows what to do about it. Why do we not take the existing infrastructure money we have and work with the municipalities to address shoreline erosion? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597698">However, working with other levels of government and providing infrastructure dollars is one way monies can be allocated.

We have the solutions. We have the St. Clair Region Conservation Authority reports, we have it all, but we cannot get the money.

              <ParaText id="8597702">Some government members said there was money to protect the shoreline, but the truth is, that money is often spent on a pilot project here or a research project there, or it is paid out on an ad hoc basis when a city applies for a program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597703">The thing is, individuals cannot do anything when their land is taken from them. None of the existing programs have funding for that. It absolutely has to go through some organization. Individuals who want to take the initiative to protect their land from the damage caused by passing ships, among other things, are in a tough spot. They are in a tough spot because they would have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket even though the cause of the problem is, as we know, under the government's jurisdiction. The government is washing its hands of it. The government is not dealing with it. The problem is, if an individual protects their land, but their neighbour does not, the situation will get worse for the neighbour.</ParaText>

The Bloc has brought forward a committee report that was done a year and a half ago regarding continued concerns about the Liberal government's inaction when it comes to shoreline erosion, in this case particularly along the St. Lawrence River.

              <ParaText id="8597716">They have worked together over the course of the last few years to quantify this by studying points in Mariatown, just west of Morrisburg, and on Jacobs Island in Akwesasne. In partnership with different groups, like the River Institute, the municipalities have done some aerial imagery. They have also put instruments in the river itself to test the impact that shipping traffic is having in some of the more narrow channels of the St. Lawrence River. The conclusion is clear from the data they have presented. They have substantiated what we have known for many years, which is that there is a lack of leadership in acknowledging the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597717">I will point out the parallel between the St. Lawrence River and Highway 401. Over the course of the last 40, 50 or 60 years, since the 401 has been in existence in Ontario, which runs parallel to the St. Lawrence River, we have seen modernization. We have seen bridge rehabilitations and replacements. We have seen bridge structures change as they have been replaced to allow for what is happening next, which is the widening of the 401. The Province of Ontario will be adding in a third lane, including through my part of eastern Ontario. The St. Lawrence River is right beside the 401, and in that same time, our country has grown, our population has grown and our economy has grown. However, we have not seen modernization to address the increased number of ships passing through and the size and speed of those ships, which is now causing damage in many parts of the St. Lawrence River.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597718"> The part that is frustrating is that this report was done a year and a half ago, and the transport and infrastructure committee of the House of Commons confirmed what everyone along the St. Lawrence River has known for years, which is that shoreline erosion is a major issue, the government is not providing infrastructure funds and, most importantly, the federal level is not providing the leadership needed to address this issue. In a few different ways this is a problem, because there are many different federal departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597719"> The Liberals are the best at this. After we debate this report from a year and a half ago that says action is needed, there will be no action and no update. When Liberal members spoke about their updates and their perspective on this, they said they had given a lot of money to infrastructure over the years. They knew this debate was coming today and knew they were going to be called out and challenged for their lack of action, but they could not name one single infrastructure project they have funded in the last nine years that has helped address shoreline erosion, or anything specific they have done to address the issue. The only thing they do, which is typical of the Liberal government, is say they are having consultations and have a committee to talk about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597720">The report was tabled after a committee talked about it and made recommendations. What is needed now is federal leadership. However, a year and a half later, another report has been done with no follow-through. In fact, the Liberals could not give any coherent, specific update on this issue, which tells us everything we need to know about how the federal government is truly broken.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597721"> The other issue we have is that the federal government needs to get its act together. It says that the provinces and municipalities are partners and players on this issue. However, the federal government has not even gotten itself organized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597722">Here is a point of reflection: What minister and department have the lead on the St. Lawrence River and the health of our rivers? I could not say. Transport Canada, one federal department and minister, has some say in some parts and jurisdictions of the river. We have Fisheries and Oceans Canada, another minister and department. We have Public Services and Procurement Canada. We have Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada, another department and minister. We also have Global Affairs Canada and the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597723"> Another big issue is the IJC, the International Joint Commission. It works to regulate water levels, which have been a major issue in our part of the St. Lawrence River, Lake St. Lawrence. If that was not enough, there was a suggestion a while ago, during this report, that the Canada Water Agency of the federal government should have some sort of lead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597724">Here we have six different ministers and departments and nobody is taking the lead. The federal government is saying it is having meetings with provinces and municipalities and it wants to study this further, but the government cannot even get its own house in order when it comes to which department, which part of the federal government, should take a singular, focused lead on the health and vitality of the St. Lawrence River, specifically addressing shoreline erosion. It has not figured that out after being in office for nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597725">The government brags about all the money it has spent “directly or indirectly”. That was a quote from this morning. It has spent billions of dollars, so directly or indirectly it has probably helped the St. Lawrence River. However, the government cannot even tangibly say how, after it doubled the national debt to $1.2 trillion. It has increased year-over-year spending, annual spending, by $151 billion. The Liberals spend $151 billion more per year now than when they came into office nine years ago. That is $10,000 more per year per Canadian family, and they cannot point to anything they have done about the issue of soil erosion and the leadership they say they are trying to provide when it comes to shoreline erosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597726"> My part of the St. Lawrence River is a good example. There is no leadership to even coordinate a coherent response. At the end of the day, which people are suffering when we have issues of shoreline erosion? It is private property owners, who are out hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the municipal infrastructure, beaches and waterfront enjoyed by the community. There is no leadership or coordination at all from the federal government year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597727">What we said as Conservatives when contributing to this report is that if the government is spending $150 billion more per year and our national debt has been doubled, surely there should be existing programs. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was used by the government when it came in, allocating over $1.3 billion to it. It has now suspended all that and no projects were done, but consultants and bureaucracies got rich and got ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597728"> We are not seeing frontline results after years and years of neglect on this issue. At the end of the day, we need more leadership and need the federal government to step up, get coordinated and get some things done, not do another committee report and study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597738">The petitioners are asking for Parliament to address an urgent issue impacting the health and safety of firefighters across Canada. The petition calls for an immediate action to ban per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in firefighter gear and firefighting foam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597739">PFAS are man-made chemicals resistant to heat, water and oil, but their durability comes at a significant cost. Scientific evidence links these substances to severe health risks, including cancer, putting firefighters, who already face hazardous conditions, at greater risk. Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597740">We must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control in their working conditions. Several countries have restricted PFAS use. Canada must follow suit. Our firefighters deserve gear free from toxic chemicals. Let us all protect those who risk their lives for us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597747">Madam Speaker, the next petition I am tabling is regarding the brutal regime in Eritrea. Petitioners raise a number of different concerns related to the actions of that regime. They highlight how Eritrea has been ruled by an authoritarian, brutal dictator, under a totalitarian system, for the last 30 years, with no constitution, no election, no parliament, no freedom of the press and no freedom of movement and association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597748">Petitioners identify the large number of people who have left Eritrea as a result of the repression.

Petitioners also want to draw attention to the way that the Eritrean regime collaborates with Vladimir Putin and supports the Russian government's colonial activities in Africa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597749">The specific asks of the petition, therefore, are for the Government of Canada to engage political and human rights activists and pro-democracy groups, to take a leadership role among western allies, to challenge the Eritrean dictator's malicious conspiracy with Vladimir Putin, and to investigate instances of foreign interference of Eritrea in Canada and take appropriate action in response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597761">Madam Speaker, the next petition I am tabling relates to the Liberal government's feminist international assistance policy. The petitioners highlight the Auditor General's report, which shows that the Liberal approach to international development for women and girls has been criticized by the Auditor General for failing to measure results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597762">The petitioners further note that this policy has shown a lack of respect for cultural values and autonomy of women in the developing world by supporting organizations that violate local laws and push western priorities at the expense of local development priorities, such as clean water, access to basic nutrition and economic development. The petitioners further argue that the Muskoka initiative launched by the previous Conservative government involved historic investments in the well-being of women and girls around the world, emphasizing value for money and ensuring that investments were in priorities identified by local communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597763">The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to align international development spending with the approach taken in the Muskoka initiative, focusing international development dollars on meeting the basic needs of vulnerable women around the world, rather than pushing ideological agendas that conflict with local values in developing countries. They also want to see an approach that actually constructively measures outcomes.</ParaText>

In particular, the petitioners are concerned about a 2021 platform commitment that the Liberals made to deny the charitable status of organizations that have opinions about abortion that are different from the Liberal Party's opinion. The petitioners note that this proposal would jeopardize the charitable status of hospitals, houses of worship, schools, homeless shelters and other charitable organizations that do not agree with the Liberal Party approach to these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597770">The petitioners also note that the government has previously applied a values test to discriminate against worthy applicants to the Canada summer jobs program. They say that charities and other not-for-profit organizations should not be discriminated against on the basis of their political views. The petitioners call on the House of Commons to protect and preserve the application of charitable status on a politically and ideologically neutral basis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597779">Madam Speaker, for anyone just tuning in now, I will recap the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597780">The Liberals chose a group of well-connected elites to give out money on behalf of the government. Those chosen elites then gave the money to companies they either owned or had a financial interest in. When these acts of blatant corruption were reported to the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, Liberals tried to cover it up. Parliament investigated the corruption and the House ordered the government to hand over all documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597781">The Communist-praising <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided he did not need to listen to Parliament. His government refused to hand over all the documents without redactions. Now we are here debating a motion calling on the government to respect the will of Canadians, who elected this Parliament. We are not going to stop debating this motion until the government hands over the documents. To do anything less would mean throwing the towel in on parliamentary democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597782">How do we think this will end? Do we think Canadians are going to rise up in protest that the government's terrible agenda is not sailing through? Do Liberals imagine the Liberal Party base forming a massive convoy of luxury SUVs to come to Ottawa? Do they think a long trail of EVs leaving from Rosedale, the Glebe and Westmount will come riding to their rescue? That is an adorable little fantasy that the Liberals have over there, but it is time for a safe supply of reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597783">Most Canadians oppose the government. They oppose its plan to censor Canadians. They oppose its plan to increase taxes. They oppose its plan to ban plastic food packaging. They oppose its plan to ban livestock farming. They oppose the preaching, hectoring and anti-Canadian attitude that comes out of the government. Canadians want to see the government defeated. It cannot happen soon enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597784">The scandal involving the Liberals' green slush fund is just the tip of the iceberg. As I mentioned in my speech yesterday, the Liberals chose a group of well-connected elites to hand out money on behalf of the government. Those chosen elite then gave the money to companies they either owned or had a financial interest in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597785">Instead of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, we now have the local journalism initiative. One difference between the conflict-of-interest scandal at SDTC and the conflict-of-interest scandal with the local journalism initiative is that SDTC was accountable to Parliament through a minister. That is why employees were able to blow the whistle to the deputy minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597786">The Liberals did not put the local journalism initiative into an independent agency reporting to Parliament. Instead, they gave the money to lobbyist organizations that campaigned for the cash in the first place. The lobbyists then appointed the owners and executives of media outlets to hand out the funds to the chosen media outlets. Those owners and executives then gave the cash to their own companies. These would be the same media owners and executives who control the media lobbyist associations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597787">Whether it is SDTC, the local journalism initiative or a billion bucks for WE Charity, it is always the same thing. The Liberals are handing out other people's money to the well-connected Laurentian elite in a circle of self-dealing. Canadians are sick and tired of the corrupt, incompetent government. It needs to hand over the documents to the RCMP. Then it is will be time to call the election Canadians badly need.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The first scandal in the top three is the SNC Lavalin affair. This started when the Liberals snuck a change to the Criminal Code into the budget bill to allow the government to make deals with corporations found guilty of corruption. Again, pre-empting: “We know there will be corrupt people, so let’s find a way out for them.” This came after months of intense lobbying by SNC Lavalin officials</QuotePara>

For example, she indicated that we have SDTC, an organization that went awry, which is actually at arm's-length from the government, I must add. She gave the impression that the government did nothing, which is just not true. There were two internal investigations. The board has been replaced, and we have a freeze on new funding. That is action.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597794">In this instance, SDTC had existed since the early 2000s, and it had run fairly unproblematically until the government took power. It was providing money to companies that provided jobs and grew into multi-million dollar businesses. Because that money was frozen, we now have several companies that were ready to launch into other countries, based on that income. Instead, they ended up having to pay extra taxes and leave Canada altogether. That is one of the implications of the actions that were taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597795">In terms of the documents, we need those. We only know about the $400 million that has been misspent out of a billion dollars allocated every year. I know that they do not want those pages released, but there is so much more corruption to uncover.</ParaText>

The former attorney general was not of the opinion that SNC-Lavalin met the criteria in the provisions added to the Criminal Code just months before, but the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sent his most trusted adviser and his Clerk of the Privy Council to make it clear to the minister that she had better obey or else.

He did not have the same moral compass as Ms. Wilson-Raybould; he was just happy to be in cabinet, so he signed whatever paper the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put in front of him.

There is no word of dispute from me as to the chronology, except for this: We do not know that the people who were put on that board had any connection to any political party at all. In fact, the chair of the board, who egregiously violated conflict of interest standards, was an adviser to Jim Flaherty, much-admired former minister of finance under Stephen Harper, and to Stephen Harper himself. In other words, like many people in business in Canada, this person seems to have made sure that they had favours with many different parties and were not associated with any one in particular.</ParaText>

This probably explains why, during one of my constituency clinics in Renfrew, I had a couple come all the way from her riding to make an appointment to see me. They had grown up in Renfrew and, from time to time, they had seen the writings that we had handed out to their family members. They wanted to tell me first-hand that they wanted a Conservative riding represented where they live. They want a Conservative to be elected in her riding, and they want her out. This is why.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278655" Type="2">Ms. Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné (Terrebonne, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8597817">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to a privilege motion that is very important to me because the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, of which I am vice-chair, is right in the middle of its study on Sustainable Development Technology Canada, following the Auditor General's report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597818">I will start by putting my cards on the table. Over the past few days, people have said that there was obstruction going on in Parliament and that this privilege motion was just a way to keep the government from moving forward or doing anything. I just wanted to mention this. This is not just about the primacy of Parliament. For starters, even if the government had a majority, it would have been wrong, because it is the duty of this Parliament to keep an eye on what the government is doing. There is a clear separation of powers. Parliament must be able to deal with important issues. I will delve into some aspects of that. Parliament must be able to ensure that the government is governing effectively, in the best-case scenario, or at least that there is no corruption. In this case, there appears to have been corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597819">This not just a question of the primacy of Parliament. Democracy is based on trust. The government has repeatedly demonstrated that people should not necessarily trust its work. Since it refuses to hand over documents to Parliament, it appears to have something to hide. What does the government have to hide? It is all well and good to shelter behind the virtue of keeping the RCMP and the Auditor General independent. Of course, no one questions that. However, it is important for our duty as parliamentarians that all the requested documents be given to the law clerk and parliamentary counsel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597820">At this point, the Liberals seem to be trying to hide potentially damning evidence. Some will say that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> acted quickly and SDTC was abolished. In fact, SDTC, which was created in 2001, was abolished because the Auditor General's report had identified so many problems that it was better to scrap SDTC altogether. Excellent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597821">The minister also arranged to have the board of directors changed completely. Now there are only three people on the board. I should point out that one of them appeared before the committee yesterday. Despite her $1,500-a-day salary, she was unable to answer any questions clearly and precisely. However, she has been in the position for four months. It took several points of order and reactions from the committee chair for the witness to simply say that she did not know the answer or to finally agree to answer parliamentarians' questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597822">The SDTC executives were not affected. The Auditor General's report identified some issues, but so far, not much has happened in committee. However, a lot of things were identified in that report. The executives were not affected, but the former president and CEO resigned at the end of 2023. Apparently, she is now enrolled in a very expensive program at Harvard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597823">I will give some examples of very problematic matters that are tied to this former president and CEO that the House should also be seized with. Other executives who are implicated in the Auditor General's report still have not appeared at committee because they are on sick leave. We respect that, but it is preventing us from moving forward with our study. What we are asking for in exchange for the fact that we cannot receive key witnesses is the government's co-operation. However, the government is still refusing to provide Parliament with the documents that would enable it to be fully informed when it deals with the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597824">The government tells us that we must look ahead and consider everything that has been done. However, when a board member who is meant to oversee the transition is incapable of answering parliamentarians' questions, we have serious questions about that transition, the reasons for the transition and the government's willingness to actually recover this money and invest it in projects that are genuinely eligible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597825">Here is an example of a question the board member was unable to answer yesterday. It had to do with SDTC's response to one of the recommendations in the Auditor General's report. No, SDTC did not agree with all of the recommendations. There was just one recommendation that it partially agreed with. It was this: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597826">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Sustainable Development Technology Canada should reassess projects approved during the audit period to ensure that they met the goal and objectives of the Sustainable Development Technology Fund and all its eligibility criteria.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597827">This recommendation seems quite clear, yet it has only been partially accepted. Why is that? It is because SDTC hires consultants to come in and review all projects. Yesterday, the board member was unable to assure me that, if the Auditor General had designated a project as ineligible, it would remain ineligible. I was told that if consultants then came in and said the project was eligible, they would probably win that one. That means that SDTC is not even in a position to accept all the Auditor General's recommendations and agree that certain projects deemed ineligible by the Auditor General of Canada are in fact deemed ineligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597828">There is more. The contracts have been drawn up so that they cannot be broken unless the company commits fraud. This means that, in the case of the ineligible project I just described, the company simply applied. It was told that there was money in the fund and that all it had to do was apply. The company did not commit fraud. It was SDTC that accepted ineligible projects, even in cases of conflict of interest. People were friends with company representatives. No problem, the company gets money. However, the contract cannot be broken. This means that projects deemed ineligible by the Auditor General, and which could be deemed ineligible by the consultants, will continue to receive public money. These are ineligible projects, projects that do not comply with the contribution agreements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597829">That means things are worse than we thought. Not only are they unable to get back funds from ineligible projects, they stopped funding a lot of projects. Incidentally, the board member was unable to confirm for me that not a single penny of SDTC funding had been allocated to companies since the start of the year, despite her $1,500-a-day salary, I would remind the House. There is more. Since the government cannot break its contracts with these ineligible companies, it has to keep funding them. That is highly problematic. Ineligible companies will keep getting funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597830">Here is another example. Consider SDTC's more recently created ecosystem fund. It was a secret fund that was never announced or mentioned even on the website. Certain apps can trace websites over time and reveal what they looked like before. We took a look.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597831">It was not a publicly available fund. I assume that only businesses contacted by certain members could receive funding. One example is ALUS, which received $5 million. As we know, and as various witnesses said several times, that company was not eligible, mainly because of problems related to financial standards, but also, as we heard, because it did not fund or support the development or demonstration of new technologies. Nevertheless, that company received $5 million from a secret fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597832">This company had something special, and her name is Aldyen Donnelly. According to the former CEO, Ms. Lawrence, whom I mentioned earlier, she is a very good friend and they have known each other for 20 years. Yes, that is what she said when she appeared before the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. Ms. Donnelly stood to make quite a tidy sum as a subcontractor for ALUS. Now she works for that company, which received $5 million in public money even though it did not meet any of the criteria. That is great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597833">If money is still owed, these companies will continue to receive public funds. I am repeating that because it is really very problematic for me. ALUS may be one of them. If that company is still owed money, it will be impossible to get the money back or break the contract, because the company itself did not commit fraud. If the company is still owed money, the fund must pay it, or the government will be sued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597834">What firm helped SDTC write its contracts? Osler, apparently. Yes, that was the very same firm that advised Ms. Verschuren on conflict of interest issues and told her that she did not need to recuse herself from decisions. It was the very same firm that told SDTC it could approve projects by the dozen, without having the board review each one, during COVID-19. Yesterday, the board member confirmed that Osler is still advising SDTC. There is no clear break. There is no good faith there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597835">Here is another example. Osler advises a fund called Active Impact. This fund, advised by Osler, has a portfolio that somewhat resembles that of SDTC. Osler advises SDTC on the eligibility of projects, on how to approve projects, yet Osler also advises a fund that will invest in the same companies that SDTC invests in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597836">All the examples I am providing cannot be set out in an Auditor General's study, because they go beyond the scope of what the Auditor General can audit. On the other hand, they are exactly what this Parliament needs to address. I have plenty of examples like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597837">Tomorrow, we will be hearing from the former industry minister. We have a lot of questions for him, and I would rather save them for tomorrow. That said, there are still many things about SDTC that are dubious. Each stone we turn over reveals a new element that interests us and that should interest the entire House and the Quebeckers and Canadians who are listening to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597838">I gave many examples, including the case of the current director who refused to answer questions and repeated the same talking points even after the committee chair asked her several times to answer parliamentarians' questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597839">Finally, we have to wonder who is doing the obstructing. Is the opposition obstructing Parliament with this privilege motion? Is it not really the government that is obstructing Parliament by refusing to answer parliamentarians' questions? Even people appointed by the government are refusing to answer questions in committee. Furthermore, in the House, the government is refusing to answer questions and accusing the opposition of being short-sighted and trying to obstruct Parliament. The Conservatives may have a slight inclination in that direction, but I can assure my colleagues that we do not. I do not think it is necessarily the case for the NDP either.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597840">What we want is answers. With all the information I just mentioned, some of which was sent to me by the whistle-blower, we need to get to the bottom of things. Yes, it was the whistle-blower at SDTC, someone not yet protected by our legal system, who shared that information with me, all of which was validated by my team. We have to look into this, and there must be consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597841">As I said, there is no point in asking the Auditor General of Canada to look at these issues again, because it exceeds her authority under the Auditor General Act, which determines the scope of the files she can look at and where she can go to audit. She cannot necessarily go and check the financial standards of the companies that have received funding. In this case, she simply looked at a sample of an SDTC project over a number of years. However, what the Office of the Auditor General found was serious enough for the fund to be abolished. Again, the fund had existed for 23 years. It was a success. It would appear that the Liberals have something to hide, and this may be one of the reasons why they refuse to hand over all the requested documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597842">It is also important to point out that one of the reasons the Bloc Québécois supports this question of privilege is that we recognize that this fund was useful and that the funding granted by SDTC was useful in most cases. Most of the small and medium-sized businesses that received funding had nothing to do with the examples that I gave of conflict of interest or ineligibility. They had nothing to do with that. On the contrary, they need that money to operate. The federal government finally had a useful fund that was financing a number of projects. In my riding and in the ridings of some of my colleagues, there are some wonderful companies with great ideas and new clean technologies that we will need if we are to make a green transition. However, the Liberal Party has just shown us what it does best, and that is taking good ideas and ruining them. That is what it did with SDTC. It ruined a great fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597843">Here is another example of a question the board member was unable to answer yesterday. What will happen to the funds that SDTC has not used? Several hundreds of millions of dollars have not yet been allocated to companies. That money is in SDTC's coffers and will be transferred to the National Research Council of Canada, then to a Crown corporation that will distribute the funding. Neither the Privy Council nor the board member who was appointed four months ago were able to tell me whether these funds will be used to meet the same objectives, namely sustainable development objectives. No one is able to answer me, neither the Privy Council nor the current SDTC board of directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597844">No one can say whether the funding that was allocated for clean, green technologies will be knowingly used for such purposes. We do not know, so we are still in the dark. What a great transition, eh? We do not have any answers to questions, we are not being given the documents, and no one can answer such simple and well-meaning questions as this: “What will that money be used for from now on?” Actually, we do know what it will be used for. If the Conservatives take power, then it is possible that the money will not be used for clean technologies but may instead be used to buy more pipelines or to subsidize western oil. That is why the Conservatives and the Liberal government agree on one thing, that it was a good idea to abolish the fund, even if it is for different reasons. For some, it was to get rid of evidence, while for others, it was to get rid of a green fund. It is that simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597845">Despite all this information coming to light by the day, I would still like to mention one thing. We do not dispute the independence of the Auditor General of Canada, and I think that the original motion was flawed in that regard. It is not up to us, in Parliament, to hold the Auditor General of Canada to account. However, and this is why I am rising in the House today, it is of the utmost importance that, when we ask the government for documents, it provide them to us in a timely manner and unredacted. Not only is this consistent with our parliamentary standards and responsibilities, it is also the government's duty to provide us with such documents. The truth is sorely needed in this matter. I will therefore address my comments here through the Chair to the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8597846">If it is going to lose the next election, then let it lose with its head held high. The government should end on a good note by getting to the bottom of the SDTC affair. We need this, and a lot of questions have been raised. Let it finish with its head held high.</ParaText>

The food banks across northwestern Ontario are running out of supplies because demand is so high, and Canadians are paying $700 more for groceries this year than they did in 2023.

              <ParaText id="8597898"> Mr. Speaker, the third report on “The State of Canada's Birds” was released today by Birds Canada and Environment Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597899">Birds are literally the canaries in the coal mine for our environmental health, and previous reports from 2012 and 2019 raised some serious red flags. Today's report shows that some of those concerns are getting worse. For instance, grassland birds have declined by two-thirds since 1970, so something is clearly going wrong in our grasslands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597900">However, these reports also show that, when we know what is going wrong and have the political will to fix it, we can see dramatically positive results. Hawks, eagles and falcons have increased by a third since 1970 because we banned DDT. Waterfowl have also increased because we started conserving their habitats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597901">We know all this about bird populations because of the thousands of talented volunteers who go out every day to count birds. These citizen scientists have given us an incredibly powerful measure of the health of our forests, grasslands and waters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8597902">Mr. Speaker, October 18 is homelessness awareness night, when we will once again gather to shine a light on a reality that is affecting far too many people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597903">This year's theme, the 100 faces of homelessness, draws attention to the fact that behind the often misunderstood word “homeless” are people with diverse backgrounds and stories, in other words, human beings. Homelessness does not have just one face. A young man who ran away from an unstable home, an isolated senior who has been forgotten by society, a worker in a precarious financial situation who is unable to make ends meet or an individual who is suffering from mental health problems or addiction can all be homeless. No matter how they may appear to us, they are all human beings with hopes and dreams and a desire to find meaning in their life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8597904">Homelessness awareness night is more than just an event. It is a reminder of our collective responsibility, because behind every face there is a person with a story, who deserves to be heard, respected and supported.</ParaText>

Hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs will be created, but these jobs are not guaranteed. To get them, we need an ambitious climate plan.

Unfortunately, the Bloc Québécois sided with the Conservatives to vote against renewable energy.

              <ParaText id="8598135">The member explained that while the committee was still debating a substantive motion that day, the chair proceeded to the putting of the question on the motion, despite her clearly manifested intention to continue debating the motion. This, she argued, violated Standing Order 116(2), which prevents committee chairs from cutting off debate on a motion when there are committee members still wishing to debate it. She asked the Speaker to use the authority conferred in Standing Order 116(2) to nullify the proceedings on the motion in question and to allow the member to voice her views on it prior to the committee coming to a decision.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598137">In response, the chair of the committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278391" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation>, assured the House that he believed that the debate had concluded with no further members wishing to speak to the motion. He explained that he did not do so precipitously, wanting to ensure that no member of the committee wished to make additional remarks. He explained that, from his perspective, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278266" Type="2">Mississauga—Erin Mills</Affiliation> had indicated a desire to speak, but only after the question had been called. He also explained that he had informed the member and the committee that the question had been put and that the only remedy would be for her to appeal his decision.

              <ParaText id="8598147">The Speaker reviewed the events that occurred at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on September 23, 2024, including relevant video clips, as well as the back-and-forth discussion that occurred between the member and the committee chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598148"> I would like to make three points about those events. First, it was helpful that the member first raised her concerns about wishing to speak to the motion in committee before doing so in the House. This made it easier to follow the chain of events.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598149">Related to that discussion in committee, and my second point, is an argument advanced by the committee chair, as to the fact that the chair's decision was appealed and sustained. This has no bearing on the procedural soundness of the proceedings on the committee motion. As Standing Order 116(2)(a) denotes in its last sentence, and I quote: “A decision of the Chair in this regard may not be subject to an appeal to the committee.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598150">Therefore, this is not an argument that I considered in assessing this point of order and all members need to be mindful that this is not an option when such situations arise during debate in committee. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598151">Third, the Speaker is convinced that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278266" Type="2">Mississauga—Erin Mills</Affiliation> sincerely believed that she had flagged her intent to speak again on the motion and had reason to believe that the committee chair would recognize her before putting the question on the motion. I am equally satisfied that the committee Chair thought that no other committee member wished to continue debate. With that said, from viewing the video of the meeting, it would certainly appear that very little time was afforded to committee members by the chair to indicate their desire to continue debate on the motion before the question was put.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598152">These points provide important context in considering this matter. There is no evidence of an intent to manipulate the process of debate by the chair's proceeding to a decision on the motion in question in this instance, but rather this appears to be a misunderstanding between the member and the chair. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278391" Type="2">New Brunswick Southwest</Affiliation> seems to have operated in good faith in presiding over the committee proceedings on September 23, 2024.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598153">That being said, such a miscommunication between the committee chair and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278266" Type="2">Mississauga—Erin Mills</Affiliation> seems to have led to the unfortunate circumstance of the member missing an opportunity to contribute to debate.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598154">Nevertheless, in the circumstances, I cannot conclude that the committee chair violated Standing Order 116(2). The proceedings of the committee on September 23 can stand. The Chair's decision is in part influenced by the fact that this is still a relatively untested standing order, and that guidance has not really been provided to committee chairs. Going forward, it is likely that the Chair will take a more rigid approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598155">Accordingly, to avoid a repetition of this situation, I wish to provide guidance for the benefit of all committee chairs and members.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598156"> When a chair begins to discern that debate is nearing completion, before putting the question, they should take great care to ensure that no other members might wish to debate a motion. For instance, they should call for “resuming debate” or ask members if they are ready for the question. This is similar to the practice in the House and one that committee chairs should emulate.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598157">As well, when members wish to have their name added to the speaking list in committee, they should also ensure they receive an acknowledgement from the chair or the clerk that their name has been added to the list. As members know, it is often the committee clerk who maintains a speaking list for use by the chair. Indeed, it is a best practice that the committee clerk maintains such a list.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598177">The government would love us to think that this is a debate about some documents or a committee, and that, as the member just stated, we are delaying documents' going to a committee. In fact the debate is all about privilege and the fact that the power of the House is absolute. When the House, which stands for the people, demands documents and the government says no, when the opposition parties, not just the Conservatives but also the NDP and the Bloc, ask for documents and the Liberal government says no, that is a defiance of the people and of the absolute power of this place.</ParaText>

Mr. Harper refused to provide documents about the war in Afghanistan and he lost. Ultimately, he had to hand them over. We hope that the same situation will not persist as long, and that we will get the Liberal Party's documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598180">Second, as I mentioned in my speech, this is not just about the primacy of Parliament. Even if the government had a majority, it would be important that it bring the documents to the House. Other questions remain unanswered and are beyond the scope of what the Auditor General of Canada is able to obtain under the Auditor General Act. It is important for this Parliament to address these issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598181"> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for her tremendous work at the public accounts committee, where this issue arose. I want to ask the member directly about this serious issue when it comes to the financial accountability of the government. There are two members who are neither Liberal nor Conservative at the committee: myself and the hon. member. We often deal with the financial accountability of the government when we see audits related to this work. We have a serious issue that was presented to us, so of course we voted together to ensure that we got accountability for the documents at our committee. This is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598182">What I find troubling is that the Conservatives are only worried about fiscal accountability when it means scoring points for themselves. They are not worried about the financial accountability that comes from trying to learn from their own mistakes when they were in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598183">Could the member please talk about the fact that there is a lot to be learned from the fact that previous governments in Canada, including former Conservative governments, have had serious issues of accountability and corruption?

              <ParaText id="8598186">It is true that the Conservatives will often take on an issue just because it suits their purposes or because it will provide them with nice video clips. However, this issue goes deeper than that. It is not just about video clips, moral authority or fiscal responsibility. It is more than that. We are talking about serious allegations of corruption, potential fraud and potential embezzlement.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8598188"> Madam Speaker, all political power is trust, and when the trust is broken, the power is lost. After nine years of this Liberal government, Canadians have lost trust in this government. To break down what this debate is for people at home, there is $400 million that was misspent in 186 cases of conflict of interest; there is accountability that this House demands; and when we look at the fact that this whole $400 million was supposed to be for creating jobs that Canadians desperately want and need, what it really comes down to in this debate today is a matter of privilege and trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598189">The people in the committee demanded answers. Then in this House, we have demanded that the documents involved be submitted to the RCMP. The government has refused the absolute power of this House to give what the people asked for, which were documents related to conflict of interest and to the misspending of $400 million, and for that money, those documents and all the information therein to be given to those who investigate at the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598190">This debate here in the House is a matter of privilege. It is not about whether we should do the right thing and just send it to committee. The government was asked to do something by the people in the House of Commons and the government is refusing to do that. That is the debate we are having here today. There is an important saying that the Constitution was created not to protect the government from the people, but to protect the people from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598191">What is at stake here is accountability, the power of the House of Commons, and transparency and trust for all of government, not just the government that is in power. Parliamentary oversight is essential for accountability. The role of Parliament is to hold the government accountable. By refusing to comply with the House of Commons and produce documents, the government undermines this principle and sets a dangerous precedent for evading oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598192"> Parliament is like the referee of a hockey game. Without it, the government would just try to score while breaking every rule in the book. Parliament is like the dentist to the government. They do not want to visit, but without it, things would rot fast. Parliament is like Simon Cowell to the government's talent show. They need to hear the harsh truth, whether they like it or not. Parliament is like one's mom checking their room after they cleaned it. The government might think they are off the hook, but Parliament is going to find the mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598193"> That is the power of government, and that is the power of Parliament. We call ourselves His Majesty's loyal opposition, and we take that role very seriously. As much as we hear today that the government does not like us making videos or talking on social media, that is our job at this point. We would love to be in government someday, and we talk to Canadians about what we might do differently, but the role we have here today is to hold the government to account and to find the mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598194">In committees, we find that we work well with other parties when it comes to certain matters sometimes. When it comes to looking at accountability, in this instance, we will find in this House that it is not just the Conservatives but also the NDP and the Bloc members who have all come together and demanded accountability from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598195">To put it in another perspective, for those Canadians at home, what does that matter and what does that mean? Government's power and Parliament's power are absolute. We can talk about another procedure and we can talk about the charter, but nothing is more powerful than that absolute right from the House of Commons and a directive from the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598196">This means that when the House of Commons comes together and asks for documents and for evidence, the government needs to provide those documents and that evidence. It is not a maybe; it is not a “can be”. To relate this to the government, let us look at what would happen if the CRA came to me and asked for my financial records and my taxes. However, if, instead of complying, I only gave them a few documents or maybe redacted documents and said I did not want CRA knowing about this part of my business or my personal life, what would happen? There would be fines, penalties and possible jail time. To Canadians at home, this House of Commons is the CRA to the government. This House of Commons has the power to ask for documents and it has to ensure that the government listens to that directive.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598197">There is also the issue of respecting the rule of law on parliamentary privilege. The government's refusal to comply with a clear order of the House of Commons violates the rule of law and weakens the democratic process. If Parliament is to maintain its role as a guardian of democracy, it must stand firm in asserting its privileges. Today, all we hear from the government is, “Just send it to committee. There is the compromise. Just send it to committee.” The concern with that is that if we just send it to committee, we are just delaying this issue down the road. It has already happened and we are here only because it was delayed down the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598198">This first came to light and the order was made back on June 10. On June 10, the government was asked to hand over to the RCMP what it had in its possession. I am just going to go over what was handed and what was not handed over because the government does say that it handed documents from some organizations and we have some of this documentation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598199"> Well, yes, the Canada School of Public Service, Canada Energy Regulator, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Library and Archives Canada, and the Office of Privacy Commissioner have given full compliance, and there are a few others. Without redactions and with partial delayed compliance were the Department of Finance and Treasury Board Secretariat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598200">Then, we have redacted records. The redacted records are documents with a bunch of black on them. Sometimes, whole sheets are blacked out. We have Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; Business Development Bank of Canada; Canada Revenue Agency; Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; Department of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities; and Department of Justice, partial compliance by deadline, with one tranche deposited before transmission to the RCMP, another tranche deposited after transmittal and many documents withheld entirely; Department of National Defence; Department of Natural Resources, but limited scope of production to directors general and above; Department of Public Works and Government Services; Department of Western Economic Diversification; Export Development Canada; Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario; Pacific Economic Development Canada; Privy Council Office; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Standards Council of Canada; and Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, the whole organization we are trying to look at.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598201">We had full-out refusal from two departments, saying they were not getting us any documents: the Communications Security Establishment and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598202">It was a simple request, and we can see from multiple departments there was never a simple answer and the documents were never given to where they needed to go. The government's claim that handing over unredacted documents would violate the charter is just an excuse to dodge accountability. Let us be clear: The charter protects individual rights and not the government's right to hide how it spent taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598203"> Imagine again if someone being audited by CRA said, “I am not handing over my documents because it is a violation of my rights.” That would not fly. CRA would demand full transparency because it is about accountability and ensuring no wrongdoing occurred. This is not a charter violation. It is about the government trying to cover its tracks. Canadians have the right to know where their money went and the government cannot use the charter as a shield to avoid answering for potential misuse of public funds. If the government really believes in transparency, it should hand over the full documents and let the facts speak for themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598204">History provides us with lessons on the consequences of defying parliamentary authority. Let us not forget the case of King Charles I, who refused to acknowledge Parliament's rights and authority. His actions led to a constitutional crisis and his eventual downfall. While we live in a very different time, the principle remains the same: When the executive refuses to respect the will of Parliament, it weakens democracy and erodes the foundations of governance. The government may argue that Parliament overstepped by ordering documents to be handed to the RCMP, but this claim does not hold up. Parliament has the power to demand documents from the government, period. The RCMP can review and investigate if needed, but Parliament is tasked with holding the government accountable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598205"> In the ruling, the Speaker clearly affirmed that the House of Commons has the absolute authority to demand documents from the government without limits unless it explicitly decides otherwise. The government's argument that sharing these documents with the RCMP oversteps Parliament's authority does not hold up under these established rules. The Speaker acknowledged this authority, stating that the motion for the production of documents has already been passed and should have been complied with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598206">The Speaker also recommended that the matter be referred to a committee for further study, citing the unusual nature of the order, specifically the fact that it involves sending the documents to a third party. However, this suggestion is procedural. It does not negate the original demand from Parliament. We have an absolute right as parliamentarians to demand the production of documents, and the government has to produce those documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598207">Here is why the committee route is also not appropriate for this case. Parliament already made a clear demand, which came from committee, and referring this issue to a committee is a way to delay compliance and avoid accountability. The Speaker stated that the government has not fully complied with the order and that the House has the right to decide whether it is satisfied with the response, not a committee. Delaying by sending it to a committee is kicking the can down the road, wasting more time instead of giving Canadians the transparency they deserve right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598208">Canadians have so much pain. We spend our time in our constituencies, and all of us know that Canadians are having a hard time feeding and housing themselves right now. They are having a hard time going to the grocery store. These are real issues. I talk routinely about the problems we have with everyday items that other people across the world can afford, like cellphones. The average cellphone bill right now in Canada is over $106. As Canadians use more data, they are finding their cellphone bills have gone up. Telus and Bell just announced they are going to increase the rates for international roaming, at a time when we already pay the highest fees. They are just finding more ways to get money out of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598209">We can talk about other big issues. Let us look at trade and what has happened in Canada since we signed CUSMA. Canada was kicked out of the negotiations at the G7 summit for three months when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made the comment that we were not helping. Trade negotiators were kicked out for three months. Mexico made a better deal with the Americans, and what has happened? Mexico is now the Americans' number one trade partner when it used to be Canada. That is two million jobs, trade and paycheques for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598210"> We have a duty in this House, and we all speak as parliamentarians. When we are elected, we all do it for one “why”. My why has always been my children and others who want to have a better life in Canada. I want a good life for my children and grandchildren. I want them to be able to afford a home, go to the grocery store and afford groceries, get a good education, get good health care and get a good job that pays a good paycheque so they can live a life. I want that for all Canadians. However, the more we are enthralled by issues that waste taxpayer money, by high taxes and by issues that make Canadians unable to find and afford a home, the more the dream is slipping away for many Canadians. It is so bad that the children of Canadians who do not have a home now will probably not be able to afford one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598211">Today, we must reaffirm the supremacy of Parliament and the importance of transparent governance. When this House ordered the production of documents relating to the SDTC scandal, it did so to uphold its duty of accountability to Canadians. Parliament's right to demand documents is absolute. Any suggestion otherwise is a dangerous misinterpretation of democratic principles.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598212">The refusal to comply is not just an oversight; it is a deliberate obstruction of parliamentary privilege. We must not allow any government to selectively decide which rules to follow. This is not a question of politics. This is a question of preserving the integrity of our democracy and the trust of the citizens who elect us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598213">The argument that sending documents to the RCMP violates the charter rights of Canadians is deeply flawed. Parliament's order does not dictate what the RCMP should or should not do with the documents. It simply provides the information necessary to investigate possible wrongdoings. Our role is to ensure no stone is left unturned when public funds are mishandled. The government's attempt to block this process cannot stand. Upholding transparency is not a violation of rights; it is the very act of protecting them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598214">The government's refusal to comply with the House order is a challenge to the authority of this Parliament and a direct affront to the principles of democratic oversight. Today, we must make it clear that no government can shield itself from scrutiny and no charter right can be used to hide the truth from the people. Let the House stand firm in its commitment to uphold democracy, transparency and accountability, for anything less would be an abdication of our duties for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598215">Parliamentary oversight is essential for accountability. Parliament's right to demand documents is absolute. Respect for the rule of law and parliamentary privilege is the whole premise and duty of parliamentarians in this place, the House of Commons. There is no conflict between Parliament and the RCMP. The RCMP can decide to do whatever it likes with the documents that are in front of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598216">Government obstruction is a pattern, and it has happened before. It happened last in 2021 with the national microbiology lab. Two scientists there needed to be examined. This exact same thing happened and it resulted in an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598217">To quote Theodore Roosevelt from back in the 1900s, “No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we require him to obey it.” A hundred years later, the same thing holds true. The government is not above the law and is not below it either, nor do we ask the government's permission when we ask it to obey. This is a privilege motion by the House of Commons, which represents the common people. This place, which we walk into every day, is green to remind us of the people who used to work in the fields, and this place has demanded an answer from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598218">For all of us parliamentarians, who represent the people back home who want accountability and transparency, and on behalf of those people, we ask for our privilege to be honoured.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598256"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in this space to speak to the issues that are important to the good people of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598257"> I was speaking with a constituent in the Nicola Valley, who raised an issue with me about how they were starting to feel about the fact that after the next election there will be changes to our riding boundaries; the Nicola Valley will be in a different riding and I will not be in that particular race. They were commenting about how they did not like the change. I told them that I did not like the change either but that sometimes we need to move with the times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598258">However, I also said that some things should not change. A constituent's member of Parliament, whoever he or she is, should be accountable to them and do their utmost to bring their voice to the chamber. It may be a different member of Parliament, but that should never change. We should always remember who elected us and whom we are here to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598259">This is a reminder to all members who are not members of the cabinet. Essentially, all of us who are not part of the cabinet, the government itself, are here to hold the government to account. As the previous speaker, the member for the <Affiliation DbId="278471" Type="2">Bay of Quinte</Affiliation> said, government is tied to the hip of Parliament to be held accountable. We give it exceptional powers. With those exceptional powers there is supposed to be accountability to the representatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598260">I know that some members have talked about the three different branches: the judiciary, the executive and the legislative. I respect that, but let us respect the place that we are in. Let us respect that we all have that particular job to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598261">One of the interesting arguments I have heard in the media and in the chamber is about issues around charter rights if the government follows through on the original production order made by the chamber. The government said that it cannot share any personal information because it would violate people's charter rights if it gave documents with personal information to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598262">First of all, I would point to section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which essentially says that where Parliament chooses in a free and open democratic society to pass a law that gets what it considers the right balance on charter rights, then that is okay. Ultimately the Supreme Court will determine whether Parliament was able to get the balancing act right. Everything is on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598263">Second, the RCMP is a creation of Parliament. It adheres to our laws, particularly the Privacy Act. In fact, the RCMP website says that with respect to any information supplied to it, the RCMP will follow and adhere to everything required of it under the Privacy Act. The RCMP will not share Canadians' information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598264">As a reminder, here we are, talking about the requirement of the government to produce documents to the chamber that we would give to the RCMP, which, under the Privacy Act, is bound to protect the privacy of individuals who are mentioned. This is information about a program that was funded by taxpayers. Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a federal body created by an act of Parliament. All of its monies and all of its activities were ultimately responsible to the chamber, which was why the former <Affiliation DbId="214319" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> of innovation, science and economic development was the minister responsible to the chamber for the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598265">I think it is important to ask whether the government is saying that if it does produce the documents, the RCMP is going to give out the personal information of people working in a publicly funded program, willy-nilly. That is what it is saying. It is essentially saying that the RCMP is not capable of operating a tight ship, according to the law. That is the criticism the government is laying down by saying that there are privacy concerns.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598266">We are not saying that the information should be given to everyone. The Privacy Act has very clear stipulations about an access to information request and what information one can receive. There are rules that are well codified and well laid out, and ultimately the government should respect that fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598267">Therefore let us put to bed the whole conversation about privacy when it comes to people who have participated in the federal Sustainable Development Technology program and who, as part of that, have voted for their own companies to receive large amounts, in a situation where the Auditor General found huge discrepancies with respect to conflict of interest over hundreds of millions of dollars. I hope we will hear nothing more about the so-called privacy concerns.</ParaText>

One of our members from Ontario, today in question period, raised a really important question, effectively asking what is in the documents that the government would stonewall its obligations to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598283"> Some might just say that it is the egomaniacs who find themselves in the current Prime Minister's Office who are saying, “Let's be obstinate. Let's just say that we don't have to, that we're not subject to them.” Well, the message is that the executive branch rules the roost and that it has no responsibilities to anyone. As someone who believes in the rule of law, I would simply say that it is up to us as an institution, as men and women of the House of Commons, to push back, because no one person is exceptional. That is why we have the rule of law and not the rule of a man or a woman, where they get to decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598284">The second thing I would point out is that when we are talking about the conduct of the current government, its members could be saying, “Wow, we allowed some horrible things to happen, and they could be criminal, definitely unethical, under the SDTC process.” However, now that they realize how shockingly bad it is, they do not want to see the information go to the RCMP, because it may have evidence to open a case file but may not have all the pieces of the puzzle to be able to have a broad range of charges to bring forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598285">I am clearly openly speculating on this. Why am I? It is because in the vacuum provided by the government, speculation will roar in. Why is that? It is because it is a head-scratcher. Why would the government stonewall a production order by the House? It is either because of ego or because it is so overwhelmingly bad that the government does not want to own up to it publicly.</ParaText>

We must not forget we are talking about over 180 conflicts of interest involving $330 million. I know other members have said it is more than that. Those are not the government's dollars, but the dollars of the citizens we represent. They send their hard-earned tax dollars to the government with the expectation that they be treated with care. By being treated with care, they mean not for narrow or partisan interests but for the public interest. How can we tell if money is spent correctly? We may disagree on priorities or the reasons for said spending, but we should always be alerted when an officer of Parliament raises concerns.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598294">What happened? As the Auditor General told us, but only after a whistle-blower came forward, I would add, she discovered that over $330 million in contracts had been improperly awarded by this Liberal-appointed board of directors. She was also surprised to discover that these same Liberal-appointed board members had all kinds of conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598295">One wonders if they were getting advice from Mark Carney back then. Just to recap, there were 186 conflicts of interest involving $330 million that improperly went out the door. Much of this money was directly funnelled into board members' companies. Aside from the obvious conflicts of interest, it was also revealed that some of these projects were not even eligible for funding under this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598296">This is where it gets truly insulting to Canadians. I have constituents who, through no fault of their own, were overpaid CERB money. When this happened, as we all know, the CRA clawed back the money. That is the end of the story, full stop. What happens here? What happens to all the money paid out wrongly to ineligible corporations run by Liberal insiders? Will it be clawed back in the same way it would be for everyday Canadians who work and pay their bills, or will this be different?

              <ParaText id="8598301">I had a constituent ask me if the Liberals are seriously arguing they have a charter right to engage in corruption. On the Liberal side of the House, the members will not want to hear that. They will say that is not what they are trying to say, but the problem for the Liberal government is that this is all Canadians are hearing, because this is what happens when a government has zero credibility and a well-documented track record of corruption and failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598302">To be clear, I also want to say that I realize many members on the Liberal side of the House are not directly responsible for what has happened here. We all know there is a small and powerful group of unelected people within the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office who call the shots. Likewise, we know that certain ministers remain ministers at the Prime Minister's cabinet table because they will do what they are told and they will also look the other way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598303"> This is exactly what allowed the SDTC green slush fund to enrich wealthy Liberal friends and insiders. A minister did what he was told and looked the other way. Only a whistle-blower stood in the way, and now we see a desperate <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office trying to hide behind the charter as a defence for Liberal corruption.</ParaText>

When the members eventually leave this place, either through an election or on their own, and when they look back at this green slush fund, they will know the facts.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8598345">Madam Speaker, today's debate is an important one, as it involves Canadians' hard-earned taxpayer dollars. It involves the ruling of the Speaker with respect to the production of documents ordered by the House, on the scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, something that unfortunately has become known as the Liberal billion-dollar green flush fund. The House had ordered the production of the documents around the scandal to the law clerk, with the intent that the documents could then be provided to the RCMP for investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598346">However, the will of the House has been hijacked by the <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Privy Council Office. In its infinite wisdom, the Prime Minister's department, the PCO, decided to execute the order by telling departments to provide documents but heavily redact them. That decision was a breach of members' privilege. The order was not some plaything for the PCO or the Prime Minister. The order did not ask for redaction. That is why we find ourselves here today, discussing an issue that involves the primacy of Parliament over all things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598347">One would think that is a fairly important element in our Canadian democracy. The matter has also been referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for further consideration. We nonetheless clearly see some objections from the government. Imagine, the government even rolled in allegations that all of this is some alleged breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598348">It strains credulity and it is a total farce to argue a charter breach. Arguing that Parliament cannot receive documents that could assist the RCMP in its investigation of possible wrongdoing is not acceptable. There is no breach of the charter. There is, however, a clear-cut example of obfuscation and of impeding a criminal investigation. How did we get to all of this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598349">A beautifully sounding entity was established in 2001, with an ambitious name: Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It had the noble purpose of giving taxpayer financial assistance to green technology companies before they could become commercialized. It was a marvellous mandate with beneficial objectives, but from the time the Liberal government was elected, unfortunately SDTC controlled a billion dollars of taxpayer money that has since become what is now known today as the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598350">Sadly, some probing by parliamentary committees found cause for serious concern. A whopping 82% of funding transactions approved by the SDTC board of directors during a five-year sample period examined by the Auditor General of Canada were deemed to be “conflicted”. For anyone who understands how auditing is done, that was just a random sample. A random sample produced a whopping 82% of transactions that were conflicted. One does not have to be a professional auditor to realize that if a random sample shows 82%, that is just the tip of the iceberg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598351">According to the Auditor General, the confliction represents $330 million of taxpayer money being given to companies that had a conflict of interest. SDTC board members voted on giving funding to those companies. Moreover, the Auditor General found that the same board thought it was okay to approve another $59 million in projects that they were not authorized to do and that were outside the mandate of the very foundation the government and Parliament set up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598352">To put it bluntly, the board broke SDTC contribution agreements. In their role as SDTC directors, those directors broke Canadian conflict of interest laws as public office holders, and they broke the SDTC Act itself. That is quite the accomplishment. At the very least, such activities uncovered by the Auditor General would certainly warrant examination by appropriate authorities. Why then is it such an affront to the Liberal government and the PCO to have the allegations delved into further by the RCMP?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598353">If laws were broken and a federal act was ignored, why would the government not want to get to the bottom of it? Instead, the government has done its best to circumvent Parliament and an order from the Speaker to provide the documents. Why would that be the case? Why would the government not provide the documents? They are documents that could divulge the existence of improprieties.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598354"> The statutes are clear enough. People who are given Governor in Council appointments by the government to oversee taxpayer money are not to personally profit from their work, nor is their family. However, evidence has come to light that, in a five-year period, there were 405 transactions approved by the board. The Auditor General sampled only 226, about half, and found that 186 of those transactions were conflicted. That is the 82%. That is the $330 million. It is likely that more transactions are conflicted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598355">Is the reluctance exhibited by the Liberals to provide the requested documents predicated on their not wanting to admit that their selected SDTC board directors presided over transactions and gave millions in taxpayer money to the wrong people, who acted to benefit their own companies? Does the government want to know the truth and what the conflicts in question were? We see such a refusal to get to the bottom of what occurred; why would the government not want to know what these conflicts are? What was the value of the benefits obtained, and who benefited? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598356">What is obscene is that, in some cases investigated by the Auditor General, according to meeting minutes, SDTC directors would stay in the room while the board was voting on their own project. What kind of unacceptable procedures and operations were being conducted?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598357"> It is unconscionable that, in one case, a member of the SDTC board received $114 million for green companies that the director had invested in. I guess it is a great game, if one can get it. What is even worse is that, after the SDTC board member's own company received $114 million in taxpayer money, its value tripled. Getting an SDTC grant is a stamp of approval from the Government of Canada that allows these companies to raise other funds. Adding to this case is that the director's lobbyist was the individual's in-house lobbyist for 10 years before he was elected. That lobbyist is none other than the current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598358">Given this kind of activity, it is little wonder that the Liberal government does not want any facts or truths to come forward. This is a disgrace. The government has resisted providing the SDTC documents and, by doing so, has stymied the investigation process. It is clear why. With just a limited examination by the Auditor General, it appears that $390 million of taxpayer money has gone to Liberal insiders. This is likely what the government is attempting to conceal. This is why the Liberal government is opposing that order and the production of documents, which would then be turned over to the RCMP. If the Liberal government wanted to hide what went on within SDTC, producing highly redacted documents would now make perfect sense. Why would the Liberals want to have anything to do with the malfeasance and abuse of taxpayer money? What arrogance is this? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598359">It is likely that the 226 of the 400 or so transactions identified by the Auditor General are just the tip of the money-giveaway iceberg, even though they represent $390 million. Strangely, all of this does not seem to worry the Liberals in the slightest. The SDTC board, by all accounts, appears to have caught on to the game well. It used to put out a quarterly report on every company it dealt with and assisted with funding, but it does not do so anymore. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598360">We are here today debating the Speaker's ruling on the privilege motion with respect to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the PCO, redacting documents. This was done against the House order to provide documents regarding the Liberal green slush fund to the law clerk to be transferred to the RCMP for investigation. We are debating, but there really is no need for debate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598361">There is, however, a great need for upholding the supremacy of Parliament and for our government to support the rule of law rather than trying to subvert it. This issue concerns systemic conflicts of interest and corruption with the green slush fund. At present, we only know that $390 million was disposed of. As of today, a forensic audit has not been done by the Auditor General. The Auditor General did, however, conduct a sampling of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598362">This whole affair is also important because Parliament is the highest court in the land, and the Speaker is its servant. An order from the Speaker must be upheld and not doctored to withhold evidence. These are fundamental elements of democracy. They matter and so does the wise, legal and worthy expenditures of taxpayers' money. Taxpayers work hard, and their money must be used responsibly and in a way that maximizes benefit for them, for Canadians, not Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598363">Instead of focusing on assisting an investigation by the RCMP into what went on with the Liberals' green slush fund, we are here today trying to end the delay and obfuscation to obtain readable evidence and get to the truth. However, the Liberal government is fighting it every step of the way. Why is it that despite the billowing smoke of corruption at such unprecedented levels, the House finds itself having to request that the Liberal government abide by the Speaker's ruling and produce documents that can be read so the information can be transferred to a full investigation by the RCMP? It should be quite straightforward. However, it is far from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598364">The House is in a pitched battle right now to access information and determine the truth of the green slush fund. We have to ask, is there more corruption yet to surface from the Liberals' green slush fund? Are there charges that should be laid? Who knows the truth, as Parliament is being shielded from it? That is not acceptable to the House. What do we know? What we do know is that the appropriate use of taxpayers' money must always be the rule, not the exception.</ParaText>

He was elected in 2019, and the year before that, he lobbied the PMO and the industry department 25 times for Cycle Capital, some of that while he was the nominated candidate for the Liberal Party. Then in 2020, while he was a member of cabinet, cabinet approved another $750 million for the Liberal green slush fund.

              <ParaText id="8598383">Madam Speaker, it is truly a privilege for me to take part in the debate on this question of privilege today. As members know, I have been in the House since 2006, and history has been repeating itself year after year since the election of the Liberal government. Unfortunately, the scandals have been piling up under this government, and the green fund scandal is just the cherry on top to crown the past nine years. “Cherry on top” may not be the right expression, but we can only imagine how much is hidden behind all the events and all these years. I must admit that I get the impression that this government is doing a big cleanup before the next election to hide as much as possible or to destroy whatever evidence it can before any investigation can be held into just about all of their accomplishments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598384">This big, colossal Liberal government is not even hiding it anymore. It openly refuses to provide the RCMP with the documents it needs to investigate the undeniable corruption that no doubt allowed Liberal cronies to benefit their friends with money from the green fund, as the Auditor General found. It is really sad because the green fund was actually a good fund designated by the Department of the Environment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across Canada through technology initiatives. It would have been deeply appreciated and timely, given the challenges future generations will face over the next few decades in reducing greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, as I will demonstrate in a few minutes, this money was not necessarily used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but rather to line the pockets of Liberal Party cronies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598385">While Canadians are struggling, life has never been better for well-connected Liberal insiders. If a person is well connected, like the friends of the Liberal Party are, then they can apply for and get funds just like that. We are waiting to prove it, if one day we can get our hands on the documents that were requested by the House. Meanwhile, the Auditor General, Karen Hogan, was able to demonstrate problems with the financing of small and medium-sized businesses in the environmental technology sector that received money from the organization. The organization's mission is a very noble one, but that mission was perverted when the organization's budget of $1 billion over five years was used to line some people's pockets. Let me use my favourite saying: This is truly scandalous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598386">Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, must remain independent and sheltered from politics in order to achieve its primary goal, which is to use scientific knowledge to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The hope is that the government will appoint competent, independent people to the board of directors, who do not necessarily own businesses in the fund's sector of activity. The least we can do is avoid placing these individuals in a conflict of interest. That is the goal, especially since these technologies will let us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing our lives and our country's development to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598387">In any case, we, the Conservatives, on this side of the House, believe that science and technology will be one of the main tools in our tool box for improving our environmental track record when it comes to greenhouse gas. Concrete actions need to be taken. Investing in our Canadian scientists and in useful things like reducing our greenhouse gas emissions could make a huge difference in improving the future for generations to come. However, a corruption scandal of this magnitude has undermined the mission of SDTC, with non-repayable contributions that have nothing to do with greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598388">For example, the Auditor General noted in her report that she was able to analyze 18 projects completed through the fund rather than each individual project. She therefore looked at a sample of 18 projects. Of those 18 projects, 12 met only half of the greenhouse gas reduction targets, contrary to what was presented when the projects were being assessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598389">Was this anticipated, or was the government pushing the limit when it submitted the projects for funding? Maybe, maybe not, but for now, if we extrapolate from all these results, it means that more than 66% of the projects submitted probably would not have qualified for public funding if they had been presented with the objectives they achieved. They would not have qualified for the funding and could not have been funded. However, they did end up being funded. Because of these false premises, they were granted funding, sadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598390">Overstating the effectiveness of projects has unfortunately been commonplace. In fact, it has been the rule, not the exception. When accepting applications of that nature under a program, some might fail to meet the objectives. However, since 66% of the projects submitted did not meet the objectives, there may have been some irregularities when the applications were accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598391">The government's refusal to produce these documents is without a doubt an admission of guilt. The majority of members in the House of Commons voted to force the Liberals to make the documents public. We are still wondering why they have not been released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598392">Our parliamentary privilege is being violated and nothing is being done about it across the way. We might say that the government is trying to save face and hide the extent of the corruption in this whole affair. It is very reminiscent of the sponsorship scandal. They tried to hide a lot of things, but thanks to the perseverance of members who were sitting in the House at the time, we ended up getting to the truth, which led to an election and the defeat of the previous Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598393">What we are talking about here is the fact that some individuals gave public money to their own companies through the board of directors. Unfortunately, people gave money to companies that were owned by board members or by those who had direct or indirect ties to board members. They did it once, twice, three times, and perhaps as many as 186 times. Of course, after awhile, these people wondered why they could not have some money too, since they had given money to practically everyone. Everyone took a little. That is putting private interest above public interest, which is an all-too-common Liberal practice. Tax dollars were used to help private companies that, unfortunately, did not produce any results. One also has to wonder about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598394">The Auditor General was very clear: The chair of the green slush fund, who was chosen by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, broke the law. She was in a direct conflict of interest. That was undoubtedly one of many errors in judgment on the part of the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598395">I would like to go over the events and provide some figures for us to understand the extent of the problem. Earlier this summer, the Auditor General found that directors had awarded funding to projects that were ineligible and that involved conflicts of interest. In all, $123 million worth of contracts were awarded inappropriately, and $59 million went to projects that should have never received money in the first place. The organization's own conflict of interest policies were broken more than 186 times. It is completely ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598396">In addition, the Auditor General found that more than $300 million in public funds had been paid out in more than 186 cases involving a potential conflict of interest. The Prime Minister's appointees were doling out money to companies that belonged to them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598397">Unfortunately, Canadians' tax dollars are being squandered yet again. The chair of the green slush fund was chosen by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, even though he had been warned of her conflicts of interest. True to form, the Prime Minister, did what he wanted and decided to appoint her to the position anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598398">SDTC is supposed to be an independent organization, accountable to the innovation minister. It has a duty to achieve its objectives and to fund companies that are genuinely beneficial to the environment in order to restore public confidence in our institutions as quickly as possible. Trust in our institutions has, sadly, been broken. This is really important here in the House because, in the Parliament of Canada as a whole, with all the funding we provide and allocate, we really do owe it to ourselves to be transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598399">After the forest fires that have raged across Canada in recent years, the Liberals are not taking the organization's mission seriously. We know that the organization's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to find technologies to prevent these greenhouse gas emissions. Enough is enough. The Prime Minister must comply with Parliament's order and table the documents pertinent to the green slush fund so that the RCMP can investigate this corruption scandal. Canadians deserve transparency. The will of the House and the will of all Canadians cannot be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598400">This whole slush fund mechanism was set up with full knowledge of the facts. It is hard to imagine that a big board of directors failed to understand or realize the potential for conflicts of interest in their own decisions. The ministers knew about it and refused to stop their friends at SDTC from engaging in corruption. A recording by a senior official called out the Liberal government on its incompetence for inappropriately awarding contracts worth $123 million. This was the senior official who said, on August 25, 2023, “There's a lot of sloppiness and laziness. There is some outright incompetence and, you know, the situation is just kind of untenable at this point.” He reported that the crooked business going on at SDTC is “a sponsorship-level kind of giveaway”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598401">The least we can say is that this new scandal deserves our full attention and that, once again, we are going to have to get out the magnifying glass, put our shoulder to the wheel and spend our time chasing down all the Liberals' unscrupulous dirty dealings. The House must address this new scandal as quickly as possible. That is part of our duty as legislators. It shows us once again that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the members of his government fully deserve to be removed from the duties they are no longer worthy of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598402">I can just hear the Liberals, with a big fat smile on their faces, suggesting that the documents have already been handed over to the authorities and that the RCMP has already begun its investigation. However, the parliamentary law clerk indicated in his letter that the RCMP has not received all the documents that the House asked for and that the Department of Justice has refused to hand over its documents to the RCMP. Many documents have been redacted and others withheld. If the government does not hand over all the evidence to the police, there cannot be a full investigation. It is hard to find the truth with only half the evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598403">This whole story could easily be over if the Liberals ended the secrecy and handed over the documents to the appropriate authorities to determine once and for all whether there is culpability or not. This should not be a partisan issue. The other opposition parties in the House also voted for the motion, but the Liberals are slow to act on things and the 30-day deadline is drawing to a close, unfortunately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598404">As recordings that the whistle-blowers released last year showed, this controversy is one of a long series of scandals during the past nine years of Liberal incompetence. These scandals have involved both corruption and the squandering of public funds. Think of ArriveCAN, an application that should have cost $80,000 but ended up costing $59.5 billion. That is more than 740 times the original cost. Think of the WE Charity scandal, in which a contract to administer public funds was going to be sent to a foundation with close ties to the Prime Minister's family. When this was discovered, Parliament was prorogued.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598405">Let us also not forget the excellent work of the Auditor General, who showed that the Prime Minister had inappropriately awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to McKinsey. In fact, 90% of the firm's contracts, valued at $209 million, were awarded without even following the appropriate guidelines, and 70% of those contracts were awarded non-competitively, without a call for tenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598406">I could give many more examples, since the list is long, but people tend to remember things better when one follows a rule of three. In closing, according to my calculations, 58% of the green fund's seed funding, another fund, was distributed in Liberal ridings, whereas only 45% of the members here in the House are Liberals. We can therefore assume that non-Liberal ridings may not have received their fair share. There appears to be a lot of favouritism and unfairness again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598407">Canadians deserve a transparent, accountable government with sound judgment and integrity. Only the common-sense Conservatives will put an end to corruption and get answers for Canadians. Canadians want an election as soon as possible to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>

Of course we want to get to the bottom of this Liberal scandal, but I know my colleague remembers what happened during the Harper years. Under Harper, the Conservatives refused any investigation into their scandals. I just want to point out that the G8 scandal involved $1 billion. The ETS scandal cost $400 million. The Phoenix pay system cost $2.2 billion. Funding for the fight against terrorism involved more than $3 billion, and we never found out what happened to that money. That is a lot of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598412">It is taxpayers' money, but the Conservatives treated the public purse like their own personal bank account.

I have lost count of the number of times in this Parliament and recent parliaments that this House has had to debate questions of privilege related to the actions of the Liberal government.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals. Thus, privilege, though part of the law of the land is, to a certain extent an exemption from the ordinary law. The distinctive mark of a privilege is its ancillary character. The privileges of Parliament are rights which are “absolutely necessary for the due execution of its powers“.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598445">I remind the House that it is necessary for the execution of the powers of this House that our right, as the House of Commons, is to order the production of documents. We are the grand inquest of the nation. Documents have been ordered by this House. Those documents were not provided as stipulated by that order. That is why we are here today on this question of privilege. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598446">Let us take a step back and look at some of the issues involved with SDTC. It has become known as the green slush fund for obvious reasons. The Office of the Auditor General made several key observations during the audit period, which go from March 2017 to December 2023. I want to include a few key points from that report, which was tabled in the House on June 4 this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598447">First, 10 projects were approved, for more than $59 million for funding, that should have been deemed ineligible. There was $59 million that went to ineligible recipients. The second point I want to focus on is that SDTC's conflict of interest policies were not followed 90 times. Those 90 times, the organization failed to follow its own conflict of interest policies. Third, the board approved $58 million for projects without ensuring that they met the terms of the contribution agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598448">At the same time, the government's responses to these issues could be summarized in one word: pathetic. Of all the responses I have heard in relation to the Auditor General's report, I cannot say I have ever heard such absurd responses from the government. In fact, SDTC, in some cases, made false and outright preposterous claims. I want to highlight a few of these responses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598449">SDTC claimed that each project proposal goes through rigorous due diligence and evaluations that are “robust” and “highly credible”. That is simply not true. If it were true, we would not be facing a multi-million dollar corruption scandal. Unless that due diligence being referred to is simply SDTC insiders looking at who on their board is getting their money, it simply did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598450">SDTC also claimed that it was subject to an innovation, science and economic development evaluation, and that was in 2018, before this scandal happened. It was six years ago, outside of the Auditor General's audit period, and outside of the period when they were clearly ignoring the audit and the findings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598451">SDTC said that it does not fully agree with the Auditor General's recommendations because SDTC “delivered strong outcomes against these objectives.” Unless those objectives were to push more money into companies that the board members had financial interests in, that is simply not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598452">In fact, the Auditor General herself found that 82% of the funding transactions approved of by the board of directors during the audit period were conflicted. Therefore, 82% of the time that funding was approved, there were members of the board who were benefiting from the decisions being approved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598453">SDTC also wrote that “written records did not fully capture the robust deliberations made,” and, “SDTC is of the view that these projects met the eligibility criteria set out...but acknowledges that the [Auditor General] reached a different conclusion”. Yes, the Auditor General did reach a difference conclusion. She found that money was misspent. She found that there were conflicts 82% of the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598454">The corrupt operators of the green slush fund are saying the Auditor General got it wrong, but any day of the week, I will put my money behind the Auditor General as opposed to the directors at the corrupt green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598455">SDTC also claimed that it had “clear processes for staff and directors to declare real, potential and perceived conflicts”. Again, this claim completely ignores the findings of the Auditor General and, frankly, the public accounts committee, of which I am proud to be a member. We know conflicts were not declared, and even when they were declared, they either voted for their own projects or took turns voting for each other's projects in the same room without even exiting themselves from the room. The idea that there were clear processes for conflicts of interest would be laughable if it was not so concerning that these things were happening under the watch of the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598456">SDTC also claimed that it further, “strengthened its conflict of interest policies” in November 2023, well after these allegations came to light. More than that, it shows that it only cared about these problems after these terrible abuses and corruptions were found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598457">By November 2023, it knew the Auditor General's report was coming because that audit period was from March 2017 to December 2023. Claiming that policies have been strengthened and implying nothing further needs to be done after the corruption has already happened is simply disingenuous.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598458">There is a word for this kind of arrogance: entitlement. Such entitlement comes when any organization is so used to getting vast amounts of money for their own projects that it disconnects them from the realities of honest, hard-working Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598459">This matter has been raised in at least two parliamentary committees, the public accounts committee and the industry committee, both of which are doing exceptional work studying this matter. However, there is still a lot we do not know about SDTC and the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598460"> What we have learned so far through the industry and public accounts committees is truly alarming. Those of us on the opposition benches are determined to find out the full story; to ensure that, we need to make sure that the appropriate authorities are made aware of the documents in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598461">Interestingly, it is often cited that this is not a new entity. Indeed, SDTC was created in 2001; it has been in existence for over 20 years. However, the problems did not occur until it came under the authority of the Liberal government. In fact, in an audit in 2017, no major concerns were raised. The conflict of interest culture only emerged after board members were hand-picked and appointed by the current Liberal government and then minister Navdeep Bains. He, I might add, is appearing at the public accounts committee tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598462">What is more is that the most concerning of these appointments was in 2019, when Annette Verschuren was appointed as chair, despite clear conflicts of interest on this file. Those warnings turned out to be warranted; this past July, the Ethics Commissioner found that the former chair had violated the Conflict of Interest Act with her participation in decisions to benefit organizations that she herself had a financial interest in. It is not me saying that; our Ethics Commissioner noted that she had violated the Conflict of Interest Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598463"> We also found out through testimony at committee that former assistant deputy minister Andrew Noseworthy was responsible for keeping watch over SDTC but apparently failed to do so. On December 11 of last year, he appeared at the industry committee and said, “To my knowledge, I am not aware of any decisions to allocate funds to projects related to board members where they did not recuse themselves.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598464">However, the Auditor General's report released just two months later clearly informed us that the system was filled with conflicts of interest; we can go back to that 82% number. ADM Noseworthy's claim that there was no awareness of these conflicts of interest is clearly at odds with the actual facts found in the case by the Auditor General. Either he told an untruth to the committee or he was willfully blind to the corruption that was going on in the institution for which he was responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598465"> We also know that, if there was any semblance of good governance, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology</Affiliation> would have or should have been notified of these lapses in conflicts of interest rules and of the fact that accountability was absent in this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598466"> What is more, we found out in shocking testimony at the public accounts committee that at least one Liberal MP was informed of these allegations more than two years ago. The Liberal member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278598" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation> was informed of these decisions, but perhaps his response to the matter got lost in the mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598467"> When the whistle-blower known to the committee as Witness 1 appeared at the public accounts committee last month, they stated that they had informed the Liberal member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278598" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation> in May 2022. The whistle-blower stated that the Liberal Member “assured me that he took this situation seriously and guaranteed that he would facilitate contact with the appropriate people in the federal government and the Auditor General's office.” However, the Liberal member was not true to his word and subsequently refused to engage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598468"> We also know that Liberal-friendly directors were appointed to the board. A key example of this is long-time Liberal operative Stephen Kukucha, who was appointed to the board in February 2021. This is after he had a long-time career as a Liberal donor, a ministerial staffer in a Liberal government, a regional organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada and a secretary for the 2016 Liberal convention.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598469"> Interestingly, shortly after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came into office, that Liberal insider became a lobbyist and advocated for certain energy and transportation businesses. However, he was still appointed to the board of the SDTC, the green slush fund, which is exactly where the companies he had a personal financial interest in could receive financial contributions from the very same government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598470">Furthermore, as my good friend and colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, has very ably explained, we also know that the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister of environment</Affiliation> has had an interest in a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital, which also received funding from the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598471">Finally, I have learned from a current member of the new board that since the scandal broke, none of the money, not one penny nor one dollar that was wrongfully spent, has been recovered. Despite the fact that 82% of decisions were made by conflicted board members, not a dollar has been recouped for Canadian taxpayers. This is but one more reason why the production order for the papers must be fulfilled, as was ordered by a majority of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598472">Let us refresh what we are looking for. As the grand inquest of the nation, this is not only a matter of parliamentary privilege for the House but also a moral obligation to Canadians. In order to meet that obligation, the documents must be fully provided to the parliamentary law clerk and thereby sent to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598473">I sit on the public accounts committee, which is still waiting to receive a number of documents. This is separate in part from the motion before us. We do not yet have the communications that would indicate if or when the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry </Affiliation> was informed that the money was going out based on the decisions of conflicted board members. We do not yet have contribution and funding agreements showing the requirements and obligations of recipients. We do not have the conflict of interest declarations of board members and former board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598474">When we put this all together, simply put, we do not have the transparency required, the oversight needed and the accountability required and expected of us as members of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598475"> As I mentioned at the outset, this is not the first question of privilege we have dealt with in recent times, but it seems like we are doing this time and time again. Earlier this year, on yet another privilege debate on yet another scandal, the ArriveCAN scandal, I stated that this is a slow erosion of rights and privileges, and that it is not a small matter. It is an absolute threat to parliamentary democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598476"> We saw this in the previous Parliament with the Winnipeg lab scandal, which caused tremendous hardship for the scandal-plagued Liberal government. In fact in that case, the then president of the Public Health Agency of Canada was called to the bar to be admonished for failing or, perhaps more accurately, refusing, to provide documents that had been ordered to be provided to the House. In that case, the Liberal government itself took the former Speaker of the House to court to avoid accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598477">On the same topic of withholding documents, just earlier this month, the Speaker ruled that there was another prima facie question of privilege in which the business partner of the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> failed to disclose documents he had been ordered to provide. His business partner is disregarding an order of Parliament, and we will certainly deal with that question of privilege once this one has been dealt with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598478">The issue before us is not simply a question of niceties about respecting parliamentary privilege; it goes to the heart of our democracy. The scandal is about a tremendous waste of money, where hard-earned taxpayer dollars were used by the board of SDTC to benefit government insiders. There need to be clear and accountable records for Canadians to know who got rich and who is at fault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598479">We must pass the motion. What is more, and what is equally important, is that the documents must be turned over to the parliamentary law clerk as required by the order of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598480">Madam Speaker, there has been accountability and there has also been transparency on the issue. The simple truth of the matter is that since it was found out, we have seen independent investigations internally, two of them; we have seen the Auditor General conduct investigations; we have seen hours and hours at the standing committee; we have seen a replacement of the board; and we have seen the stopping of funding of new monies going in. These are all actions as a result of the government truly caring about what is taking place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598481">Now, the Conservatives have chosen to make a political game out of this, because they want to tie the word “corruption” to it. Hindsight is wonderful, but the chair of the board was an actual adviser to Brian Mulroney, Stephen Harper and Jim Flaherty, and we appointed her as the chair of the organization. With hindsight, yes, that was a mistake. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598484">However, we are not done yet. We still do not have all the details of what happened in these cases. We have only seen 82% of the conflicted cases that the Auditor General examined. We do not know the extent of that applied to the more than 400-plus decisions that were made outside that time period. The Auditor General was only able to look at a sampling of those cases. So, we know about 82% of those cases, but there could be much more. There is so much work left to be done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598517">First, Canadians, my colleagues and I suspect that what is in the documents is extremely damning to the corrupt government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, so bad that they will go to such great lengths to avoid producing the documents demanded by members of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598518">Parliamentarians, at least on this side of the House, take our role very seriously. Members of His Majesty's loyal opposition have a job to do, and that is to hold the government of the day accountable. Lord knows, that is a formidable task these days with a government that has been in power for nine years and is desperately trying to cling to that power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598519">I recall the 2015 campaign by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, which was during my first campaign in my first election. The Prime Minister made statements about sunlight being the best disinfectant, and he said that his government was going to be so transparent. Well, something has happened to those sunny days, and there are storm clouds brewing all over the out-of-touch, out-of-time Prime Minister and his government. On the aspect of transparency, what has truly become transparent is the Liberal government's clear and penchant leaning to look after its Liberal friends and ignore the rest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598520">When we look at the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Auditor General has identified as having been spent or allocated inappropriately, we have to wonder how much good could have been done with those dollars. How many struggling Canadians would have been better off had the green slush fund dollars been properly accounted for and gone to deserving causes instead of to entitled Liberal friends?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598521">When I am home in the North Okanagan—Shuswap, I hear from seniors who are struggling to get by on their minimal pensions because of the increased cost of living, including food, rents that have doubled and fuel and energy costs beyond what they can afford because of the government's penchant for its carbon tax that is driving up the cost of everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598522">These Canadians are the ones hurting the most, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his appointees had no problem letting a billion dollars, or a major portion of it, get blown away unchecked to insiders in conflicts of interest. These are the Canadians who deserve to know that justice can be served for them by holding the Prime Minister and his appointees accountable. These are Canadians like the one in five who skipped or reduced the size of at least one meal because they could not afford groceries; that rate is 45% among single parents. These are Canadians like the one in five parents who ate less so their children or another family member could eat; that rate is 44% among single parents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598524">Many of the food bank users in Vernon are hard-working, middle-class families struggling to put food on the table. I bring this to the current debate, because those Canadians have an expectation that we hold this government accountable through the actions of the members in this chamber, accountable for the taxpayer dollars those Canadians pay and this government continues to waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598525">Many of those Canadians have to work two jobs and still rely on the food bank to feed their families. They deserve to know how this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has let hundreds of millions of dollars be given to privileged insiders he appointed, while at the same time families, seniors and hard-working Canadians cannot afford food for their tables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598526">I spoke of the situation in Vernon and the North Okanagan, but the same situation is playing out across that riding and across Canada, with homelessness and tent cities popping up faster than a Liberal can spew talking points. We have heard members from across Canada speak of the rise in food bank use and the rise in homelessness, all while this PM and his insiders have funnelled millions of dollars to themselves or their close friends, leaving honest Canadians to go without.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598527">I will shift topics a bit here to emphasize some of the points made by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> regarding some of the objections by the government to providing these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598528">If I was the owner or manager of a company and became aware of alleged criminal activity within that company, I would be expected to turn over evidence to the police to have it investigated. In fact, I would find it an obligation to point out wrongdoing, criminality and waste. There is no reason we would not provide the documents of evidence to enforcement agencies and investigative teams, except for one possible reason. That reason would be if the body providing the evidence was also guilty in the activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598529">This House and its members should be held accountable in the same way, as managers of the business of government. We, through the motion to provide the documents and the question of privilege we are debating today, are working to do just that: to report alleged wrongdoing and conflict of interest, so that the proper authorities can investigate and, if needed, prosecute. We, through the motion to provide these documents, are doing what we are supposed to do: exposing the activities that have allowed $390 million to go to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598530">As I have noted, there is only one reason apparent for this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his appointees to keep these documents hidden from the sunlight that he espoused to be the best disinfectant. It is also so intriguing that a government, or maybe it is just the Prime Minister and a few insiders, would go to such extreme measures to keep the truth from seeing the light of day. They have so far been willing to set aside all other legislative debate in this chamber to keep something hidden. We can only surmise what that may be, but from what we have seen in the Auditor General's report, it does not look good: numerous cases of conflict of interest; $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on occasion could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8598531">The Speaker may already see, but Canadians may not, that there is a way to end the impasse we are now at. All it would take is for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to release these documents as the House has directed. I say “directed”, not asked or requested. It was a clear direction, an order from the House and the members of this chamber, for the Prime Minister and his government to produce these documents. It was not a request from one party. It was a motion that the majority of the House voted to support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598532">The motion that Parliament adopted also did not say the documents could be redacted. Therefore, government could not pick and choose which portions to produce. It did not give permission for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the PCO to decide which parts the House would see and which parts it would not. It would be highly inappropriate for a potentially guilty party to be given the leeway to remove or redact portions that could be damaging to their reputation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598533"> Speaking of reputations, the government continues to build on its reputation of being untrustworthy when it comes to campaign promises, election promises and fake commitments. Now the corruption runs even deeper, and the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are refusing the will of Parliament. We saw how the government previously provided documents that were so redacted, entire pages were completely blacked out; not a written word was to be found. It must have gone through volumes of printer toner and ink just to keep parliamentarians and Canadians from seeing its dark secrets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598534">As I mentioned earlier, parliamentarians do not take their jobs lightly or without consideration for the impacts on Canadians, that is, most parliamentarians with nothing to hide. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his insiders are not supreme rulers. They are servants of the people of Canada, not the other way around. That is why we, as a majority of Parliament, adopted the motion to bring to light the documents that may show whether the Prime Minister has served the people or whether it is the other way around, and he has made taxpayer dollars serve him and his appointees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598535">We do not take lightly the demand for production of documents. We will also not take it lightly when a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government ignore an order of Parliament, nor should Canadians. All 338 members, as duly elected members of the ridings we represent, are here as the voices of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. If the Prime Minister ignores the will of Parliament, he ignores the will of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598536">Where would we expect the leader of a country to ignore the will of the people? I suggest the only places where that would occur is in dictatorship countries, the types of countries that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said he has a liking for or an admiration of. Dictatorships are where the leader and government have the people serve them. That is not the Canada we knew before the current Prime Minister and government, and it is not the Canada we want to see in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598537">One thing I learned before I entered the political arena is that responsibility cannot be passed on to someone else. In early media training, I learned that, when we make a mistake, it is best to fess up, own up, dress up and admit it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598551"> Madam Speaker, it is a great day in this place when Conservatives are speaking to the government's fiscal accountability. I just wish they had done that when it came to their own government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598552">At the time of Stephen Harper, there were scandals galore and we saw the Conservatives shut down investigative proceedings into these issues all the time. The New Democrats, on the other hand, believe in financial accountability and in ensuring that we have strong trust in our public institutions. The Conservatives seem to only care about financial accountability if it means scoring political points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598553">If the Conservatives were to form government, would they keep the same appetite for fiscal accountability, unlike during the time that Harper was prime minister?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8598564">Madam Speaker, I have a late show again tonight and it is predicated on a question I asked back in May after the government's budget on the accumulating deficits it has drawn on this country. Parliamentary secretaries for the government at that time told me that there was no problem as Canada was still very highly rated in the world with the best fiscal record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598565">Let us address some of that in this question here. Canada now has a growth rate of about 1.2%. That is 1.2% per year, according to international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund, which is not exactly stellar considering that the OECD itself is about 3.8% a year. We have to do better in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598566">However, more than that, if we really look at these numbers, Canada has a huge productivity problem, such a productivity problem vis-à-vis the United States, our main trading partner, that between 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy GDP per capita actually went up by 3.6%, whereas in Canada our GDP per capita went down by over 5%. How did that happen? That happened because of bad economic policies that, frankly, punish successful companies across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598567">Also, we still grow our GDP, but we have not grown our GDP per capita because we have 2.4 million new Canadians. If we look at GDP per capita, minus 5% plus, that would mean we are actually in a recession. Did we avoid a recession by saying there is a whole bunch more people and, of course, people mean spending and spending means GDP? It is the nature of what the economy is. That is not the way to run an economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598568">Our economy is falling down as far as our productivity goes, as far as the value add that we earn as a country. Now, this is interesting because 10 years ago, in 2013, looking at our productivity in Canada vis-à-vis the United States, Canada's GDP per capita at that point was about 98% of the U.S.'s GDP per capita. What is it now? It is 66% per capita, so it has fallen down by almost a third vis-à-vis our main trading partner. That is a disastrous decade that the Liberal government has foisted upon this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598569">However, looking forward, which is the most important thing, we have to look at how this country reverts back to being a productive economy and how we actually get back to a standing in the world where we are once again a world leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598570">Ray Dalio is a fund manager, a very important hedge manager in the United States, who is well regarded as far as his views on income equality and its importance in the economy. He looked at Canada in a realm of 35 countries and assessed us at number 26 out of 35, as far as our growth over the next 10 years goes. That was because of all kinds of issues, including the lack of education funding and the lack of ability to actually grow the country, but primarily the excessive debt we have built into the economy. He looked at Canada's 1.2% growth per year over the next 10 years. The top, of course, is India at 6.3% annual growth. The nine countries below Canada are all difficult European countries. We know that Europe's economy is in the sewer and is not going to emerge for quite a while because of bad energy policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598571">I am going to ask the government this again: When is it going to address the stress it has caused in the financial markets and actually stop spending so much? The government has a spending problem and needs to get a hold of it to address inflation before it punishes Canadians even more than it already has.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598572">Madam Speaker, I did not have an opportunity to respond to any questions during question period today, because the Conservatives have no economic questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598573">I am so grateful to the member for Calgary Centre for his question tonight because in fact the Bank of Canada is leading the G7 in interest rate cuts. Canada was the first G7 country to lower interest rates for the very first time. We were also the first country among all of the G7 peers to cut interest rates for the second time, and yes, we were the first G7 country to cut interest rates for the third time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598574">I will tell the House why this is good news for Canadians. It is helping business owners, those who have loans and those who do not. It is helping Canadians who have a mortgage coming up for renewal, and it is helping people looking to buy a very first home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598575">What else is helping Canadians buy a first home? It is the reforms that our government just announced. For example, we are expanding eligibility for 30-year mortgage amortization to all first-time homebuyers and also, importantly, to all buyers of new builds. This will help reduce the cost of monthly mortgage payments and help more Canadians buy a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598576">What else is helping Canadians buy a first home? It is the first home savings account that we introduced to allow prospective homebuyers to save up to $40,000 completely tax-free in order to put a down payment towards their first home. In fact, 750,000 Canadians have already taken advantage of the program and opened their account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598577"> What else is helping Canadians? For 19 consecutive months, wage growth has outpaced inflation, which means that even taking into account global inflation and even taking into account affordability pressures, Canadians are still better off today than they were five years ago. They are taking home larger paycheques, even taking into account inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598578">Talking about inflation, I must tell Canadians the truth: Inflation is down to just 2%. The fact that my Conservative colleague is bringing up a question he posed last May shows that the Conservatives are not following the inflation numbers. Inflation is exactly at the target rate that the Bank of Canada had set for itself.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8598579">The member opposite seems concerned about inflation, but I would remind him that it was 2% in August, which is right in the middle of the Bank of Canada's inflation target range. Indeed, inflation has been within the Bank of Canada's target range all year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598580">Moreover, wages have outpaced inflation for 19 consecutive months, meaning that Canadian workers are now receiving higher paycheques on average than they were before the pandemic. That is even with taking inflation into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598581">Experts also predict that Canada's GDP will grow the fastest among all our G7 peers in 2025. This shows that the Canadian economy is strong and resilient, and it shows that the economic plan we have put in place is fiscally responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598582">While the Conservatives continue to call for cuts to the supports Canadians depend on, our plan will allow the next generation to realize the dream of buying their first home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598583">On our side of the House, on the Liberal government side, we know that Canada is stronger when everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598584"> Madam Speaker, Canada has dropped its interest rate. The Bank of Canada has dropped it three times in a row now, and Canada has led the world because Canada's economy is leading the world in going down. Of course, we are entering an absolute recession, and not just a GDP-per-capita recession. The recession is on the horizon. I hope it does not happen. Nevertheless, something is on the horizon here: an economy that has stalled and has been stalled for a long time. We can take a look at the 1.2% growth, which is not the type of growth this country should be going through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598585">Here is the issue. Canadian government debt now is 107% of GDP, which the parliamentary secretary will refute because she is monkeying around with the numbers. In addition, Canadian debt per capita, household debt, is 132% per capita. We have a debt problem in Canada. It is going to land on the backs of Canadians one way or another. Will the government please address this and stop loading more debt onto the backs of Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598586">Madam speaker, unfortunately my Conservative colleague seems to be cheering on the idea of a recession, which would be bad news for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598587"> In fact, as I have explained, Canada is projected to have the highest growth rate of our G7 peers in 2025, which is just next year. I would also note that the Conservatives' desperation for bad economic news is not working very well for them, because Canadians understand that they are in fact in a strong economy and are seeing their wages increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598588"> I would like to correct the member, who mentioned yesterday, I believe, that the Conservatives are enjoying making a comparison to Alabama's GDP. Canada's GDP is $2.138 trillion. Alabama's is $242 billion. Therefore if anybody is monkeying around with the numbers, it is my colleague from Calgary Centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598589">I do wish to end simply by stating that our government will continue to fight for vulnerable Canadians while maintaining a fiscally responsible frame.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598590"> Madam Speaker, inaction is a choice. The Liberal government's intentional decision to do nothing and allow Samidoun to not only continue to operate on Canadian soil but enjoy tax exemptions on its income as a federally registered non-profit is reprehensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598591">Since my initial question to the government on September 20, calling for it to take action to ban Samidoun, arrest leader Khaled Barakat for inciting violence and hatred, and list Samidoun as the terrorist organization that it is, October 7 has passed. On that sombre day, when our Jewish brothers and sisters were grieving the most heinous, horrific and deadly attack on Jews since the Holocaust, what did Samidoun do? It celebrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598592">It put up posters for a rally in my city of Toronto under a headline of “Long live October 7”. In Vancouver, it glorified terrorism by literally chanting, “we are Hamas and we are Hezbollah”; these are literal terrorist groups. It also desecrated our Canadian national flag by lighting it on fire. When is enough, enough?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598593"> This terrorist-affiliated, terrorist-supporting organization does not even bother to hide it anymore. Before, it would at least pretend to not hate Jews and just claim it was all about anti-Zionism. It just hated Zionists, which, unfortunately, we know is code for Jews. However, every incident of hatred left intentionally unanswered by the government has emboldened the organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598594"> On October 7, in addition to celebrating literal terrorist groups, Samidoun chanted, “Death to Canada. Death to the United States. And death to Israel.” The people at Samidoun have shown us who they are, and one of the things they have shown us is not only that they hate Jews, but they hate Canada and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598595">Why does the government make the choice to allow them to turn Canada into their base of operations to promote terrorism and hatred? Inaction is a choice, and the intentional decision to allow these blatant acts of hatred and incitement of violence is a choice by the Liberal government that puts Canadians in danger. What will it take for the government to stop choosing to allow this to continue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598596">Being a doormat is not a policy, and the government's tepid condemnation of hate on our soil, with claims of “this is not who we are” or “hate has no place in Canada”, is worthless, when it, with all the resources and authority available to it as a G7 national government, does nothing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598597">I am not even calling for Canada to be the first to take action. Germany has banned Samidoun, and Khaled Barakat is banned from the entire European Union of 27 countries. Nearly a whole fricking continent will not allow this terrorist supporter onto its soil, yet he is free to spew hatred here in Canada. What am I missing? Is Khaled Barakat a Liberal super donor? Is he a member of the Laurier Club? Is he about to be appointed a board member of SDTC, the Liberal government's green slush fund?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598598">Instead of slushing around, the government should be flushing this hateful organization. My question to the parliamentary secretary is simple: Will it ban Samidoun, yes or no?</ParaText>

Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or hate in any form is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598600">Hate propaganda and hate crimes are taken very seriously by all orders of government in Canada. The federal government, heads of police services, and provincial and territorial partners have all been meeting regularly to discuss policing collaboration and the best way to ensure safety and security for communities during these challenging times. As a government, we encourage all those affected by hate propaganda to contact their local law enforcement, as well as their local elected officials, should they have any safety concerns revolving around hate speech or actions in a community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598601">We have taken several actions to combat anti-Semitism and hate in Canada. In November 2023, we appointed the second special envoy on preserving Holocaust remembrance and combatting anti-Semitism. In addition, we recently appointed the first special adviser on Jewish community relations and anti-Semitism. We also renewed Canada's anti-racism strategy to continue the fight against racism, and we introduced Canada's first-ever action plan on combatting hate. In budget 2024, we proposed $273.6 million over six years, starting this year, with $29.3 million ongoing to advance this action plan. The funding will support community outreach and law enforcement reform, tackle the rise in hate crimes, enhance community safety and security, counter radicalization and increase support for victims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598602">With regard to designating an organization as a terrorist entity, as the <Affiliation DbId="311643" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> reminded the House today, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has already referred the listing of Samidoun to our national security experts and asked for an emergency and urgent review. As my hon. colleague knows, the listing process is iterative. The environment has changed since October 2023, and the public safety department and portfolio agencies continue to monitor and assess national security threats against Canada and Canadians constantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598603">I want to be clear: The Government of Canada takes any and all allegations of criminal activity, terrorism or violent extremism in Canada extremely seriously, and we have a number of tools available to address them. They include conducting investigations with a view to laying charges under the Criminal Code, and when applicable, using peace bonds, no-fly listings, the revocation of passports and terrorist listings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598604">Whether to list or delist an entity under the Criminal Code is determined as a result of a rigorous process that is based on evidence, intelligence and the law. It involves cross-government consultations, used to ascertain whether an entity meets the threshold for listing as set out in the Criminal Code. I cannot comment on the process of listing a specific organization, but I can assure the member that the Government of Canada is taking the necessary actions to keep Canadians safe from violent extremism and terrorism. We will continue to work with all our partners to counter national security threats and to uphold democracy. This government stands firm in actions to protect Canadians and its belief that it is wrong to direct hatred, violence and intolerance towards those of diverse faiths and social groups. These acts will not be tolerated in Canada. We can build a better future together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598609">The government encourages all those affected by hate propaganda to contact law enforcement, as well as local elected officials, if they have safety concerns revolving around hateful speech or actions in a community.

              <ParaText id="8598611">Madam Speaker, we had a consensus on immigration. It was never a controversial topic. We had the best immigration system in the world; it was the envy of the world. It was a system that brought in the brightest and the best. It was a system that had integrity. It was a system that worked for newcomers and Canadians who have been here for generations. However, after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government and five immigration ministers in that time, we have seen our immigration system fall apart. Our system is now full of chaos, full of fraud and full of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598612">What is most concerning for me is that the current <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> wakes up every single morning, goes to the media and says that he is alarmed with what is going on, that he is shocked with his own department's failings. Do not take my word for it. His own colleagues have said the system is a mess and is out of control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598613">We have seen a record number of people in the low-wage stream of our TFW program. We have seen chaos in our international student program. We have students coming to our country for degrees that we do not need from colleges that do not exist. Recently, we saw a massive surge in asylum claims after the changes the government made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598614"> Canada's population growth is at about 3.4%. That is not sustainable. Again, do not take my word for it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself has said that Canada's immigration rate has grown “beyond what Canada has been able to absorb”. These are record numbers, and they put pressure not only on housing, services and health care, but also on the labour market for our youth. We saw a 14% youth unemployment rate this past summer because of folks coming here through the low-wage stream and abusing that process. Greedy corporations were also abusing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598615">This is not a problem that started today. The government was warned by officials that its reckless policies would cause a housing crisis and would put pressure on our health care system. The government ignored it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598616"> In 2018, the government removed the police clearance certificate requirement for temporary residents coming to our country. Recently, we found out from a media investigation, a story that came out, that government officials were told to skip over crucial vetting for the temporary foreign worker program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598617">This is weakening our system. It is jeopardizing our country. It is not only putting Canadians at risk, but also breaking a system that was once the envy of the world, a system that everyone wanted to copy, a system that had integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598618">My question for the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is very simple. We have seen new ministers. We have seen new announcements. We have seen a lot of photo ops. However, we have not seen any changes to our country's immigration system. Why is the minister so negligent? Why has he broken Canada's immigration system, which is not only causing chaos for newcomers but also hurting Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8598624"> Madam Speaker, biometrics are a more reliable method of determining admissibility than any one document, such as a police certificate. They unequivocally verify an applicant's identity and therefore lead us to any information that is accessible about them. We check every applicant's biometrics against a wide range of databases, from the RCMP in Canada to U.S. immigration and international partner holdings, to identify any potential security risk. Immigration officers then carefully review each application on a case-by-case basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598625">Decisions on admissibility are evidence-based and risk-informed, and they follow rules around procedural fairness. Officers may request any additional documents they deem necessary to make a recommendation on a final decision, such as police or additional intelligence reports. However, I should note that, depending on the country of origin, police certificates are not always reliable. Final decisions on admissibility are made at the border by a CBSA officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598626">I am disappointed that the Conservatives have been sharing misinformation and attempting to stoke division and drive fear into the hearts of Canadians. I cannot say that I am surprised. After all, it was a Conservative Party that promised to create a barbaric cultural practices hotline that would encourage Canadians to spy on one another. It was the Conservative Party that kept families apart through limited family reunification targets, all because they did not want to let too many seniors into the country. It was the Conservative Party that accuses vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees of abusing Canada's generosity. The Conservatives are doing what they know best, misleading and dividing Canadians. I will not stand for it nor will I dignify their tactics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8598627">As I outlined earlier, all international students are subject to a robust and comprehensive security screening prior to coming to Canada. This includes biometric screening, which then goes through our RCMP database in Canada, U.S. immigration and our international partner holdings. If necessary, an officer can request a police certificate, though I will note that, depending on the country of origin, it is not necessary.</ParaText>
