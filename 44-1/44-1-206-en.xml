          <ParaText>The Chair would like to comment on the points of order raised on Friday, June 2 by the members for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation>, as well as rule on the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> regarding proceedings on Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47, An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023</Document>.</ParaText>
          <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
          <ParaText>The various concerns raised touch upon the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill by the Standing Committee on Finance, and how it should inform the selection and grouping of report stage motions by the Speaker. The Chair would also like to address the events surrounding electronic voting during the recorded division held on Friday.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="279135" Type="15">The Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>The Chair will begin by addressing the concerns raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>, before turning to the question of selection and grouping of report stage motions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In his intervention, the member claimed that his privileges were breached during the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill by the Standing Committee on Finance. His concerns centred on the contention that his right to vote, to move subamendments, to speak and raise points of order were unfairly limited by the committee chair. He argued that Standing Order 116(2)(a) had not been respected. Furthermore, the member alleged that the scheduling of the bill last Friday by the government had limited his ability to have report stage motions drafted and submitted in time for publication in the Notice Paper.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Standing Order 116(2)(a) makes clear that a committee can set time limits in relation to its own proceedings. The standing order reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Unless a time limit has been adopted by the committee or by the House, the Chair of a standing, special or legislative, committee may not bring a debate to an end while there are members present who still wish to participate.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This also applies during the consideration of legislation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>It is an established practice that a committee can adopt its own orders, set its own deadlines to submit amendments or limit debate during its clause-by-clause consideration of bills. This appears to be what occurred in this case, where the committee adopted a motion to restrict the time for considering Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>. Given that the committee made such a decision, as the Standing Orders allow, I do not believe that the Speaker has any cause to invalidate its proceedings nor to consider them a breach of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As to the other matters raised by the member, Speakers generally will not address procedural concerns from committees without first having a report outlining what procedural irregularities may have occurred. This was stated by the Assistant Deputy Speaker on Friday and I too see no reason to deviate from this well-established practice in this case.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As to the contention that the scheduling of the bill for consideration in the House last Friday limited members’ ability to submit report stage amendments, I would refer members to Standing Order 76.1(1), and I quote:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The report stage of any bill reported by any standing, special or legislative committee after the bill has been read a second time shall not be taken into consideration prior to the second sitting day following the presentation of the said report, unless otherwise ordered by the House.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The report in question was presented on Wednesday, May 31, 2023. It could therefore be called for debate as early as Friday, June 2, 2023. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>This two-sitting imperative, combined with the 24-hour notice requirement to submit report stage motions, is standard and usually provides enough time to have motions drafted and submitted.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As such, members who wish to receive support in the drafting of report stage motions should contact the capable staff in the Office of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel as soon as possible with clear drafting instructions. If members wait to see when the bill will be called, they run the risk of not having their motions drafted in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For all these reasons, the Chair fails to see how the rights and privileges of the member were breached.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>I will now turn to the points raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278453" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member indicated that the programming motion adopted by the committee for Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> had prevented the moving of amendments during the clause-by-clause study of the bill. For that reason, he asked that his motions now be selected at report stage. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation> echoed the same concerns, adding that rulings made by the chair of the committee had prevented members from moving new proposals to the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As stated in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, at pages 787 and 788:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the Speaker could, if he or she thinks fit, call upon any Member who has given notice of an amendment to explain it so as to enable the Speaker to form a judgment upon it, but in practice, Members would send a written submission to the Speaker if there were any doubt as to the selection of their amendments for debate.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to stress the latter part of this sentence. This important practice was also mentioned by the Assistant Deputy Speaker when she addressed the point of order on Friday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If members wish to assist the Speaker in his deliberations, they are strongly encouraged to bring their arguments for the selection of their report stage motions by way of a written submission when they place them on notice. They can nonetheless rest assured that all report stage motions are always carefully analyzed by the Speaker, even if they are not accompanied by written submissions. The Speaker makes his determination after a thorough analysis of the committee’s consideration of a bill, precedents and guidance provided by the Standing Orders. This includes considering whether or not motions could have been presented in committee.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As per usual practice, the Speaker’s rationale for the selection of motions for Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> will be provided to the House when it is called for consideration at report stage.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Finally, the Chair would also like to revisit the technical issues raised during the taking of the recorded division held on Friday. This matter is of significant importance given that recorded divisions are scheduled regularly.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Casting one’s vote is an important part of our parliamentary system and is central to each member’s parliamentary duties. Members can exercise their vote in person, by rising in the House when their names are called or, since 2021, electronically through the voting application. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The process for electronic voting is spelled out in the order made on June 23, 2022. Subparagraph (o)(iv) of this order specifies that “any member unable to vote via the electronic voting system during the 10-minute period due to technical issues may connect to the virtual sitting to indicate to the Chair their voting intention by the House videoconferencing system.”</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>If a member is not successful in casting their vote using the app, they may indicate on the House’s Zoom feed how they wish to vote. They can simply connect to the feed, use the raised hand function, wait for the Speaker to recognize them and, when invited to do so, cast their vote, promptly—and I am emphasizing “promptly”—without getting into specifics or providing unnecessary details. This is especially important as there is generally no interpretation during this part of proceedings, as the Clerk announces the name of the member and their vote in English and French.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Last Friday, an unusually large number of members connected to the virtual sitting claiming technical difficulties. As Speaker, I was concerned and therefore mandated the House administration to conduct an assessment of the situation. I would like to commend our committed staff for having invested their time to do a fulsome analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am happy to report that, besides very minor issues affecting only a few members, no generalized outage occurred that day. The voting application worked as it was meant to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That being said, issues may arise from situations that are not related to a malfunction of the voting application. While giving the benefit of the doubt and taking members at their word, the Chair has found no evidence of difficulties some members claimed to have experienced. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>In a statement made on March 7, 2023, I indicated that the effectiveness of remote participation is based in large part on the use of proper equipment. This ranges from an optimal Internet connection, the type of device used and to the need for adequate sound quality. This includes the use of proper headsets with an integrated microphone. I therefore encourage members to ensure they are properly equipped before participating remotely in a sitting, including when using the voting application.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>The Chair has the utmost respect for the voting process. The success of the voting application depends on the good faith of members. All members are to treat their right to vote in this place with the sanctity and respect it deserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to thank all members for their attention.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Mr. Philip Lawrence (Northumberland—Peterborough South, CPC) </Affiliation>
            </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>moved that Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281, An Act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act, the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law), the Broadcasting Act and the Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act</Document>, be read the third time and passed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>He said: Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour and privilege to rise in this House on behalf of the people of Northumberland—Peterborough South. Today, it is a particular honour because I rise with respect to my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>, on human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just to give a little context before I jump into the substance of this legislation, I want to say that we are extremely blessed to live in the greatest country in the world, a country where we can be assured of the rule of law and where people can disagree without there being any physical violence. In the last three weeks of Parliament, I imagine we will hear some rancorous debate, which I am sure the Speaker will do a great job presiding over, along with some arguments and other things that may not be as pretty as they could be. However, they will be a lot better than the alternative, which, of course, would be violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In too many countries around the world, people have been resorting to violence. There are many countries where people will spend the night awake, waiting to see what their government might attempt to do to them. People who are just standing up for who they are, what they believe in and how they choose to worship stay up nights in living, shaking fear of an authoritarian regime or some goon or thug coming in to threaten them, simply because of the way they live. Worse yet, they may be arrested, put in jail or tortured. Right now, many are sitting around and rotting in horrible conditions, suffering through torture and unthinkable, unbelievable pain at the hands of governments around the world. Therefore, it gives me great pride today to discuss my private member's bill, which seeks to at least move the ball a little bit forward towards more humane conditions while advocating for human rights around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document> has four primary sections, or clauses. The first section deals with prisoners of conscience. Prisoners of conscience are people around the world who are being detained, sitting in prisons right now, simply because of their beliefs or thoughts. They are fighting for virtuous causes like liberty, freedom of religion or freedom of expression. They are in incredible pain and suffering. Anything that Canadians and the Canadian government can do to alleviate or reduce their suffering is something that I think we should do as quickly as we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My private member's bill seeks to give the Canadian people and Parliament oversight of the government's advocacy for these individuals, these important people around the world. Specifically, it puts on to the government a reporting regime that forces it to report what actions it is taking to help prisoners of conscience around the world. It would have to report how many prisoners of conscience the government's Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of and what it is doing to aid their cause; it would also have to determine whether it has been deemed helpful by the families of these victims to publish their names.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have had the great privilege of talking to some of the family members in Canada whose loved ones are in prisons around the world; there is one in particular who is in Venezuela. They want the name of their loved one, their brother in this case, to be published, because it would add <I>gravitas</I>. They would be able to point to a government report to say, “Yes, the Canadian government agrees with me. My loved one, my spouse, my sister or my child is being held not because they have done a crime but because they believed in the cause of freedom, democracy or religious freedom.” The report will go on to say what the Canadian government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will not cast aspersions in this House, because I do not think that would be parliamentary. However, I think it is fair to say that many observers out there have written about the fact that the cause of human rights has sometimes been forgotten when carrying out international diplomacy or economic trade. However, human rights should be something we stand on. Human rights should be something that demands transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>This private member's bill would get us there with respect to accountability and transparency. It would have the government tell us why it has not been taking action with respect to prisoners of conscience or individuals who believe that they are prisoners of conscience. There will be various groups of individuals and organizations that will look at this report and ask why a certain individual is not included or why there are only 10 prisoners of conscience in Venezuela, when surely there are many more than that. It would give family members and organizations the ability to push the government to help with care and advocacy and, hopefully, the release of their loved ones. As I said, these are some of the most honourable individuals I can imagine; they are people who have given their lives to the cause of liberty, democracy and freedom. As Canadians, we need to do everything we can to support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The next clause is with respect to the Magnitsky sanctions, which are, of course, named after Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky was a brilliant tax lawyer in Russia and one of the strongest fighters against Vladimir Putin's incredibly corrupt and devious regime. He stood up to Putin. Unfortunately, he ended up in a prison in Russia. A true warrior for the cause of integrity and honour, Magnitsky wound up passing away in that prison while fighting for what was right, for integrity and honour. The president of Russia, then and now, let him die there from a treatable medical condition that he would not allow him to get treatment for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Magnitsky's friend and business colleague, Bill Browder, then went around the world trying to get Magnitsky sanctions in place. In my estimation, Magnitsky sanctions are incredibly powerful devices. They seek to put individual sanctions on some of the worst human rights violators in the world. Too often, in the past, human rights violators have gotten up in the morning, tortured victims, then hopped on their jets to attend cocktail parties in some of the most advanced economies around the world, hobnobbing with the world's elites. These are the lowest of the low; they deserve to be sanctioned and not to be given access to our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>These Magnitsky sanctions are incredibly important tools in our tool box, and when the Magnitsky act was passed, there was a flurry of sanctions put in place for some human rights violators. We started towards the path of holding them accountable. It was a great step, I might add. However, in recent years, it has slowed down to an almost imperceptible trickle of people who have been named under the Magnitsky act. This is challenging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What is being asked for in the second clause of my private member's bill is to look at giving Parliament oversight. We would not be taking away the power of imposing Magnitsky sanctions, although many legislative bodies around the world have done so. We are simply looking for the government to report back if the Senate, the House or a committee thereof says a person is terrible and is torturing people in Venezuela, Russia or Beijing. It then needs to find out why the government is not sanctioning that individual. All it would require is a very simple report, but it would add transparency and accountability to the government when it does not sanction a terrible human rights violator, when it is letting an individual get up in the morning and torture innocents, then, in the afternoon, fly their private jet to Toronto, B.C. or wherever to hobnob with some of our elites. It is a very reasonable bill in that it does not seek to go too far. It simply looks to hold the worst human rights violators in this world accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The next section is with respect to the Broadcasting Act. During Vladimir Putin's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we saw that a foreign power can use Canadian airwaves to broadcast its propaganda. Fortunately, the CRTC did the right thing in pulling Russia's licence today, stopping it from broadcasting Vladimir Putin's hatred across Canadian airwaves. Unfortunately, there was no process in place, so the CRTC had to hodgepodge one together. This bill would give the CRTC a process to use when a genocidal state is using Canadian airwaves to broadcast its hatred.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>We obviously do not want to restrict freedom of speech or freedom of expression unduly, so this would be a very limited prohibition in that it would need to be a genocidal state utilizing Canadian airwaves. The CRTC could then prevent it from broadcasting on Canadian airwaves. It is an oversight that this does not exist. The idea of a genocidal state broadcasting its hatred, propaganda and promotion of genocide on our airwaves is completely and utterly unacceptable. I am very proud of the proposed Broadcasting Act amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The final amendment is about the prohibiting of cluster munitions. These are all great provisions, and they are all important to me, but this one is of particular importance and relevance to me. I have been to demining fields. We are talking about cluster munitions, but it is a similar concept in demining fields around the world. It is incredibly sad what cluster munitions and mines do to civilian populations. They primarily kill innocent civilians, and in many cases, children. Once the cluster munitions or mines are put down, they can take years or even decades to remove, making otherwise fertile farmland and areas where there could be schools and businesses completely useless for years and decades to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Even sadder is the fact that, often, these unexploded ordnances last for years and decades. The ones that are not found are the saddest of all; many children have lost their lives simply by walking somewhere. The really scary, sad and disturbing part is that cluster munitions are bomblets, or bombs of bombs. Imagine one bomb with thousands of little bombs inside that land all over. They are completely indiscriminate, which makes them particularly horrible and terrifying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They land everywhere, and no one has a map or a marking of where these bomblets went because they are often dropped from thousands of feet up. The wind could take these things in a myriad of different directions. Therefore, mapping them out is nearly impossible. Even if countries that drop them wanted to remove them, it is very difficult to do so and requires a demining process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The disturbing part is that these bomblets often look like shiny little toys. There have been many reports of small children going out to a play yard or a field and seeing these shiny toys; obviously, the worst happens. These tools are not even valuable when it comes to war. Because they are indiscriminate and not targetable, their value to an army is extremely limited. They are really just weapons of terror, weapons that are completely indiscriminate; because of that, they are particularly dangerous to civilians and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As part of this private member's process, I have had the ability to travel a bit in the country and meet with people in communities from all over who settled here in Canada, because they believe, as I do, that Canada is the greatest country on earth. They have told me their stories. They have told me about their suffering. More than once, in either one-on-one or group meetings, I have been brought to tears by their stories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>These individuals are people who have given up their lives, sacrificed their lives, for important things like making sure little girls have the opportunity to go to school; that children, regardless of where they live in the world, have the opportunity to seek an education and improve their lives; that people have the ability to vote for their leadership and not simply be told; that people enjoy freedom and have the right of personal self-determination; and that people have the right of liberty and are able to decide who they want to be, how they want to be and whom they want to love. These people need our help, and this is hopefully at least a small step in that direction, a step in re-establishing Canada as a human rights champion around the world, as it should be.</ParaText>

My father was a member of the Solidarity movement. He was arrested, detained and put in prison. Like many Solidarity activists, he was a prisoner of conscience.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his important bill. It is a step forward in terms of government transparency, which is what my question will focus on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C‑281</Document> does, however, raise some issues. Consider the case of Raif Badawi and his wife Ensaf Haidar, a past Bloc Québécois candidate. Mr. Badawi spent 10 years in a Saudi Arabian prison. Although he has been released from prison, he is not permitted to travel. He is not allowed to come here. In essence, he is still not really free. He is still over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It has been a long time. Canada has not been able to do anything for him. He served his 10 years in prison and remains in Saudi Arabia. The government has still not shown accountability. We have no idea what discussions the government has been having.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am speaking to Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document> today and would like to comment on two main themes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First, I would like to comment briefly on the portion of the bill that would amend the Broadcasting Act. My colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278378" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, began commenting on this during the debate at report stage, and I think it is worth highlighting a few points that come from this side of the House. Afterwards, I would like to speak to human rights generally and the government's commitment to promoting and protecting human rights, both globally and here at home. This is a core part of our foreign policy and is essential to our party's approach to politics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Broadcasting plays an important role in Canadian society. It allows for Canadians to exchange ideas, enriches our democracy and can play an important role in advancing human rights. Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document> would recognize this important role by prohibiting the issuance or renewal of broadcasting licences to broadcasters that are vulnerable to significant influence by certain foreign nationals or entities of concern. Measures to protect the broadcasting system from influences are important, especially when it comes to critical issues related to human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That said, despite the intent behind this proposal, ensuring that broadcasts that go against Canada's fundamental commitment to human rights are not on the airwaves, the bill, in its original format, was troubling. I am glad that, thanks to Liberal proposals at the committee, it has been significantly improved. It is crucial to respect the independence of the CRTC as a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal that serves at arm's length from the federal government as a regulator for broadcasting and telecommunication. In Canada, the CRTC is our expert regulator, comprising professionals with comprehensive knowledge of the broadcasting industry. It is independent, and it is well known and recognized, as it operates outside of the political sphere and has done so since 1968. It must continue to act in the public interest and make use of the full regulatory tool kit. The bill would now ensure that the CRTC can use the full scope of its power to deal with broadcasters under the significant influence of an individual who has been sanctioned, or who has been implicated in genocide or other crimes against humanity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Additionally, I would like to recognize the important role played by Canadian courts and by international tribunals to which Canada is a signatory, such as the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, in making legal determinations of genocide and other crimes against humanity. While the House has an important role in shining a light on these types of bad acts and being at the leading edge of international responses, it is crucial that the political determinations we make in the House are not confused with decisions that have full legal standing both in Canada and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Next, I would like to speak to Canada's work in promoting and protecting human rights around the world, which goes far above and beyond the proposal in this bill. In fact, should the new reporting requirements for the government proposed in this bill go forward, I am confident Canadians would gain a better understanding of just how strong the government has been on this front. Just last month, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> announced that Canada would be seeking a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2028-30 term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Human rights are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. When there is greater respect for human rights globally, the world is more stable, prosperous and resilient. Unfortunately, they are also currently under attack, and the multilateral system that underpins these rights is under threat like never before. This is evident in challenges such as illegal wars of aggression against Ukraine, rising racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and discrimination and an intensifying backlash against the most basic rights of women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In order to confront the challenges that lie ahead, we must work together to reinforce the foundation of human rights and strive toward a more just tomorrow for everyone. Multilateral institutions play a crucial role in continued and effective engagement on human rights, online and off-line, and to holding countries accountable for their international human rights obligations, including respect for gender equality, the rights of freedom of expression, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and freedom of religion or belief. I encourage members of all parties to come together in support of initiatives that advance Canada's work on this matter, such as our candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council and many of the concepts proposed by this bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In her announcement, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> outlined that Canada's candidacy will be based on six priorities. As a member of the council, Canada aims to support the vital and courageous work of human rights defenders, strive for a more inclusive future for all, advance reconciliation with indigenous people, prioritize gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all of their diversity, reduce harms online, and work with others to address the adverse impacts of climate change, which Canadians across the country know all too well, given the wildfires raging across much of the country. These objectives are ambitious, but with determination and in close collaboration with other countries, indigenous partners and civil society we can advance these objectives and achieve a better future for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> also noted that the government's engagement on this issue is built on a desire to strengthen the international human rights system. It also reflects our approach here at home, where we stand up for the human rights of all Canadians. For example, we are currently celebrating Pride Month. It is a time for 2SLGBTQI+ communities and allies to come together to celebrate the resilience of the pride movement and to show the beauty and talent of our community, while also continuing to advocate for a safer and more inclusive Canada. It is necessary for us to keep in mind that, while it is important that we take the opportunity to recognize the hard-earned victories of the pride movement, we must continue pushing back on the sharp rise in anti-trans hate, anti-2SLGBTQI+ legislation, protests at drag events, the banning of educational books in schools, and calls against raising the pride flag. I am glad that, on this side of the House, working on that type of issue is a key part of our approach to human rights.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>In that regard, I want to thank all the municipalities across the country that raised the pride flag on June 1. I want to thank them because it is important. Resistance is rising across the world. Last week's flag raising is humbling, and I want to thank all of the mayors who participated.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>Canada's Human Rights Council candidacy adds to a consistently strong voice for the protection and promotion of human rights and the advancement of democratic values. It is without question that the human rights bodies of the United Nations are the foundation of a strong and effective international human rights system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada is party to several international human rights instruments and disarmament conventions, including the Convention on Cluster Munitions, to which we acceded in 2015. This convention, in fact, takes inspiration from the work of another great former Liberal foreign affairs minister, the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy, who led the charge in the 1990s on banning the use of land mines. Cluster munitions pose a devastating and indiscriminate threat to civilians in conflict and post-conflict contexts. Having immediate and long-term effects due to high failure rates, these weapons are dangerous and hinder sustainable development and post-conflict recovery for affected societies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canada has played a critical role in encouraging the international community to accede to the convention and ultimately eradicate these deadly weapons from the world. Canada meets its international obligations outlined in the convention through the Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act. We have also made significant investments to support programming that aims to eliminate cluster munitions and all unexploded ordnances of war. Over the past two decades, Canada has contributed over $450 million to this end. Our international programming addresses key elements of explosive ordnance clearance work, including national implementation support, stockpile destruction, gender mainstreaming, risk education, training and victim assistance. This work is essential to the sustainable facilitation of the safe return of civilian populations, reconstruction of affected communities and the restoration of essential services for generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All countries have a duty to promote and protect human rights under international law and the United Nations charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to thank my hon. colleague for putting this bill forward, and I look forward to further debate.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madame Speaker, before I begin my comments, I would like to say a few words. Quebec is in a very difficult situation right now. Over 150 forest fires are burning on the north shore, in Abitibi and in Lac-Saint-Jean. My colleagues are working on the front lines of that situation. Thousands of families have been evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Meanwhile, another tragedy has occurred on the north shore. Five people went capelin fishing and drowned. Four of those were children. It is not clear whether they were members of the same family, but it is a terrible tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to say to the devastated families and the families who have been evacuated that we are thinking of them and they have our heartfelt sympathy. We are hoping for rain as soon as possible to put an end to the forest fires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I thank my colleague for introducing Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>. It is an important bill that is quite robust and touches on many issues. I think that, more than ever, we need greater transparency on human rights. I think that is one of the objectives of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This bill has four components.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first objective of the bill is to increase government transparency. The government will be required to report to the House on international human rights issues. It will therefore be required to report more frequently. I will talk about that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second objective of the bill is to impose new measures to counter corrupt foreign officials, particularly by requiring that the Minister of Foreign Affairs respond within 40 days to any committee report recommending sanctions against a foreign national under the Magnitski Law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The third objective of the bill is to prohibit the licensing of foreign propaganda broadcasting undertakings when the state is recognized by the House of Commons as having committed genocide or is facing sanctions. No one needs to be a genius to know that this refers primarily to China, but also to Russia and other states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The fourth objective of the bill is to prohibit any investment in an entity that contravenes the Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act. Still today, throughout the world, weapons that were once used in a war are still on the ground ten years later. Children often go through those areas where bombs may have fallen and where parts of those devices may still explode and cause serious injuries and deaths. Moreover, the victims are often children. It is unacceptable that that is still happening today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us go back to the first component, government transparency regarding international human rights. I think that more than ever there is a need to ensure that Canada's actions advance the ongoing cases and issues of those who are unjustly detained. Transparency would allow for joint work with organizations such as Amnesty International. It would also enable families to be actively involved in a communication and dissemination strategy that is consistent with their needs. That would make it possible for civil society to support advocacy and grievances and for elected officials to follow up on real-life situations, which would help advance international human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I spoke earlier about the case of Raif Badawi. This is a clear case of unjust imprisonment. Mr. Badawi was imprisoned for 10 years simply for having posted things against his government on Facebook. His case received a lot of media coverage. His wife is still advocating for him. She is travelling around the world to talk about her husband’s case, to talk about human rights and all these issues. In Canada, we are doing nothing. We have no news. We do not know what is happening. Mr. Badawi is no longer in prison, but he is still stuck in his country. He would like to come and join his children, whom he has not seen for 10 years. His wife is here and his children are growing up. It is outrageous that we have no news and that the government is not more transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second component, imposing new measures against corrupt foreign officials, speaks to all the foreign interference problems that have been talked about in recent weeks. It is completely inconceivable that foreign individuals in Canada can threaten Canadians here, in Canada. We have heard stories. In the Uyghur community, people have been threatened and harassed and families have split up. It is an inconceivable tragedy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, we also immediately think of the case of the Chinese diplomat linked to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>, which we discussed here for many weeks. Despite all the questions asked, we never truly learned what the government did or did not know. We never received much of an answer to that. I think it is really important, particularly since the government is not acting quickly to stop activities that jeopardize the safety of a Canadian individual. That is the situation. We asked questions, but we do not know what the government knows. We are unable to get to the bottom of things.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>This bill will ensure that there will be more frequent reporting. Perhaps we may get answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I sit on the Special Committee on the Canada-People's Republic of China Relationship. Recently we submitted a report entitled “A Threat to Canadian Sovereignty: National Security Dimensions of the Canada-People’s Republic of China Relationship”.

              <ParaText>I would also like to mention that the Canada—Hong Kong Parliamentary Friendship Group met with representatives from Hong Kong Watch last week. They reported situations similar to those disclosed by the witnesses who appeared before the special committee. These examples of threats and intimidation can be found in the report, which describes them as the “coordinated use of counter-protesters, Chinese international students, and pro-Beijing United Front organizations to block and intimidate peaceful demonstrations in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver and Ottawa”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another example cited in the report is the “publication of private information online to intimidate protest participants”.</ParaText>

The Special Committee therefore recommended that the Government of Canada convey, to the Ambassador of the PRC in Canada, that any interference with the rights and freedoms of people in Canada would result in serious consequences. It also recommended that the Government of Canada carefully review accredited diplomatic personnel in the People’s Republic of China’s diplomatic missions to Canada. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText>Canada can no longer afford to be complacent about situations like this. It is unacceptable. We are being laughed at. Swift, consistent responses are needed to counter this type of interference, which threatens our sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The third element of Bill C‑281 seeks to prohibit broadcasting licences from being issued to foreign propaganda companies when the House of Commons or Senate has recognized the foreign government as having committed genocide or when it is subject to sanctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The same special committee report mentions that the People's Republic of China has been identified “as one of the countries that has attempted to interfere in Canadian elections”. That much is proven.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I remember when a representative from Hong Kong Watch appeared before the committee. I told her that there was a documented case of interference in the election of a municipal candidate in Brossard. The Chinese regime was sending messages in Mandarin to people in Brossard using a platform called WeChat to encourage them to vote for that candidate. I naively asked the representative from Hong Kong Watch whether such a thing were possible at the provincial or federal level, and she basically laughed in my face. She found the question to be completely ridiculous because the answer was so obvious to her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is clear that the Chinese regime has been attempting for years to influence municipal, provincial and federal elections here in Canada in any way possible. There is no doubt that issues are coming to light. People are talking about it more and more, but the government is still not doing anything about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to come back to another aspect of the special committee's report with regard to ACHK. It reads, and I quote:</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank colleagues of mine who have spoken to Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The New Democrats will be supporting this bill at third reading. I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation> for bringing it forward. It has been a real pleasure to work with him and his team on this bill over the past few months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reason for this bill is that we want to make sure Canada's laws protect human rights. We want to strengthen that legislation. We want to strengthen how Canada acts with regard to international human rights. For me, I want to remember, while we do this work, that people's lives are at risk. These are people who are being detained, who have disappeared and who are suffering greatly. Canada could play an important role there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to start my speech today by talking about a few of those people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to talk about Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has recently been sentenced to 25 years in prison in Russia because he opposed Putin's illegal war in Ukraine. I know that a number of people from all parties are hoping that the government will offer Vladimir Kara-Murza honorary citizenship in Canada to help protect him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I also know there are others. It has been over a decade, getting close to two decades, since Huseyin Celil, a Canadian citizen, has been able to see his family. There is also Dong Guangping, whose wife and daughter are Canadians. We do not know where he is right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a lot of work to do on human rights, and I want to make sure that we always centre this work on the people who suffer, the people who are impacted by this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As many have said before me, this bill has four changes to pieces of Canadian legislation. It requires the minister to publish an annual report on human rights, as well as a list of prisoners of conscience for whom the government is actively working. It amends the Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act. It amends the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, the Sergei Magnitsky act. It also requires the issue or renewal of broadcasting licences in the case of genocide to be prohibited. Obviously these are all things that I think are very important and very strong to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We were happy to bring some amendments forward. That first piece about providing the list is important. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation> spoke to many families of victims, and they wanted more information; they wanted that there. We were also conscious that there are some concerns. We do not want to put people's lives in danger. We do not want to make situations worse. We always need to act with an abundance of caution when we are working with things that are very sensitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The NDP brought forward an amendment that would change the list to give the government the ability to protect people but still give information to families, parliamentarians, activists and human rights defenders around the world. It was a compromise, and a really strong one, that makes the legislation better. It was lovely to see support from all parties on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our second amendment was on a human rights strategy. I have brought this up in this House before. We asked for there to be a human rights strategy in this country. Most Canadians probably feel we have one. We do not have a human rights strategy. We have no benchmark to measure how well the government of the day is doing in protecting human rights. That does not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It makes sense to me, and I think it is a very common-sense thing, to include that and have the government do it. Unfortunately, the government chose to vote against that. It chose not to move forward on that in a way that makes me believe it simply did not want to do the hard work. It simply did not want to have to do the work to create that strategy and keep it updated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is very disappointing, particularly considering that the government is asking for a seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council as we speak. It is very disappointing, because time and time again, we hear the government talking about being defenders of human rights while at the same time failing time and time again to do the hard work to protect human rights. A perfect example of that for me is watching the Liberal government, as reported yesterday in The Globe and Mail, continue to sell more arms to Saudi Arabia than any other country aside from the United States, despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has an appalling human rights record, despite the fact that this does not align with our Arms Trade Treaty and despite the fact that the government continues to claim that it has stopped doing it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>As we see, there is a record of the government speaking about human rights, and talking about being human rights defenders, but failing to act when it comes to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the things that I really want to talk about today is the piece in this bill around cluster munitions. This, for me, is the absolute ultimate in the Liberals' ability to say one thing when they are in opposition and do a completely different thing once they are elected as government. In the Prohibiting Cluster Munitions Act, section 11 carves out the ability for the Canadian military to use cluster munitions in the event it is working with another military that uses them. In 2013, the NDP worked very closely with the Liberal government to put restrictions in place to fix that loophole. Paul Dewar, the NDP foreign affairs critic at the time, said, “when we sign international agreements, it's important that we live up to our signature. It's important that the legislation we adopt does not undermine the treaty we negotiated and signed on to and accepted.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is one other quote that I would like to share, if I could, which states: </ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That is why, while we support the bill going to committee, we have great difficulty with the way in which the government has chosen to interpret the treaty in clause 11 of the bill.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>That sounds like it was Paul Dewar, but in fact, it was Bob Rae, speaking as a Liberal, saying how much Liberals disagreed with clause 11. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The language New Democrats chose in our amendment to close that loophole in Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document> was the exact language that our former colleague Marc Garneau had used when he stood in this place and said that section 11 was a loophole that needed to be closed. Again, we find ourselves in a situation where the Liberals have said time and time again, when they were not in government, that they wanted to fix this loophole. Some of the pre-eminent voices within their caucus, Mr. Garneau and Mr. Rae, people who would be seen as good, staunch Liberals, wanted to fix that loophole and saw that as important, but when it came down to doing the work, when it came down to them actually fixing it, they chose not to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It has been very difficult for me to listen to the government try to make excuses for this. It has been very difficult for me to listen to Liberals try to justify why they continue to support the loophole for cluster munitions, which is similar to why they continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. Before they were elected, they also said they would support nuclear disarmament, but whenever we asked them whether they would even attend the TPNW, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, even as observers, even the fact that many NATO members do attend as observers, they declined to participate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My ask of the government members would be for them to please be the Liberals they were before they were elected in 2015 and to please think about nuclear disarmament and human rights the way they did before 2015 because, since 2015, their record has been appalling, and human rights are far too important for this continual politicization.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I welcome colleagues, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak about Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>, the international human rights act, and to congratulate my colleague. Over this journey we have had together on this bill, I have been working to get his constituency's name right. It is <Affiliation DbId="278532" Type="2">Northumberland—Peterborough South</Affiliation>. I want to recognize the member for Northumberland—Peterborough South for putting forward this bill. I spoke at report stage about the provisions of this bill, and I want to focus on something else at third reading, which is how people will be able to use this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I spent the entire parliamentary recess week in the greater Toronto area, meeting with different communities, with the primary goal of sharing and discussing Bill <Document DbId="11849768" Type="4">C-281</Document>. There was a lot of support from different communities, from the Yazidi community, the Persian community, various African communities, the Hong Kong community and eastern European communities. There is a lot of support for this bill in the impact it would have. People were asking how we would use it and what concrete difference it would make. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>My hope is that Canadians of all backgrounds would eagerly await, every year, the government's publication of its annual report on international human rights. People will be able to look through that report to say, “What does the government say it is doing? What are the areas where the government is not doing enough?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They will then be able to hold the government accountable and say, “Why has it not talked about Ethiopia? Why has it not talked about Yazidis? Why has it not talked about Rohingya this year?” </ParaText>
              <ParaText>They will be able to look to see where the areas of action have been and where the areas of inaction have been and then hold the government accountable to ask why more has not been done. They can then look at the following year's report to ask if there has been progress in relation to the previous year's report or not. Are there individuals that communities want to see the government advocating for, in terms of their release? Are those names in the report? If they are not in the report this year, there is a jumping-off point for advocating for their inclusion next year</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Right now, so much of this advocacy, whether it concerns prisoners of conscience, human rights in general or listing individuals under various sanctions provisions, happens in a bit of a black hole of information. There are no requirements right now around this sort of reporting. If people want to advocate for individuals to be listed, for sanctions to be considered in various ways or for human rights advocacy, it can be very difficult to know what the government is doing and where the access points are for that advocacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This bill strengthens the Canadian government's engagement on human rights, we hope. It strengthens the tools that parliamentarians have, but it also provides broader tools for communities across the country who are concerned about human rights issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If one wants to see somebody sanctioned for human rights abuses they are involved in, one can advocate directly to members of Parliament, who can then put forward motions at committee. If one wants to know whether the government is doing anything on a particular human rights issue, one can look at the human rights report and ask if it is doing anything, if it is not doing enough or if one is satisfied. Then one can advocate for the government to change its approach and hope to see that change in approach reflected the following year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is important for communities of people who are concerned about human rights issues, not because this bill is going to usher in nirvana, and not because things will be perfect after the bill is passed, but because it provides critical tools of advocacy and mechanisms for people to know what is going on, to advocate and to make a difference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would like to start by thanking all of the individuals who played such important roles in getting this legislation before the House today, up for a final vote and, hopefully, off to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will start with thanking the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>. He worked very closely with me in drafting and putting this legislation together. I would like to also thank all of the non-government agencies and the families of victims who I had the opportunity to talk to, along with all the groups from various communities across the country and the world that have come together to signal their support. I would also like to thank Bill Browder for his support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have many thanks for the contributions from the members of the different parties who helped out, including the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and the Liberal Party. There were some substantial amendments made at committee. There was significant debate and long discussions. I am proud to say that I think we finished in a very good place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There were a number of concerns. I do not think any one of our parties got exactly what we wanted out of the amendment process, but perhaps that is a signal that we got what we should get, with one exception. I thought the NDP amendment for a plan of strategy for human rights was excellent. I was sad to see it ruled out of order by the Chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I said, this legislation has four critical parts that I believe would help the cause of human rights in Canada and around the world. The first of these respects prisoners of conscience, those heroes around the world who are fighting for important rights, such as for young girls to have the ability to pursue an education; for people to have the ability to live in a country free of government tyranny; and for people to pursue democracy, freedom and liberty and live their lives as they see fit without potentially fearing imprisonment or worse. The part on prisoners of conscience is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second critical part is having parliamentary oversight of Magnitsky sanctions. This is important. I am hopeful that this piece of legislation will not only allow Parliament to make its reports, but also encourage the government, maybe even future Conservative governments, to take the steps they need to make sure Magnitsky sanctions are put in place against some of the worst offenders. As I have said numerous times, it just seems shameful to me that, in this day and age, we allow violators of human rights to torture their victims in the morning and then take their private jets to fly around the world to hobnob with the world's elite in the afternoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Third, with respect to the Broadcasting Act, I think this is an amendment that only makes sense. Genocidal states should not be allowed to use Canadian airwaves to tout their propaganda. Just to add to that, we have seen what foreign interference can mean for our democracy and the challenges that can impose. Canadians should have a full, free and open ability to understand and give consent. We should also make sure that genocidal states are not broadcasting their hatred on Canadian airwaves. That seems to be only common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Finally, with respect to cluster munitions, of course these are horrible, terrible things. Canada has had a leading role, going all the way back to the Harper government, in outlawing and making them illegal. This will reduce the ability of Canadian companies to finance the construction and manufacture of cluster munitions.</ParaText>

For the sake of time, I will spare reading the text of the question into the record, but my point of order relates to a passage found on page 523 of Bosc and Gagnon, which states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>To restate, the government has stated it could not respond to the question in the 45 allotted days. As such, it did not answer the question, as required by the Standing Orders, within the allotted time. That is because Standing Order 39(5)(b) states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> If such a question remains unanswered at the expiration of the said period of 45 days, the matter of the failure of the ministry to respond shall be deemed referred to the appropriate standing committee. Within five sitting days of such a referral the Chair of the committee shall convene a meeting of the committee to consider the matter of the failure of the ministry to respond. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The key word here is “unanswered”. I have indicated my desire to have the question answered in 45 days, per the Standing Orders, and the government has now stated that the question could not be answered within that timeline. Due to this, per the Standing Orders, after 45 days my question remains open without a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before (5)(b) of Standing Order 39 came into effect in 2001, governments routinely ignored the 45-day deadline to answer questions. Following the adoption of this rule, the government began to respect the 45-day deadline. However, it appears that the government is attempting to circumvent this rule to thwart the intended protection offered to members of Parliament by Standing Order 39(5)(b). That is, it stated on the matter of the question that the government cannot respond within the time allotted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I think it hopes that would hold water with the Speaker, and that is why this point of order requires a different level of scrutiny and response than previous rulings made on related matters in the past. The Speaker often cites how what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The government's acknowledgement that it did not answer Question No. 1337 by saying it could not produce the information in the time allotted is an example of that principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Speaker's rulings have established that access to information from the government is a fundamental privilege of a parliamentarian. It is also a critical aspect of the functioning of our system of democracy. When the government flouts its responsibility to provide this information, the system fails. That is why, in a related matter, many members of the press gallery are raising concerns about the breakdown of the access to information system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government has also begun to argue in its responses that time allotted to respond to questions could lead to incomplete and misleading information. That too is a contravention of the Standing Orders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I ask the Speaker to consider this. If the government does not have the processes in place to answer questions, it is incumbent upon it to change those processes, not to contravene the Standing Orders. I ask that the Speaker respect this principle in their ruling. If the Speaker rules that the government can satisfy the Standing Orders by saying that it cannot respond to the question in the time allotted, then none of us should bother submitting Order Paper questions anymore.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>While I suspect the government would not much mind that outcome, the House is governed by rules that allow parliamentarians to access information necessary to do their job for a reason. In this instance, the government's decision to flout the Standing Orders severely hampered my ability, as a parliamentarian, to scrutinize a government expenditure that has been in the news for many weeks. I hope you consider this impact in your ruling and I would like to explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This question related to expenses in the mission cultural fund. Every year, the government spends millions of dollars on this fund that purportedly assists with Canada's diplomatic efforts abroad. Given the current state of geopolitics, this could be a reasonable expenditure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The problem is that I and, by virtue of me not having this information, Canadians have no real way of knowing because there is precious little information regarding how this particular fund selects project and is managed and how success is measured. The government's decision to flout the Standing Orders has made this situation worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I require a response to this question because last year, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> made blunt comments emphasizing Canada's lack of military power. She stressed that the federal government's current strategy is to continue to rely on soft power as the government's primary tool to influence other nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The concept of cultural diplomacy is the formal term for a notion that soft power can be exerted through sharing values like food, visual arts, music and literature. One of the government's primary vehicles regarding cultural diplomacy is the opaque and, frankly, questionably managed mission cultural fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Much has already been recently reported about the value for money that Canadian taxpayers may or may not get from this fund. More has been written about the provocative nature of some of the events that have been funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The bigger issue, and the issue I ask the Chair to rule on, is the government's muted and closed-door response to both of these issues. That is because you should not rule that the government's statement that it cannot provide this information in the time allotted is a satisfaction of the Standing Orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Very little has been said by the Liberal government to defend the program or describe how the fund is furthering broader diplomatic goals. How can I, as a parliamentarian, ascertain value for money if the government flouts, in the Standing Orders, questions about the matter?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For a government that loves nothing more than to loudly honk about spending money, the statement regarding my question raises many other questions. If the fund is not yielding impressive results, why hide them? Why not brag about how much has been spent, as it does with so many other programs? Why not disclose where the expenditures remain and what they accomplished? What criteria was used to select projects and the recipients of contracts?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Coming back to the matter at hand, my point of order simply asks you to rule that when the government substantively ignores much of the substance of an Order Paper question by saying it cannot respond within the time allotted, it should be considered an open question and it could also be considered a failure to answer for the purposes of Standing Order 39(5)(b).</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That way the government's refusal to answer a written question can be referred to a committee for review. It is unacceptable for the government to state that it cannot provide the information in the 45-day time period. That is not my problem. I ask the Chair to rule in my favour that this question remains open.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, like the previous member, I stand today to address some of what I believe are very serious challenges when it comes to the questions posed related to the Order Paper questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would read from the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. This is the September 2021 edition where 39(5)(b) states:</ParaText>

The question shall be designated as referred to committee on the Order Paper and, notwithstanding Standing Order 39(4), the member may submit one further question for each question so designated.

              <ParaText>I would specifically refer to Question No. 604 put forward by me, which was signed by the <Affiliation DbId="293789" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>.

            <Content>
              <ParaText>I want to indicate that I get the hon. member's point and I will take the information under advisement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to remind members who are getting up on this point of order that our precedents are clear that it is not for the Chair to rule on the content of the responses to written questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Indeed, in a ruling on a similar matter, on April 25, 2022, at page 4310 of the Debates, the Chair stated:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Chair is of the view that ruling on the completeness of responses to written questions is tantamount to ruling on their content, and that is not the Chair's role.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText>Therefore, although the hon. member is mentioning that the information was different, he may not like the information that he received, but he did receive a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will go to another point of order if the hon. member is finished. If he wants to continue on with respect to the information he just provided, as I indicated, he may not have been satisfied with the information he received, but it is very clear that it is not the responsibility of the Chair to rule on the information he has received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would ask the hon. member to wrap it up, please, because points of order and questions of privilege need to be succinct and to the point and should not drag on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, absolutely. Personally, I would not want to drag it on. I would just point to Standing Order 19 on points of order, which indicates the effort of being succinct certainly when addressing these fundamental questions we have before us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are three specific questions. To ensure that I am in fact succinct, I would simply reference specifically the other two questions I am calling the Chair to look at, not just with respect to the government having provided a response, but as to whether or not that response was satisfactory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>With respect to the work we do within this place, it is fundamentally important that Canadians can trust the information that is provided. Therefore, this has far less to do with whether I am satisfied with the response, as that is not even relevant to the discussion, but about the government hiding behind procedure and the ability to simply reply by saying it cannot reply, or in some cases it simply seems like it is not willing to do the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would refer you to Question No. 286, signed by the <Affiliation DbId="293767" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. There is a very clear unwillingness on behalf of the ministry to provide information. Again, it is not that I am dissatisfied with the answer, but the fact that it seems there is an unwillingness on the part of the government to provide any information related to the substance of the question. I may not like the answer, but it is not the responsibility of the government to decide whether or not it likes the question. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would further refer you to Question No. 565, signed by the then parliamentary secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, which has to do specifically with the work that is being done at the ethics committee, of which I am a part. The issue is not whether I agree with the substance, but that the government seems to be using the 45-day timeline requirement to simply not table a response in this place. It can then wash its hands of anything to do with those important questions that, in some cases, my constituents bring forward, like I referenced with— </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to the vote that took place on Friday, June 2, 2023. I want to express my thanks to the Speaker for returning to the House with the results of his investigation into the technical issues that were experienced. With the indulgence of the Chair, I would like to make a few brief points to add some context and then ask for a clarification from the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First, as the chief opposition whip, I would point out that votes on a Friday are rare and unusual. In my caucus, we allow members who do not have further responsibilities in Parliament on Fridays to travel back to their constituencies to tend to community and family matters. This is a policy that helps members who have long commutes to and from their ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In the Conservative caucus, we have 14 members from Saskatchewan, 29 from Alberta and 13 from British Columbia. That is 56 members from the west. To accommodate these members and others who travel great distances to perform their elected responsibilities, governments have generally avoided forcing these kinds of votes on Fridays. However, the government is in a rush to pass its budget implementation legislation, something the NDP is eager to help it do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am trying to provide context because we are seeking clarification from the Speaker, including in my own situation, where I had no use of my camera on my computer and had to switch to my phone. As you may recall, I also did not have the proper headset. I appreciate that my vote was counted, but these things happened on a Friday. I am certainly going to encourage all members of the House to make sure they have proper equipment and access at all times regardless, because of what you just said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The clarification I seek is this: is the Chair contemplating the question of privilege raised by the <Affiliation DbId="293762" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> to the government House leader? As you are aware, the parliamentary secretary rose in this place following the vote and accused the Conservatives of being in contempt of Parliament, which is a serious accusation. Such an accusation would normally be raised as a question of privilege and would then be contemplated by the Speaker, who would decide if there was a prima facie case of privilege. I note that the member did not explicitly state that he was raising the matter as a question of privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is a common practice for other members to return to the House to make arguments as they see fit if the matter is being considered as a question of privilege. Therefore, it would be helpful to all members if the Chair clarified whether a question of privilege is being contemplated. For our part, I can assure the House that the Conservative caucus holds the highest regard for the institution of Parliament. We do, however, have contempt for the Liberal-NDP government that is in the process of forcing a budget through.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I want to seek clarification on the use of the word “phony” in the House of Commons. You will recall that, last week, I referred to the special rapporteur, David Johnston, as the “phony rapporteur”, because the Conservatives simply believe it is a fake job.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, as I was saying, it is our contention and belief, as more and more Canadians are realizing, that the position of the rapporteur is fake and the idea that there is independence around it is also fake. The government may believe something different, but it is certainly our right as opposition members of Parliament to make that assertion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On Thursday, my question was interrupted by the Speaker because of that word, and that really puzzled me, because I have sat in that chair before and I know the exercise that one must go through in listening to interventions and assessing whether they are orderly or disorderly. It is truly a context-driven exercise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I used the expression “phony rapporteur” last week, I certainly was not imputing motives on the part of any hon. member or suggesting that any member was deliberately misleading the House. In my view, the use of the word “phony” was acceptable and parliamentary in the circumstances. Citation 490 of Beauchesne's identifies a list of examples of expressions that, between 1958 and the mid-1980s, were held to be parliamentary. They are actually in Beauchesne's, in a list of words that have been ruled parliamentary. Not only is it not on the list of unparliamentary words, but it is on the list of parliamentary words. I refer you to page 147 of Beauchesne's sixth edition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>“Phony” appears on that list with four separate rulings in support of it being a parliamentary expression: Mr. Speaker Michener, on July 7, 1959, at page 5624 of the Debates; Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole Charles Rea, on July 11, 1959, at page 5849 of the Debates; Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole Charles Rea, on May 19, 1960, at page 4051 of the Debates; and Chair of Committees of the Whole Herman Batten, on April 21, 1967, at page 15206 of the Debates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Perhaps more importantly, the expression has been in common use in the House since that time. Punching the term “phony” into the House's website search engine for parliamentary publications reveals hundreds of occasions when the term appears in Hansard. I know that I heard it often when I served as the chair occupant between 2006 and 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Here is one example by then leader Bob Rae, at page 6077 of the Debates, from March 12, 2012, which has a lot of resonance in this debate. It states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I ask you, Madam Speaker, to rule that when the government significantly ignores the substance of an Order Paper question, this should be considered a failure to answer, for the purposes of Standing Order 39(5)(b). That way, the government's refusal to answer a written question can be referred to a committee for review.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I thank the member very much. However, I want to remind members that, while members should have access to relevant and accurate information to ensure that they can fulfill their parliamentary functions, it is not for the Chair to evaluate the content of responses to written questions. Again, this is a response from the Speaker. As with Oral Questions, it is acceptable for the government, in responding to a question, to indicate to the House that it cannot supply an answer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, there seems to be a bit of a pattern developing here. I also would like to bring forward my issue with a non-answer, actually a failure to answer my question that was put, which is Question No. 1002. This is a very short question. It is not that I did not like the answer; I did not get an answer. In its answer, the government is saying it did not answer. I will put this into the record to show you another quick instance. My short question was:</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, my understanding is that, having stood to be recognized on a question of privilege, my standing should have come prior to that piece of business being moved, so I would seek a ruling from the Chair on that item and ask for you to come back to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I gave notice to the Speaker's office about the question of privilege that I am raising. It concerns the government's not appointing a Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. I would like to draw attention to pages 80 and 81 of the third edition of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, which states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Any disregard of or attack on the rights, powers and immunities of the House and its Members, either by an outside person or body, or by a Member of the House, is referred to as a “breach of privilege” and is punishable by the House. There are, however, other affronts against the dignity and authority of Parliament which may not fall within one of the specifically defined privileges. Thus, the House also claims the right to punish, as a contempt, any action which, though not a breach of a specific privilege: tends to obstruct or impede the House in the performance of its functions; obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of the House in the discharge of their duties; or is an offence against the authority or dignity of the House, such as disobedience of its legitimate commands or libels upon itself, its Members, or its officers. As the authors of <I>Odgers’ Senate Practice</I> (Australia) state: “The rationale of the power to punish contempts, whether contempt of court or contempt of the Houses, is that the courts and the two Houses should be able to protect themselves from acts which directly or indirectly impede them in the performance of their functions.” In that sense, all breaches of privilege are contempts of the House, but not all contempts are necessarily breaches of privilege.”</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>At page 82, there is a list of those offences. They include “interfering with or obstructing a person who is carrying out a lawful order of the House or a committee”. In this case, the government is refusing to fill the position of an officer of Parliament who is charged with carrying out the lawful orders of the House. On the same page, it also lists as an offence. “failing to fulfill any requirement of the House, as declared in a code of conduct or otherwise, relating to the possession, declaration, or registration of financial interests or participation in debate or other proceedings.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Without an Ethics Commissioner in place, there is no one on duty to ensure that members fulfill the requirements of the House, as described by the House in law and in its rules. There are serious questions that remain unanswered, like that of Michael Sabia, the former deputy minister of finance, who is now with Hydro-Québec. Mr. Sabia and the finance department were repeatedly lobbied by Hydro-Québec throughout his tenure as the deputy minister. Hydro-Québec approached Mr. Sabia about a job there, but Mr. Sabia declined to pursue it until the budget was released. He knew what the job was, and, lo and behold, the budget contained direct benefits for Hydro-Québec. There are many questions arising from this case that can be answered only by the Ethics Commissioner, and there is not one. Did Mr. Sabia report that job offer? Hydro-Québec lobbied finance, and both the company and the former deputy minister stood to benefit from the decisions he just made in government. It is actions like these that damage the public trust in institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberal government, this one in particular, its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and its ministers, has a record of repeated ethical breaches that further reinforce the question of privilege I am raising now about the need for an Ethics Commissioner to be appointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are several references in reports that have been tabled in the House, which I would like considered. They include the “Trudeau Report” and the “Trudeau II Report”. Both of these outline the first time in the government's history that a prime minister has been found guilty of breaking ethics laws. We also have the now <Affiliation DbId="278920" Type="4">intergovernmental affairs minister</Affiliation> who was found guilty of breaking the Ethics Act, and the then president of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, who had given a contract worth $24 million to a family member. The same is true with the former finance minister. We have seen repeated reports of breaches of this code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I want to refer you to Joseph Maingot's 2nd edition of<I> Parliamentary Privilege,</I> page 227. It says, “In the final analysis, in areas of doubt, the Speaker asks simply: Does the act complained of appear at first sight to be a breach of privilege...or to put it shortly, has the Member an arguable point? If the Speaker feels any doubt on the question, he should...leave it to the House.” This citation is in reference to a ruling from March 21, 1978, at page 3975 of Debates, where the Speaker cites the report of the U.K. select committee on parliamentary privileges, and from a ruling of October 10, 1989, at pages 4457 to 4461 of Debates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In a ruling of October 24, 1966, at page 9005 of Debates, the Speaker said:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> In considering this matter, I ask myself, what is the duty of the Speaker in cases of doubt? If we take into consideration that at the moment the Speaker is not asked to render a decision as to whether or not the article complained of constitutes a breach of privilege...and considering also that the Speaker is the guardian of the rules, rights and privileges of the house and of its members and that he cannot deprive them of such privileges when there is uncertainty in his mind...I think, at this preliminary stage of the proceedings the doubt which I have in my mind should be interpreted to the benefit of the member.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Finally, on March 27, 1969, at page 853 of the Debates, the Speaker ruled:</ParaText>
              <ParaText>
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[The member] has, perhaps, a grievance against the government in that capacity rather than in his capacity as a Member of Parliament. On the other hand, honourable Members know that the House has always exercised great care in attempting to protect the rights and privileges of all its Members. Since there is some doubt about the interpretation of the precedents in this situation, I would be inclined to resolve the doubt in favour of the honourable Member.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have an unprecedented situation, in which the government has an obligation, based on laws passed by members duly elected to the House, to appoint one of those guardians, one of those whose position allows them to safeguard the confidence of Canadians in this democratic institution. AS in the question I raised with respect to the former deputy minister, Mr. Sabia, testimony at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, which now appears in Hansard, was heard from spokespeople from the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner who said they are unable to fulfill their obligations because of the vacancy in this role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Members have the right to be able to file with the Commissioner, and the Commissioner then has an obligation to investigate these complaints and whether or not a breach of the act has occurred. In this case, it is incredibly serious. It deals with a deputy minister of the Crown then taking a position, a lucrative one, with a company like Hydro-Québec, which benefited substantially from the budget Mr. Sabia presided over as the deputy minister. Once that cash hit the table, he was out the door and into a job at Hydro-Québec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is only reasonable that members of the House, on behalf of Canadians, in order to ensure their confidence in the processes we have in place, would be able to raise that with an independent officer of Parliament so there could be an investigation. If that officer of Parliament were to find there was in fact a breach, there are ramifications for that; if not, then the matter is disposed of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is only one example, because we are not going to hear from all members of the official opposition today on other issues they have observed and that they would like investigated or raised with the Ethics Commissioner, because no one is in that position. In fact, when a standing committee of the House did send for a representative from that office, the office had no one to send except a communications director. I have checked, and if the Speaker consults the act, they are not going to find that members of the House are to raise concerns with the GR director, the PR director or the comms director for the offices of independent officers of this place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>They do not have powers that are given to them by statute or by law. The government has that obligation. It also has the power to appoint someone on an interim basis, but it is refusing to exercise that power. What this demonstrates is that the government is availing itself of the ability to mind the store without anyone counting the register at the end of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All members of this House were duly elected by their constituents. The official opposition is composed of members who have exercised the right to raise issues to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. That independent office has, in the past, found breaches by ministers of the Crown and by other designated public office holders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Madam Chair, I am asking for you to consider this question, come back to the House and make a ruling on whether my privilege, as a member of this House, has been violated by the government's actions and inactions in this case.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, June is Filipino Heritage Month in Canada and I would like to wish a happy Filipino Heritage Month to Canada’s Filipino community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This past weekend, I attended the Filipino Canadian National Congress convention in Halifax with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278131" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, and I was reminded again how this community was making a difference in every corner of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the fastest-growing communities in Canada, they are our doctors and nurses, our caregivers and restaurateurs, our sports stars and business owners. So many were on the frontlines in the pandemic, working so we could stay home and bend the curve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>With the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278252" Type="2">Mississauga—Streetsville</Affiliation> and Senator Gigi Osler as role models to the next generation, I hope we will see even more Filipino Canadians taking their place in public life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I look forward to celebrating with everyone this month. </ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278568" Type="2">Mr. Blaine Calkins (Red Deer—Lacombe, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to champion the outdoor way of life that millions of Canadians hold dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With over eight million avid anglers, two million passionate hunters and countless others who relish our great outdoors, we must defend and promote this cherished heritage. These pursuits not only provide immeasurable personal benefits, but also contribute a staggering $18 billion to our national economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us not forget that hunting, fishing and trapping are a huge part of Canada's history, which shaped us into the resilient nation we are today. However, the past eight years of the Liberal government have brought unprecedented frustration to some of those who hunt and fish, such as fishing closures that are not based in science, delayed decisions on selective marked fisheries and inaction to control pinnipeds that are devastating fish populations. There is also the full-on ideological attack on lawful gun owners that would have banned thousands of rifles and shotguns used by hunters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Only Conservatives truly respect those who hunt, fish and trap. Only Conservatives will prioritize conservation. Only Conservatives will safeguard Canada's outdoor way of life, generate new opportunities and ensure abundance for generations to come.</ParaText>

The pure white represents faith, purity and peace, as well as the commitment to harmony. Finally, the vibrant red symbolizes courage, strength and the indomitable spirit of the Italian people. It evokes Italy's determination and immense pride in its heritage. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>On this World Environment Day, our thoughts go out to the thousands of Quebeckers and Canadians whose lives have been devastated by the widespread forest fires. In Quebec, the SOPFEU has responded to 416 fires that are still burning. This is an absolute disaster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Climate change has a real impact on people and on our forests. We need to start a real green transition and really move away from oil, but, for the time being, let us say thank you to the thousands of men and women who are fighting these fires. Let us also thank the armed forces for supporting them and for supporting the people affected by the fires.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, our planet and our country are literally burning. Objectively, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> is making it worse. Not only has he allowed Canada's greenhouse gas emissions to climb to a record high, but he has also done so while dogmatically enforcing policies that are not getting the job done and are making the cost of living worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is because the Liberals' deficit-fuelled inflation crisis means that Canadians cannot afford to replace their high-emissions cars, even if they want to, or make improvements to energy efficiency in homes they do not have or cannot afford to live in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need to address climate change and make life more affordable. Today, I beg the Liberals to do smarter things, including getting more public transit bills, building more emissions-free electricity plants and, more importantly, cancelling policies that do not work, such as ineffective, inflation-causing deficit spending and taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>None of us can afford to allow these failures to continue. We just need to look outside today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the cost of the Liberal government is driving up the cost of living. The more the Liberals spend, the more things cost. They have added more than $60 billion in new spending, and what do Canadians get? They get more inflation, more taxes, higher costs and worse government services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians are struggling. Mortgage payments and rent have doubled under the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and that is if one is able to afford a home or find a place to live to begin with. The cost of food is at a 40-year high, driving more than 1.5 million Canadians to food banks in a single month. Now, the Liberals are adding a second carbon tax, increasing the price of food and necessities that will cost the average family another $600 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Things have gotten so bad that retired seniors are trying to re-enter the workforce, because they have to choose between heating and eating. After eight years of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, everything feels broken, and Canadians have less money in their pockets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the Liberal budget is the work of a <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> who says one thing and does another. She does not answer a single question asked of her in this House, and she lectures Canadians who do not agree with her. The $60 billion in new spending pours gas on the inflationary fire. She admitted that to be true. She said she would not do it, and she did it anyway. She told Canadians that the budget would be balanced in 2027. Now, she says it will never be balanced. She said the debt ratio would go down, but she cannot tell this House the number, because it went up. </ParaText>

They think we can spend our way to prosperity, but the last eight years have created a crisis. There is good news, though.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, “Water, water everywhere, so let's all have a drink.” At least Homer Simpson thought so as he scooped up a mouthful of sea-water to quench his thirst. Of course, while it may have the illusion of relief, drinking ocean water will not cure thirst; it will only make it worse. That is a lot like the Liberal budget. It is full of salt water. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians are parched with inflation caused by massive Liberal deficits. Even prominent Liberals, such as John Manley, Bill Morneau and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> herself admitted that bigger deficits would make the problem worse. Not only are the Liberals salting the water by tripling the first carbon tax and introducing a second one, but they are also racking up $63 billion in new inflationary deficits. Extra spending means extra borrowing, which means higher interest rates for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, the illusion that Liberals are offering in response to the cost of living crisis will actually just make things worse. Canadians will not be fooled. They are smarter than Homer Simpson and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, and they are demanding the real relief that Conservatives are offering.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the Liberals want to blame emissions on the senior who simply wishes to visit her grandchildren or the farmer who takes the bounty off his field and turns it into finished goods to go on grocery store shelves. The Liberals would rather penalize the single mother who has to drive long hours to provide for her family than face the fact that it is neither making a difference for the environment nor, certainly, for Canadians. Adding insult to injury, the government is planning to up the tax by adding a second one on July 1. The Liberals sure know how to party, do they not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians cannot at all afford this, and they are calling for change. Seniors are delaying their retirement, students are using food banks at astronomical rates and half of all Canadians are reporting that they are close to bankruptcy. The answer to climate change is not more taxation but, rather, more technology. This means that Canadians are the solution rather than the problem. They are the way forward. They are the problem solvers; they are the innovators that this nation needs. It is time for the government to celebrate them as such. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on May 12, the Hon. George Furey retired as the 45th speaker of the Senate. He was appointed in 1999, and at the time of his retirement, he was its longest-standing member. He is, however, much more than this. George was born in 1948, a year before Newfoundland joined Canada. He knew loss and challenges from a young age, as well as the importance of family, hard work and resilience. These guiding principles served him well as a teacher, principal, lawyer and politician.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am pleased to join Canadians and Newfoundland and Labradorians from all political stripes in celebrating of George's retirement. I would like to thank Karen, George's wife and best friend, his four children and their families for sharing him with this country and my home province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I look forward to watching how George shapes a traditional retirement. He has served his country and province as a statesman and courageous leader while maintaining humility and decency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, six months ago, the Minister of Finance promised a balanced budget by the year 2027.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it was just six months ago that the minister promised a balanced budget by the year 2027. She said that deficits fuel inflation. The former finance minister John Manley, a Liberal, said that while the Bank of Canada was slamming on the brakes of inflation with higher rates, the government was slamming the gas with higher spending. This could cause the whole engine to blow when all that mortgage debt Canadians hold comes up for renewal unless the rates come down. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, what is truly reckless is driving up inflation and interest rates on Canadian consumers who are the most indebted in the entire G7. In fact, the combined consumer debt is almost bigger than the entire Canadian economy. When the monster mortgages that Canadians took out, with the advice of the government back in 2021-22, come into higher rates for renewal there could be a massive mortgage meltdown. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Therefore, will the finance minister do what she promised only six months, and that is to stop putting fuel on the inflationary fire, balance the budget to bring down inflation and interest rates, yes or no?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, someone who advised Canadians to opt out of inflation by investing in crypto is pretty ill-positioned to offer economic advice of any kind. What is he doing instead of providing a responsible economic plan? He is blocking the support that Canadians need, real measures in our budget implementation bill, for example, cracking down on predatory lending. Who could be opposed to that? Is that not what Canadians need right now? The Conservatives, with their frivolous childish behaviour, are stopping Canadians from getting that support.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we are proud of a record that, during the last recession, cut taxes for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, let us talk about energy and food costs, which are some of the biggest contributors to inflation. It is puzzling that the government continues to increase taxes on both fuel and food and making them more expensive by continuing to increase the carbon tax. These carbon taxes, as the central bank says, are inflationary, and this government wants to impose a second carbon tax, which will just make food and fuel more expensive, because we have to ship the food to the table and farmers use fuel in their operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When will the government realize that its policies are making inflation worse?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, as I was saying earlier, Canadians are battling forest fires right across the country. It is likely going to be the worst year for forest fires in the history of Canada. While this is happening, just last week in this House, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278432" Type="2">Red Deer—Mountain View</Affiliation> rose to tell Canadians that climate change is normal. It is not that they do not care about climate change. It is not that they do not want to even understand it. They do not believe it is a problem, so why have any plans to fight climate change? Why have any plans to help Canadians adapt to what is a changing climate, as more and more Canadians face the impacts of climate—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, as Canadians plan their summer vacations, many are shocked with skyrocketing costs: motel prices, food prices and in particular gas prices.

As one of Ukraine's closest allies, Canada has and will continue to support the efforts of those brave individuals defending their homeland. This conflict, in many ways, may conjure memories of Canadians working with our allies in other democratic nations to ward off a common foe: the Soviet Union and eastern bloc nations during the Cold War, which lasted from 1946 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many Canadians served their nation during this tense period in our history.

              <ParaText>This bill would empower vulnerable people, such as women and children, by legislating the compliance of highly-likely-to-repeat sex offenders with conditions outlined under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, or SOIRA, under court orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For most people, September 16, 2021, was an uneventful day, but for Cody McConnell, it was the day his life was destroyed by a tragic event when his 24-year-old fiancée, Mchale Busch, and his 16-month-old son, Noah McConnell, were murdered by a 53-year-old registered sex offender who was deemed highly likely to reoffend. Because of this horrible and devastating event, Cody McConnell does not want anyone else to experience what he went through and still endures every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Noah's law would allow a court to order highly-likely-to-repeat offenders to comply with SOIRA for 30 years, in order to protect the public; to complete a sexual behaviour rehabilitation/treatment program before the termination of the order; to increase the frequency of reporting to a registration centre before moving to a new address; and to make it an offence for offenders to fail to report to a registration centre in accordance with SOIRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to acknowledge Laura MacRae, the lawyer and family friend of Cody McConnell who drafted Noah's law. I am also extremely pleased to have Senator Boisvenu introduce Noah's law into the Senate tomorrow afternoon. I would like to acknowledge the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278568" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation> as well for supporting Noah's law by sponsoring petition e-4460.

              <ParaText>My heart goes out to Cody McConnell and his family and friends. Mchale Busch and Noah McConnell have not been forgotten. Their deaths should lead to meaningful change within Canada's criminal justice system so that no other family will have to go through a tragedy like this again, and this bill would do just that. MPs and senators should quickly pass this bill. I would also like to thank Cody McConnell and his family and friends who came from Alberta to join us today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to be able to speak to this very important committee report. It has been an honour for me to work as part of the team on the public accounts committee. I will be sharing my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The 20th report deals with the public accounts themselves, which are the volumes that come out every year, detailing the government's spending. There are various important items in the report. I particularly want to highlight the dissenting report the Conservatives submitted, because it talks about an issue that is top of mind for many Canadians: the carbon tax. Our dissenting report highlighted how the public accounts revealed key information about the cost to Canadians associated with the carbon tax, and, in fact, the action we want the government to take, namely to cancel the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The dissenting report from the Conservatives highlights something we have been saying in the House for a long time, which is how the cost of the Liberal government is driving up the cost of living. We are seeing out-of-control spending by the government and higher taxes. This is driving up the cost of living for many Canadians. The more the government spends, the more it costs Canadians and the more those costs are seen in terms of taxes, as well as higher prices, which are the result of inflation. Every time the government spends money, it has an impact on Canadians in terms of higher prices and higher taxes. The dissenting report from Conservatives highlights how grocery prices are up; they are rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. The average family of four is now spending over $1,200 more each year to put food on the table. We have seen particularly astronomical increases in costs in areas like housing and rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The carbon tax applies to the fuel that Canadians use, as well as to the goods that need to be transported using fuel, which is almost everything. It is the things we eat and many of the things we buy. The carbon tax is baked into those costs, and Canadians are seeing those costs increase. In the past, the government has tried to claim that this is a tax that will not cost anybody anything, a rather convenient but absurd claim. The public accounts revealed, and Conservatives were able to identify in our exploration in the public accounts committee, the enormous cost to Canadians associated with the carbon tax. One way the carbon tax is obviously not neutral is the GST. The GST is charged on top of the carbon tax; it is a tax on a tax. I recall a time when a former Conservative MP, the late Mark Warawa, I believe, put forward a private member's bill to take the GST off the carbon tax, but Liberals opposed it. They voted in favour of double taxation, which is clearly not revenue-neutral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For Canadians who are concerned about the cost of the carbon tax, I am sorry to say that, as long as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> remains in office, it is going to get worse. The Liberal plan is to triple the carbon tax, and to do so in the coming years. Hopefully we will see a Conservative government reverse those plans. The Conservatives' plan is not only to not increase the carbon tax, but also to eliminate the carbon tax. We want to bring tax relief to Canadians. We want to focus on deploying technology, not taxes, as the tool required to move us toward our environmental objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals do not have an environmental plan. Their plan is clearly not working. Their only plan is to increase taxes on Canadians, and this is hurting Canadians. It is driving up the cost of living and making everything harder for Canadians. I am—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I apologize for that and I apologize to the interpreters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians are struggling because of increasing costs, and these costs are the result of a failed fiscal policy from the current government. We listen to the way the government talks about spending, and whenever things go wrong, it is not the Liberals' fault. Whenever the Liberals are spending money, they have no sense of the source of where that money comes from. We hear members of the government, ministers and other members, say that costs are high and things are challenging. It is as though when bad things are happening, they wonder, “How did this happen? We have been in power for eight years and costs are going up; surely it has no relationship to the policies we have pursued.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is actually very clear to Canadians that there is a direct, causal link between the decisions the government has made and the pain Canadians are experiencing. It is the Liberals' policy to increase taxes, especially in the area of the carbon tax. We actually just had a vote on what is, in effect, a second carbon tax that the Liberals want to impose. Not only do they want to triple the existing carbon tax, but they also have a second carbon tax in mind. They are constantly lying awake at night trying to think of creative new ways of taxing Canadians. The result is that Canadians are paying more. They are paying more to the government, but also, as government spending continues to grow and in even greater proportions outstrip the amount we are seeing in terms of tax increases, we are seeing rising prices driven by inflation and by more money chasing fewer goods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this was in the Conservatives' dissenting report for the public accounts committee. Conservatives have called for tax relief for Canadians. We have called for more freedom for removing the gatekeepers, for eliminating the carbon tax, for not imposing a second carbon tax, for not having a tax on a tax and other such attacks on Canadians' efforts to live an affordable, prosperous life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are some other things I will share from the discussions we had around the study of the public accounts at the public accounts committee. It was interesting to me to note that there are instances where the government has provided loan forgiveness to various corporations. They could be very large and profitable corporations that have benefited from loans from the government, to which the government says it is going to forgive those loans, so, effectively, those loans turn into a subsidy. Therefore, as part of the public accounts discussion, we asked whether the government would be willing to provide the names of those companies and to release information about who is benefiting from a corporate subsidy. It seems to me to be a common sense proposition that, at the very least, if a large profitable corporation is benefiting from a federal government subsidy in the form of debt forgiveness, that is, the stakeholders took a loan they were supposed to pay back and did not pay back, and the government says they do not have to pay it back, then at that point, they should have to tell not only the government; Canadians should also be able to know that the company benefited from a public subsidy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many people would want to ask questions, and the company operators should be expected to provide some kind of explanation. Corporate welfare should not be something that is provided in secret. Maybe it should not be something that is provided at all, but certainly it is not something that should be provided in secret. Therefore, we asked, as part of the public accounts committee process, whether more information could be given with respect to which companies are benefiting from such loan forgiveness. That information was not forthcoming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have asked for similar information through Order Paper questions as well, by the way. Some points were raised earlier today about the government's not answering Order Paper questions and that it provides what are very clearly non-answers to Order Paper questions. Answers are supposed to provide information. Again we see, in the public accounts committee, in responses to Order Paper questions and in other areas, this decline in terms of the willingness of the government to provide information in general in response to queries from members of Parliament, committees, the public and journalists, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, as I say, the main thrust of our dissenting report is about the fact that life has become more expensive. It has been eight years under this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Everything feels broken. Costs are up. Rent, housing and food are up and the government members want to behave as if it is not their fault and it is all some accident, as if to say, “How terrible that bad things keep happening to the country while we are in charge” and “What terrible fate we have.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>That is obviously not the case. The Liberal government is pursuing policies that are making life less affordable. It is piling taxes on taxes. It has the second carbon tax, in addition to the tripling of the first. Inflation is up because of government spending. We have seen the accumulation of more debt under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> than in the entire history of the country up until this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is clear that the Liberals are not working. Their policies are not working. They are not making life better for Canadians. They are not making life better for the middle class and those working hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is why we need an alternative policy prescription that recognizes the creativity, potential and creative genuis in every individual, and that seeks to harness that creativity to create more space and opportunity for individuals to go out and pursue their own ideas without the kinds of impediments that we are constantly seeing from the Liberal government. We need to unleash the creative potential of Canada by removing the gatekeepers and the barriers, and that includes reducing the regulatory burden on Canadians and lowering taxes. That is why we have put forward concrete policy proposals that move us toward—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it was a scam all along, and Conservatives knew it from the beginning. The Liberals and the NDP sold this carbon tax as something that would fix the environment, and the higher it went, the better the environment would get. The weather would get better. They also said that Canadians would get more back in their pockets than what they would pay into the scam in the first place. Were they wrong? Boy, were they wrong. The Conservatives were right all along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now the Liberals and the NDP have nowhere to hide. This was a scam that made the cost of gas, groceries and home heating even more expensive. Remember that at first they sold it as a levy? They said it would be a levy for your Chevy. They said that the more one drove, the more one would have to pay, so maybe people would change their habits. Boy, was that wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It does not take a government economist to see that Canadians were sold a bill of goods. The PBO says that low-income Canadians were hit the hardest by this scam. We are already seeing Canadians suffering today because the Liberal-NDP government spent and put Canadians further into debt than all governments before them combined. It made inflation go up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have seen 1.5 million Canadians visiting a food bank in a single month. We have seen one in five Canadians skipping meals in this country. One in four Canadians today are having to borrow money from their friends and family just to put food on their table, and now more and more Canadians who are being driven to food banks are asking for medical assistance in dying because they are hungry. This is the state of Canada today under the Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When my family and I came here, we came here to live the Canadian dream. Under the Liberals and their costly coalition partners of the NDP, that Canadian dream is dead. Canadians are working harder than ever before, sometimes two or three jobs, and they are not getting anything back in return. They are paying higher taxes than ever before because the government continues to spend. It continues to break its promises. It promised a balanced budget in 2015. It said it would balance the budget, and by 2019, there would be no more deficit spending. It is 2023, and it still continues to break that promise. It is breaking that promise on the backs of hard-working, struggling Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are these continued failed experiments, such as carbon tax number 1, and now they are introducing another one, carbon tax scam number 2. That does not have any phony rebates with it. The first carbon tax scam is going to cost each and every Canadian household an average of $1,500. The second scam is going to cost every single Canadian household on average $537. That is more than $2,000 on the backs of hard-working Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I talk to newcomers to this country all the time, and they have the same complaint. They ask us, “Why did we leave the country we came here from? We came to Canada looking for a better future. We were promised a lot. We were promised a better future. We were promised a safer future. We were promised that we could get ahead with the more work that we put in.” Now they feel like they were scammed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>They come here working harder than ever. At the end of the day, they have a Liberal-NDP government working against them and their hard work, so much so that now one in five newcomers are thinking about packing up and leaving this country. Most are only living here for about two years. They cannot afford the cost of living, and they have a government that is dead set on making sure that they take more from these newcomers than Canadians. With their carbon tax scam 1, they told Canadians they would get more back in their pockets. They promised, “We'll take some money from you, and we promise to give you more back.” Conservatives did not believe that in the first place. We knew it was a scam all along.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In my home province of Alberta, Albertans will be paying $2,500 more into this scam than what they get back. In Ontario, it is almost $2,000. This carbon tax scam was not as advertised from day one. Thank God the Parliamentary Budget Officer exposed the truth and the scam behind what the Liberals were selling for years. Do members remember when they promised that it would not go over $50 a tonne? They broke right through that promise, like they did when they said they would balance the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>More Canadians are finding it harder to eat and heat their homes. We hear about seniors having to cover themselves with blankets during the wintertime just so they do not have to pay the high heating bills they keep getting every single month. Heating bills have almost doubled across this country. Why? It is because the climate zealot, ideologically based Liberal-NDP government blocked and stopped any energy projects from being built in this country. They could have helped not only lower the price of energy in this country, but lower the cost of the fuel to heat our homes, of goods and even of food. However, the government continues to block them over and again. Why? It is because it wants to look woke. It seems like the more the Liberals go woke, the more Canadians go broke. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have an <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> who, as far as I know, is the only one in this House who has worn handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit at the same time. He is dead set on making sure our energy costs are the highest in the entire world. Not everyone has the luxury of having transit close to them or being able to ride a bike everywhere they go. We have hard-working Albertans and people who live in northern parts of Canada who have no other choice than to drive pickup trucks. What are the Liberals doing? They are punishing the people who are trying to make this country better, the people who are literally building this country with their hands and putting in hard work to make Canada the best place in the world. What is the government set on doing? It is punishing them. It is punishing our seniors and each and every worker in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is sad that newcomers to this country are not seeing the same opportunities that my family and I saw. We did not come from a really great background. We struggled for many years. There was a deal back then that Canada had: If someone put in the work, they would get something in return. However, with the government, the harder people work, the more they pay and the more they will be punished. Never before in my life have I seen people who used to volunteer their time and donate their money to food banks standing in those food bank lines themselves. That is the sad state of this country after eight years of the Liberal-NDP government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It is sad to see people who do not want to stay in Canada and help contribute anymore because they do not see the point in that. Some people have risked their lives and have left everything behind to come to this country, and now they want to pack up and leave and take their talent, energy and entrepreneurial spirit because the government continues to attack them and make everything more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is why the Conservatives will bring in a common-sense plan, cancel both these carbon tax scams and solve the problem using technology and not taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, let me just start off by reminding the  member that Edmonton is in Alberta and that Albertans overwhelmingly selected a majority Conservative government, rejecting the same carbon tax that we are debating right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>He wants to talk about disrespect. We can talk about the one in five Canadians who is skipping meals and the 1.5 million people who are visiting food banks because that party is making food, groceries, home heating and fuel more and more expensive with the failed carbon tax. We cannot call that party an opposition party anymore, because it is part of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>It has failed to hit a single emissions reduction target, yet it is making things worse for those struggling Canadians and putting more tax on the backs of Canadian families.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, here is a rebuttal. What do the Conservatives block? They are blocking dental care for seniors, people with disabilities and families with youth under the age of 18. They are blocking a grocery rebate that about 11,000 people in his riding would benefit from. They are blocking affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>In fact, the Conservatives are being pyromaniac gatekeepers, blocking all those things that the NDP has forced the government to do, which would actually benefit people in his riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, let me be very clear. What Conservatives are blocking is this Liberal-NDP government piling another 4,200 dollars' worth of debt on to the struggling backs of hard-working Canadians. That is what we will continue to block.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have two simple asks. The Liberal-NDP government needs to lower the deficit and lower the inflation. We see nine out of 10 young people blocked out of home ownership, and we see mortgages and rents going up. That is because these two parties got together and put Canadians further into debt than any government before them combined, which raised the interest rates. Today, we have a housing crisis along with a crisis of cost of living. It is because of the failed policies of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Conservatives will continue to stand up for Canadians, make sure that we lower the price and bring it home for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank the members of the House for rejecting that motion to adjourn; this gives me the opportunity to speak to this very important issue. I found it interesting that it was a report from the public accounts committee that was looking to be concurred in, but little was actually said about the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Instead, there was just a lot of talk about a price on pollution, something that the Conservatives should realize they have lost the war on. They keep fighting this fight thinking that, somehow, more members in the House are going to change their opinion on the matter. That is just not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians should know what is really going on right now, which is that the soldiers of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> are doing his dirty work for him. Earlier today, in a news conference, he said that he was going to put up every roadblock possible to ensure that we could not get the budget through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have news for Conservatives. We are absolutely going to be here as long as it takes to get the budget passed. We are going to pass the budget; we are not going to bend to their two ridiculous demands in the process. We can keep playing these games all they want. We can sit here into July if they want, but we are going to deliver for Canadians. That is what we have been sent to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians should also know about the games the Conservatives played on Friday. There is a great montage and summary of all that, which I have shared on Twitter. This shows the extent to which they used the hybrid provisions that we have in the House, provisions that are there to assist members in participating from outside this chamber, in order to delay absolutely everything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I hope that Canadians are aware of that. Typically speaking, on any given motion like this, we would have maybe one or two people who would have to raise a point of order after the debate. They would do this if something happened to their phone, where they were not able to utilize it properly or it flagged and said to “please verify”. Do we know—</ParaText>

Just for his information, we are debating a concurrence motion that his colleague put forward from the public accounts committee. That is what we are debating, but I am not surprised that Conservatives are absolutely clueless as to what is going on in this House right now, given the fact that 40 Conservative members, on Friday, raised a point of order after the vote and wasted a total of 23 minutes just in one voting exercise.

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola, I am honoured to table a petition. The petitioners are asking for support for Bill <Document DbId="11610193" Type="4">C-257</Document>, which would add protections for people who have political differences to make sure they are valued the same as other human rights in the federally regulated sphere. This is an important initiative, and certainly these petitioners need to be heard by their government. I hope the government will respond accordingly and favourably. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present petition e-4281, signed by almost 2,000 Canadians. The petitioners point out that a major source of bird mortality is collisions with windows and buildings. The Canadian Standards Association has a bird-friendly design standard that is already practised by many architects, builders and municipalities. These designs significantly reduce bird mortalities, at minimal cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners ask that the federal government include this standard in the national building code, and they also ask for a national plan to reduce the mortality of birds from building and window collisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I rise for the seventh time on behalf of the people of Swan River, Manitoba, to present a petition on the rising rate of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The common people of Swan River are demanding a common-sense solution to repeal the Liberal government's soft-on-crime policies, which have fuelled a surge in crime throughout their community. A surge of robberies by repeat offenders has forced nearly every business to install bars on their windows and buzzers on their doors. Now many local businesses are considering closing their doors for good. To say that crime has significantly impacted the local economy is an understatement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The people of Swan River demand that the Liberal government repeal its soft-on-crime policies, which directly threaten their livelihoods and their community. I support the good people of Swan River.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to table a petition on behalf of residents of British Columbia and visitors to the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call on the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> to reinstate the surf guard tower and surf guard services, and to extend the duration of the surf guard program to accommodate the growing number of emergencies as well as visitors at Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Emergencies at Long Beach are attended by Parks Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Coast Guard, Westcoast Inland Search and Rescue, B.C.'s Emergency Response Group and the RCMP. However, rescues initially fall into the hands of surfers, beachgoers and the surf schools that operate in the park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In February 2018, a man died at Lovekin Rock. In May 2018, in the same area, a woman died. In March 2016, four people were saved by the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Armed Forces. In August 2021, another man drowned at the same spot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Basically, lifeguards watched over that beach as part of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve surf guard program for 40 years, until the Conservative government cut the program in 2012. The petitioners are calling on the government to reinstate this program so that no more lives are lost.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>These Canadians agree that democracy is important, and they want to safeguard it. They think no one should be discriminated against based on their political beliefs. It is something we all believe in strongly on the Conservative side of the aisle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We hope that we can get this bill passed quickly so that Canadians will not face discrimination for thinking differently, which we have seen the Liberal government do time and time again. We are hoping we can get this bill passed to protect the rights of Canadians across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the second petition I will present today is from Canadians across the country who want to draw the attention of the House of Commons to the Liberal Party platform of 2021, where the Liberal Party was jeopardizing the charitable status of hospitals, houses of worship, schools, homeless shelters and other charitable organizations that do not agree with the Liberal Party on the matter of abortion. Many Canadians depend on and benefit from these charitable organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners point to the fact that the Liberal government has previously tried to impose a values test on the Canada summer jobs program. They are calling on the House of Commons and the government to protect and preserve the application of charitable status rules on a political and ideological neutral basis without discrimination on the basis of political or religious views, and to affirm Canadians' freedom of expression.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to present a number of petitions to the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first petition is the same as the petition my colleague presented with respect to the human rights situation in Turkey, Pakistan and Bahrain.

Also, the petitioners say that Turkish officials have wrongly detained over 300,000 people without reason and that multiple international human rights groups have confirmed gross human rights violations in Turkey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call on the government to closely monitor the situation in terms of human rights in Turkey, to sanction those officials who have committed these violations against these Canadians as well those involved in the killing of Gökhan Açikkollu, and to call on the governments of Turkey, Pakistan and Bahrain to end all human rights violations in their respective countries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the next petition highlights the ongoing, horrific and unjust detention of Mr. Huseyin Celil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners note that they were very pleased to see the release of the two Michaels who had been detained for 1,000 days in China. They note that Mr. Celil has been detained for over 5,000 days, that he is a Canadian citizen and a person of Uyghur ethnic origin who had been vocal on advocating for the human rights of Uyghurs. Of course, Uyghurs face ongoing genocide, as has been recognized by the House and most of the parties in this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to take a number of steps to support the human rights of Uyghurs and to seek the release of Mr. Celil: demand that the Chinese government recognize Mr. Celil's Canadian citizenship and provide him with consular and legal services in accordance with international law; formally state that the release of Mr. Celil from Chinese detainment and his return to Canada is a priority of the Canadian government of equal concern to the unjust detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor; appoint a special envoy to work on securing Mr. Celil's release; and seek the assistance of the Biden administration and other allies around the world in obtaining Mr. Celil's release.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am going to table a number of petitions that relate to the human rights situation in Hong Kong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>First of all, the petitioners note how recent Hong Kong graduates can apply for open work permits under a temporary public policy for Hong Kong residents. In June 2021, there were two pathways, stream A and stream B, announced to Hong Kongers who worked or studied in Canada to obtain permanent residency in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Stream B required graduates to have one year of work experience in Canada and have graduated within the last five years from a Canadian or foreign equivalent post-secondary school. On February 6 of this year, Canada announced an extension and expansion of the open work permit program for eligible Hong Kong residents by extending the open work permit for an additional two years. However, this extension failed to address time constraints that stream B applicants face while pursuing eligibility for permanent residency. The 2016-17 graduates who met the five-year graduation requirement at the time of applying for the open work permit are falling out of eligibility to apply for permanent residency under stream B of this scheme by the time their work permits are received and they have fulfilled the hours of work requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call upon the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</Affiliation> to remove the five-year restriction to include all persons who fulfill the educational credential requirements of stream B.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the next petition is also about the situation in Hong Kong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners note the injustices that have been inflicted against Hong Kong and how people who have been involved in the democracy movement might have faced politically motivated prosecutions and, as such, they might be considered inadmissible to Canada under the current approach being taken. The petitioners are concerned about people being asked for police certificates and so forth. It would be difficult for those who have been involved in the democracy movement and faced politically motivated prosecutions to get those certificates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to recognize the politicization of Hong Kong's judiciary; to affirm its commitment to render all national security charges and convictions irrelevant and invalid in relation to section 36(1)(c); to create a mechanism by which Hong Kong people with pro-democracy movement related convictions provide an explanation for such convictions on the basis of which government officials can grant exceptions to Hong Kong people who would otherwise be deemed inadmissible; and to work with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Australia, New Zealand and other democracies to waive criminal inadmissibility of Hong Kong people convicted for political purposes who otherwise do not have a criminal record. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), the list of state supporters of terrorism is not provided for under section 83.05 of the Criminal Code but is pursuant to section 6.1 of the State Immunity Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Section 83.05 of the Criminal Code provides for the Governor in Council, GIC, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety to establish a list of terrorist entities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Under the Criminal Code, “entity” means a person, group, trust, partnership, fund or an unincorporated association or organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In order to be listed, the GIC must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that “[s. 83.05(1)(a)] the entity has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity”; or “[s. 83.05(1)(b)] the entity has knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with, an entity” involved in a terrorist activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Determining whether to designate an entity is based on information, intelligence and legal analysis. It involves cross-government consultations and the preparation of security or criminal intelligence reports, which are independently assessed by the Department of Justice to ascertain whether an entity meets any of the thresholds for listing as set out in subsection 83.05(1) of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (b), the list of state supporters of terrorism is not provided for under section 83.05 of the Criminal Code but is pursuant to section 6.1 of the State Immunity Act, which is described in the answer to part (c).</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With respect to the list of terrorist entities pursuant to the Criminal Code, the process of adding or removing entities is iterative and ongoing. The Government of Canada does not disclose the specifics of this publicly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In respect of a foreign state, the “terrorist activity” definition in the State Immunity Act has the same meaning as in subsection 83.01(1) of the Criminal Code, provided that a foreign state set out on the list referred to in subsection 6.1(2) does the act or omission on or after January 1, 1985.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (c), with respect to the List of State Supporters of Terrorism, created in 2012 pursuant to section 6.1 of the State Immunity Act, the Governor in Council can create a list of states where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a state has provided support to a listed terrorist entity under the Canadian Criminal Code. “Support” is defined in the State Immunity Act as an act or omission in relation to a listed terrorist entity that, had it been committed in Canada, would be punishable under specific counterterrorism provisions of the Criminal Code. As such, upon the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Minister of Public Safety, the Governor in Council has the authority to list foreign states that have supported a terrorist entity named pursuant to the Criminal Code. By being placed on this list, states lose their immunity from the jurisdiction of Canadian courts in relation to actions brought against them in connection with their support of terrorism under the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, the pan-Canadian vaccine injury support program, VISP, provides financial support to people in Canada in the rare event that they experience a serious and permanent injury as a result of receiving a Health Canada authorized vaccine, administered in Canada, on or after December 8, 2020. The program also provides death benefits and support for funeral expenses in the rare case of a death as a result of receiving a Health Canada authorized vaccine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The VISP was launched on June 1, 2021, and is being administered independently by Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Consulting Inc., RCGT, with Public Health Agency of Canada, PHAC, funding. PHAC is not involved in individual cases, including in the determination of decisions regarding causality or compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As the independent third party administrator, RCGT oversees all aspects of claims intake and assessment and is responsible for providing periodic public reporting on program statistics. Public reporting began on December 1, 2021, and data on the VISP is updated twice a year. Latest public reporting can be found at: https://vaccineinjurysupport.ca/en/program-statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Province of Québec continues to administer its long-standing vaccine injury compensation program, VICP. Information on Québec’s VICP, including program statistics, can be found at: https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/vaccination/vaccine-injury-compensation-program#c3895.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (a), as of RCGT’s last public report on December 1, 2022, RCGT had received 1,299 claims; 221 claims had been assessed by a medical review board and 50 had been deemed eligible for compensation; and 171 of the claims assessed by the medical board were deemed ineligible for compensation and 209 claims did not meet the eligibility criteria. Further information with regard to program statistics can be found at the following link: https://vaccineinjurysupport.ca/en/program-statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Province of Quebec updates its program statistics annually. As of March 31, 2022, Quebec’s VICP had received 410 claims; 199 claims were assessed by a medical committee and 56 had been deemed eligible for compensation; and 143 of the claims assessed by a medical committee were not deemed eligible for compensation and 45 claims received were not pursued. Further information with regard to program statistics can be found at the following link: https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/vaccination/vaccine-injury-compensation-program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (b), from June 1, 2021, until December 1, 2022, a total of $2,779,277 in compensation has been approved or paid by RCGT.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>From the inception of the program in 1988 until March 31, 2022, Quebec’s VICP has paid a total of $7,853,000 in compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (c), the amount of compensation an eligible individual will receive is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the injury. Eligible individuals may receive income replacement indemnities, injury indemnities, death benefits, including coverage for funeral expenses, and reimbursement of eligible costs such as otherwise uncovered medical expenses. Given the different types of supports available, the average dollar value of successful claims would not represent the amount an eligible claimant may receive through the VISP or VICP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (d), serious and permanent injury is defined as a severe, life-threatening or life-altering injury that may require in-person hospitalization or a prolongation of existing hospitalization, and results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or where the outcome is a congenital malformation or death. In compliance with privacy laws and policies, PHAC only collects information relevant to program administration. As per the terms and conditions of the funding agreements with RCGT and the Province of Quebec, PHAC will never receive disaggregated data on details on the nature of injuries for which claims are being submitted or approved from RCGT and Quebec.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), since the start of the pandemic, the Public Health Agency of Canada, PHAC, has conducted several reviews and assessments of its emergency response activities, including linkages with key emergency management plans. During this time, these plans have provided a useful framework for establishing key governance and operational structures to drive response activities in accordance with internationally recognized best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The collective learning from Canada’s experience with the COVID-19 pandemic is informing PHAC’s preparedness planning for future pandemic or epidemic events together with a broad range of federal, provincial, territorial, FPT, and indigenous partners and multiple multisector partners, building on all key components of the public health response to COVID-19 including strengthening surveillance, wastewater monitoring and detection of infectious diseases; improving early monitoring and warning processes; updating and testing our emergency plan; securing and distributing vaccines, therapeutics, and other equipment; enhancing public health risk communications and trust building among people living in Canada; and developing evidence-informed public health guidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Office of the Auditor General, OAG, published four reports concerning COVID-19 performance audits related to pandemic planning, health surveillance, early warning of public health threats, border measures, strategic stockpile and procurement support of vaccines. Further information concerning the AG’s report findings can be found at the following link: https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca. Further information concerning PHAC’s management response action plans to address the various OAG report recommendations can be found at the following link: Audit reports - Canada.ca.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>PHAC’s work and other forward-looking pandemic preparedness work is already under way as part of several PHAC management response action plans in response to OAG audits related to COVID19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>For example, PHAC is already working with provincial and territorial, PT, partners to build on information sharing, management, and technology improvements; PHAC has established a new centre for integrated risk assessment; PHAC has established a new centre for data management, innovation and analytics; PHAC has restructured its border and travel health program to better respond to the changing pandemic and increase its focus on compliance; PHAC continues to work with FPT partners and vaccine manufacturers to manage its supply of COVID19 vaccines, make surplus vaccine doses available to other countries for donation, and prepare for potential pandemic influenza vaccine readiness; and PHAC continues to support and improve vaccine information data sharing among FPT health authorities and indigenous partners, health care professionals and vaccine manufacturers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Drawing from lessons learned, PHAC will continue to support the health and well-being of Canadians and prepare for future pandemic or epidemic events.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know how important it is to take stock of what we’ve learned through this pandemic, to prepare for future health emergencies. We can always do more, that’s why our government has committed to a COVID response review in the future. In the meantime, we will keep working with provinces and territories to improve our health care system and keep Canadians healthy and safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>With regard to part (b), since January 1, 2020, PHAC has led or contributed to 21 emergency preparedness exercise activities. This includes 15 discussion-based exercises such as seminars, workshops or tabletop exercises, and six operations-based exercises such as drills, command post or full-scale exercises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Exercise activities included various partners internal to the health portfolio, other federal departments and provincial, territorial and/or municipal partners as required for the designated subject matter and scenarios. The exercises aimed to meet targeted objectives developed for each individual activity, testing relevant plans and processes involved in the emergency response. In addition, the exercises highlighted best practices, gaps and opportunities for improvement moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In processing parliamentary returns, the government applies the principles set out in the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. The requested information in part (b) concerning emergency preparedness exercises and simulations is considered to be protected information, therefore the specific details have been withheld due to confidential business information.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask for an emergency debate on the urgent and escalating wildfire situation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to first say that our hearts are with the 30,000 Canadians who are still out of their homes and the many hundreds who have lost everything in these fires. I thank the firefighters on land and in the air for their brave and dangerous work keeping all of us safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>More than 400 fires are burning right now across the country from Vancouver Island to Nova Scotia. More than 3.6 million hectares have been torched so far this year, and it is only the first week of June. We have a long, hot fire season ahead of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Local and provincial first responders have been overwhelmed. It is clear that we need to re-evaluate the federal role in wildfire protection and response to develop a more proactive process, instead of the present reactive one, and we must do as much of this as possible as quickly as possible in the next few weeks, before summer truly arrives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This process and support to affected parts of the country should be informed by the urgent debate of Parliament, so I therefore ask for an emergency debate tonight here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I am rising today to also request an emergency debate for the very serious matter we see happening across Canada today, which is the housing crisis. It is one that the <Affiliation DbId="278914" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation> refuses to acknowledge as something we are going through today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>New IMF data was released. It shows that Canadian households face the greatest risk of mortgage defaults as households struggle to cope with increasing interest rates. These high interest rates were caused by high inflationary deficit spending by the government. It made the Governor of the Bank of Canada raise the rates, causing Canadians headaches and all sorts of hardships when it comes to the housing crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, in November, said she did not want to throw fuel onto the inflationary fire, but then, with the recent budget, threw 68 billion dollars' worth of fuel on that inflationary fire. That made the inflation problem worse and will possibly have the Bank of Canada raise its interest rates once again, which would cause even more hardships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know that nine out of 10 young people cannot imagine home ownership. Newcomers do not even dream of ever owning a home, as the cost of living is growing because of the inflationary deficit spending by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would also implore you, when considering this decision, to also consider that we are on the reading stage of the budget, so it only limits the scope. We want to expand it because of how serious the housing crisis is and how much worse it is going to get when people start defaulting on mortgages, according to RBC and this IMF report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am requesting an emergency debate on this very serious matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I suggest that we make sure the Table gets that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just to clarify, once the agreement has been made among the parties, even though it is after 6:30 p.m., a motion to move forward on this would probably be in order. If somebody could move that motion, it would be beneficial.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Just to make sure that everything is in order, let us pause to make sure the text reflects the agreement that has been had among the parties this evening.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>He said: Mr. Speaker, as Tupac once said, “All I'm trying to do is survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty, unbelievable lifestyle that they gave me.” More Canadians I talk to today feel like that is exactly the position the current Liberal government has put them in: a dirty, nasty, unbelievable position because of its overspending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We used to have something called a Canadian dream here in Canada. After eight years of the current Liberal-NDP government, that Canadian dream is dead for so many people. I will tell members why. It is because Canada is now seeing one in five Canadians skipping meals, and we are seeing 1.5 million Canadians going to food banks in a single month. Two in five Canadians are borrowing money from friends and family just to put food on the table, and nearly a third of Canadians are struggling just to get by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we talk about what the Canadian dream used to be and what it used to represent, now we see that the dream is gone for many newcomers and those living here who are just struggling to barely get by. These are not statistics of a country that is prospering or one that people can look forward to moving to, but that is the reality after eight years of the current government's failed policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Members might ask why Canadians are feeling this way. As Thomas Sowell once said, “The real goal should be reduced government spending, rather than balanced budgets achieved by ever rising tax rates to cover ever rising spending.” Having a government that has added more debt on the backs of Canadians than all governments before it combined is what plunged Canadians into the worst cost of living crisis in history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Inflation has ravaged our country and Canadians for a very long time. On top of that, we have a Liberal government that does not stop raising taxes. People are already being pile-drove by the cost of living crisis because of out-of-control spending, which made interest rates go up as well. Then the Liberals pile more taxes on Canadians. We see two payroll taxes; an excise escalator tax; carbon tax 1.0, which went up; and a second one that the Liberals are going to introduce to make gas, groceries and home heating even more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will take members back to a few months ago, in November. Do they remember when the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> fooled us all? She said she had an epiphany. First, she finally admitted that deficits fuel inflation. That is what she said. She also said she was going to be careful. She said she did not want to throw more fuel on the fire of inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Even in her fall economic statement, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> fooled us once again. She showed in the fall economic statement that she would have a balanced budget by 2027. She said there would be no more deficits. She even had it down in writing for Canadians to see. It took until just six months after that for her to do a massive flip-flop and say she was just kidding and that not only is she not ever going to stop spending money, but her inflationary deficits will never end. She said she will never balance the budget. She turned on her own word and threw a $60-billion jerry can of fuel on the inflationary fire that she started in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Member should remember that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is the one who said that deficits fuel inflation. Those were her words. It is something the Conservatives had been saying from day one and that the Liberals refused to acknowledge. It is not just us. The possible future Liberal leader and the finance minister's possible seatmate when the Liberals are on this side of the House, Mark Carney, said that inflation in Canada increasingly reflects what is happening in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="20">(1920)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>If members do not want to believe him, we have a former Liberal finance minister, John Manley, who said, “[The Liberal Prime Minister's] fiscal policy is making it harder...to contain inflation.” This is something that was also confirmed by the current Governor of the Bank of Canada, Tiff Macklem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Where does all this wasteful spending lead, with the added-on $60 billion? It is going to lead to each and every Canadian household having another $4,200 of debt put on their backs. This is because the government, supported by its coalition partner, the NDP, just cannot help itself but to continue to tax Canadians further and further into bankruptcy. It is at the point now where we are seeing insolvencies going up more than ever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>More Canadians are visiting food banks than we have ever seen before. Why is this? It is because this trust fund <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not understand the pain of Canadians. How could he understand it? He is the same guy who spent $6,000 a night on a hotel room. How does he understand the pain of what he is putting Canadians through? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We see wasteful spending of $22 billion on consultants. Those consultants are covering up for the incompetence of the government, especially its ministers. That is the ministers' job. They are supposed to be figuring out how to fix the airports and immigration system that they have made a huge mess of, yet they are hiring more and more consultants to try to cover for their problems. What is that doing? That is adding more taxes on to Canadians and driving more people to the food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>While we are talking about food banks, we had some of them testify at committee recently. All we hear from the Liberal side is that everything is fine, that things are great here in Canada and that people have never had it so good. However, the CEO of the Daily Bread Food Bank said, “The underlying reasons for [higher food bank usage] are complex, but I can summarize them in one sentence: People do not have enough income to afford the rapidly rising cost of living.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have already established that the government brought out-of-control inflationary deficits that pile-drove and forced Canadians into this cost of living crisis. Then, the government piled on more taxes, such as carbon tax 1, which was a scam all along; it made gas, groceries and home heating more expensive. Now, on July 1, it is going to pile-drive another one, carbon tax 2.0, which is going to take even more out of Canadians' pockets. It is going to make gas, groceries and home heating even more expensive. This government is not “responsible” or “fiscally prudent”, although these are words that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> sometimes likes to use. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is a government dead set on bankrupting more and more Canadians and taking more and more from them. Canada is not the country it used to be, where a person could put in hard work and expect to get something back. Now, people are working harder than ever, yet they do not see a promise that they are ever going to be able to afford a home. Interest rates keep going up because of the government's out-of-control spending. Those interest rates might go up even further. We have a housing crisis in this country, because of the out-of-control spending by the government; this budget, again, is going to add another $60 billion of fuel to that fire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Conservatives continue to stand up for the betterment of Canadians. We are calling for a few simple things. When Conservatives take over, we are going to bring home powerful paycheques, lower prices and more affordable homes that Canadians can actually afford. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our two simple requests for this out-of-touch Liberal-NDP government are to lower the deficit and axe the tax. Lowering the deficit would lower inflation, and with that, the interest rates would come down. Axing the scam of both the failed carbon taxes would let Canadians keep more in their pockets. Let us bring down the cost of gas, groceries and home heating; let us bring it home for Canadians and actually do something to help them out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Why does he not mention anything about climate change, in terms of affordability, and its impact on food prices and impact on Canadians? However, I will not ask him that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My question is this: Before standing up in this House and ignoring climate change, did he even go outside today to see the smoke in the air in the nation's capital from forest fires elsewhere, or is he just going to put his head in the sand and continue with the old ways of the Conservative Party?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of smoke and a lot of hot air coming out of that member's mouth. The member fails to realize that all these events are taking place. How much has the Liberals' carbon tax actually helped? How many fires or climate events has it stopped from happening?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals do not even have an environmental plan. We looked for it everywhere. Can anyone say they found the Liberals' environmental plan? Mr. Speaker, have you seen it? I have not seen it yet, and I looked for it. I did not find it anywhere. What we found was a tax plan that made gas, groceries and home heating more expensive, and the Liberals doubled down. Their failed carbon tax scam 1.0 already made the cost of everything go up, and now they are going to pile-drive another one, with carbon tax scam 2.0.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They need to get serious, actually present an environmental plan and stop the hypocrisy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, on another note, I would like to talk a bit about the monarchy with my colleague. The monarchy is a subject that the Bloc Québécois is particularly fond of talking about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>As members know, the Liberals included the recognition of Charles III as Canada's sovereign in Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, which we find a bit far-fetched in such a bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, the Bloc Québécois still wanted to give the Liberals the benefit of the doubt. Since it is only fitting, and generally proper procedure, we asked that Charles III be invited to appear before the Standing Committee on Finance so that we can assess his skills. That seems fundamental to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We asked Rideau Hall if it was possible to invite him. We were told to ask Buckingham Palace, which we did. Buckingham Palace told us that we had to send a request in writing on fine paper, no less. They are fancy at Buckingham Palace. Obviously, it was a lost cause. Charles III will not appear before the Standing Committee on Finance as we would have liked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives are proposing to remove clause 510, which proclaims Charles III as Canada's sovereign. I think that is worthwhile, and I would really like to hear my colleague's thoughts on that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, I want to hone in on an aspect of the member's speech that I think is really important for Canadians to attempt to understand. I believe the member often presents a goodwill solutions to the many things that are affecting Canadians from coast to coast to coast, particularly on affordability. I commend him for offering, what I believe, is an attempt at a solution for the affordability crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I am the wrong person to look to for a Tupac quote. However, in the rest of my speech, I will try to educate, enlighten and entertain members of this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I asked about this in my question. It was troubling this morning when I got a warning on my phone. I think we all would have if we looked at the weather. It was an air quality advisory in Ottawa, which was related to forest fires elsewhere. It is shocking to me that members of the Conservative Party could go outside this building, see it with their own eyes, and then go to their ridings. They stand from Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. They see these forest fires; they see the impacts of climate change so directly. It is impacting lives. I know they are passionate about their constituents. They get up, talk and ask what the government is doing, but they do not talk about the impacts of climate change on their residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives do not put two and two together, despite scientists across the country, Nobel laureates and every credible scientist saying that these things are connected. However, the Conservatives stick their heads in the sand, even though they all, every single one, ran on a price on pollution during the last election. They can see it. We can see it with our own eyes. The hon. members can see, with their own eyes, the impacts of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What will these forest fires and floods cost Canadians? What do droughts cost farmers? The members talk about the impacts on Canadians, and that is the right thing to be talking about. What are the long-term impacts? What are the impacts going to be on our kids? If it is tens of billions of dollars now, what is it going to be for our kids? My kids are about to turn seven and five. What is it going to be like in 20 years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are seeing the planet get warmer. The Conservative Party of Canada is going to throw its hands up in the air and say, “We've tried nothing, but we're all out of ideas.” I do not know how they can look their kids and their grandkids in the eye.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a lot more work that we have to do. That is fair enough; there is not necessarily one way to get to a particular path, but the Conservatives are offering no solutions. We can see smoke in the sky outside. What do the Conservatives have? They have absolutely nothing but bumper sticker slogans. As I mentioned in an earlier comment, the only part of the Conservative environmental plan is recycling their slogans. That is all they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When it comes to actually working for Canadians, the Conservatives talk a good game. All these slogans sound great; they are going to do this or that, all these things straight off the bumper sticker. However, where have they been in the last seven and a half years? The Liberal government and other parliamentarians have worked hard to help lift Canadians out of poverty. There are 2.7 million fewer Canadians living in poverty, than there were in 2015, when the Conservatives were in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Where were they when the Canada child benefit was discussed? They voted against it. They were against increases to the guaranteed income supplement and increases to old age security. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> is fervently against day care, which means thousands of dollars in the pockets of families who are having a difficult time. The Conservatives were against the Canada worker benefit and the rental benefit. Time after time, Conservatives talk a good game, but that is all they have. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is no policy plan, only cuts. We have seen this story before. They say, “Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. The government will not be there for you.” There would not be anything that the Conservative party would do to help Canadians, except make it free to pollute. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The cornerstone of their policy is that those who pollute the most will get the biggest tax break. They will cut the benefits to Canadians, cut the green rebate to Canadians, the climate action incentive, and transfer that money to the biggest polluters in this country. That is unbelievably shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is no ambition. There is no fear for our children on that side of the House, and there is no desire to do anything better for our kids. There is no view in terms of what the long-term costs are going to be on this because, again, they will do nothing. Let the fires burn. Let the floods happen. The Conservative Party of Canada will do absolutely nothing on climate change. We have heard from economists, from the insurance industry and from national security experts, who have said the greatest threat to this country is the impacts of climate change. The Conservatives do not care. It is really that simple. If they cared, there would be some kind of plan. They talk about having technology. Where is this magic box that the Conservative leader has that is going to solve this crisis? There is no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They talk a lot about food banks, again, rightfully so. There are a lot of Canadians who are having a difficult time, despite the supports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I wonder if those members will go to food banks in their ridings and tell them that they will cut affordable day care. What would that do to parents, single parents especially? They will cut GIS perhaps, cut day care and cut the CCB. There would not be a rental benefit. They would not have stood by Canadians during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Those seem to be the talking points from the Conservative Party. I do not think that is what they are going to hear or that they will gain much support from food banks across the country with a message of “Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. It is the Conservative way.” Again, as droughts, fires and floods ravage agricultural areas of our country and those of our allies, what is the cost of that? They are silent on that, consistently silent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The final thing I would like to discuss, and the one that is the most shocking of all they are opposed to, is dental care. Each one of us, every member of this chamber, has taxpayer-funded dental care for themselves, for their family, for their spouse. What are we hearing the Conservatives tell their constituents? They say, “You don't need that. You don't want that. We will cut it. That is the Conservative way.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They can talk a great game about balancing the budget, but that is going to be the cornerstone of it. We do not hear the other side of what the Conservative Party is talking about: “We will balance the budget, but it will be on the backs of Canadians and, by the way, we'll give a tax break to the largest polluters in this country.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If pollution is made free again, the one thing that I think we can all guarantee is that there will be a lot more pollution. There will be more fires. There will be more floods. There will be more drought. That is the one guarantee. It is very sad, again, that Conservatives can go outside, see the smoke in the air and say they do not care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the Liberal member fearmongering about cuts, as many Liberal members do. If we take a look at actual history and facts, we will find that the last government to significantly cut transfers for health care, social services and other important programs was the one of finance minister Paul Martin's budgets of 1995-96 through 1997-98, where we went from $18.4 billion in 1995-96 to $14.7 billion in 1996-97 to $12.5 billion in 1997-98 because of the absolutely disastrous economic policies of the last incompetent Trudeau government, a government that racked up deficits in 14 out of 15 years. We now see another incompetent Liberal government doing the same thing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this evening to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023</Document>, introduced by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The budget is a key exercise in our democracy. It is the time when the government decides how and where it will spend the hundreds of billions of dollars that it controls. The government does not pull all this money out of thin air. Each of these dollars comes directly out of the pockets of individuals from the four corners of Quebec and Canada who worked hard to earn that money. That is why the government has a duty to use that money responsibly and reasonably. Most of all, it has to spend so as to meet the needs and priorities of the public—because, again, it is our money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government can also use the budget to implement its vision for society, the vision it has for the future. We saw that in Quebec with the construction of hydroelectric dams, which continue to make the Quebec nation an ambitious, visionary and decidedly green nation. I will say, however, that if we want to find a vision of the future, then we need to look somewhere other than this Liberal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>If we take a close look at the budget, we see that the government's priority is more about saving its faltering marriage to the NDP than meeting the needs of Quebeckers and Canadians. While the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> plays political games and uses the treasury as his personal piggy bank to stay in power, everybody else is tightening their belts and wondering how they will pay their mortgage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are talking about inflation, recession, the economic slowdown and skyrocketing interest rates, but the government has not seen fit to implement preventive measures to prepare the economy for the possibility of rough times ahead in the coming months and years. This government is completely out of touch with the economic situation and its day-to-day impact on the lives of real people. Since these ministers are chauffeured around and do not often take the time to look beyond Ottawa and the greater Toronto area, I will use the rest of my time to explain what is happening in areas such as mine, the Lower St. Lawrence, and how their inaction is making life difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first urgent issue is housing. It is not complicated. There is virtually nothing available on the market in my region. According to the most recent data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or CMHC, the vacancy rate in Rimouski is 0.4% this year compared to 0.2% last year. That is a slight improvement, but it is nothing to write home about. To give members an idea, a healthy real estate market usually has a vacancy rate of about 3%. We are nowhere near finding a balance between the current vacancy rate of 0.4% and the average of 3%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That imbalance is having unprecedented consequences for my region. I held a housing summit in my riding in March to better understand and identify those consequences. Here are some of the things that the organizations and people on the ground shared with me. There is no longer any such thing as affordable housing. The housing units that are available are unaffordable or not fit to live in. Requests for emergency assistance have tripled since the beginning of the pandemic. Obviously, there are not enough resources to help all of those people and many are being left to fend for themselves. Emergency shelters, particularly in Rimouski and the surrounding areas, are full to overflowing. It is unprecedented. People were homeless in Rimouski in the middle of winter. Spending the night outside in the Lower St. Lawrence area in the middle of winter is far from pleasant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have heard some extremely disturbing stories. Students looking for housing are being approached by older men offering to put them up in exchange for services. That is completely unacceptable. Staff at addiction treatment centres have even told me that people cannot leave their facilities because there is nowhere go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Given all the precariousness and the distress people are feeling, one might think the government would have made it a priority to tackle the housing crisis, but no. The Liberals have completely dropped the ball. There is nothing at all for housing in the latest budget—zero, <I>nada</I>, <I>niet</I>, not one penny.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The government members are patting themselves on the back and quoting data from the 2022 budget. It is unbelievable. How can this be happening? A crisis is going on, but no investment is being made to find solutions that could end it. The disconnect is staggering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, the demands of the Bloc Québécois and community organizations were fairly clear and specific. For instance, the government was asked to permanently renew the rapid housing initiative and to increase the rent supplement transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The need to speed up the transfer of funds between governments was also discussed. With each day that the federal government holds on to funds instead of passing them on to Quebec to send where they are needed, construction costs keep rising and our students, families and seniors keep growing poorer. How much longer do we have to wait for action? Urgent action is needed now to resolve the housing crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another area where we hoped the government would deliver on expectations is employment insurance. This issue has been a topic of discussion for a long time. When the Liberal government came to power in 2015, it was one of their election promises. When it came back to power in 2019, it did not keep its promise then either. In 2021, it made the same promise again. We were told that consultations were being held to find out what was going on, but they know what is going on. They know the problems and they know the solutions. What is missing is the will to act, the action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have not forgotten the Liberal promise of 2015, and I can say that the rights groups advocating for the unemployed have not forgotten it either. The unemployed men and women who are waiting for the government to deliver real reform have definitely not forgotten it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Currently, six in 10 workers who pay into employment insurance are not eligible for it because the eligibility criteria no longer reflect the reality of the labour market in 2023. These are not people who hope and pray for an unemployment cheque, they are people who pay into the fund. It is not complicated: this program was set up many years ago and has not been updated. There has been no reform. Naturally, it no longer reflects reality. I hope that the government will take action on this for once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As mentioned, on reading budget 2023, we learn that the government is not planning for any reform before 2030. The Liberals promised reform in 2015. During the 2019 election, they said they would do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In 2021, they called an early election. We all remember what a good idea it was to change government and call an election in 2021. What is more, they did it in the middle of the pandemic, when they were telling people to wear their mask and maintain social distancing. Then the government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the member for Papineau, went out and took photos with babies. They acted like the pandemic was over because they wanted to win the election. They did not want to change things for people. They wanted to return with a majority government. It is not easy to be in a minority government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Every day, this government shows us that it does not care one iota about democracy. We know that it entered into an alliance with the NDP, which has been doing its bidding for some time. This is not new. The NDP also serves the government by supporting its gag orders. There have already been a dozen gag orders since the government and the NDP, which calls itself the New Democratic Party, struck a deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us come back to the budget. My colleagues will understand that it is quite difficult to just go along with it. I hope that the people listening to us at home will realize what is happening in this democracy. It is now operating under multiple closure motions to allow the government or an opposition party to save face. That is what we are currently putting up with in a G7 country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will repeat that six out of 10 workers who pay into EI are unable to access it. In the Lower St. Lawrence area, back home, seasonal work is a large part of the economic activity and the lives of workers. A strong EI system would help build solid regions and ensure that people keep living in our regions and do not leave.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The EI reform is urgent. It is part of the support measures that are necessary for seasonal work, which is an economic driver in our regions. I am thinking mainly of tourism, agriculture and the fishery. We can discuss that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>All of these sectors rely on seasonal activities. It is not because people do not want to work in certain seasons. Potatoes cannot be planted in the middle of winter. Some government ministers do not seem to grasp how it works. People are still wondering about this in 2023. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Another issue I absolutely must address has to do with seniors, specifically the inequity suffered by people aged 65 to 75 who are not getting an increase in their OAS benefits. The government is completely out to lunch on this. It is yet another broken election promise. I hope the government will do something once and for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>However, I will say one thing. It is not a secret. We can see in the government's current budget that there is no allocation for the so-called dental care program. There is nothing until 2023. I will make a wager on what will happen after that. It is possible that there will be an election in 2024, if the agreement with the NDP is not honoured. I guarantee that the Liberals will put that in their election campaign. They will ask people to elect them again with this promise. I do not believe it right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is another very important thing I would point out to my colleague, and that is that the government's dental care program penalizes Quebec families. That is unfair. Quebec families will receive less money than other Canadian families, because we already have dental care programs with Quebec's current employment conditions. There is therefore nothing to boast about, quite the contrary. The House should be condemning the fact that the federal government's dental care program is creating a certain inequity between Quebec and the rest of Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, what I am about to say is no secret, but it is important. The government purchased a pipeline. It is not for shipping grain; it is for shipping oil. The pipeline cost $30 billion. It started off at $7 billion, and then climbed to $15 billion, $22 billion, $24 billion, $28 billion and $30 billion. I hope that the government realizes that it could fix an awful lot of problems with that money. It could build housing, help seniors and support families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What my colleague from Terrebonne said is important. The government is not even trying to hide anymore. It bought a $30‑billion pipeline with our money. In the latest budget, it is also giving away $21 billion in tax credits to oil and gas companies. I will not be shedding any tears here tonight for these companies over tax credits. They are not even subsidies now, just tax credits. That makes it even harder to track how much money will be disappearing into the pockets of which multi-million dollar corporation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government cannot be serious. It wants to transition to green energy, yet, today, the <Affiliation DbId="278925" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation> is praising the government's action on seabed oil and gas development, saying, “Don't tell me a green energy future doesn't include oil and gas.” I want to congratulate the Minister of Labour. This government is not going to make the net-zero energy transition happen, I guarantee it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, the budget implementation act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will start off by condemning the incredibly childish behaviour of Conservative MPs over the course of the last few days. We have seen in the House unprecedented adolescent, juvenile behaviour. We certainly saw that last Friday. I raise that concern because Canadians need to know that what the Conservatives have been blocking are measures that are going to benefit their constituents. I find that surprising.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What have the Conservatives been blocking over the course of the last few days? They have been throwing paper in the air. They have been trying to pretend that they are having technical problems. They have been putting forward every single dilatory motion they can think of. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278628" Type="2">South Okanagan—West Kootenay</Affiliation> was able to finally put forward the emergency debate motion, after eight hours of Conservatives blocking it. They were blocking an emergency debate on wildfires at a time when Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia are consumed by fire. Firefighters are working hard, communities are threatened and there have been massive economic losses, and the Conservatives have spent the whole day blocking that motion from coming forward. I am glad they were finally overcome by the weight of more rational members of Parliament, and we will have that debate on wildfires tonight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, the fact is that the Conservatives are so disconnected from reality that they blocked an emergency debate that is so important for paying credit to the firefighters fighting these fires and paying credit to the communities and volunteers trying to keep people alive and safe. They blocked that for the course of the entire day, and I am unbelievably disappointed with these pyromaniac gatekeepers. Finally, the NDP persevered, as we always do ultimately, and we are now going to have this debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives would justify this by saying they are blocking programs the NDP wants to bring in, and that is true. There are programs the NDP, on behalf of Canadians, wants to bring in, so let us talk about what the impact of them would be in Conservative ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is the dental care plan that the the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation> and the entire NDP caucus forced the government to bring in after decades of commitments from Liberal and Conservative governments that they always reneged on. The dental care plan means that people with disabilities, seniors and families with kids under the age of 18 will finally have access to dental care at the end of this year. That is what is in Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>. This is what the Conservatives have been blocking for two days. It is access to dental care for thousands of their constituents. It is access to dental care for seniors in their ridings, 70-year-olds who have never had access to dental care because they could not afford to pay for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know that dental care is expensive. However, the Conservative MPs stood resolutely against seniors finally having access to dental care after decades. They stood resolutely against people with disabilities. I find that particularly despicable, because we know that people with disabilities are the poorest of the poor. Half the people who go to food banks to make ends meet are people with disabilities. Half of the homeless in this country are people with disabilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I remember during the terrible years of the Harper regime how the Conservatives steamrolled over people with disabilities, steamrolled over seniors and forced the retirement age up so that people who had worked all their lives were forced to work longer. The disrespect shown by blocking dental care, to my mind, is inconceivable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As members know, in the recent Alberta election, the NDP swept all of Edmonton, every single riding at the provincial level, and took most of the ridings in Calgary. If I were a Conservative MP from Edmonton or Calgary, I would read the room and think, “What we are doing with the kind of mean-spirited approach we have, where we try to deny people services that can make a difference, is obviously something that people in Edmonton and Calgary have turned their backs on.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>If I was an Edmonton MP or a Calgary MP for the Conservative Party, I would think twice about doing what they have done over the last two days, which is deny basic dental care to those seniors, people with disabilities and all families that have youth 18 and under. It is not just that; the Conservatives also denied the grocery rebate. As for the average benefit to a Conservative MP's constituency, about 11,000 Canadians living in each of those ridings would benefit from that grocery rebate: $500 extra to put food on the table at a time when people are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who is the head pyromaniac gatekeeper, is saying he does not want that money to go to those 11,000 people in his constituency, and I guess other Conservative MPs are saying the same thing, that in their constituencies, they do not want those 11,000 Canadians, who are struggling to make ends meet and who have lower incomes, to get the grocery rebate. Why would they be so mean-spirited? Why would they be so entitled to deny those constituents the benefits they have? I ask, because the Conservatives have access to a dental care plan as MPs, and they have access to a good salary as MPs, but they would deny that to, on average, 11,000 constituents in their ridings. To my mind, it is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Then, of course there is the other element that the NDP succeeded in forcing the government to do, which is on affordable housing. The urban, rural and northern indigenous housing strategy financing is so vitally important. Affordable housing is finally being built. Finally, we are getting to the point where we are starting to address the housing crisis in a meaningful way. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> likes to talk a good game. He says, rightly, that the cost of housing has doubled under the Liberal government. What he neglects to say is that it also doubled under the terrible Harper regime, one of the most corrupt governments in our history and one of the most mean-spirited governments in our history. It was an unbelievably incompetent government. It could not manage finances. It could not fight its way out of a paper bag, and all of the other things—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, the truth hurts. When Canadians speak truth to Conservatives, we know what the reaction is. Albertans in Edmonton and Calgary certainly spoke truth to Conservatives earlier last week, and I think we are seeing that reflected in the falling poll numbers as well for the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Conservatives would stop affordable housing from being built. After we have seen decades of both the terrible Harper regime refusing to build affordable housing and the Liberal government refusing to build affordable housing, the NDP is forcing the government to actually do that, and the Conservative response is to block it. They do not want affordable housing for Canadians, as they might be able to have a roof over their heads and they might be able to back to school or work. A whole bunch of things could happen from that, and Conservatives somehow find that this is something they do not want to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The NDP forced investments in health care, and members will recall it is the terrible Harper regime, that dismal decade of 10 awful years that Canadians had to survive, that actually cut the health care funding in the first place, so the NDP is fixing what the Harper regime and Conservatives broke.

              <Affiliation DbId="278478" Type="2">Mr. Gary Vidal (Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise to speak on behalf of the people of northern Saskatchewan. Debates such as this on Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> are good opportunities for members of Parliament to bring their own unique backgrounds and perspectives to the House. As a former accountant and mayor, members can imagine that I have dealt with a few budgets and many numbers in my day. I want to spend the first few minutes tonight talking about a few of these numbers, some very big numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In 2015, when the Liberals were first elected, Canada's national debt was $612 billion. This budget projects Canada's debt to be $1.22 trillion by next March, which is $81,000 per Canadian household, and it will reach $1.3 trillion by 2028. A simple fact is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has accumulated more debt in eight years than all of Canada's previous prime ministers combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How did we get here? In 2015, the total expenditures of the government were $280 billion. This budget again calls for billions of dollars in new spending. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> simply cannot help himself. This past year, total expenditures were $480 billion, and this budget projects to start at $497 billion and rise to $557 billion by 2027-28. That is an average of $526 billion in each of the next five years. That is also $246 billion per year or 88% greater than expenditures were in 2015. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>If this is what the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> meant when she said, “we will review and reduce government spending, because that is the responsible thing to do”, I would hate to see what the irresponsible thing looks like.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have a couple more numbers. Canada will have accumulated over $700 billion of new debt under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> by 2028. As projected, the cost of interest on that debt will rise to over $50 billion per year. That is more than a 100% increase over 2021 and 2022, and it would then become about 10% of the total expenditures of the government. If I had run my accounting practice for the little City of Meadow Lake the way the Liberal government has run Canada's finances, I would have been out of business and run out of office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us consider some promises made in 2015. First, the Liberal Party said it would run small deficits and return Canada's finances back to balance in 2019. I hate to break it to the members opposite, but not only did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> overspend this promise by about $700 billion, but the budget was never balanced and there is no plan to ever balance it. It is no wonder that record numbers of Canadians no longer trust their government institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Second, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> talked a lot about the declining debt-to-GDP ratio. This was her fiscal anchor. She said, “This is a line we shall not cross. It will ensure that our finances remain sustainable.” That sounds like another promise. I hate to once again break it to colleagues opposite, but the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen every year since the government was first elected in 2015 and is projected to rise again in the coming year. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and finance minister make promises about debt and deficits, forgive me if I do not hold my breath.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Sometimes one must invest in things to be successful, so it is important to measure what one gets in return for choosing debt and increasing spending. Let us consider the state of Canada after eight years of out-of-control Liberal spending and inflationary deficits. Food price inflation is at a 40-year high. Nearly half of Canadians feel they are less than $200 from insolvency. One in five Canadians is skipping meals to reduce the cost of food, and 1.5 million people used food banks in a single month. The average cost of housing, both to rent and purchase, has doubled since 2015. This is the record of the Liberal government and the measures it is proposing in budget 2023 will, in fact, make the situation worse for Canadians by pouring another $67 billion of new deficit spending fuel on the flames of inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am very proud of coming from northern Saskatchewan. I believe it is an area that is a very good benchmark to measure how Canada's economy is performing. It is a region that has many important sectors of our economy: mining, forestry, agriculture, oil and gas, tourism, etc. It is also home to a unique cross-section of communities and people, communities and people that, frankly, should be thriving. Instead, everywhere I visit when I go home, people speak about how frustrated and desperate they are with the current economic situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Municipalities are struggling. The cost of much-needed infrastructure projects has ballooned over the last few years. Whether it be upgrading a sewer line, building a recreation complex or improving a street, community leaders are being tasked to do more with less. The result is that not only do they have to do the heavy lifting for their people, but the conditions under which they are operating keep getting worse due to the economic policies of the NDP-Liberal coalition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These same policies are negatively impacting small businesses in northern Saskatchewan. This winter, I was talking to a business owner. He supplies people living in remote and rural communities with home heating fuel. He described to me the difficult position he was in due to the rising cost of this home heating fuel. His customers were either being forced to buy very small amounts, or they were pleading with him to extend credit until they could pay. They were having to choose between feeding their families or living without heat in the middle of a northern Saskatchewan winter, and he was having to choose between possibly losing money or seeing these families live without heat. That is the choice that this small business owner was facing because of the NDP-Liberal coalition nightmare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Small business owners are also continually telling me how the carbon tax disproportionately affects rural and remote areas like northern Saskatchewan. This is becoming a very serious situation for them. Not only are they dealing with a labour shortage crisis, but due to the rising carbon tax they are forced to increase prices. Now the costly coalition is adding a second carbon tax that will ultimately add 61¢ per litre to the cost of fuel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Everything, everywhere in northern Saskatchewan must be trucked. There is no other option. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, this will cost the average household in Saskatchewan $2,840 per year. Increasing taxes at a time when people are struggling to get by is not a recipe for economic success. Is it any wonder that the people I talk to are fed up?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That anger can also be felt when I talk to farmers back home. The government members seem to forget that agriculture is the economic backbone of Canada. A stabilizing sector and one that provides the food we all rely on deserves better from its government. Let us imagine being the <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> in Canada and voting against Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, a bill that would give farmers carbon tax exemptions to produce the food we need. If the minister will not stand up at the cabinet table for farmers, who will? </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us face it. When it comes to agriculture, these Liberals have become the living definition of biting the hand that feeds them. In a country that feeds the world, Canada is now a place where people cannot afford food. For many people in northern Saskatchewan who were already struggling with the increased cost of living, the skyrocketing price of food has become a crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>“This isn't working” are the words of a food bank chair from northern Saskatchewan, who adds, “Everything is increasing—gas, rent, food, heat.... I just don’t know how people are supposed to manage.” The food bank's monthly food budget is $5,000, and it now provides half the number of food hampers that it did just three years ago. The Liberals' mismanagement of the economy, assisted by their NDP enablers, has created conditions that directly harm the most vulnerable in our communities the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this is while the people from northern Saskatchewan and Canada have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who spends $6,000 a night on a hotel in London, but would not admit to it for months and still takes no responsibility; a Prime Minister who vacations in Jamaica at a luxurious estate of Trudeau Foundation donors; a Prime Minister who spends $8,000 a month on groceries; a Prime Minister who is embroiled in a foreign election interference scandal and uses Trudeau Foundation members and friends to investigate; a Prime Minister who named an interim Ethics Commissioner who is the sister-in-law to a cabinet minister, who is also a long-time family friend, to replace the former commissioner who grew so frustrated by the continued Liberal ethical lapses that he finally walked away. This is not leadership by any measure at any time in our history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Budget 2023 is not an economic document. It is the political document of a government led by a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has chosen power over principle.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, like the Conservatives, the Bloc Québécois will be voting against Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, but for different reasons. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would respond to my colleague's question by saying there are many things that we find missing in this budget and that are not included, one of them being the ability to control the inflationary spending and the huge deficits.

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have listened to a number of speeches on this year's budget and on Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, the budget implementation act, at all stages of debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have been inspired by some of these speeches. I really enjoyed the one delivered by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>. He spoke about the lines the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said last year she would not cross. It was about the increase in a ratio called the debt-to-GDP, or gross domestic product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I agree with him completely. It seems as though the government, from so many of its ministries, tells Canadians what to expect from them and then ignores those seemingly brave words. It spoke of short-term deficits of $10 billion to bring us back to balance by 2019. I remember that one quite well. Then it spoke of a carbon tax that would never rise above $50 per tonne. That was in the 2019 election platform, not so long ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I love when the Liberals say, “We have got Canadians' backs.” What does that even mean? They say, “We are laser focused on solving this problem.” Sure. The one I like best is, “We are not worried about inflation. We are worried about deflation.” I think they would like to erase those words from the record at this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Talk is cheap in today's politics, until Canadians actually see the consequences of breaking the real pillars that hold up our country's financial well-being. There will be reduced opportunities in an underperforming, non-resilient economy for generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Social programs such as health, education and welfare will be compromised because bankers will get paid first and the amount of priority spending is increasing. This means the amount of money we have to spend as Canadians taxpayers paying the interest on our debt is a rising rate and a rising number. It is escalating quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Deficits do not solve themselves. They take planning and resolve. The consequences of not solving them are upon us with rising inflation, rising taxation and rising income inequality. There are rising labour tensions, as we saw with the recent strike at the Public Service Alliance of Canada. Canadians are just trying to have their wages and salaries keep up with the rising cost of living that the government's negligence has caused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Inflated dollars buy less. They buy less food, less shelter and fewer social services. We are all poorer by degrees. The government just hopes Canadians do not notice it too much. Canadians are noticing, and they are wondering how a modern country is throwing away its future and has forgotten the lessons from the last time this scenario unfolded just four decades ago. Politicians change, but institutional memory, the decision-making, should learn from the lessons of history, especially recent history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would say Canada's debt-to-GDP is a somewhat useless ratio, as it only compares how bad our ability to provide balance for tomorrow's taxpayers is with that of other spendy governments in the world. The debt-to-GDP is increasing, and there is no benefit to having a high debt-to-GDP. There is only a cost, and it is a rapidly rising cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As so many have indicated, that rising cost has rising consequences. The government presents in its own set of data that its sacred ratio will peak next year, this time at 43.5%. Let me caution colleagues on this opportunistic representation of data and remind everyone how last year, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said that this ratio had peaked and would not increase further. Those are words and promises without meaning or real intent. I think we know the answer to that choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us look at what is called a national accounts basis, as the rest of the world looks at these metrics. That is that there is only one gross domestic product and there are a number of government debts in Canada. If we add in each of the provinces, on top of the federal government's debt, we get a ratio that is higher than 95% on the ratio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also have to subtract out the funds that do not belong to the government that it likes to include in its calculation. That is the amount it subtracts from workers who have to set aside money for programs, such as the Canada pension plan and the Quebec pension plan. I should point out that that is one of the costs to workers that is increasing substantially this year.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Canadians need to tell the government that these funds do not belong to the government. They belong to the people who have earned those pensions. The government should get them out of the calculations, trying to make its numbers more justifiable. These are not the Government of Canada's assets. They are being held in trust for Canadians at arm's-length organizations. The government has no recourse to these funds, or does it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Does the government want to explain how it might have recourse to these funds, which Canadians think are sequestered for their retirement? I ask this question because the government went out of its way to freeze Canadians' bank accounts last year, and freezing earned benefits would pale in comparison to freezing a basic bank account, so someone could buy food and pay for their shelter in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In any event, for the financially literate, let us stop painting a rosier picture of reality. The government does not get to pick and choose which numbers it uses. Sustainable finance theories aside, and these are mock theories, the government does not get to pick and choose the numbers that affect people's lives. It should just be presented factually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The irony is that the Liberal government presents a scenario in which provincial budget balances have collectively turned positive in 2022, and thus contributed to Canada's overall turnaround. Let us be clear. That is based on the surplus in one province, Alberta, and those revenues are predicated on world resource pricing of, yes, oil and gas, which the government scorns daily in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As is said, comparing badly run jurisdictions in the world, Europe is a collection of poorly managed economies with no resource wealth, whereas Canada is a very poorly managed country with a backstop of significant resource wealth. It is very clear the country needs better management. We are in line for the job, and we are just waiting for the shareholders to fire this underperforming team.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I went through much of the budget presentation, and I noted a number of fictions that the government actually prints on government paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>How is this? “The federal government’s fiscal anchor—reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term—remains unchanged and is being met.” That is wrong. There is also this: “Even with higher borrowing costs, public debt charges as a share of the economy are projected to remain at historically low levels“. That is wrong, again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The $44 billion in interest payments is up from $24 billion just two years ago, and a larger portion of the GDP than it had been in over 15 years. The government says these metrics are going in the right direction and hope that Canadians are not paying attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, they are emulating themselves in the House of Commons by now putting nonsense on paper. Let us just keep spending and everything will balance itself.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>What is in this bill? A whole bunch of items that have nothing to do with the budget, including CEPA changes and jurisdictional oversteps. It is just tax, spend and divide. That is not the way to manage Canada's finances.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it felt like there was some dishonesty in the member's speech. He started out speaking about the dishonesty of the Liberal government, but then he spoke about how this was almost an omnibus bill at the end, as if the Harper government was not renowned for its omnibus bills. He spoke about how we should have learned from history, but in World War II, one of the things that we saw was the massive investment in our communities and in our infrastructure, so I want to ask him about what he would cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, what actually caught my ear the most was when he was talking about pensions, about Canadian pensions. I am sure he knows where I am going with this. We just finished an election in Alberta, and the United Conservative Party, the UCP, in Alberta, was running on the idea of taking Albertans out of the Canadian pension plan and using that money for its own means.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I have put this question to other members debating tonight. Over the course of any discussion of Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document> in this place, I have heard very few members actually speak to Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, which is not the budget. The budget carried already in this place. We are now debating a budget implementation act, which changes many pieces of legislation. It is an omnibus bill, but it is not an illegitimate omnibus bill. It follows through on changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I actually voted against the Liberal budget, but I will vote for the budget implementation bill because it contains many, many useful measures, none of which relate to the topics that my hon. friend discussed. Universally, it seems, in this place, we assume that the legislation, Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, is the budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question and the member is exactly right. There is everything anyone could choose, part of which is the budget and part of which is in this bill for the budget implementation act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I had here in my notes 10 different issues on the budget implementation act, which I could have spoken about today. Getting to them, of course, requires some preamble. I hope the member appreciates all the issues about the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which I did refer to in my speech. It is also in the budget implementation act. We are changing words in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which we just recently put through at our own committee, and the member attended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is a bunch in here that does not belong. Frankly, it is an omnibus bill and should be presented when we are amending those acts in Parliament.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak this evening—although I must say the hour is late, almost 9 p.m.—to join the debate on Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C‑47</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before I start, I would like to take a few minutes to voice my heartfelt support for residents of the north shore and Abitibi who have been fighting severe forest fires for several days now. This is a disastrous situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278351" Type="2">Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou</Affiliation> are on site. They are there for their constituents and represent them well. They have been visiting emergency shelters and showing their solidarity by being actively involved with their constituents and the authorities. The teamwork has been outstanding. Our hearts go out to the people of the north shore and Abitibi.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Tonight, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi-Témiscamingue</Affiliation> will rise to speak during the emergency debate on forest fires. He will then travel back home to be with his constituents as well, so he can offer them his full support and be there for them in these difficult times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, I also offer my condolences to the family grieving the loss of loved ones who drowned during a fishing accident in Portneuf‑sur‑Mer. This is yet another tragedy for north shore residents. My heart goes out to the family, the children's parents and those who perished.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before talking specifically about Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>, I would like to say how impressive the House's work record is. A small headline in the newspapers caught my eye last week. It said that the opposition was toxic and that nothing was getting done in the House. I found that amusing, because I was thinking that we have been working very hard and many government bills have been passed. I think it is worth listing them very quickly to demonstrate that, when it comes right down to it, if parliamentarians work together and respect all the legislative stages, they succeed in getting important bills passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am only going to mention the government's bills. Since the 44th Parliament began, the two Houses have passed bills <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C‑3</Document>, <Document DbId="11476884" Type="3">C‑4</Document>, <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C‑5</Document>, <Document DbId="11488565" Type="3">C‑6</Document>, <Document DbId="11496808" Type="3">C‑8</Document> and <Document DbId="11525611" Type="3">C‑10</Document>, as well as Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C‑11</Document>, the online streaming bill. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278348" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation>'s work on this bill earned the government's praise. We worked hard to pass this bill, which is so important to Quebec and to our broadcasting artists and technicians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We also passed bills <Document DbId="11545366" Type="3">C‑12</Document>, <Document DbId="11644886" Type="3">C‑14</Document>, <Document DbId="11650420" Type="3">C‑15</Document>, <Document DbId="11650525" Type="3">C‑16</Document>, <Document DbId="11719486" Type="3">C‑19</Document>, <Document DbId="11838108" Type="3">C‑24</Document>, <Document DbId="11838128" Type="3">C‑25</Document>, <Document DbId="11878436" Type="3">C‑28</Document>, <Document DbId="11924004" Type="3">C‑30</Document>, <Document DbId="11924005" Type="3">C‑31</Document>, <Document DbId="12038143" Type="3">C‑32</Document>, <Document DbId="12130535" Type="3">C‑36</Document> and <Document DbId="12189059" Type="3">C‑39</Document>, which is the important act on medical assistance in dying, and bills <Document DbId="12287081" Type="3">C‑43</Document>, <Document DbId="12287105" Type="3">C‑44</Document> and <Document DbId="12308787" Type="3">C‑46</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are currently awaiting royal assent for Bill <Document DbId="11501554" Type="3">C‑9</Document>. Bill <Document DbId="11826019" Type="3">C‑22</Document> will soon return to the House as well. This is an important bill on the disability benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are also examining Bill <Document DbId="11603137" Type="3">C‑13</Document>, currently in the Senate and soon expected to return to the House. Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C‑18</Document>, on which my colleague from Drummond worked exceedingly hard, is also in the Senate. Lastly, I would mention bills <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C‑21</Document>, <Document DbId="11893577" Type="3">C‑29</Document> and <Document DbId="12290871" Type="3">C‑45</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do not know whether my colleagues agree with me, but I think that Parliament has been busy and that the government has gotten many of its bills passed by the House of Commons. Before the Liberals say that the opposition is toxic, they should remember that many of those bills were passed by the majority of members in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I wanted to point that out because I was rather insulted to be told that my behaviour, as a member of the opposition, was toxic and was preventing the work of the House from moving forward. In my opinion, that is completely false. We have the government's record when it comes to getting its bills passed. The government is doing quite well in that regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have now come to Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C-47</Document>. We began this huge debate on the budget implementation bill this morning and will continue to debate it until Wednesday. It is a very large, very long bill that sets out a lot of budgetary measures that will be implemented after the bill is passed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I have no doubt that, by the end of the sitting on June 23, the House will pass Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C‑47</Document> in time for the summer break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What could this bill have included that is not in there? For three years, the Bloc Québécois and several other members in the House have been saying that there is nothing for seniors. I was saying earlier to my assistant that, in my riding of Salaberry—Suroît, we speak at every meeting about the decline in seniors' purchasing power. I am constantly being approached by seniors who tell me—</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, at my advanced age, it is more difficult to concentrate when there is background noise that seems to be coming from the great beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What I was saying is that, basically, what is missing from this budget is real support for seniors. As my Bloc Québécois colleagues have said many times, there are two classes of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Quebec and Canada, there are seniors between the ages of 65 and 74 and those aged 75 and up. Seniors aged 75 and up received an increase in their old age security, whereas those between the ages of 65 and 74 got nothing. Quite frankly, I am not sure whether my colleagues are aware that a person whose sole income is the old age security pension and the guaranteed income supplement does not even get enough money a month to pay for decent housing, cover all the rent-related costs and still manage to have a decent and reasonable life. It is rather shameful that a G7 country is unable to take better care of those who built Quebec and contributed to its development. We must give them what they need to live and die in a dignified way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Roughly 22% of the people in Salaberry—Suroît are seniors 65 and over. Earlier, before the technical problems, I was saying that I attend all the events in my riding, and seniors talk to me and tell me about their problems. They cannot grasp the government's lack of understanding and the fact it does not give them more support in meeting their monthly obligations. If a senior needs home care or to buy services, go to a private seniors residence and pay for services to support their loss of autonomy, quite honestly, that person has to ask for help from the Quebec government, from their province, because what they receive in old age security benefits is not enough to meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In this budget there is a serious lack of consideration and esteem for our seniors, those who built the society we have today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is another important thing missing. I am sure that people are affected by this. There is nothing about employment insurance reform. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278672" Type="2">Thérèse-De Blainville</Affiliation> has often said that it is high time that old legislation were modernized. The <Affiliation DbId="278928" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has made some promises over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Recently, we believed we could start working on the reform because the minister went to the trouble of holding consultations. Unfortunately, the Bloc Québécois and our partners who support workers were utterly disappointed. There is no EI reform and no major change to the Employment Insurance Act to face the new realities of the labour market and secure better coverage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In closing, I know that my time is up. Madam Speaker, I hope you gave me the time I lost because of the audio issues during my speech. I imagine you did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will conclude by saying that what is important to the Bloc Québécois is to vote for a budget that is really useful and serves Quebec's interests. At present, that is not what we have before us. Therefore, the Bloc Québécois will vote against the budget and, consequently, against Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C‑47</Document>. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I will give a very honest answer. Strangely enough, no one talks to me about dental care in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As many people know, children in Quebec have some coverage. I know the Quebec government has extended coverage to include some people who need surgery but cannot have it because they need dental care before they have their surgery, so it has extended its coverage. The Quebec government made that decision without waiting for Ottawa to decide what it was going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Quite honestly, people are not talking to me about that. Seniors want to talk about the loss of their purchasing power, about having to make difficult choices between groceries, care, rent and leisure activities. They tell me they are feeling so squeezed financially that they have no room to manoeuvre after working their entire lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many seniors who are now 65 or 70 years old do not have a pension plan, even though they worked hard. I am thinking of people who worked as restaurant waitresses, or people who worked hard physically, in factories, for example, and did not have access to a collective agreement that guaranteed a pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today these people are worried and do not understand why the government did not think of them when drafting Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C‑47</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to rise and ask a question of my colleague from Salaberry—Suroît.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In her speech, she once again demonstrated her empathy and warmth for her colleagues by highlighting the work of our colleagues from <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278351" Type="2">Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou</Affiliation>. She also highlighted the work of our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>, who will be leaving in the middle of the night tonight to drive long hours to his riding so he can support his constituents. That is quite admirable, and I congratulate him for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A few seconds ago, in response to our NDP colleague's question, my colleague talked about the lack of measures to help seniors financially. The OAS has not been increased for seniors aged 65 to 74. This is an injustice that the Bloc Québécois has been denouncing for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This class of seniors is not getting that assistance. These people are being deprived of this increase, but we believe they are entitled to it. What is more, when they have to go back to work so they can make ends meet and fight the rampant inflation we are seeing today, they are penalized, because their pension income is cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Bloc Québécois is really troubled by all this injustice. My colleague mentioned it briefly. I also wanted to ask her whether her constituents are approaching her about this. Mine are. Are people talking to her about the housing crisis and the fact that the government has done nothing in this budget to respond to the urgent housing crisis in Quebec?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would say to my colleague that seniors talk to me about housing, but they mostly talk to me about having the opportunity to work without being taxed, without changing four quarters for a dollar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The budget could have included measures to make seniors' work more valuable, to prevent them from losing their guaranteed income supplement or prevent them from paying too much in tax. Indeed, seniors perhaps would have wanted to work a bit to stay socially active and improve their living conditions, but there are no tax measures in Bill <Document DbId="12341217" Type="3">C‑47</Document> to encourage seniors to go back to work.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting debate tonight. There were a couple of things that I heard from the Liberals and the NDP, one of which I expected to hear a lot about and one which I did not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>What I did not expect was a couple of NDP members doing victory laps over the Alberta election results time and time again. As I watched the election results, I was struck by the fact that a Conservative government, having gone through a pandemic and a leadership change, unsurprisingly lost a couple of percentage points and formed a strong majority government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The NDP may want to celebrate the fact that it gained about nine percentage points at the expense of the Alberta party, but hopefully all of us can hope for the very best for the Danielle Smith government in Alberta, because that would be really good for Albertans across the board. I, for one, congratulate that government and hope that it succeeds on behalf of all Albertans over the next four years of its very strong mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What I expected to hear and have heard a lot of today, over and over again, is Liberal fearmongering about cuts that some potential Conservative government might threaten or initiate or whatever the case might be. It caused me to look back at history. It is important to look at where there have been cuts, because maybe we can learn from situations in the past when we have seen actual cuts. I had to go back a long way to find real cuts to health spending, social services spending, education spending and the transfers that fund those things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I went back to 1993, 1994 and 1995, when we saw cuts at the very start of a newly elected Liberal government, but then it was astonishing to see the cut that occurred in 1995-96. In the 1995-96 Liberal budget, $18.4 billion was spent on health care, social services and education, and then in 1996-97, the very next year, we went from $18.4 billion to $14.7 billion, a reduction of almost $4 billion in important transfers for health, social services, education and those kinds of things. The next year, 1997-98, we went from $14.7 billion to $12.5 billion in those transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I mention those figures because, as a result of the spending during the reign of a fiscally incompetent Trudeau government, a government that ran 14 deficits in 15 years while it was in power, we saw a crisis in energy, a crisis in housing and a crisis in inflation. I do not know if that sounds familiar to anybody around here. There were 14 deficits in 15 years in the 1970s and 1980s, and that led to these devastating cuts in 1996-97 and 1997-98, going from $18.4 billion for health, social services and education to $12.5 billion two years later. That was a Liberal government dealing with the devastating effects a generation after another Liberal government, a Trudeau government, had absolutely zero idea of what to do to run an economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I fear that we are in the same boat now. We have heard Liberal speaker after Liberal speaker get up and ask how Conservatives can vote against this thing, and they will cherry-pick one thing, or be against this other thing. All of the things they talk about sound great, but I hearken back to the debate on May 1 in the House of Commons, and one comment, though there were many comments like this, struck me. The comment was in response to a question during question period from a Conservative member of Parliament. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, talking about the grocery rebate, said, “The grocery rebate is going to deliver support to 11 million low-income Canadians who need it.” How have we come to a place in 2023 when the finance minister is bragging about the fact that we have 11 million low-income Canadians who need support to buy groceries? How are we at that place in 2023?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="10">(2110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>We look at the government's own budget documents and we take a look at the numbers in these documents and we think about those important transfers we are talking about and other programs. The Canada health transfer is set to be, in 2023-24, $49.4 billion. Do members know that the projected cost to service the debt will be in the same year? It is $43.9 billion, so because of the fiscal incompetence, and there is no other way to say it, of the government that has been in power for eight years, we are going to spend as much in interest as we are going to spend on health care in this country as a federal government. There is no other way to say it: That is absolute incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When we take a look at the Liberal budget, one of the things that strike me is that they cut their deal with the NDP, and we hear the NDP talk about the different things that they were able to negotiate into this Liberal budget, but I will tell members one thing that was negotiated out of the Liberal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is the state of where we are. We in this place oftentimes can agree that there are certain things that need our attention. We might have different ideas on how we address those things, but we can agree there are certain things that require attention. One thing that we all agreed on during the last election campaign was the fact that there is a mental health crisis in this country. We all had different platform ideas that we put forward. We ran an election. Canadians looked at those promises we made, because we make promises in election campaigns, and I would think Canadians would expect us to keep those promises. Admittedly, we made promises that were different from those of the Liberals and the NDP on mental health, but we all had substantial promises in there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals promised, on page 75 of their election platform, very clearly in a black-and-white five-year costed layout of their election platform, a $4.5-billion investment in mental health called the “Canada Mental Health Transfer”. That was something the Liberals promised. Every Liberal in this House went to doors during the election campaign and promised things to Canadians, many of whom would have been struggling with their mental health, especially as we were still in the midst of a pandemic. We were moving hopefully toward the end of it, but at that point in time people were obviously very significantly affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians struggling with their mental health had a Liberal member of Parliament or a Liberal candidate go to their door and promise they were going to spend $4.5 billion on a Canada mental health transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What happened next? Immediately the Liberals signed their deal with the NDP. No NDP member has actually yet taken credit for negotiating this out of their agreement, but clearly it must have been something that the NDP said. They must have said that they wanted to put NDP priorities on the agenda instead of the Canada mental health transfer. No one has talked about why that was negotiated out, but it is very clear that the Liberals have decided that this promise they made is no longer important and that there are other priorities, or, if it is still important to them, that they have come to a point where the fiscal situation is so bad that it was in their cabinet meetings.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I do not know if the leader of the NDP is in the Liberal cabinet meetings or if the House leader of the NDP is, but the Liberals had to go into these cabinet meetings. They had to have conversations and say that things are really tough here and that they had decided to fund some program, one of the many programs they are listing, but they were no longer going to be able to afford this thing they promised on page 75 in their election platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do not know what those conversations looked like; all I know from taking a look at the budget we are debating tonight and from taking a look at the numbers we are talking about tonight is that we are going to be in a situation where Liberal governments and this coalition, however long it lasts, are going to be having conversations like that, because they have come to a point where life is just not only unaffordable for Canadians but unaffordable for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>It becomes unsustainable at some point. It is just like when we were dealing with the results of Trudeau Liberal incompetence in the mid-nineties because the Trudeau government of the seventies and eighties had run up all of those deficits over all of those years. I fear we are going to be in the same situation moving forward. During questions and comments, I hope some Liberal will rise up and explain that maybe my concerns are somehow misplaced. Hopefully there will be some explanation and some understanding tonight of the situation we are in.</ParaText>

It is approximately $46 billion of new funding. One of the aspects of that funding includes certain conditional priorities, and one of those priorities is exactly what the member was referencing: access to timely, equitable and quality mental health, substance use and addiction services. I would just point that out, to flesh out the record in terms of the context of this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member's party is steadfastly committed to voting against this budget. This budget includes $158.4 million over three years to support the implementation and operation of a 988 number that would be a suicide hotline in this country, which would serve the mental health needs of Canadians. Does the member seek to revise his voting position in that regard?</ParaText>

They have not even let us have a debate on wildfires, which is so urgently needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I want to agree with my colleague on one thing in his speech. I will give Stephen Harper credit for one thing when he was the prime minister of this country: He did tell us who he was, when he was going to cut things and how he was going to decimate the charitable sector, the foreign aid and all of those things. He made it very clear he was going to do those things, and then he did them. However, the current Conservative opposition party refuses to tell us what the Conservatives would cut. The member refuses to tell us which things in this budget he would cut. Is it dental care? Is it housing? Is it health care? Is it a futures economy? Which one of those things would the member cut?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I have heard the New Democrats talk about the Harper era during the whole debate tonight, and here are a couple of things from the Harper era. The member was wrong on most of her facts, but the reality is that, during the Harper era, there were a few things we did promise and deliver. We promised regular increases. In fact, almost every single year, we increased spending on the Canada health transfer by six per cent. Members would not know that by listening to Liberal talking points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Something that clearly differentiates the current Liberal government's approach from ours is that when we dealt with a global economic meltdown, a part of that, every step of the way, was a road map to get back to a balanced budget, which we delivered in 2015. We have not seen one since.</ParaText>

However, one thing we agree on is that there was no need for the federal government to own the Trans Mountain pipeline. In our view, of course, the private sector should have been able to build that pipeline.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, of course, it always a delight to stand in this place representing the incredible constituents of Edmonton Strathcona.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is the first day I have been in the House since the Alberta election, and I did want to send my congratulations to Rachel Notley. Of course, it was not the outcome we wanted, but I think it is important for all of us in this place to recognize the significant wins in Alberta. In Alberta, we elected the very first Black woman as an MLA. We elected the very first indigenous woman as an MLA. We elected members in Sherwood Park. We elected members in every seat in Edmonton and in so many more seats in Calgary. Almost every urban seat in Alberta went to the NDP, including seats that had been held by ministers and that flipped over to the NDP. It is something I think Rachel Notley, and all Albertans, should be extremely proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are things on which we have more work to do. I am not very proud of the fact that Albertans elected a member who compared trans children to feces. I am not very proud that a Conservative with those views was elected. It is appalling and disgusting during Pride month. However, there is work to do, and we will continue to do that work. However, this is not actually why I am here tonight, but I did want to raise that, because, frankly, some of those things are indicative of the changing political landscape in Alberta and the belief of Albertans in the importance of taking care of each other, and I think that is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>What we are actually here to talk about is the budget implementation act, and I want to talk a little bit about why this is so important and why I am supporting it. This is not a perfect piece of legislation. This is not a perfect budget. This is not the budget I would have written. However, I am so proud to be part of the New Democratic Party, which pushed for some of the things that are in this budget, and I am going to outline a few of those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Edmonton Strathcona and across the country, families are struggling with the cost of life, with affordability. We cannot go into grocery stores and communities and talk to people on their doorsteps without them telling us about how difficult this is, how challenging it is for them, how difficult it is buy food, to pay their rent, to find housing, to be able to pay for their lives and to be able to thrive in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a parliamentarian, my primary job is actually to make life better for Canadians and my constituents and to find ways to support them. I cannot tell members how proud I am that dental care is something that Canadians are going to have access to when the bill is passed, and not just for children, but for everyone under 18, people living with disabilities and seniors. Oh my goodness, seniors in this country will have access to dental care, which is something that should have been in place decades ago. However, I am just so proud that I get to be part of the New Democratic Party, which pushed for this happen in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have talked about the GST rebate in the House, which is that added help that so many families need. I will agree with other members who have raised this; I would like us to live in a country where that is not necessary, but right now, the reality is that there are Canadians who need that extra help, who need that extra piece to get them through. If we can provide that support to Canadians at this moment, when affordability is so challenging, why would we not do that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On urban, rural and northern indigenous housing, I learned so much from my colleague from Iqaluit, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278704" Type="2">Nunavut</Affiliation>. She is such a champion in the House, and she is a person who speaks so strongly for her constituents. She has made it very clear that there is not enough money for the need in northern indigenous communities. However, I will say that this budget implementation act is important, and it is important that New Democrats recognize it and recognize that our job is going to be to continue to push the government to do more, continue to push the government to make sure that rural, urban and northern indigenous communities have the funding they need for adequate housing. We would not accept less in any other communities, and we should not accept it in indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>

I am proud that there is legislation that will prevent scabs from being used by corporations. That is important. That is important for workers, so that workers know that they can actually work, that they can actually negotiate, that they can go to the negotiation table with their employers and get a fair deal.

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> has done so much work, but, more importantly, workers in Alberta have done so much work. Workers in Alberta have been calling for this investment in them. I have said this many times in this place. I come from a line of oil and gas workers. My dad was a trucker and my dad worked in the oil fields. He worked in Alaska and in Alberta. My brothers work in the oil and gas sector. My husband works in the oil and gas sector. I recognize what that sector has done for Canada. I also speak to people in my constituency. They want assurances that there is a future for them, for their children and for their families, and that there are going to be jobs for them, that there is going to be a place for them in a futures economy. If we do not have investment in Alberta, that is not going to happen. I am thrilled that this is here. I am thrilled that this is being led by Alberta workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will finish today by saying how ashamed I am of some other members of the House from Alberta, how ashamed I am that some of the members have done everything they can to stop the processes of this Parliament going forward. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has benefited from a publicly funded health and dental care plan for over 20 years. Every one of us in the House benefits from dental care and a health care plan, but the Leader of the Opposition started today by proclaiming that he will use every procedural trick in the book to stop hard-working families from accessing desperately needed dental care. That is shameful, when seniors, people living with disabilities and children, his children, have access to dental care, and when he has access to dental care. The 25 New Democrats in this place have done more for Canadians in this Parliament than the 115 Conservatives have. I would ask them to tell me one thing they have delivered for Canadians, one thing they have been able to deliver. All they do is come here and obstruct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I, for one, want to work to make this country better for Canadians. I want to make sure this world is better for everyone, so when I come to this place, I look around this room and think of who I can work with. How can I get things done? What can I do to make sure that life is better for my constituents? That is my job. That is why I come here. Every member of this 25-member caucus does that. That is why Canadians are getting dental care. That is why Canadians are getting housing support. That is why Canadians are getting the grocery rebate. It is not because the Conservatives are throwing shenanigans all over the place; it is not because they are making a mockery of Parliament. We are allowing things to get done, and I am so proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We talked about Harper a lot tonight, and I will say again that he did tell people when he was going to cut things. He did tell us when he was going to destroy our social safety net. The current opposition refuses to tell us when it is going to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will say it again: This bill is not perfect. There are things I would like to change in this bill, but there are more than enough things in this bill that are going to help Canadians, help with the affordability crisis and help people who are struggling in our country right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will come into this place every single day ready to work and to do more and more to get the help for Canadians, and I certainly hope the Conservatives stop their shenanigans and get on board.</ParaText>

That is worth applauding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I wanted to draw her attention to aspects of the budget. She outlined a lot of what is in the budget. There is a lot in there. Specifically, there are references to funding and supports to deal with some of the challenging divisions that we continue to see in Canadian society. The budget includes $25 million for supporting Black Canadian communities initiative, which is about empowering Black organizations. Another $25 million will go to supporting the anti-racism strategy and dealing with some of the pernicious issues that relate to anti-indigenous racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I would also say that the government has promised money since 2019 and has not followed through with spending. That is my biggest concern with the Liberal government. It has the ability to say the right things, but it does not do the hard work. It does not do the work necessary to implement things, to spend the money and to get the programs out to the people who need them the most.

              <ParaText>I was also glad to hear her say that, even though the election in Alberta did not necessarily go the way she would have liked, she still respects the democracy that was expressed in Alberta. They elected a premier who, while not her choice, was nonetheless democratically elected by Albertans. That is good, because the Bloc Québécois believes that it is important to respect democracy, as well as the authority and jurisdiction of the Quebec National Assembly and the legislative assemblies of the other provinces. Alberta's democracy has spoken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to ask my colleague a question. Governments express their priorities through the budget choices they make. I am having trouble understanding something, and I hope she can explain it to me. How can she support a budget that contains no measures to support seniors, no increase in the OAS benefits for seniors aged 65 and over?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government is creating two classes of seniors. By supporting the budget, my colleague is endorsing the idea that seniors under 75 do not need assistance.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to yet another inflationary, irresponsible Liberal budget that claims to rein in inflation, yet actually does the complete opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals even claim that it is a made-in-Canada plan, while they continue their attack on workers' paycheques. Thanks to their irresponsible spending, Canadians from coast to coast to coast have found themselves bringing home less and less. People are lining up at food banks to put food on the table. Young people have given up hope of ever owning a home. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer has flagged several issues in the budget, ranging from a meagre economic outlook in the coming years to lack of fiscal transparency and an incoming recession. The Liberal government has had eight long years to step up for Canadians, but, despite managing to spend more than all past prime ministers combined, its chronic fiscal mismanagement and reckless policies have left Canadians struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Canadians continue to watch prices soar, from food to fuel, home heating and even housing prices. Making ends meet through the cost of living crisis has become impossible. Despite all this, the government continues to hike the carbon tax and the excise tax on alcohol, against the interests of hard-working Canadians. Enough is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberal government has had eight years to step up for Canadians, but it is now time for it to step down and for common-sense Conservative solutions to be enacted to truly help Canadians across the country. As Conservatives, we set these three conditions for our support of budget 2023: It must bring home powerful paycheques, with lower taxes, so hard work pays off again. It must bring home lower prices by eliminating the inflationary carbon tax and deficits. Finally, it must bring homes that young people can afford by removing gatekeepers and speeding up the construction and affordability of housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberals have rolled out over $43 billion of inflationary spending and senseless tax grabs that would burden Canadians from coast to coast. After eight years of the Liberal government, we all see how its solutions simply do not work. Conservatives have the right solutions that do work, so paycheques will work for the Canadians who do the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am proud to say that Conservatives will not support this budget, and here is why: The Liberals' budget 2023 continues the Liberals' war on work, dedicated workers and workers' paycheques. Instead of listening to struggling Canadians suffering under the worst affordability crisis they have ever seen, the Liberals continue with their reckless, inflationary spending, while increasing taxes. This means that workers are punished for working hard and take home even less of their paycheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The government's inflationary spending has caused the cost of groceries to skyrocket, leaving one in five Canadians skipping meals or relying on food banks. The misleading grocery rebate would only give $234 for a single adult to cover the rising cost of living, which the Liberal government's reckless spending caused. Canada's food price report 2023 predicts that a family of four will spend up to $1,065 more on food this year, which is drastically higher than the $467 grocery rebate that they will receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>On April 1, the Liberal government hiked the senseless carbon tax, costing the average family between $402 and $847 in 2023, even after the rebates. The government also continues to raise taxes on still-recovering restaurants and breweries by increasing the excise tax on alcohol by 2%. The temporary cap in the hikes of the alcohol excise tax is only valid for a year, and it is not enough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="45">(2145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>The Liberal policies of hiking taxes and clawing back money that should remain in the pockets of Canadians in the first place must end. Conservatives will prioritize fixing what the Liberals broke by ensuring powerful paycheques and opportunities for the people who do the work. The down payment that is necessary nowadays for an average home has doubled after eight years of the Liberal government. We believe in bringing homes young people can afford so that they do not continue to live in their parents' basements because they have given up on their dreams of home ownership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Back when the Liberals first took office, the average rent in Canada for a one-bedroom apartment was $973. After eight years of the current government, the price has skyrocketed to $1,760. The average mortgage and rent payments have also nearly doubled since the Liberals took office, increasing to $3,100 from what was once $1,400.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Before the Liberals took office, Canadians only needed 39% of the average paycheque to make monthly payments on the average house. After eight long years of Liberal recklessness, this number has risen to 62%, leaving Canadians with way less of their paycheques to spend on other necessities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Liberal government has not outlined any plans to get rid of the gatekeepers and get more affordable housing built. Its inflationary spending and misguided policies have left people giving up on home ownership. Conservatives believe in building a country with homes people can actually afford by getting rid of the gatekeepers, freeing up land, speeding up building permits and getting shovels in the ground to get affordable housing built. While the Liberal government continues to overspend and overtax, we will continue to prioritize the interests of hard-working Canadians by getting affordable housing built fast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Eight long years of the Liberal government has brought nothing but reckless inflationary spending, senseless tax hikes and irresponsible policies, leading to the worst affordability crisis Canadians have ever seen. Canadians from coast to coast to coast have found themselves bringing home less. People are lining up at food banks to put food on the table. Young people have given up the hope of ever owning a home. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer has flagged several issues in the budget, ranging from the meagre economic outlook in the coming years to a lack of fiscal transparency and an incoming recession. That is the effect of the Liberal government, which has had eight long years to step up for Canadians. Now is the time for it to step down and adopt our common-sense Conservative solutions to make Canada work for the people who have done the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We will continue to demand the following: offering powerful paycheques, with lower taxes, so hard work pays off again; lowering prices by eliminating the inflationary carbon tax and deficits; and building homes that young people can afford by removing gatekeepers and speeding up the construction of affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Because our pragmatic demands were not met, we will not be supporting this inflationary Liberal budget.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>For the most part, when it comes to zoning and restructuring building plans, it usually falls under municipal government acts that, because of the policies they have sometimes created, need to be amended and addressed because we are not building the homes that need to be built. The money seems to be put in the budget, yet the homes are not getting built. Why is that? It is because the policies and programs offered by municipalities a lot of times do not warrant the quick and speedy building of homes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, there is absolutely no reason for the government to buy a pipeline. The only reason it did so was because of its own policies, which created the issue. If this pipeline had been built by the contractor and the company, we would not have seen a $30-billion increase to the project. That is an outstanding amount, which is ridiculous, and no private industry would have ever built this pipeline for that kind of money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is, once again, the government's ineptness in getting projects done in Canada. First, they are hugely overrun and probably would have been built by now, but Liberal policies, such as Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, have stopped pipelines from being built in Canada, and they are intentionally causing the high costs to make sure Canadians think it is ridiculous and a pipeline will never get built again. They are right. If the government owned the pipeline, we will never own it. That is why it should go back to the private sector, where it belongs. The government should never have been involved in the private sector for pipelines.</ParaText>

Compile all of this, and it spells bad news for Canadians. Canada's debt is projected to reach $1.22 trillion in fiscal year 2023-24. That is nearly $81,000 of debt per household.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the results of this inflationary spending is to cause inflation to go up to the highest rates we have seen in 40 years. The previous high was under a former Liberal government with an out-of-control spending problem. The high inflation rate is resulting in the Bank of Canada raising interest rates to try to rein in inflation, rates that the Liberal government was warned about, but it failed to take the warning. Therefore, now, as a result, we have record high national debt combined with jacked-up interest rates that will see Canada's debt service costs projected to reach $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023-24. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Can members imagine the good $43.9 billion could do if it were not required to pay just for the debt? That is not to pay off the debt. That is just to pay the annual debt service cost. None of that estimated $43.9 billion would be going to reduce the deficit or the cost in future years. It is only to pay that annual debt service fee. That is $43.9 billion that could have gone to health care, to the nurses, doctors and hospitals where health care workers have been stretched to and beyond their limit. That is $43.9 billion that could have been going to infrastructure projects to improve water and wastewater projects in our communities, indigenous communities and municipalities. That is $43.9 billion that could have gone to transportation projects to help people get to work on time, or $43.9 billion to get homes built. However this $43.9 billion is only going to pay the debt service costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I used to ask people at home if they could envision what $20 billion looked like because I myself had trouble envisioning what that looks like. I would get blank stares or heads shaking back, and so I would ask them if they can imagine what five $100 bills would look like in their hand. They would say, “Yes, I can picture five $100 bills.” I said that is what $20 billion is to every living Canadian, every infant, every youth, every adult, every senior and every veteran. It is five $100 bills in debt. That was what the $20-billion deficits were causing. Now we are seeing $40-billion deficits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>He said: Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to thank the Speaker for granting my request for an emergency debate on the urgent and escalating wildfire situation across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to say first that our hearts are with the 120,000 Canadians who have been forced to flee their homes this year, 30,000 of whom are still out of their homes, and even more so with the many hundreds who have lost everything in these wildfires. I thank the firefighters on land and in the air for their brave and dangerous work in keeping all of us safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>More than 400 fires are burning right now across the country from Vancouver Island to Nova Scotia. More than 3.6 million hectares of forest have been torched. Today, for the first time in my eight years as an MP, I woke to smoky skies in Ottawa, a sight I know only too well from my home in British Columbia, but it was a first for me here, and it is only the first week of June. We have a long and hot fire season ahead of us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Local and provincial first responders have already been overwhelmed in Alberta, Nova Scotia and Quebec. It is clear that we need to re-evaluate the federal role in wildfire protection and response to develop a more proactive process instead of the present reactive one. We must do much of this as quickly as possible in the next few weeks before summer truly arrives. This process and support to affected parts of the country should be informed by the urgent debate of Parliament, and that is why we are here late at night debating this critically important topic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>This has been a wildfire season like no other. The area burned so far is 10 times the annual average. How many times have we heard that over the last decade? How many summers have been described as the “worst ever” for forest fires?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was listening to Dr. Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert from Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops on the radio a couple of days ago, and he made some important comments that I will be repeating here tonight. One of the most important was his comment that this weather, these fire seasons, are not the new normal. He said that we are in a downward spiral when it comes to climate change and wildfire behaviour, and that our fight against climate change is a fight to keep things from getting worse and worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>A paper published in the journal of Environmental Research Letters last month found that about 40% of the wildfires we are experiencing every year in North America can be directly attributed to the fossil fuel industry and its impact on climate change. However, while we are fighting climate change to keep things from getting worse, we must adapt to the changes that are already upon us because these changes are essentially permanent, since carbon dioxide takes centuries to leave the atmosphere, and those changes include more frequent and more intense wildfires. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>An essential part of that adaptation will be an increased role for the federal government to play in wildfire management. First, we need to train and maintain crews of firefighters who will help us attack fires rapidly before they explode out of control. Second, we need to maintain a national stockpile of equipment that can be quickly sent to affected provinces so that we are not wasting valuable days while a fire or a cluster of fires gets out of hand. This could also include a squadron of water bombers that could be deployed quickly wherever they are needed. Third, we need better coordination of both resources and manpower. Finally, we need to work between fire seasons to reshape the forest surrounding our communities so that interface fires will not have the same destructive effects that they have today. I would like to cover all of these points in more detail, starting with firefighters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Firefighters on the ground are the heart and soul of wildfire fighting in Canada. Wildfires are fought by both professional and volunteer crews based in small communities across the country. When I go to fire lines in my riding, I see crews from all over British Columbia. I want to thank those 90,000 volunteer firefighters from across Canada for that work, which goes completely unpaid. I want to put in a plug here for Bill <Document DbId="12127551" Type="4">C-310</Document> from my NDP colleague for <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation>, which would provide more tax relief for volunteer firefighters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Increasingly, international crews are coming to help us as we have helped other countries in the past. When I was in Chile for a parliamentary visit in March, there were Canadian personnel and equipment fighting fires there during the worst fire season that it ever had. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="05">(2205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>We need to consider the idea of creating a national firefighting service. Michael Flannigan has suggested that 20 crews of 20 firefighters each would be a great help in getting onto fires quickly. That rapid initial attack is the key to fighting wildfires. Once a fire gets beyond a few hectares in hot, dry windy weather, it very quickly becomes an unmanageable monster that can only be tamed by a change in weather or a change in the season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once tamed, they are actually put out by boots on the ground, with teams of firefighters doing the hard, dirty, hot work. A quick response with water bombers, skimmers filling from nearby lakes and helicopters bucketing water from ponds and temporary reservoirs can knock down small fires quickly. I have seen it happen from my back deck at home, since I live only a couple of kilometres from one of the main air bases for firefighting in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Too often, I have had bombers and helicopters fly low overhead as they fight fires in the forests and grasslands around my home in Penticton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Prompt bombing with retardant dropped by larger planes, and the latest ones to arrive in Penticton are part of a new fleet of Dash 8-400s, can help set boundary containment for big fires but, again, that on-the-ground work is essential to really putting the fires out. We need quicker access to essential firefighting equipment that is available to regions in need. We saw that need last week in Nova Scotia, when local and provincial resources were overtaxed very quickly with wildfires on the outskirts of Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The federal government provided material but it took a couple of days to find that material and get it to the firefighters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to turn now to how we coordinate our efforts nationally and how we must be anticipating where fires will break out rather than reacting after a wave of thunderstorm cells paint the countryside with fires set in tinder-dry forests. Our weather forecasting is accurate enough to tell us with near certainty the general temperature and, to a lesser extent, the weekly precipitation trends across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This year, we knew the fire season would be extraordinary, after record-setting temperatures in almost all parts of the country. We should develop programs that develop the teams of firefighters and equipment they need and then use careful but prompt planning decisions to put all of that in place in at-risk parts of the country before firestorms break out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have to properly fund FireSmart programs to thin the forests that interface with our communities and even the trees and shrubs around our own homes, to reduce the chance of homes and infrastructure being lost to wildfire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The community of Logan Lake, British Columbia literally saved itself in 2021 with a concerted program of forest thinning, FireSmarting backyards and even rooftop sprinkler systems. It can be done. Logan Lake worked at it for over 20 years but on the big scale needed it will take a lot of effort and, quite frankly, a lot of money. The federal government can and should play a big role there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Things have changed dramatically in the forest fire situation in the last 50 years. When I was going to school in the 1960s in the Okanagan Valley, there were only two serious wildfires in a dozen years. Now we have several every year. This year, we have seen that pattern spread across the country, with huge destructive fires in the maritime forests of Nova Scotia and fires in the rainforests of Vancouver Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Wildfires are changing and wildfires are changing our lives. We must change, as well, in our response to these growing threats. The provinces have been doing admirable work in fire-prone parts of the country but it is clear from our experience so far this spring that no part of the country is immune from wildfire. The federal government must step up to provide necessary leadership for the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I think the provinces are certainly pulling their own weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Some provinces, like British Columbia, have been facing this for longer and more intensely than others, and have put more resources into it. For provinces like Nova Scotia, this is a new thing, so they are in a different place. The provinces have really been stepping up, but one difference between the provinces and the federal government is that they have less of an ability to invest large sums of money into projects and issues like this. The federal government is in a place where we could really help in a national sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The hon. member mentioned the Armed Forces stepping in. It would be a good idea to have a special force that would be there to fight fires and deal with other emergencies, a force that is specially trained exactly for that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, through you to many of my fellow Albertans, what has been happening in the month of May and what continues to happen across our province is truly devastating. The wildfires, the smoke, the devastation and the loss will be with those families for a long time. I know we will never be able to truly rebuild to the point at which they remember where they have those cultural heirlooms, where they have the things that they raised their children with, where they have the mementos from each of those monuments in their life that they can cherish and keep with them, which are now reduced to ash. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are with those families. We will do everything in our power to make sure they can rebuild. That is why New Democrats and I are steadfast in our support of indigenous communities that have been hit the hardest by these fires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to extend my personal thanks as well to the many men, women, non-binary and diverse folks who serve in our firefighting teams right across the country, but particularly in Alberta right now, who are risking their lives so that community members can save what they can. They are risking their lives to make sure that children may have a place to go back to. They are risking their lives to make sure that communities stay intact. They are certainly unsung heroes, heroes who go home day after day, covered in ash, who may not hear the thanks and gratitude from families like my own and families I visit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In 2003, my family endured a wildfire in the northeast part of the province of Alberta. At that time I was just a child, living with my family. In just a short time, a 30-minute wind was able to bring in a fire so large that no crew could even get to it. It brought down forests; it brought down power lines; it stopped roads, and it stopped services. We were stranded. I was alone and I was scared. Me, my mum, my dad and my sister were alone, cut off from all roads, with fallen trees on either side of us. We thought surely this would be it. My dad and my mum prayed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>My dad did what he could. His father had built a barn, and he looked after that barn. Inside that barn were saddles, handmade and passed on from generation to generation, from horse whisperers in my family to some of the best rodeo clowns our province had to offer. That history was reduced, burned to ash while my father was reduced to tears.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I remember being evacuated in the arms of a firefighter. He took me in his hands, and without question I could feel his compassion and his need to save us. He put me in a car, put an oxygen mask on my mouth and told me to close my eyes. He told me to sing a song. “Three times,” he said, “and you'll be okay.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Two songs in, I realized finally we were escaping the smoke. Although I had left my family behind, I knew that my mother and my father were going to be okay because people like him were with them, like the firefighters who are with our communities right now. For them, I want to thank the firefighters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The reality is that it is ongoing and it is still happening today. Whether it is wildfires on the east coast or right across the Prairies, we are seeing the devastation of families like my own who have to go through this. I know that pain of not being able to get back what we once had, but I also know the joy of being able to return home with all of our lives, with the things we cherished most of all, which was each other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I went and journeyed just weeks ago to the East Prairie Métis Settlement, a community of which over 80% was reduced to ash, people greeted me with smiles. They greeted me with the kind of generosity and the kind of love that only a community that has withstood the worst could have. East Prairie Métis Settlement is a community of resilient, hard-working, remarkable individuals. When they received that call to evacuate early one morning in early May, they sprang into action. Just four hours is what it took for the entire community to evacuate, in a community that had only one entrance and one exit. That was because of the coordination of the community, not because of any extra help they got. It was because the community knew that this was not a matter of if; it was a matter of when.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The forests in northern Alberta have been sick. On top of that, people have had to suffer gruelling and dangerous temperatures. We used to have a saying, and I am sure many members are familiar with it: April showers bring May flowers. However, there have been no showers; this has resulted in one of the most devastating fires in the history of our province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When I met with the council of the East Prairie Métis Settlement, its members pleaded with me. They said that in the heat of an Alberta election, they did not receive any support. They looked to the federal government, and they were stonewalled with jurisdiction. They sought support from local municipalities, but they had no resources left to offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This community had nothing left, but its members gave it their all. Although they lost over 14 homes, and 80% of the community burned, they saved 20%. That is an immense feat for a group of volunteers, a group of experts who hold within them the traditional knowledge necessary to continue to keep our communities safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>They are called “wildland firefighters”, and it took only 14 of them to save the remainder of the community. This is the same group of firefighters we sent to Quebec, Ontario and right across the globe. Their skills, their understanding of forests and the traditional knowledge they carry are needed now more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I spoke to East Prairie survivors. I was there the day the evacuation order was lifted, and they took me into their community. What I witnessed was truly devastating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I went with families, and it was an amazing moment for some of them. They saw their houses standing. They even saw their dogs, covered in ash but still protecting their land. They were holding their ground as if it were their last stand. They did it as they waited for their humans to come home. That is the kind of love that animals have a power to demonstrate and one that humans often hold back on. It is one I hope we never relent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I spoke to some of those who lost their homes. A survivor, the oldest elder in the community, came up to me and said that once she got on that bus to go home, it felt like she was going back home as she did the day she left the residential school. She said the fear she had in her heart, and of not knowing what she was going back to, triggered her, and she wept. She found that although there was nothing left of her home, there was so much left of her community. She provided her strength, leadership and kindness to the children, mothers and those who were truly in pain. She offered them smiles, condolences and love, even though she had lost so much. I am truly inspired by that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That is a story I wanted to share with all my colleagues, because people like this exist in their communities, too. They are worth protecting and investing in; we need to ensure that this climate catastrophe does not continue to wreck their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know they exist. They had only one ask. They said that as many families as returned home, there was the same number that could not return, because they did not have anywhere to go. They said that $900,000 is all it is going to take to ensure that all of those who lost their homes have temporary housing until they can rebuild.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We need courage, and we must demonstrate the kind of love we have for Canadians in our hearts. This must materialize as the programs and supports that people who are in need right now need the most. I beg this chamber and my colleagues to truly use the compassion they often speak so much about and turn it into action. The people of East Prairie, Paddle Prairie and Peavine deserve that. The people right across this country who are affected by the wildfires deserve that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Those wildfires continue to rage every single day, and they are doing it right now, as we speak. I know it is late in the day for us, but those firefighters are going to be working even harder than we are tonight. They are going to be going all night, and they are going to be doing it with the risk of not returning home. I ask that we all keep them in our hearts and in our prayers tonight as they continue to battle raging wildfires across our country, in hopes that help truly comes from this place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, there is no question in my mind of the service put forward by firefighters and first responders in the service they conduct, at the height of the worst conditions and realities imaginable for everyday people. They put their lives at risk. They hold on to that fear, and they manifest courage. What is most important for us to know is that, when they put that courage on, they are also putting on equipment that is risking their lives and that has been found to contribute to cancer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am so thankful for the bill put forward by the member opposite, because this is something we are truly united around. We have all had firefighters come join us, and we have all promised them we would do something about what they are experiencing. That is exactly what we are going to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>In the boreal forest of Treaty 8, Treaty 10 and Treaty 11 territories, there is a tradition of prescribed burns, where indigenous people burn <I>x</I> amount of land in order to prevent an even greater fire from being produced. Without prescribed burns, this fuel gathers, builds and becomes dangerous. That is exactly what happened when we banned the ability of first nations and Métis communities to have prescribed burns; unfortunately, this is still a reality in Canada. If we want to ensure that indigenous people get to the point of restoring the lands, which they have done for thousands of years, we have to make sure that we listen and get laws out of the way that are currently prohibiting indigenous people from practising the traditional ecological work they are supposed to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for that question, because it is something that we often do not have the opportunity to speak about in this place. Indigenous people have long stewarded Turtle Island, North America, when catastrophes happen, from floods to natural disasters, such as forest fires, as well as huge, immense, prolonged winters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We have a history, stories and knowledge. The history that is present here and that we often talk about is short. It is a small piece of what Canada is. Canada is an immensely ancient place, a place with tradition and knowledge. Indigenous people have been installed in a position to care for and administer this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know about prescribed burns. When we take care of forest fires at a low-risk level by destroying the fuel in the forest early, rather than stacking it up by banning prescribed burns, then we deal with what would become a much worse fire, which is what we are seeing in Alberta today. If we had invested and allowed indigenous people the jurisdiction and the resources to do what traditional wildland firefighting looks like, we would not have had this issue; we would stand a chance.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, before I begin, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278666" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to acknowledge that I rise in my place here on the traditional territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. I am very pleased to be able to join in the emergency debate on the wildfire situation in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to begin with two important messages, as these are top of mind for me and, I suspect, for all those here today. First, for all those affected by the wildfires burning across the country, whether they have had to evacuate their home, experienced the loss of a pet or property or had their life upended in some way, I want them to know that the Government of Canada is with them. We are working hard to provide help where it is needed. Second, for the brave workers and volunteers fighting these fires, whether on the front lines as firefighters, police, search and rescue personnel or members of the Canadian Armed Forces, or behind the scenes as dispatchers or staff, we are beyond grateful for their heroic work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To put things in perspective, as of June 5, which is today, there have already been 2,214 wildfires nationally; approximately 3.3 million hectares have been burnt. We are already in the thick of another severe wildfire season. In many areas, the season is shaping up to be historic. Resources are already stretched to their limits and beyond. I know that many Canadians are understandably concerned and wondering how the Government of Canada is responding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Emergencies like these are, of course, first managed at a municipal level. If they begin to escalate, municipalities may request assistance from their province or territory. In turn, if the situation continues to deteriorate, provinces and territories may then submit requests for federal assistance, or RFAs. These are initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory, and additional federal resources are needed to support the impacted region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once an RFA is received, the government operations centre leaps into action to coordinate the response, including consultation with provinces or territories and all implicated departments. We received RFAs from the Province of Alberta on May 10 and May 27, from Nova Scotia on May 31 and from Quebec on June 3. We were asked to help with the severe situations under way in these provinces. All these requests were approved. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Alberta, the Government of Canada has provided resources, including Canadian Armed Forces resources, for an initial period of two weeks, with a possible one-week extension. CAF resources in Alberta include firefighting personnel; airlift resources for tasks that include evacuation of isolated communities; and engineering support, including heavy equipment. There are roughly 150 soldiers in total currently deployed in support of firefighting tasks in the Fox Creek region and Fort Chipewyan. The Government of Canada is also providing resources from numerous departments, including contracting support for supplies and logistics, RCMP response and law enforcement, enhanced Service Canada hours, mobile outreach support and much more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The CAF resources are also being deployed to Nova Scotia for an initial period of three weeks, with a possible one-week extension. An immediate response unit from Canadian Forces Base Gagetown, New Brunswick, is also available to assist with basic firefighting. Other supports are similar to those being offered to the Province of Alberta, as well as additional air-quality monitoring capacity, deployment of response personnel and assets from the Canadian Coast Guard, support for affected first nations through the emergency management assistance program, and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In Quebec, there are now 150 soldiers deployed to the Sept-Îles region to assist with firefighting activities. The Canadian Red Cross and other non-governmental organizations are actively deployed in multiple regions across the country, providing support as needed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>In addition to our robust, efficient response on the ground to these emergent situations, we are also undertaking donation-matching programs to further provide financial assistance and encourage the same from Canadians. We are partnered with the provinces of Alberta and Nova Scotia and the Canadian Red Cross to match donations and to help provide relief to the most severely impacted communities and families in these areas. Thus far, the campaign in Alberta has already raised $20 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are also implementing a donation-matching initiative with the Northwest Territories and the United Way to support relief and recovery efforts in several communities. Canadians, as we all know, are known for their selflessness and generosity for a reason, and I have no doubt that they will step up in a big way with donations for their neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have just provided an overview of our immediate response to the emergency situations under way across the country. Fighting these fires and addressing their immediate impacts is no small task, but it is only one small part of a disaster response. We know that even after the smoke clears, there lies before us a very long recovery. That is why we have programs, such as the disaster financial assistance arrangements, or DFAA, whereby the federal government provides post-disaster relief supports to provincial and territorial governments, about $7.9 billion since the inception of the program in 1970, in fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Government of Canada can also cover up to 90% of costs, but provinces and territories have full say over the design and delivery of their recovery plans. Eligible costs might include evacuation, emergency shelter, repairs to public buildings or infrastructure, removal of hazardous material and, of course, repairs to individual homes, small businesses or farms. We know that recovery is not always easy, but we are here to help with financial, tactical and practical support. I want Canadians to know that all governments and partners are working together with their safety in mind and with a high degree of co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As we head into summer across the country, we are seeing hot, dry conditions, and that has led to very active wildfire conditions across central, eastern and western Canada. There are 413 current wildfires burning. As we continue to see an influx of firefighters and resource-sharing right across the country, I would like to once again take an opportunity to thank all of our partners, indigenous communities, federal, provincial and international counterparts, for their excellent co-operation. We maintain continuous communication, and impacts on communities are being monitored on a 24-7 basis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, we are grateful for the tireless work of Canadian firefighters on the front lines, behind the scenes and in the hearts of our communities. I thank them, all our partners and Canadians, for staying safe and stepping up to help. To all the Canadians who are impacted by these wildfires, I want them to know that we will continue to be there for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>The Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs just wrote an op-ed in The Globe and Mail yesterday and cited how Canada is becoming more and more reliant on over 90,000 volunteer firefighters. It also highlighted in its op-ed that, number one, it wants to make sure that the government sends a clear message to firefighters that they are needed, valued and appreciated. It highlighted that the tax benefit for firefighters who do over 200 hours of volunteer work get about a $450 benefit. They get a $3,000 tax threshold relief. They have been calling for that relief threshold to be raised from $3,000 to $10,000, and the right thing would be to support this. It is identified in my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12127551" Type="4">C-310</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Will the government support what is really a small token given the inflationary costs and the costs on firefighters? They are being stretched to the max.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to stand in this House and speak on this urgent emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let me begin by recognizing the incredibly hard work of firefighters and first responders across the country. They have been on the ground fighting these wildfires for days and weeks, working around the clock to keep their communities safe. Today, and every day, we are deeply grateful for their efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are asking everyone to please keep an emergency kit ready and important documents by the door. If an evacuation is ordered, please follow that direction. If someone has already experienced the unimaginable loss of your home, prized possessions and memories our thoughts are with them. We stand with them at this difficult time and we will continue to work with all partners to ensure everyone affected has the support they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As a society we have used this word a lot the past few years, but Canada is facing a truly unprecedented wildfire season. Over 3.3 million hectares of land have burned across Canada. That is larger than the entire country of Belgium. It is just under six Prince Edward Islands. As of June 4, across the country there are 413 wildfires burning, 249 of them are out of control. There have been 2,214 fires to date. The 10-year average for this time of the year is 1,671 fires.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>We are in constant communication with our federal and provincial partners, including indigenous communities. The impacts on the communities are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText>As we stand ready to support any province and territory that seeks federal funding, including facilitating the movement of firefighters within Canada or from international allies or other federal supports, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, or CIFFC, leads coordination of firefighting support across all jurisdictions in Canada. CIFFC is an independent agency. The federal government supports its work with a $1.2-million annual grant, and NRCan's experts provide data and advice throughout the fire season. This agency has facilitated the movement of hundreds of firefighters and firefighting equipment between provinces and territories so far this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>Firefighting support is also brought in from allies like the United States, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. We have also authorized the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces in three provinces at their request: Alberta, Quebec and Nova Scotia. While their tasks differ slightly depending on each province's identified needs, support includes helping with fire turnover, mop up, hot-spot dousing as well as logistics and planning support. For the jurisdictions that requested it, airlift capacity is also available in case of urgent evacuations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, federal support does not stop there. We are taking a whole-of-government approach to this emergency. When our provincial and territorial counterparts ask for help, it is all hands on deck. Indigenous communities on reserve, which can be particularly vulnerable to wildfires and other natural disasters, are supported during emergencies through Indigenous Services Canada's emergency management assistance program. ISC works with communities on reserve and can help pay for both response and the rebuilding costs incurred when there is a wildfire evacuation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Canadian Coast Guard has made personnel and equipment available. This includes helicopter assistance, as requested and based on asset availability, to transport essential supplies in and out of affected regions, as well as the transportation of people for non-emergency but necessary movement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>ESDC and Service Canada are working hand in hand to ensure those affected by wildfires have access to federal services and benefits. We are prepared to offer emergency contracting support for goods, services and temporary accommodations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Our government has also agreed to match donations made to the Canadian Red Cross's response in Alberta and Nova Scotia and to the United Way's response to the Northwest Territories. With the respective provinces' and territories' support, this means that every dollar will be turned into three for those who need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are just a few examples of the federal resources that have been activated or are ready to respond to provincial and territorial requests. Also, we are always prepared to work with our counterparts to address any gaps that arise and pose a potential risk to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I will note that our work will not end once the fires have been extinguished. Through the disaster financial assistance arrangements, the federal government is able to provide extensive financial support to provincial and territorial governments in the aftermath of large-scale natural disasters. When Fort McMurray experienced the devastating wildfire season in 2016, for example, we provided over $374 million to support the recovery. We are prepared to work with all provinces and territories that seek support through this program as they rebuild.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is an issue that goes beyond partisanship. Excellent work is being done across the country at all levels of government. In this emergency, we are all focused on what matters most: the safety of everyone in Canada. As we move into summer and the rest of wildfire season, we will continue to put Canadians first.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>In my speech, I mentioned the fact that a growing number of experts, including Mike Flannigan, have been calling for the formation of a dedicated firefighting service in Canada; something that would complement what the armed forces do, but people who are specifically trained for this. He suggested maybe 20 teams of 20 each, which is about how many people we bring in from other countries every fire season. I am wondering if the member could comment on that idea, which would be available to all provinces as needed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I want to ask the member a question. She mentioned the term “all hands on deck”, and I think that is the response we have seen in this emergency. However, we also have to recognize that we did not just fall into this. It has been decades in the making. It is a climate crisis that is fuelling these wild fires. It is not one party. We have never had an “all hands on deck” response to this climate crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am usually pleased and honoured to rise in the House to speak. Often, I am called upon to speak to issues of the day. I am always grateful for the opportunity I have to speak out against things that I find unfair and to debate important issues. However, that is not the case tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am not at all happy to give this speech. I am sad, even. I have been very troubled and worried these past few days. I am, of course, talking about the wildfires that are raging across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The wildfires have been the top news story for a few weeks now. The Government of Canada has never seen wildfires so early in the season. All these fires are having an unprecedented impact. If this unfortunate situation keeps up, Canada could see its worst wildfire season on record. All Canadians are worried about these wildfires. They are also worried about what will be left when this is all over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In all, there are 400 active forest fires across Canada right now. Of those 400 fires, 155 are burning in Quebec. The surface area of the forest in Quebec is as large as France. In other words, the vast majority of our province is covered in forests and trees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Let us consider the following: When the province is the victim of Mother Nature and we are struggling with these types of fires, it is a real environmental and human disaster. Fires are burning across the country. I am deeply saddened by this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to talk about the regions of Quebec such as Saguenay and Abitibi that are experiencing the worst of the forest fires. An article on Radio-Canada this morning showed that Abitibi—Témiscamingue is the most affected region in Quebec. Schools will likely have to close tomorrow because the air quality has become too toxic. In fact, I want to commend the work of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> who is leaving this evening for Rouyn-Noranda. Everyone has to pull together in tough times like these.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second most affected region is mine, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. I just came back from a weekend in my riding and people back home are really stressed out. There are currently 30 or so active fires in the region. Some are in my riding, but the majority are in the riding of my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not an easy time for us as MPs, because we feel powerless in the face of disasters that are bigger than us. Citizens are coming to us for help. Sometimes those citizens have lost their homes or had to be evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The first fire to break out in my constituency was in Ferland‑et‑Boileau. As luck would have it, it started the day after celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the local forestry co-op. This small municipality is surrounded by trees, which put the residents particularly at risk. In all, 40 homes had to be evacuated because the situation had become too dangerous. Families were left homeless for several days. It is all very stressful for parents and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The second major fire took place in Rivière‑Éternité, near the Montagne à Adrien, a few days ago. Once again, the forests in this small municipality fell prey to the flames. Approximately 30 residents were evacuated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Furthermore, Marie‑Médiatrice elementary school had to close for the day for safety reasons. Four water bombers and forest firefighters battled the fire for many hours. It was not easy to control the fire on the side of the mountain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>At present, fires are raging in the riding of my Bloc Québécois colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>. A dozen fires are active in the ZEC Des Passes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>No emergency evacuation plan has been implemented, but the ZEC is ready in the event that a state of emergency is declared due to the smoke caused by the fire becoming thicker. The fire, located near Notre‑Dame‑de‑Lorette in Lac‑Saint‑Jean, covers more than 5,600 hectares of forest. It is the largest fire in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The spokesperson for SOPFEU, Josée Poitras, mentioned that this fire is deemed to be “out of control”. This is a great concern but, luckily, this very competent organization provides an update of the situation every hour to limit the damage before intervening directly with methods to stop the destruction, such as fire lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Fortunately, there has been no loss of life reported from the forest fires burning at the moment. That is due to the excellent work of the forest firefighters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to commend them for their bravery and their extraordinary efforts. Of course I would also like to thank SOPFEU, whose mission is to protect the forest as well as the infrastructure. I would also like to once again thank all the personnel who provide assistance to disaster victims and ensure that citizens feel safe, despite the conditions. They are essential and indispensable in these times of crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Not only do fires devastate the vegetation and the wildlife, but they also mess up the air. Air quality in much of the province will be affected. Many schools are having to close their doors, because the situation is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Quebec has requested 480 firefighters, 30 command teams and four water bombers. Ottawa needs to listen to what Quebec is asking for, because our province is in a very bad situation right now. The federal government needs to make an unwavering commitment, and it must be based on what Quebec is asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>To Canadians across the country, I want to remind everyone how important it is to refrain from going into the woods unnecessarily, and especially to not start any fires at home. The danger is real. Everyone needs to appreciate how serious this crisis is and work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague for highlighting how the smoke and the air pollution are impacting people due to fires. In fact, we were just at the all-party climate caucus, where we had representatives of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment. They highlighted that seven million people worldwide, and this is according to the World Health Association, are dying from air pollution. It is rivalling smoking, which is at eight million. It is also contributing to 18% of premature deaths. The impact is severe on human health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We know we have to mitigate climate change, but actually putting out fires quickly is an important role and responsibility in doing that. Does my colleague agree that the federal government needs to ensure that we have equipment so we can tackle these fires quickly?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I think of Coulson Aviation, from my riding, which is fighting fires in Argentina and Australia. It works with the federal governments there to refit their aircraft. We know the Canadian military needs to have the right equipment if it is going to support provinces in need as we see fires pop up in different parts of the country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, we have heard some very good speeches tonight on this important issue. I would like to start by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="278628" Type="2">South Okanagan—West Kootenay</Affiliation> for bringing this forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to make more of a personal comment. I am not the first member of Parliament who has had to deal with wildfires in the riding, but two of the largest wildfires in Nova Scotia are in my riding, and one of them is still out of control. Therefore, I would just like to personalize this a bit with what the last eight days have been like in my province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Going back to Sunday, May 28, two Sundays ago, as members of Parliament, most of us were either flying to Ottawa to come here to do our jobs, as we do every week, or we were preparing, like I was, to leave early on Monday morning. It was late in the afternoon of that Sunday when my phone started to go with an alert that there was a fire and an evacuation going on 10 minutes from my house. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There was a major fire in the community of Tantallon, which I am sure nobody in the House had ever heard of until eight days ago. It is a wonderful community up behind exit 5, as we call it, off the 103. It is the exit where people get off to go to Peggys Cove and St. Margarets Bay. It is a community of families and young families. There are three day cares there. There are a lot of retired folks, including quite a few retired RCMP and Canadian Armed Forces personnel, up there. There is an RCMP detachment in Tantallon, right there by the Sobeys. There is one street in and out of this subdivision, and it has no fire hydrants. On the back of it is the wilderness that is Nova Scotia. It is about a 15-minute drive from downtown Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That day, the wind was about 40 kilometres an hour in Nova Scotia. On the first evening of the evacuation on that Sunday, I went to the newly opened comfort centre in the Black Point fire hall, which is about 30 seconds from my house. It was opened quickly by one of the two volunteer managers of the community centre, Janet Fryday Dorey. As people streamed in, they were really just in a state of shock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I talked to one couple who were sitting on their porch at about 3:30 in the afternoon having a beverage, as people tend to do after they have cut the lawn or done their chores on the weekend. They were sitting there and said that in so-and-so's back yard there was a fire going. Then the fire started to get bigger and within moments it had spread to their house and very quickly, because the winds were 40 kilometres an hour, it spread to the next house. The couple said, “We'd better get out of here”. They quickly got in their car and left. There was a roofer working on a roof next door who saw the fire happening, got off the roof and started to knock on people's doors to get them evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>When they came in, they were saying they did not know what was happening, that their neighbourhood was on fire and they did not know where to go or what they would do. This was not a comfort centre where people could sleep. It did not have showers. Community members started to come in, saying, “I have a room” and “I have a place for somebody to stay if they need it.” People from a couple of local inns in Hubbards came in and said, “If there is anyone who is evacuated, they can stay here for free.” Then food started to arrive. For Nova Scotians and most Canadians, food is the first response to a crisis, and food started to come in so that people had food to eat. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was there until about 11 o'clock at night. I got home when the centre closed. My cellphone rang, and it was the <Affiliation DbId="278903" Type="4">Minister of Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> calling on a Sunday night. On that first night, he phoned me, the local member of Parliament, to ask what was happening from my perspective, which I greatly appreciated. I was still a bit in shock.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I knew there had been a fire starting in the south of my riding two days before. It started around a lake. I also knew that on that same day, 20 minutes down the road in a community called Chester Basin, another fire had started on Beech Hill Road. It was out of control, and the winds were blowing at 40 kilometres an hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This modest fire in Shelburne County on a lake started on Friday night, May 26, at a party on a lake, when a fire was set to keep people warm. It was accelerated by the wind that Sunday and started to spread across the county.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The next morning, the deputy fire chief of Halifax and the Department of National Resources were holding a media briefing to say what was going on. That was in Tantallon for the fire in Tantallon, not the Shelburne one. There were over 100 fire trucks from around the province on the scene in Tantallon, where in the space of two hours, over 16,000 people had been evacuated from their homes and had to find a place to live temporarily. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The fire only got worse on Monday and Tuesday. In Shelburne County, the fire doubled in size every single day. If anyone knows Shelburne County at all, it is the big lobster fishing community in the southern part of my riding. There are two main towns and a lot of villages. The two main towns are the town of the Shelburne and the town of Barrington. This fire spread between the two of them. They are 30 kilometres apart. Over the next few days, half of that county was evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>That fire is still out of control. It has grown to 25,000 hectares, or 65,000 acres. Luckily, we had some rain on the weekend and it has not grown. It grew a bit on Sunday, but it has basically been stable. Some 5,000 to 6,000 people in that community were evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Part of the fire in Halifax spread into the riding of <Affiliation DbId="278131" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, and over 20,000 people were evacuated in Nova Scotia. During the week, while we were fighting the fire in Shelburne, an additional fire began behind the town of Shelburne, and another one in East Pubnico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There were a number of volunteers at the comfort stations. The Red Cross was running the comfort station in Shelburne, and the Salvation Army was feeding and running a station for the firefighters. My lead constituency assistant is a volunteer firefighter and has been fighting this fire every day since it started in the woods. I was back in the woods with them. They brought me back one night. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We had communities shut off. We had firemen shut off. Firemen had to drop their hoses in communities like Clyde River and run for their lives to get on their equipment to escape the speed of this fire. It is feet down in the Earth now. It is a fire we are going to be dealing with in Shelburne County for months and months to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The Halifax fire is 100% contained. There are still about 5,000 people evacuated in Halifax. The amount of work that has to happen to allow the rest to go back is huge in terms of determining safety, determining water quality, because most are on wells, and restoring power. The premier, the minister of emergency preparedness provincially and the federal <Affiliation DbId="278903" Type="4">Minister of Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> have been working well with all of the municipal officials as one team.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is unprecedented. We have never had this happen in Nova Scotia. There was no playbook for dealing with a suburb of Halifax burning at the same time as the largest fire in our province's history in Shelburne County.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I just have to thank all the firefighters and all the first responders, as well as all the volunteers who are still helping to feed the firefighters. I ask for the patience of all those who are still evacuated; I ask them to please not go back until the evacuation orders are lifted. It is not safe. There is no going around it on an ATV or by boat. People will put themselves and others in harm's way if they do that. I ask them to please listen to local officials so we can deal with this as expeditiously as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>I would like to ask the member to give further detail on how Nova Scotia has been handling this. How has the federal government been helping? Can he share some ideas on how we can do this better in the future? We have parts of Canada that do not deal with fire on a daily basis. In the midst of it all, would it be better to have some federal resources to call on immediately? That way we would not have to wait a day or two, as Nova Scotia did, even though we were trying hard.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, that is a great question. In everything, we can always do better, but in this case, because this was so unprecedented, I think things came together fairly well. I heard, and still hear, enormous frustration from residents of my community who ask why all of it did not happen with a faster response. With 40-kilometre-per-hour winds and this thing rolling through like a freight train, it was very difficult to react as quickly as people wanted everyone to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member talked about federal resources. I think that is a great idea. I think one of the things this experience has taught me is that the federal government's role is coordinating and trying to find all the assets that are across the country. Right now, there are not any available. That was a challenge. The federal government should have some ability to have some equipment to add. This is not the first or primary job of the armed forces. We were thankful they could come in, but they are not professional firefighters. They do not have professional firefighting equipment. They do not have water bombers. There were six water bombers that had to come on Friday night from Montana. There were three from Newfoundland and a number from New Brunswick. For Nova Scotia, that will be part of the analysis afterwards. It needs to have a little more ability. I think it is an important area we should be looking at from the federal government to see what kind of resources we could have available more permanently.</ParaText>

I would like to offer the opportunity for the member to talk about any other advice he would like to give Canadians who may be watching, in terms of safety advice, whether it be with respect to camping season or avoiding having open fires. Is there any advice he would like to give others, as we are seeing wildfires across Canada, to prevent a situation similar to what his riding is facing?</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, when we have no-burn rules that have come from our provincial governments, saying that people should not burn, or should be very cautious when we have dry seasons like we have, people should not think they can control the fire because they are someone special. That seems to still happen in Nova Scotia during all of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>These are ridings that rely on their own water, their own wells and septic systems. When people go back, they cannot drink the water; they have to have it tested. The provincial government of Nova Scotia is going to be providing, starting tomorrow, free water testing to make sure that, when people go back, that gets done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Primarily, people need to think about what they do on their own property. They need to make sure it is clean so there is not material there to catch fire. Most important, I ask people, when we are in this type of situation, to please not be lighting even local campfires or local bonfires at night just because they think they can control them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to once again thank my colleague, who is far too humble, in my opinion. Naturally, we are grateful to local authorities, the provinces and everyone who is pulling together right now, but to see a member become involved this way too is unusual. Of course, we are there for our constituents, to reassure them, or at least to try. That is part of our role. However, I think the member's involvement in this case is of a different order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I would like to express my support for everyone affected across the country. We are talking about more than 26,000 evacuees at the present time. The situation is extremely fluid. I think that all members who have risen to speak this evening have reported different figures on the number of fires and on the number of fires currently burning out of control, simply because the situation is changing so very quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>The teams in the field, local authorities, firefighters, the provinces and the federal government, which agreed to help the provinces that ask for it, all deserve our acknowledgement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Early last week, we saw Quebec fire crews lending a helping hand out west. Now we have to bring those people back home because we need to have as many resources as possible all over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am starting to look at websites that show a map of Canada and what is happening everywhere. There is data on air quality. What we are going through right now is extremely worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I really want to give all my support to the people affected. I am thinking especially about my colleague from the north shore, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation>, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278351" Type="2">Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou</Affiliation> and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>, who is going home tonight to be with his constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I commend them because when we go through times like this, we wonder a bit about what our role is. It is obviously not always easy. When Quebec was first affected, the Quebec government was in charge of the situation along with SOPFEU and local authorities. As federal members, we were asking what we should be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Not long ago, a tragedy occurred in my riding and civilians were killed. We wondered what we could do in that type of situation. We do not want to hinder the authorities who are doing their job, but it is important that we be there to reassure people and inform them of the information that must be passed on. That is what my colleague was doing before me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I believe that it is important to repeat messages. I was reading about the potential causes of fires. I know that some are caused by lightning, but we must also mention open air fires and cigarette butts that could be thrown out and start fires. I believe that these messages bear repeating; we also need to make clear that no one should try to be braver than the others, that we should let professionals handle the situation and that we should follow the authorities' instructions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I think our role is to be there for our constituents, so I would like to salute the work of my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois and across the country. I know that many members are affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I want to reiterate my gratitude to the <Affiliation DbId="278903" Type="4">Minister of Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> and his staff. They have been working hard to keep us, the critics for public safety and emergency preparedness, informed of the situation. They told us from the outset that they were going to communicate directly with the MPs affected, because it was important for them to know what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I have worked with a number of ministers in the House since 2019. I really want to emphasize that collaboration with the Minister of Emergency Preparedness is always impeccable. It is good to see this level of cross-party collaboration. We can set politics aside in these situations. I think the affected citizens deserve nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is it important to have this debate tonight? Of course it is. It is urgent. This situation must be discussed and solutions must be found. As I was saying, most members are out on the ground. Afterwards, they will be able to come back and give us their assessment of the situation. They will have seen first-hand the resources mobilized. They will know what additional resources are needed and what should have been done better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know I am not allowed refer to the presence of members in the House, but I am glad to see that the people who have to work on this are doing so while we are discussing it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="30">(2330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>I do not know what will come of this debate tonight. We certainly need to talk about it. I am talking about Quebec's experience. Until there is evidence to the contrary, we saw that the federal response was quite quick once the request was made. Are we going to run out of resources? That may be the case. We have to ask ourselves these questions. I think there is a contingency plan under way. We need to ensure we have these resources, particularly given that the Premier of Quebec pointed out this afternoon that the situation is likely to continue throughout the summer. Approximately 3.3 million hectares of forest have burned down so far. That is far more than the ten-year average. Normally, it is about 260,000 hectares. That is worrying. We need to make sure we have the necessary resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I think we need to take stock and understand the root cause of all this. Obviously, there is the inevitable link with global warming. We have to ask ourselves these questions. Today may not be the right day for that. The Bloc Québécois feels that the priority is putting out the fires and making sure we have the resources on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am going to talk more specifically about the situation in Quebec, and my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> will provide a more detailed description of what is happening in his region. I can speak on behalf of my colleague from the north shore, who went to be with her constituents on the ground as soon as she heard that residents of Sept‑Îles were being evacuated. The situation is extremely worrisome. We are talking about two fires that are very close to each other and are surrounding the city of Sept‑Îles. I was told that the wind was out of the southeast but that, if the wind changes, then the whole city could be destroyed. Obviously, that is very worrisome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I often hear my colleague from the north shore talking about the importance of breaking the isolation of that area. I would imagine that it takes a situation like this to realize how important it is to do that. When we look at the situation that people from the north shore are currently facing, we see that they have a forest on one side, where the wildfires are burning, the ocean on the other side, and the Touzel bridge, which is currently damaged. They are a bit trapped. People are being evacuated by air, mainly for medical reasons. Supplies are going to be sent in to people in some communities that are also somewhat trapped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We should be asking important questions about these heavily forested regions, which may be more affected than others. I was saying earlier, in response to a speech by my colleague, that the majority of indigenous communities live in forested or wooded regions. They inevitably become the first victims of this growing phenomenon. What are we as elected members doing to protect these communities?</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I understand that fire crews are currently focusing on the out-of-control fires that are closest to inhabited communities, and we can understand what that is urgent. However, seeing the photos, the images of fires that are devastating hundreds of square kilometres of forest, makes me very sad. Obviously, the priority is human beings, but it is still shocking to see how much of the forest has been obliterated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today, I travelled from my riding to Ottawa. I live just on the other side of the north shore, so I expected the air back home to be thickly contaminated. It was not too bad. Oddly, the closer I got to Montreal and the Outaouais region, the heavier the smog became. Now, even the people living in communities that are nowhere near the fires cannot say that they are unaware of the situation and unaffected by what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>My colleague was showing me a map of his riding. The fires are closing in. For some communities, it is only a matter of time before the fires reach them. Obviously, this is worrying. More than 780 international firefighters have been or will be deployed on the ground. President Macron will be sending approximately 100 firefighters and fire experts, particularly to Sept-Îles on the north shore. Firefighters have come from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The Canadian Armed Forces have also deployed soldiers and military personnel to lend a hand. The scale of the situation is obvious. I hope we are ready to face what is coming.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, that is exactly what I was saying earlier. The people of the north shore are practically stranded by the fire. They have the forest on one side and the sea on the other. The Touzel bridge has been closed for other reasons since last week, and the Rio Tinto rail line that runs north has also been damaged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was talking earlier about opening up the region. We are going to have to adapt our infrastructure, even in remote regions. It is just wrong that such a large community would have no emergency exits. I often say that my riding is big, at 15,000 square kilometres, but Manicouagan is a different story. It is immense. These people could find themselves completely cut off. It just does not make sense. Investment in this infrastructure absolutely must be considered right away, since it really should have been done long ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I thank my dear colleague, the member for Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia. She speaks the truth, as always. There is just a slight difference between us, or maybe not. I am talking about the new normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are currently seeing a global temperature increase of 1.1 degrees Celsius. We need to avoid an increase of 2 degrees and, if possible, keep it at 1.5 degrees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I do not think this is a new normal, but the writing is on the wall. We are now in a situation where it is almost impossible to imagine that we can keep it at 1.5 degrees. We are already at 1.1 degrees. I think that in the future, we will look back wistfully on the summer of 2023.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, it is always daunting to answer a question on the environment and climate change from my colleague, who knows so much about the subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was talking about climate change adaptation and mitigation earlier. Unfortunately, some changes are already at a critical point, already irreversible, and we are going to have to live with that, unfortunately. As she said, we may have missed the boat on temperature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Is Canada's climate change plan enough? Certainly not. Are the plans of other major countries sufficient? Certainly not. We should have done better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Now we are at the adaptation stage. What are we doing to adapt to these new realities? Earlier, we were talking about adapting infrastructure. Some essential infrastructure is under threat. There is certainly more to be done in this area.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to a subject that is vitally important to my region of Abitibi—Témiscamingue and all areas of northern Quebec that are dealing with raging wildfires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As my colleague mentioned, I am going to get back on the road following this evening's debate. It made sense for me to be here today. It gave me an opportunity to talk to many members, particularly on the government side, who are stepping up. I think that enhances the work that we can do as elected officials, and I thank them for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I stand before my colleagues with a heavy heart and a deep sadness to talk about the areas that have been ravaged by fire and the people who live there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Many of the fires were caused by lightning, but human activity also contributed to the situation. The fire, which has a mind of its own, is laying to waste our peaceful forests, leaving in its wake widespread destruction reminiscent of an apocalyptic movie. One need only look at the photos of cities in Abitibi—Témiscamingue, northern Quebec, the north shore or Lac-Saint-Jean, where the sun is hidden behind a haze of smoke and where you can smell wood burning a hundred kilometres away from the affected areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In these areas, where nature is lush and vibrant, there are now only ashes or burning memories. The majestic forests that shelter an incredible diversity of animal and plant species will be reduced to blackened stumps and silent cries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>There is something far more precious than the trees and flowers that have been ravaged by the flames: the human lives that have been affected by this tragedy. After being evacuated, many families are waiting to find out whether their home and their belongings avoided the worst. Many people are waiting to find out whether the lands filled with their memories will still be there after the fires have gone or whether loved ones will be affected. Lives have been disrupted, dreams are now on hold. My thoughts are with the Clova community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Through the darkness of the smoke, the light of solidarity has guided us. The people of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, of the north shore and of every region in Quebec stand together. The people of these regions have joined forces to face adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Firefighters are on the front lines. They are fighting fires, facing the flames and prepared to fight to save communities. Volunteers are working alongside them. Armed with machinery and backhoes, they are putting their know-how at the service of their community. Thousands of unknown heroes are volunteering without expecting anything in return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Police officers, first responders, municipal authorities and SOPFEU are there. They are making preparations and assessing the risks. They support one another to protect people's assets and ensure everyone's safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>In addition, there are all the people in the community who are helping out, offering land, housing, food or a cot. They are ready to lend a helping hand to save animals, especially in farming areas, by working together, supporting each other and sharing tears, suffering and worries. The solidarity of Quebec regions is a source of inspiration to us all. This solidarity will continue to be essential for our communities until the last fire threatening them is put out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I would like to take this opportunity to provide an update on the situation back home in Abitibi—Témiscamingue. When a disaster of this magnitude occurs, information is often hard to come by. I would like to salute my brother Philippe, who is a regional director with the Quebec department of transport. He was able to reassure me on certain points and give me the facts, which is always important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>An important meeting was held yesterday under the leadership of the Conference of Prefects of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Sébastien D'Astous, the mayor of Amos and prefect of the Abitibi RCM. Also at the meeting was Danielle Guimond from Quebec's public safety department, which was reassuring. However, this meeting also made us realize the amount of work that needs to be done on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, I want to recognize the work being done by SOPFEU, and especially Sylvain Labelle, who coordinates its operations. There is also the Abitibi-Ouest RCM and its prefect, Jaclin Bégin, as well as Norman Lagrange, who was on the ground to set up one of the camps in La Sarre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Today my colleagues may have heard for the first time in their lives the names of the towns of Normétal and Val-Paradis. Both communities were threatened by the flames and had to be evacuated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I also want to commend all the elected officials in Abitibi—Témiscamingue who are rallying together, particularly my provincial counterpart Suzanne Blais, the MNA for Abitibi-Ouest, with whom I have had discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The real work will begin once these fires are put out. Many forest communities may have seen their livelihoods disappear. Nearly 3.3 million hectares of forest have been decimated in Canada. This will require an inner strength that will be seriously put to the test.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="45">(2345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText>Solidarity will guide us once again. We will have to rebuild what was lost and heal the wounds. The regions devastated by fire will need us to help them rebuild and restore hope. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must invest in fire prevention, improve early warning systems and strengthen safety measures. We must also redouble our efforts to fight climate change and climate deregulation, which increase the frequency and intensity of these natural disasters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This has a major economic impact. Who knows what the flames will have devoured in our communities or what road or rail infrastructure has been affected? I am thinking of the north shore. Just think about the serious impact that the destruction of fibre optic infrastructure alone has on communication with the rest of the world at a time when people need information. We cannot imagine what an impact that can have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this will take time, effort and, most importantly, money. I know that the governments will step up. The economy of the regions will depend on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We must show empathy and compassion to those who have been affected by this tragedy. We must reach out to them, give them our support and comfort. Together, we can heal the wounds, rebuild homes and help communities get back their joie de vivre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One thing is certain: The forest will need our help the most. It contributes to our economy and our environment. My region centres on outdoor activities, outfitting operations and forestry. The forest has always been resilient, but this time, it may need some help. It is up to all of us to contribute. We need to replant trees, while respecting the principles of sustainable forestry management. Let us remember one thing: Out of the ashes of these apocalyptic scenes, a seedling will emerge, its branches held high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>This is not the first time our forests have been through such an ordeal. I am thinking about a squat little cedar tree on the islands in Lake Abitibi in Duparquet. It has witnessed much history, being more than a thousand years old. It has pretty much seen it all, from climate change and forest fires to the arrival of settlers in Abitibi—Témiscamingue, all the way back to the coming of the Anishinabe first nations. It still stands there, proud and tall, just as Quebeckers in our region will stand proud and tall after this difficult time, ready to rebuild and ready to reforest to help our Quebec continue to prosper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As I have a little bit of time left, I will continue to name those involved. The armed forces are making a difference in our communities, especially the soldiers from Valcartier who have been mobilized. The Union des producteurs agricoles has made itself available to the people who have been asked to support the cattle that are particularly affected in Abitibi-Ouest and to try to find refuge. There may be some assistance in that regard. Due to the lack of resources in small municipalities, they will require a helping hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Once again, I want to salute the excellent work of SOPFEU. I want to point out the excellent work of my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation>, who was a source of inspiration in the current situation. In Abitibi—Témiscamingue, I feel somewhat like the little white house in Lac-Saint-Jean on the weekend. It is as though the entire neighbourhood was burning, but only my house was unaffected. We could smell the forest fire in Larder Lake in Rouyn‑Noranda, which is about one hundred kilometres away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>Of course, when speaking of Chapais and Lebel‑sur‑Quévillon, there is everything that is happening in the riding of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278351" Type="2">Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou</Affiliation>. The fire was 500 metres from the Nordic Kraft mill and could have had devastating consequences given all the potential explosive products on site. </ParaText>
              <ParaText>There are the indigenous Anishinabe communities of Lac‑Simon and Kitcisakik; Louvicourt, which is the gateway from Abitibi—Témiscamingue to the rest of Quebec; Val‑d'Or, which has had evacuation alerts; the people of Normétal and their mayor, Ghislain Desbiens, who have had to mobilize; Saint‑Lambert also had an alert; Saint‑Dominique‑du‑Rosaire and its mayor, Christian Legault, whom I would like to acknowledge and to whom I spoke briefly today, where fires broke out and were quickly brought under control; La Reine and Fanny Dupras, with whom I have frequent discussions. I want to say thank you and bravo for their resilience and for welcoming the SOPFEU teams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>All of this unimaginable work is being done in collaboration. Solidarity remains perhaps the most important value under the circumstances.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Today, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about people in Alberta, of course, my home province, and certainly about the indigenous groups in northern Alberta, such as Chief Adam and the group in Fort Chipewyan. We know that people in remote communities, indigenous communities, are much more at risk for wildfires due to their location. I wonder if the member could speak a bit to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I know my colleague brought up, earlier, the idea of FireSmart programming and ways we can prepare our communities for forest fires. I wonder if he could speak to that a little more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText>Madam Chair, what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>'s community and that of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> are going through right now is very similar to mine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>One of the experiences I had, and it was not a good time but a very difficult time in the community of Shelburne, was that, when the lobster season was ending, I asked the government if it would extend the lobster season to get the traps out of the waters because the lobster fishermen were most of the volunteer firefighters, and they were also evacuated from their homes, so they could not get to their boats and could not get on the water. The government accommodated that and continues to accommodate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I was behind the lines with the volunteer firefighters. Most of our firefighters in rural Canada are volunteers. They are putting in 18-hour days around the clock to try to deal with this, and for the rest of the day, they are sleeping at the fire station where they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I am wondering if the member for <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> could share with us any of what he is hearing about the role of the volunteer firefighters in his community and that of <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation> and other communities in Quebec.</ParaText>

As I said, I am going to hit the road so I can become the man on the ground that he has been for the people back home in his riding. He gave us several examples, including the lobster industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>I see a broader issue here. It is about decentralization. Why can the people themselves not be the ones to decide on the ownership of their resource, in order to ensure its sustainable development? Why can they not be the ones to decide when the season is, based on community priorities and the sustainable management of the stock? I see this as a critical aspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The member has reminded us of the human element, of the people who are risking their lives and working such long hours. They will go to the front, literally, and leave their families to help others. I sincerely appreciate them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>The international community is also helping. I mentioned that in an earlier speech. There are people coming from France, the United States, Portugal and South America.

              <ParaText>Madam Speaker, I appreciate my two minutes to speak to this emergency debate on the wildfires, and I appreciate all of my colleagues here tonight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>We are taking up a debate that operates at two levels. We have spent most of this debate on the first level, and that is appropriate. That first level is the immediate, the now. It is what we have just gone through, which is not over yet. As my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> pointed out, the idea of forest fires raging in areas of Nova Scotia, my home province, where the month of May is not known to be hot and dry but rather cold, miserable and very rainy, is so unknown to a Nova Scotian that it is rather chilling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>As my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> said earlier tonight, the fire is deep, several feet underground still. That is the immediate. That is the now. That is knowing that over the last 10 years in this country, the month of May has had an average area burnt of 150,000 hectares. The last 10 years have already been affected by global warming, so if we were to go back 100 years, it would have been less. This month, May 2023, saw in excess of two million hectares burnt. That is the immediate. That is the now. That is the courage of the firefighters we salute. That is the patience and forbearance of people who leave their homes without question, get to safety and do it in an orderly fashion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText>However, I think we also know that right now we are at the very edge of being too late on the larger question of the climate emergency. This place voted that we were in a climate emergency on June 18, 2019. That same year, Greta Thunberg used fire as the analogy that should have caused our generation and our leaders to do what was required to avoid getting to this point. As she said, “Our house is on fire.... I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.”</ParaText>
