              <ParaText id="8784875"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honour a remarkable individual, Barry Janyk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784876">Barry served as mayor of the town of Gibsons for four terms, from 1999 to 2011. Known for his smile, humour and infectious spirit, he was beloved by those who had the pleasure of knowing him. He was a pioneer in advancing smart growth for Gibsons. He spearheaded the development of parks throughout the town, supported the creation of Tetrahedron Provincial Park and got Gibsons' drinking water recognized as the best in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784877">As a skilled pilot, environmental advocate who got stuff done and devoted father, Barry's impact was far-reaching. From being an extra in <I>The Beachcombers</I> to working to engage and lead the community, his story is part of the fabric of Gibsons. Barry's legacy lives on in every park, in every initiative and in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784878">In this difficult time, our thoughts are with his loving wife, Jane; his three kids, Kohlby, Roen and Garnet; his many friends; and the entire community of Gibsons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784879">Mr. Speaker, after nine years, Canadians are paying the price for the NDP-Liberals' economic vandalism. The carbon tax and job-killing oil and gas cap hurt rural people and non-profits the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784880">The Dewberry Agricultural Society paid over $5,000 in carbon taxes in just six months and cannot afford to heat its hockey rink much longer. The NDP-Liberals said small business owners are tax cheats. The reckless capital gains tax hike and shameless, temporary two-month tax trick prove it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784881"> Sheryl, an accountant from Vegreville, says the tax hike will slash nearly 10% of savings when owners sell their life's work and the labours of love they rely on for their retirement. Ron from Glendon says the cost to switch his store's items to be GST-exempt and back could cripple his business at the most important time of year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784882">Canada's promise is that anyone from anywhere can work hard for a powerful paycheque and pension, living in safe and healthy communities, but the NDP-Liberals broke it. Common-sense Conservatives will restore it, axe the tax, spike the hike and turn hurt into hope for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784883"> Mr. Speaker, this Christmas season, our Catholic community here in Canada and around the world was blessed to begin this period of prayer and preparation for the arrival of Jesus Christ at the heart of St. Peter's Basilica, when Pope Francis inducted 21 new members into the College of Cardinals. Among them was one of our very own, His Eminence Cardinal Frank Leo of the Archdiocese of Toronto. It was a proud moment for Canadian Catholics and for our proud Italian Canadian community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784884">Born in Montreal to immigrant Italian parents, Cardinal Leo is one of the youngest cardinals serving the Holy Mother Church and courageously shepherding Christ's flock. As he witnesses the Church in today's world, Cardinal Leo finds strength in prayer; he anticipates that “the Lord wants to pour out generously into our hearts many graces”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784885">May this sacred moment inspire us to live with renewed purpose and generosity throughout the Christmas season and the upcoming Jubilee 2025, declared by Pope Francis. I send my congratulations to Cardinal Leo and our entire Catholic community. <I>Buon Natale</I> and merry Christmas to everyone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784887">With those words, a small group of artists launched an artistic and social revolution in 1948, laying the foundations for what would become modern-day Quebec. The <I>Refus global</I> is perhaps one of the most fundamental texts when it comes to understanding today's Quebec. The manifesto, which was signed by Paul‑Émile Borduas and co-signed by the group of artists known as the “automatistes”, calls for an end to fear, freedom from the oppression of religion and the joyful fulfilment of our fierce desire for freedom. Under Borduas's name, we see the name of Madeleine Arbour, who has just left us at the venerable age of 101. Madeleine Arbour was an extraordinary painter, a brilliant visual and design artist, a set designer, notably for Duceppe, and a teacher, who spent her whole life helping to make Quebec a more beautiful and caring place. She was one of the last surviving signatories of the <I>Refus global</I> manifesto. We owe an immeasurable debt to these men and women. They are the builders of an identity, the liberators of a people and the founders of today's Quebec. The Quebec nation is grateful to this great woman. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784889">Myles and I were talking about how our Liberal government is making life more affordable and how people have been lifted out of poverty.

              <ParaText id="8784898">Fortunately, Earl and his family have had many champions, such as my constituent Ashleigh Mitchell, who is working hard to draw awareness to this important cause. The Alzheimer Society of Manitoba and other organizations, alongside individuals such as Ashleigh, continue to serve as wonderful advocates and resources. I rise today in honour of their work to draw attention to this plight facing tens of thousands of Canadians across the country and to encourage all of us to elevate the conversation so that, together, we can support families, individuals and our communities alike in the face of these challenges. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784913">Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois and his members voted against this common-sense plan. That is what the “Liberal Bloc” is all about, specifically, voting with the Liberal government and blocking help for young families. However, the CMHC boss said that if the cost to build new housing units could be brought down, that would certainly encourage more construction. Despite that, the leader of the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals oppose our plan. A good Conservative government cannot come soon enough.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784915"> This news is more than a recognition of academic excellence; it also highlights the university's role in empowering northern communities through innovative education and research driven by local priorities such as climate change and health. The achievement will open new doors for collaboration, reconciliation and knowledge sharing, positioning Yukon University to better serve its students and its community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784916">Congratulations to President Brown, Chancellor Geddes and all the dedicated staff and students at Yukon University. Here is to their continued success and to the unique impact they will make as a university in the years to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8784920">Mr. Speaker, a recent report issued by Women's Shelters Canada has found that the crisis in affordable housing is impacting women's shelters across Canada and putting women's lives at risk. As the executive director of Women's Shelters Canada explained, “Since there's no affordable housing, women are staying in shelters longer...new women can't move in if women already in shelter have nowhere to go.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784921"> The lack of affordable housing is so acute that half the women who are needing shelter are having to return to live with their abusers because they will otherwise become homeless. Access to affordable housing is a matter of life or death. Women's shelters are at capacity. There is nowhere to go. It does not have to be this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8784922"> In Alberta, the Canada housing benefit for survivors of gender-based violence was announced in mid-April and ran out of funds in August. The federal government must step up and provide more funding to women's shelters, to the housing benefit program, to the building of transitional housing and to non-market and co-operative housing initiatives, in order to create real options for women who are at risk.</ParaText>

Last time they were in office, they cut 1,100 workers from the CBSA who were there to prevent illegal guns flowing in from the United States.</ParaText>

He has had to give an amnesty to reverse all of the announced gun bans that he did, standing in front of a cartoon image of a scary Hollywood-style gun. What has been the sum total of all of this?

We have banned assault-style weapons and already we have seen thousands of assault-style weapons collected and destroyed.

They would re-legalize assault-style weapons in this country and unfreeze the market on handguns.

              <ParaText id="8785175">In her intervention, the member claimed that before and during the taking of the last recorded division on Thursday, November 28, the disorderly behaviour of many Conservative Party members reached an unacceptable level. She alleged that members were disruptive to the point where she and her colleagues could not hear their names being called by the table officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785176"> Furthermore, she indicated that her caucus had, prior to the vote, alerted the Chair and the Table to the possibility of intentional disruptions because of what she felt was inappropriate behaviour in the shared opposition lobby. This made it difficult for her to carry out her duties as the deputy House leader for the NDP and constituted a breach of privilege and even a contempt. The member described the behaviour of the Conservative Party members both in the House and in the lobby as unacceptable, toxic and designed to intimidate other members as they carried out their parliamentary duties. </ParaText>

In addition to commenting on the lack of decorum during the vote, he alluded to what he considered as other objectionable behaviours by some Conservative Party members, whom he accused of being inebriated, and reminded the House that the party whips are responsible for ensuring a safe workplace that is free of harassment for members and employees who work with them.</ParaText>

He detailed the events of the evening in question as he saw them, stating that it was the members of the New Democratic Party who acted in a harassing manner toward members and staff of the Conservative Party. He argued that if any contempt occurred, it was a result of the behaviour of New Democratic Party members, who stormed up the aisle to confront the Chair at the adjournment of the House and then approached the Conservative benches to confront some other members. He therefore requested that the member for London—Fanshawe withdraw her question of privilege. </ParaText>

I would add that the adjournment of the House should also happen in an orderly fashion and that approaching the Chair or the seats of one's colleagues to carry on arguments is not helpful or conducive to a respectful atmosphere. While the House had technically adjourned when such events took place on the night in question, the repercussions of these actions have a negative impact on the manner in which the House operates.</ParaText>

The lack of decorum and noisy disruptions experienced that evening do not meet the expectations Canadians have of us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8785195">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> equated the events to interfering with her ability to carry out her parliamentary duties. While I understand the member's concerns, I cannot conclude that it resulted in any member not being able to vote or participate in proceedings.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8785196">Therefore, I cannot agree that the member was interfered with in the performance of her parliamentary duties. What happened that night was clearly a breach of decorum. I do not excuse this or seek to normalize it, but I am not aware of any precedents where incidents of this nature rose to matters of contempt or breaches of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785197">I nonetheless take concerns about harassment and intimidation very seriously. While moments of strong disagreement and political tension are common in this place, there is still an expectation that we, as elected officials, treat each other with civility and respect. Apart from being a deliberative and law-making body, the House is also a workplace. In addition to members, employees of the House administration and staff from political parties themselves support within these august walls our parliamentary democracy. They are all entitled to a safe working environment at all times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785198">The Chair believes that these concerns warrant, at a minimum, a discussion between the whips. They, and in fact any member voluntarily seeking productive solutions to conflicts, may explore available support options provided by the House administration to help mediate this situation.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8785199">Before closing, I would like to point out that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs is currently conducting a study on the issue of harassment. This study arguably already provides the remedy the member for <Affiliation DbId="278292" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> seeks, namely, referring the matter of harassment and intimidation to that committee. The counterpoints raised by the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader for the official opposition</Affiliation> could also fit within the committee's existing study.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8785200">Moving forward, as Speaker, I have strong expectations that the whips will address the matter in a serious and timely way. Of all the workplaces in Canada, the House of Commons, as the heart of our democracy, should serve as a role model. Members are passionate in defending their views, and this can bring vigorous debates in the House. However, when away from the cameras, we are all colleagues and we should all work together to ensure a productive and safe workplace for not only ourselves but also our staff and all those who support us in this great place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785201">Notwithstanding the seriousness of the matter raised, I cannot find that this constitutes a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>

The petition has been signed by over 500 people from across Canada and was initiated by Jade Dulle, a mental health advocate who biked across Canada this summer to hear from people who have lived experiences with mental health challenges and to raise awareness about barriers to mental health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785276">The petitioners highlight the prevalence of mental health disorders in Canada and the lack of a national framework for mental health care. They are also calling on the Government of Canada to collaborate with the provinces and territories to finally develop a universal mental health care system that would ensure all Canadians receive support for their mental health concerns and to commit to adequate federal funding to facilitate its successful implementation.</ParaText>

In November 2020, the Special Committee on Poverty in PEI recommended immediate negotiations with the Government of Canada to implement a basic income guarantee demonstration project for Prince Edward Island. This particular idea has the full support of all the political parties on Prince Edward Island. It would be of significant benefit to Canada, as poverty is a social determinant of health.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785286">Mr. Speaker, through budget 2021, the Government of Canada is investing more than $27 billion over five years (2021-22 through 2025-26) to build a Canada-wide early learning and child care, ELCC, system with provinces and territories, PTs. When combined with other investments, including in indigenous early learning and child care, IELCC, up to $30 billion will be invested in support of ELCC over the same period. The goal is for families in Canada to have access to regulated ELCC for an average cost of $10 a day by March 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785287">On March 27, 2022, the governments of Canada and Ontario entered into the mutually agreed-upon Canada–Ontario Canada-wide early learning and child care agreement to deliver on average $10-a-day child care for Ontario families by the end of March 2026 and support the creation of 86,000 new licensed spaces by the end of 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785288">As per section 2.1 of the agreement, Canada and Ontario committed to a number of objectives and targets related to access to ELCC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785289">Ontario commits to using federal funding to increase the net number of licensed spaces for children under age six by flowing funds by the end of fiscal year 2025-26 to support the creation of 76,700 spaces, from 2019 levels, by March 31, 2026, and 86,000 child care spaces, from 2019 levels, by December 31, 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785290">In creating these child care spaces, Ontario commits that federal funding will be exclusively used to support licensed child care and that federal funding will be used predominantly to support the creation of not-for-profit child care spaces to ensure that the existing proportion of not-for-profit licensed child care spaces for children age 0 to 5 will be maintained or increased by the end of this agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785291">For further clarity, at the end of this agreement, the proportion of not-for-profit licensed child care spaces for children age 0 to 5 compared to the total number of licensed child care spaces for children age 0 to 5 will be 70% or higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785292">In addition, as noted by the Government of Ontario in its March 28, 2022, news release announcing the Canada-wide agreement, the agreement includes the “protection of all for-profit and non-profit child care spaces, helping to support predominantly female entrepreneurs across the province who provide high-quality child care services.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785293">Ontario will receive approximately $10.2 billion in federal investments to support its commitments as per the agreement, including commitments to support the creation of 76,700 new affordable child care spaces and lower child care fees to an average of $10 a day by March 2026, and creating a total of 86,000 spaces by December 31, 2026. This $10.2 billion of federal funding is in addition to other federal investments such as approximately $765 million through the Canada-Ontario early learning and child care agreement, 2021 to 2025; close to $150 million through the Canada-Ontario early childhood workforce funding agreement, 2021 to 2022; and over $135 million through the 2023-26 Canada-Ontario ELCC infrastructure agreement. In total, Ontario is scheduled to receive over $11.3 billion in federal funding between 2021-22 to 2025-26 to support child care in the province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785294">On August 15, the Government of Ontario announced a new parent fee cap of $22 a day along with a new cost-based funding formula for child care operators enrolled in the Canada-wide ELCC system, both of which will come into effect in January 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785295">On October 21, Jill Dunlop, Ontario Minister of Education, wrote to the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development to note the high interest of for-profit providers in some service system managers in Ontario to join the Canada-wide ELCC system. In this letter, Minister Dunlop highlighted challenges in creating child care spaces in particular regions due to the 70-30 ratio of not-for-profit to for-profit spaces that Ontario committed to uphold in the Canada-Ontario Canada-wide ELCC agreement. The Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario are in ongoing discussions to support the successful implementation of the Canada-wide ELCC agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785296">Canada-wide ELCC agreements predominantly support not-for-profit, public and family-based child care providers, but given the unique ELCC landscape in each province and territory, the Government of Canada recognizes that licensed for-profit providers also play a role. Provincial and territorial early learning and child care systems vary in terms of the proportion of ELCC spaces that are not-for-profit or for-profit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785297">While Ontario and Canada agreed to keep the proportion of not-for-profit child care spaces at 70% or higher, in New Brunswick, the ratio of for-profit providers is higher than not-for-profit. Under the Canada-New Brunswick Canada-wide ELCC agreement, New Brunswick committed to creating predominantly not-for-profit child care spaces, e.g. 2,000 of the 3,400 spaces to be created. All new child care spaces created are part of the province’s designation system, which ensures high quality standards and includes a market fee threshold to control fees charged to parents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785298">Due to the high demand and challenges faced in creating not-for-profit child care spaces in rural areas and in francophone settings in New Brunswick, additional flexibility was agreed to, allowing for the creation of a limited number of additional designated spaces in the for-profit sector in rural areas and francophone settings and as part of New Brunswick’s target to create 3,400 designated child care spaces by March 2026, as per the Canada-New Brunswick Canada-wide ELCC agreement. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785310">With regard to parts (o) to (q), CSC does not have estimations for the current market value of these buildings. The market values are only determined during the disposal process, lease or sale, and there are no disposals currently planned for these buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785311">With regard to part (r), since 2022, the work completed at the steel-clad structure includes the repair of the roof penetrations, power washing and disinfection of the building, replacement of the overhead doors, repairs of the stairwell retaining wall, LED light upgrades of outside wall packs, emergency light and exit signs upgrades, replacement of the interior steel door, replacement of the door and lock hardware, an accessibility study, replacement of the building heaters, replacement of the plumbing fixtures.

              <ParaText id="8785350"> Mr. Speaker, that was probably the longest petitions segment we have had in a long time, but I am glad everybody had a chance to deliver petitions signed by their constituents, or signed by their EDAs. Some of our friends across the way probably put them together, but nonetheless, who am I to judge?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785351">Why are we here? We are here once again talking about SDTC, the Liberal green slush fund. I think this is the third time I have had a chance to speak to this. Every time we get a chance to speak to this, we go back into our ridings and we hear more anger and frustration from our constituents regarding the NDP-Liberal government. I will just warn the Speaker that he is probably going to get a lot of points of order from our friends down along the way. I see my friend, another B.C. counterpart from the NDP down there, who likes to filibuster. He likes to take up a lot of the Conservatives' time and protest all the time about all the bad stuff that us Conservatives do, yet he has propped up the government for four years now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785352">The NDP-Liberal government has now frozen the business of the House for weeks because of its green slush fund scandal. We have been unable to deal with any of the pressing issues facing Canadians, because it refuses to release the documents, the unredacted documents, detailing over $400 million of taxpayer funds that were handed to Liberal insiders. That is the honest to goodness truth. There were over 186 conflicts of interest. A senior civil servant slammed the Liberal government's outright incompetence. The Auditor General said that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> did not sufficiently monitor contracts given to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785353">As a matter of fact, the chair of SDTC directed funds right to her own organization. That is what we are talking about today. That is what we have been talking about for the last weeks, or months, really. It is shocking. I have been a member of Parliament for nine years, and I was elected during the sunny ways campaign, where the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> stood before Canadians and said that when he was Prime Minister, his government would follow the law and be the most open government in the history of our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785354">What have we seen is scandal after scandal after scandal. What is shocking to me is how the NDP just fell in line with the Liberals and have really carried the water for them many times. It is always funny when pieces of legislation come before the House and we hear, “Just get it to committee. We will do good work at committee and everybody can have a say in it.” What we have seen over the last four years, whether it is with the WE scandal, SDTC or so many more, is that the NDP has carried the water for the corrupt Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785355">New Democrats stand up and like to be holier than thou and very sanctimonious in their deliberations and interventions. They say, “How dare they?” Their <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> puffs up his chest and says, “I'm right here, bro” and is on social media talking tough. He did a press conference before QP today, where he was all tough talk and what have we. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785356">The <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> stood before Canadians and ripped up the agreement between the two parties, and then quickly taped it up and said, “I'm sorry, dear. I didn't mean to do that. I love you.” Every step of the way, he has propped up these guys. Just recently, he once again chose the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> over Canadians. It is shocking time and time again. He says that he is against the carbon tax, yet he has voted 24 times, maybe even more, in favour of it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785358">Instead, Liberals stand before the cameras and say, “If only the Conservatives would stop doing what they are doing.” We are the only ones doing our job and making sure that the government is held to account for $400 million. I see the gallery is filling up again. It is Wednesday afternoon after question period and we have a semi-full gallery. I want to let the people in the gallery know that it is $400 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785359">What do the Liberals want us to do? They want us to send it to committee, to let the committee study it and see if there was any malfeasance or bad stuff going on. I have said before that, if somebody steals from you, Mr. Speaker, do you go to a committee or do you go to the RCMP? That is why we are here today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785360">Another thing I want to talk about today, one that is near and dear to me, is another crisis that is taking place, and that is the opioid crisis. The reason I bring that up is for us to imagine how far that $400 million could have gone to help the opioid crisis. How many beds could that $400 million have built? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785361">The Liberals stand and say it was the Conservatives who cut all the jobs at CBSA, but in 2014-15, one of the highest amounts of funding went to the CBSA. Once the Liberal government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were in place, in 2016-17, over 1,000 jobs were cut. Over $440 million were cut. It is in the Liberals' own public accounts. No one has to believe me. Canadians can bring up the public accounts and see for themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785362">Let us get back to what I was talking about: the opioid crisis. We are powerless to stop illicit drugs from coming into our country. Over 47,000 Canadians have tragically lost their lives to the opioid crisis since 2016, and that situation continues to worsen. In British Columbia, the decriminalization of hard drugs was touted as a solution to reduce stigma and save lives, yet the policy failed. It failed to deliver the intended results. Instead, communities have seen increased drug use in public spaces, needles outside of schools and in playgrounds, public disorder, diversion to youth and organized crime, and no meaningful reductions in overdose deaths. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785363">I am going to say this again because I believe it bears repeating. Overdose is the leading cause of death for youth aged 10 to 18 in the province of British Columbia. That is staggering. I ask Canadians listening in and those in the gallery to look around their neighbourhoods and communities. Do their communities look the same as they did nine years ago? They do not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785364">I can say that it was not that way before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and it will not be that way when we elect a strong Conservative prime minister who will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. The sole focus of the next Conservative government is cleaning up the mess that the Liberal government has made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785365">We cannot talk about the opioid crisis without talking about safe supply programs, where these government-funded drugs are being diverted and sold illegally, undermining their purpose and fuelling addiction in vulnerable populations, including our youth. The situation is further exacerbated by the flow of deadly substances like fentanyl across our porous borders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785366">I talked about this earlier. Liberals like to blame Stephen Harper and the former Conservative government, yet it is the government that has been in power for nine years that cut funds and jobs at the CBSA for consecutive years when it took power. The Liberals like to blame everybody but themselves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8785367">Despite clear evidence of dangers posed by these substances, enforcement and border controls remain insufficient to stem the tide. Clearly, stopping fentanyl from entering our country and destroying our communities is not a priority for the government. The government has spent billions on policies that perpetuate addiction, without addressing the root causes or providing support for treatment and recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785368">I will bring it back to the topic we are talking about today: the SDTC fund, where over $440 million of Canadian taxpayer funds was stolen and divvied out by a Liberal-appointed committee to the chair, to other friends and to families and colleagues of the Liberals. Canadians should be outraged at this. How can the Liberals continue to ignore the pleas of families and communities devastated by this crisis? They have had nine years, and all they have been doing is making it worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785369">Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> is a classic example of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hug-a-thug, revolving-door criminal justice policy that is making our communities unsafe. Bill C-5 eliminated mandatory jail time for certain violent offenders. We want jail, not bail, for criminals who will endanger Canadians. This is why we introduced a motion in the House this week calling on the NDP-Liberal government to reverse Bill C-5, bring in harsher jail sentences for drug kingpins, ban precursor chemicals that organized crime groups use to make deadly fentanyl, scan the containers at our ports and put more boots on the ground at our borders. Ninety-nine per cent of the containers that come through our borders are not scanned. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785370">Unfortunately, to Canadians' shock and awe, the Liberal-NDP-Bloc coalition voted against it. It voted against the safety of our communities and of Canadians. I ask this of any Canadian who is watching right now: Is this the government they elected in 2015? Is this what they expected? Many Canadians took the bait, hook, line and sinker. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to stand before Canadians, put his hand on his heart and dab away a fake tear. He has lied, misled Canadians all along the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785371">I cannot talk about the opioid crisis without talking about young Brianna MacDonald. For those who might be just tuning in and those in the gallery, Brianna MacDonald was a 12-year-old. She was on the streets of Abbotsford. She turned 13 on July 15. That is my son's birthday. She died on August 23 in a homeless encampment from overdose. That is my daughter's birthday. Lance Charles, her dad, and Sarah MacDonald were here. Over 30 times, they took Brianna to the hospital to plead for help, for health care, for the doctors or somebody to intervene and help Brianna. What were they given? They were told that if Brianna wanted to kill herself, it was her prerogative. Instead of help, Brianna was given needles and instructions on how to do the drugs better. She was 13 years of age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785372">I cannot talk about the Liberal government and its failed soft-on-crime, hug-a-thug policies, without talking about Mr. Hubbard in my community. Mr. Hubbard is a senior. He was out in the morning and returned home in the afternoon to find his place being looted by criminals to fuel their drug addiction. He tried stopping them. What happened was that they drove over him, dragged him down the road and left him for dead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785373">We are tough in northern B.C., in our region. Mr. Hubbard lived, but he has had reconstructive surgery on his face, and he almost lost his arm. He has to endure more operations down the road. However, the same day this incident took place, the RCMP caught a couple of the perpetrators. Within 24 hours, they were back out on the street. It is crazy, but that is what we are seeing time and again from this hug-a-thug Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his friends in the NDP. They talk a big game; they always talk about doing the right thing, yet they fail Canadians every time they get a chance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785374">We talked about the $400 million of taxpayer funds taken out of the pockets of Canadians and handed to Liberal insiders. We talked about the 186 conflicts of interest that were found by the Auditor General. Again, this debate could end right now if the Liberals just turned over the documents, unredacted, so that the RCMP could have a look at them and see what went on. Instead, they continue to try to cover their tracks and defend their corrupt friends. Meanwhile, Canada is broken. Time and again, we receive messages from our constituents, who are frustrated: “Can't you do anything about the government? Can't you call an election? Can't you force an election?” We are trying. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785375">Canadians are struggling just to get by while the Liberals are focused on enriching their corrupt friends. However, it should not surprise anyone. The legacy of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is one of chaos, scandal, corruption and cover-up, and it did not start today with the green slush fund. It has been a nine-year pattern of dodging accountability and transparency. Did he not say that his was going to be the most transparent government in the history of the country? Somehow, the NDP and the Bloc are still supporting the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785376">I could go on for hours about the scandals and conflicts of interest that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government have been caught in: the Aga Khan, WE Charity, SNC-Lavalin, blackface, clam scam, arrive scam, GC Strategies, cash for access, gropegate, elbowgate, surf is up in Tofino, the Emergencies Act, sole-sourced contracts, foreign interference and the condo on Billionaires' Row with his media buddy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785377"> The latest scandal to rock the government is, of course, the other Randy. First, he found himself in hot water when texts emerged of a Randy texting the business partners of a shady, fraudulent company. If anybody has seen these text messages, they know that it is an actual shakedown of $500,000. It is a strict no-no for Crown ministers to be caught bidding on federal contracts, so the former minister explained that it was the actions of another Randy, an individual who, as far as we know now, does not exist. His partner said that it was autocorrect nine times. What a farce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785378">Honestly, the excuses we get from the Liberal front bench on their misgivings is really farcical. I am sure they are going to write a movie about it at some point; all of these scandals and the corruption that take place are really out of a Hollywood script. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785386"> Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the union also identified the 1,100 jobs that were eliminated from CBSA by Stephen Harper and many of the member's colleagues who sit with him here today. The jobs included the sniffer dogs and the people doing intelligence research. They were the frontline workers, men and women who also had to go on strike to get proper protection in the workplace. Therefore, the suggestion that the Conservatives had nothing to do with that and did not take away frontline officers is erroneous. That Conservatives are insisting on attacking the union is outrageous, because the men and women on our front line, protecting our border, deserve the proper supports and protection. They have press releases, press conferences and numerous interventions in the House on this. For the Conservatives to continue to run this line of attack on the union is rather unfortunate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785422">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today, and always, to address the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785423">I want to start by drilling down on the concept of common sense. Members in the House, and those who follow the debates elsewhere, will know that Conservatives speak a lot about the concept of common sense. We have been highlighting the importance of restoring common sense in government decision-making. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785424">I have observed that our critics across the way, and some of their friends online, have responded by denigrating the use of the term “common sense”. Our critics say they do not really know what we mean by common sense. The fact that the government is claiming not to understand what is meant or implied by common sense actually, I think, demonstrates the problem in substantial measure. The concept of common sense has a history and a meaning that are worth reflecting on and that used to be well understood. The fact that the government, in particular, does not know what common sense is shows how far we have gone. However, for the government's benefit, I think it is worth delving a bit into this concept and why it is important to restore common-sense decision-making in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785425"> Let me say first, at a general level, that we all know ideas have practical consequences. We can see over time whether an idea works when implemented. A critical test of an idea is the practical consequences it creates in the real world. When we consider, in our policy debates, the validity of an idea, we need to ask whether that idea will work in practice, whether it produces the effects it is intended to produce and whether it contributes to or undermines human flourishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785426"> Most people in their regular lives hold ideas that they also practise. As they practise the ideas they profess, their lives demonstrate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the ideas they profess and practise. I would see this happen a lot, by the way, thinking back, with friends I had in university. They would develop some idea about human behaviour, maybe through a class, a discussion or something they read, put that idea into practice, and then reap the consequences, thus becoming either an example or a cautionary tale as a result. More often than not, in my recollection, it was a cautionary tale. These were little, but profound, demonstrations of John Stuart Mill's theory on the value of experiments in living: that free people engage in experiments in living, which others can then observe, and the observation of experiments in living leads to the collective formation of norms that work and lead to greater human flourishing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785427">The things that most people learn and practise in order to live well-ordered, healthy, happy lives are what we have come to call common sense. There is no central repository of the information that we call common sense, but the concept still has profound meaning. It refers to the things most normal people have come to know by experience and perhaps by listening to elders in their lives who have shared from their experience. Experiments in living over time produce general insights that most people recognize as true, the things most people know by experience to be right and sensible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785428">If a person comes up with a new, novel theory, they might well posit that it is true, but they could not consider it common sense. New, novel theories often challenge common sense, and they are often wrong; not always, but the conservatism that we champion on this side of the House is the idea that we should at least be cautious and deferential when implementing changes in order to preserve the common-sense wisdom of the past. A lot of harm has been done through the capricious application of someone's idea of what would be a good and interesting experiment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785429">Let us consider one example of this in the policy space, so-called modern monetary theory. This is the theory that a government can spend as much as it wants without being constrained by revenue or worried about the consequences. Some way, somehow, modern monetary theory posits that a government can just run massive deficits in perpetuity. Needless to say, proponents of this radical theory would not consider this theory to be common sense. They would not even pretend it was common sense, because it is novel and radical. Even proponents, I think, would acknowledge it is both novel and radical. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785430">I think we can say that, to a substantial extent, modern monetary theory has been tried in Canada by the government, which no longer believes that it ever needs to target the balancing of the budget and has more than doubled our national debt in the last nine years it has been in office.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8785431"> This radical, novel theory has been tried and I think we can see now, or most people can see, that it has clearly failed. There are many other new and novel theories this government has tried that have failed as well. It tried experimenting with a carbon tax. It tried experimenting with very high levels of non-permanent immigration in the absence of a housing policy to make up for the need that was thus created. It tried experimenting with hard-drug decriminalization. This is just to name a few examples of radical, novel experiments that this government imposed on this great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785432"> These were experiments in policy and all of them failed. They were ideas that nine years ago might have sounded good to some people in theory, but we no longer need to simply debate these ideas as theory because we can see them in practice and we can see they have failed in practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785433"> They are also ideas that I think we can say violated common sense. They went against things we know and have known to be true for a long time about the kinds of policies that work and the kinds that do not. The government tried radical new ideas and these radical new ideas did not work. When Conservatives talk about restoring common sense, we mean, precisely, pushing back against these sorts of radical experiments and restoring an application of long-standing wisdom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785434"> We would make decisions that are rooted in the common-sense experience of real people. We would replace the government's weak, weird, woke and wasteful policies with common-sense conservatism, with ideas rooted in the conclusive experience of history and the things normal people know from experience to be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785435"> I want to make one other observation about common sense, and that is that one of the biggest attacks we see on common sense is from privileged people who promote their luxury beliefs at the expense of everyone else. Luxury beliefs are ideas promoted by privileged people, often not actually practised by the people promoting them, that confer on the promoter a kind of social recognition and status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785436"> Here are a few examples: rich and privileged people pushing calls to defund the police while themselves relying on private security or living in gated communities; politicians denouncing choice in education while finding workarounds for their own families; and leaders pushing for higher taxes on small businesses while ensuring they will never have to pay those higher taxes themselves. These are examples of luxury beliefs where the proponents of these radical ideas have the power and the privilege to protect themselves from the impacts of the weird experiments. They are running an experiment, but they are stepping out of the lab, so they are not affected. A normal person living in the real world cannot afford to ignore common sense for long, because a lack of common sense will catch up with them. It will have consequences for their life that they and others notice and that will lead to a course correction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785437"> Well-functioning democracies, by protecting the voice of the common people in decision-making, maximize the chance that collective decisions will be informed by common sense. The common people are often most in touch with common sense, because the common people have to live with the consequences of collective decisions. However, a small, privileged elite can often continue, even for a long time, to hold, promote and govern on the basis of a narrow set of luxury beliefs that defy common sense, while protecting themselves from the impact of those decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785438"> This fundamentally defines the record and practice of the current government: making decisions based on luxury beliefs that its members can insulate themselves from and that in reality have devastating impacts on the lives of everyday Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785439"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is generally insulated from the impacts of his carbon tax. He will not even share information about the amount of greenhouse gases his own activities produce. We have sought that information before and have not received it. He has a taxpayer-funded home and has never struggled to afford a home because of inherited wealth. He has the privilege to protect himself from inflation and he does not have to live in communities devastated by his own dangerous drug decriminalization policies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8785440">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> persists in his own luxury beliefs because he does not see or experience those real-world consequences. Today, many Canadians, who once voted for him, can see the failure of his luxury beliefs and see the urgency of our call in response to these radical experiments. Our call is for a return to common sense, to axe the tax, to build the homes, to fix the budget and to stop the crime, to reverse these radical policies and replace them with clear common-sense priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785441">Conservatives' priorities notably correspond to these specific areas of NDP-Liberal failed experiments. They brought in a carbon tax, which was an experimental idea. It was the theory that if we increase the cost of everything, this will lead to less consumption in areas that produce carbon emissions. This failed because, as history has shown us, technological change leads to changes in behaviour. It was not through taxes on horses that we saw the transition to the automobile. It was through the invention of the automobile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785442">I remember seeing a post online of someone showing a picture of a street before the invention of the car and after the invention of the car, and it showed how quickly things can change. The point is that things changed because new alternatives become available that allow people to adapt. We would not have seen that change through a tax on horses. It just would have made taking a horse and buggy more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785443">The carbon tax was a theory. It was tried. It has not worked. The government has not reached its targets at all. There are other countries that have pursued other policies that I think have been more effective than the actions of the government. The Conservatives' response is to reject the Liberals' radical experimentation and restore common sense in this area with our proposal to axe the tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785444">When it comes to another area of experimentation, the Liberals brought in changes around housing and immigration. They were experimental changes. They radically increased non-permanent immigration to this country. They did not have any plans around home construction. In fact, fewer homes are being built today than were built in this country in the 1970s, despite the growth in population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785445">This experiment of not having enough homes to meet the needs of the population was a radical experiment. Individual members of the government are insulated from the impacts of the experiment, but it was an experiment that failed. In response to that, we want to champion a return to common sense, the common-sense proposal to build the homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785446">Then, as I already talked about, the Liberals experimented with modern monetary theory. They wanted to try something new. They tried dramatically increasing spending and did not worry about, at any point, balancing the budget. It was a radical, novel idea. I think many people would say it would be nice if that was true. It would be nice if we could spend infinitely without needing to worry about where the money came from, but that is just not how the world works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785447">Disraeli famously said that the facts of life are conservative. What goes up must come down. There is a basic reality the experimentation defied. The Liberals acted on fiscal policy, and continue to act on fiscal policy, in defiance of basic common sense. The wisdom that people naturally gather over time by living normal lives, is that they realize that they cannot spend money they do not have, and if they spend money they do not have, eventually it is going to catch up to them. That is common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785448">The government tried to defy common sense. It did not work. In response to that failure, the Conservatives have a proposal to fix the budget. It is to institute a dollar-for-dollar rule, which restores common sense. If we are going to spend a dollar on something, that dollar has to come from somewhere. We cannot spend money we do not have, and if we have that money, it had to come from somewhere. It is simply asking government to discipline itself to that common-sense reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785449">That is our plan to fix the budget: axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and finally stop the crime. We have seen radical experiments from the Liberals on crime. When they took office, they made substantial changes to the bail system. We can see, if we look at the data on violent crime in this country, how violent crime was going down under Stephen Harper, and it started to go up when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. It is because the Liberals made specific policy changes—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785454">Mr. Speaker, we have seen the radical experiments of the government on crime, and that is why Conservatives are championing common-sense proposals to stop the crime. We will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. These common-sense principles respond to the radical experimentation of the government. I hope that is helpful for members of the government in understanding these principles of common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785455">The member highlighted the privilege issue. I have talked a bit about the privilege of the government and how it is so privileged that it has insulated itself from the impacts of its bad policies. In particular, in this privilege motion, we are talking about the fact that the government has refused to hand over documents ordered by the House of Commons. What I have been building up to is the reality that the government's approach to scandal and to the House of Commons demonstrates a lack of regard for the basic principles of common sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785456">We are talking in this privilege motion about the rights of the House of Commons, fundamentally, to order the production of documents. We call it the House of Commons for a reason. It is because the House of Commons has always been the institution that represents the common people. I talked earlier in this speech about how the common people are necessarily in touch with common sense by the experience of their lives, whereas it is often the case that a privileged elite can become disconnected from common sense. We are in the House of Commons championing the common sense of the common people and the right of that House of Commons, on behalf of the common people, to order the production of documents that are relevant for the work of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785457"> In the midst of its defence of power and privilege against the common people and the House of Commons, we have a government that is refusing to hand over documents that have been ordered. In the spirit of common sense, Conservatives are going to continue to demand that those documents be handed over. What are the documents? Aside from the principle of the right of the people's House to order the production of documents, what exactly are the documents the government is making its stand on in defence of power and privilege against the rights of the people to order these documents? It is about a corrupt green slush fund, where government insiders were able to, because of their privileged access, hand out money, and they did so often to companies that were owned by people on that very board. There was a group of insiders appointed by the government that was able to hand out $400 million to various companies, and it used that insider access, that power, to give money to its own companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785458">This is obviously a violation of the basic principles of common sense. I think any reasonable person thinking about what makes sense and what is fair would understand that there should not be people with the power to allocate taxpayers' dollars to companies that they own. That is just common sense, but it was not common sense that penetrated the elite decision-making circles within the government. Both the process of this motion, the fact that the government is refusing to hand over documents, and the substance behind it, which is what happened with the green slush fund, underline the need to restore that common sense to the decision-making that takes place here in Parliament and in Ottawa, in general. The very fact that the government insiders thought that what they were doing was okay or that they could get away with it illustrates how broken things have become under the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785459">I could go through the litany of scandals. Just this week, the government operations and estimates committee was doing ongoing work on the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal, how elite non-indigenous insiders took money that was supposed to be benefiting indigenous companies. In fact, the AFN said that the vast majority of those who benefited from these set-asides were actually shell companies. We had an auditor before committee who said that he, years ago, came to the government with evidence of criminal activity by people pretending to be indigenous, saying that these allegations should be referred to the RCMP, and the government decided not to do that. It is unbelievable that an auditor would say there is criminal activity and that the government would decide not to hand the documents over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785460">It is time to restore the common sense of the common people united for our common home, and that is what we should be standing up for in this House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785461"> Mr. Speaker, I have certainly enjoyed the choice of words used by Conservatives lately. They do not talk about balancing the budget, but about fixing the budget. I am wondering if the member can tell me the difference between the two because I certainly do not think they mean balancing it. If we look at the history of the Conservatives over the last few decades, neither Stephen Harper nor Brian Mulroney balanced the budget. Actually, Harper only had two balanced budgets. One questionable budget was just before he left in 2015 and the other was on the heels of Paul Martin's surplus in 2006.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785462">The member talked about fixing the budget. What is the difference between fixing and balancing? He can spare me the rhetoric that every dollar spent must be saved. Does that basically mean that they will keep the deficit exactly where it is? In reality, most governments accept the fact that running deficits is okay as long as they are growing the economy at a pace that is outpacing the deficits, which has been the case for this government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785464"> This is common sense, so it is good for the member to hear it. To fix the budget, we will bring in a dollar-for-dollar rule. That means when a dollar is spent that dollar needs to come from somewhere. The government needs to identify when it is making spending decisions. If it is proposing to spend $100 million on something over here, it needs to be able to say where that $100 million will come from. The money has to come from somewhere to go to the spending item. That is common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785465"> What the NDP-Liberal government has pursued is a radical policy in defiance of common sense, where it seems to believe that it can promise new spending without ever offering an account of where that money came from. The effect of that has been massive inflation, making life significantly less affordable for Canadians, more than doubling the national debt. It is a horrible record, a record worse than any previous Conservative or Liberal prime minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785466"> Canadians are going to be living with the debt caused by the NDP-Liberal government for a very long time. However, we are prepared to use common sense to clean up the atrocious mess that it has created and restore our common home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785469"> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear the difference between an across-the-board, permanent tax cut and the temporary tax trick proposed by the NDP-Liberal government. We permanently reduced the GST from 7% to 6% to 5%. We did so while balancing the budget. Of course, there were timely temporary deficits during the global financial crisis and we brought the country back to a balanced budget. It was a prudent fiscal approach and we were able to cut taxes permanently and across the board, cutting the GST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785470">This temporary tax trick says that we are going to change the list of goods that are tax-exempt for a period of two months, so there will be one list of tax-exempt goods now. That list is going to change for two months and then it is going to change back, which is just a nightmare from an administrative standpoint for small businesses that have to manage this. It is a trick because it will not cut people's taxes permanently. We favour permanent, across-the-board, effective tax cuts to make our system simpler and more effective and to provide Canadians the tax relief they deserve.</ParaText>

Prior to that, it was Brian Mulroney in a Conservative government, at $40 billion. Also, during that time frame, the Conservatives brought in the HST, thanks very much, with Brian Mulroney's GST before that, and they borrowed up to $6 billion to pay the different provinces to bring in the HST, which we are still paying for right now.</ParaText>

Over the Harper years, that debt-to-GDP ratio went down overall. We went through the global financial crisis and we balanced the budget coming out of that. We lowered the debt-to-GDP ratio.

              <ParaText id="8785480"> However, I have the honour of serving on the government operations committee, and I will just highlight a few things that we have been able to identify there in terms of government waste. While the size of the public service has grown, there has also been a dramatic increase in spending on outside consultants. We would expect these things to go inversely; if there were a larger public service, there would be less need to contract out or vice versa. However, under the current government, there has been growth in the public service and it is contracting out more. The government is contracting to people who are then subcontracting. There is this whole class of professional contractors and subcontractors who receive contracts and then subcontract, companies like GC Strategies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785481">We have seen horrendous abuse of the indigenous procurement program, where non-indigenous elite insiders pretend to be indigenous or set up shell companies or abusive joint ventures and then use those arrangements to take contracts that should be benefiting indigenous communities. We are talking about the green slush fund today. There are abuses of the indigenous procurement program. There is outrageous spending on contracting out to friends of the government, like McKinsey and others. These are some of the obvious, significant examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785482"> I am very proud of the fact that when we have put forward proposals for cutting Canadians' taxes, like by taking the GST off new home construction, for example, we have, in every case, identified where the money is going to come from.

              <ParaText id="8785491">Let me move on to the SDTC slush fund. I talked about this earlier in my question to my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, saying that one scandal that took down the Martin Liberals was the ad scam, an advertising scandal that rocked Quebec. It was something that really showed what Liberals do when they are in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785492">The Liberals actually, at some points in time, believe that they are above the law. They believe that they have the divine right to govern, and they take every opportunity to enrich their friends and family. We see it time and time again. It is not a flaw of the Liberal organization; it is actually the raison d'être. The Liberals want to be in government so they can enrich their friends and family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785493">After the Liberals get voted out and the Conservatives have to come in and clean up their mess, their friends and family can give them cushy parachute jobs so they have the opportunity to make money while they wait for their turn to come back into government and wreck everything again, and Conservatives have to clean up their mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785494">The SDTC slush fund was a $420-million fund that was set up by the Liberal government. The board was put in place by the Liberal government. The key mandate for SDTC, which was a federally funded non-profit, was to approve and disburse over $400 million to clean-technology companies. Ironically, many of these companies have direct relationships to people in cabinet, and the chair of SDTC actually gave money to her very own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785495">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>, set it up nicely by talking about common sense. Lots of people would say that it would be common sense that if someone is on a board, especially as chair of the board, appointed by the government to give funds to clean-tech companies, they would automatically assume that one's company would not be eligible or, at the bare minimum, they would recuse themself from the discussions. However, none of this happened with the corrupt organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785496">Here are the numbers that the Auditor General's audit found: Funding was approved by the SDTC board for 10 ineligible projects. There were 96 cases where conflict of interest policies were not followed, 90 cases where conflict of interest policies were also not followed for projects without ensuring contribution agreement terms were met, $19.5 million for seed projects and $38.5 million for COVID relief payments. The funding in overlaps was $62 million, for a grand total of $390 million that was given out to ineligible projects or to projects that were found by the Auditor General to be in conflict of interest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785497">This is something that has rocked the Liberal Party of Canada and its junior partner, the NDP. These documents are so bad. This is why we are seized with this debate, day in and day out. Liberals and their NDP junior partners are terrified to see what is in these documents. They have no idea how bad this is going to get, so they do not even want to look at what has happened in this case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785498">I remember the 2015 campaign, the member for Papineau was running around the country saying “sunny ways” and that there would never be a more open and transparent government in the history of Canada than the one headed by the member for Papineau. What an absolute failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785499">There have been over 70 scandals by the current government, and at the head of these scandals is the current NDP-Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who himself has been in a conflict of interest, not once but twice. I once heard a very good quote from a fine football movie called <I>Remember the Titans</I>: “Attitude reflects leadership.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785500">We see that within the Liberal and NDP caucuses. Their leaders have the attitude of “rules for thee but not for me.” That comes straight from the Prime Minister's Office. They believe they are above the law and that taxpayers' dollars are there for them to spend as they please, conflict of interest be damned. It does not matter to them. They are very much entitled to their entitlements, which I think came from one of their members a few years ago.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785503">Madam Speaker, in terms of the funds that are going out, I do not know if this is actually a strategy the NDP-Liberals have, but maybe it is that, if they have this many scandals, the Canadian population will just become accustomed to it. Maybe if there are so many wrongdoings within the government, the Canadian population will say, “It is just another Liberal-NDP scandal. What else would we expect? It is kind of what they do.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785504"> As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> has stated eloquently, Liberals are going to liberal. That is what we are seeing here. It is actually embedded into their ideology that taxpayers' dollars are their own. I say this in many speeches, and it bears repeating: The NDP-Liberals should realize government has never earned a dollar. Government only takes money through taxation from individuals or businesses that make that money. That is how government gets its funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785505">I think that we need to look at the ideology within the Liberal Party. They will give money to their friends. We had the clam scam. I have a list of all the scandals here, which I would like to run through and talk about. The Canadian population, I think, has become accustomed to Liberal scandals. I think they expect a new scandal every week, and the Liberals are obliging them because we have a new scandal every week. There is another Randy. There are so many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785506">I will start from the top. We put this list together in my office. Obviously, we have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s first breach of ethics, the Aga Khan vacation scandal, when he took a vacation that cost tens of thousands of dollars to a private island. I do not have many friends who own private islands. I do not know if any other members do, but that is probably not even an option for many in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785507">We have the prison needle exchange program. Then there was pressuring the justice minister to get Liberal donor SNC-Lavalin off the hook and firing the minister for not helping to cover it up. That was the Jody Wilson-Raybould saga, which ended with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> unceremoniously dumping the first indigenous female justice minister, but that is just the first of many competent, strong women that the Prime Minister has thrown under the bus. I will get to more of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785508">We have the “people experience things differently” response to groping allegations, and the WE Charity scandal. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> asked how Conservatives are going to fix the budget. I would like to add to the answer from my colleague. We fix the budget by cutting wasteful spending. There were hundreds of millions of dollars given to WE Charity over the years. There is an easy cut. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8785509">In addition, the public service has grown exponentially, yet more than double the amount of money is being paid to outside consultants. The member asked how we grow government and increase the money given to third party consulting contracts. There was hundreds of millions given to McKinsey. There is another easy cut to save taxpayers money, so we are probably at about $200 million right there. The Canada Infrastructure Bank has not finished a project in this country. I think that is a couple of billion we could bring home; we could actually get projects built in our country with those dollars. There is more money that could be saved. When we talk about common-sense approaches to fixing the budget, here are some concrete examples right there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785510">We had the WE Charity. We had the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> elbowing the female NDP member in the House of Commons. That was another scandal that rocked this nation, with the Prime Minister being physical with another MP. He prorogued Parliament to escape the WE scandal. Once again, I am building on the WE scandal. The government sent personal protective equipment to China during the pandemic. I remember that there was a stock house filled with protective equipment in Regina, and they actually just threw it out during the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785511">The government gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in ventilator contracts to Liberal Party insider Frank Baylis, whose company did not even produce ventilators. That is foreshadowing for what happened with SDTC, giving money to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785512">There were fake charges against Mark Norman. In 2021, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278598" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation> took people's mail out of their mailboxes, so that was another scandal. The illegal invocation of the Emergencies Act is one of my personal favourites. The last time the Emergencies Act was invoked, Tommy Douglas said that invoking the War Measures Act was like cracking a peanut with a sledgehammer. That was a long time ago, when the NDP stood for something; now it stands for nothing but its <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>'s pension and keeping the current scandal-plagued <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785513">PHAC found a committee in contempt of Parliament with the Winnipeg lab documents. I remember that. The Liberals then took their own Speaker to court. There was the trampling of Canadians with horses, as well as the seizure of Canadians' bank accounts. That was something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. There was rampant abuse of staff in the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>-appointed Governor General's office. The Governor General wasted $100,000 to throw private jet parties. There were connections with illegal casino magnates and vaccine delays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785514">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> dressed up in racist costumes on official trips to India. The Liberal Prime Minister dressed up in racist blackface. There were mass airport delays and cancellations. The government decriminalized hard drugs. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation> gave a wonderful speech on how, in his province, because of the decriminalization of hard drugs, overdoses have become the number one cause of death for 18- to 27-year-olds. That is a direct result of the NDP government in B.C. and the Liberals agreeing to decriminalize hard drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785515">The sending of diplomats to a party at the Russian embassy during the invasion of Ukraine was another scandal. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pollutes more in one year with his private jet than the average Canadian does in half a lifetime. That is another thing. We see the Liberals prop themselves up as stewards of the environment, but they pollute more through private jet use than Canadians do in half a lifetime. That is another example, as we talked about earlier, of “do as we say, not as we do”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785516">This list gets longer every time I give this speech. The <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> gave a $17,000 contract to a Liberal-aligned media firm. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> let Thomson Reuters take his chief of staff to the White House press correspondents' dinner. The former DND minister misrepresented his service in the military. The government tried to get unwarranted border searches of electronics. There was the restriction of online free speech.

Obviously, this came from a man who never thinks about monetary policy, or fiscal policy either. Can members imagine a prime minister saying that the government would take on debt so that Canadians do not have to? Who does he think pays the debt back? Does he think he can just print money? Obviously, he does think he can just print money, which he has done over the last year, which caused the inflation crisis for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785520">When we look at the prices in the grocery stores, more and more Canadians are going to the grocery store just to see that they cannot buy the essentials to feed their family. That is a direct cause of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lack of knowledge when it comes to fiscal and monetary policies, because he does not think about it. We see grocery prices continue to go up because of the policies of the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785521">Then inflation happens and what do we see? An increase in mortgage rates across this country and people finding it harder to pay their mortgage. When it comes down to it, people cannot afford the groceries they need for their kids or a roof over their head because of the doubling of mortgage rates and the doubling of rents because of the reckless fiscal policy of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Then they look at this debate and wonder how on earth a government, headed by the NDP-Liberals, could spend $400 million of our money and give it to their friends and party insiders. These are the questions we get in the riding. Do they think they are above the law? They give money to their friends and family and people are left holding the bag. Hopefully, my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation> can get on his feet and explain how, if a government goes into debt, the Canadian taxpayer does not pay that money back through taxation and increased taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785522">I think that is one of the reasons the Liberals have such an infatuation with the carbon tax, because they are trying to get money any way they can from Canadians. If they use this tax policy, which is not an environmental policy, they get more money into the coffers. On top of that, which is not in the book but should be a scandal, the NDP-Liberals charge GST on the carbon tax that they are charging Canadians. It is a tax on a tax. I get many questions at my office about how it is even legal that they can tax a tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785523">We are going on to a few more scandals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785524">There were more than 72 secret orders in council the Liberals have passed over the last nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785525">The Liberals eliminated the mandatory minimums for gun offences while going after law-abiding firearm owners, like Uncle Joe's rifle we talked about in question period earlier this day. The actual numbers do not lie. Over the last nine long years of the government, gun crime has increased by 116%. The government members think that, by going after our sports shooters and law-abiding firearm owners, gun crime is going to go down. I do not understand why they cannot wrap their minds around the fact that it is not the law-abiding firearms owners who are causing gun crime to go up; it is the illegal guns coming across our border. It is the criminals who are actually breaking the law. What we need to do is have a common-sense policy with more border stops and more checks at the borders. We need to put criminals in jail where they belong, not out on bail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785526">I will talk about that for one more minute, the fact that the Liberals' bail, not jail policy has hurt communities across this country. One is my community in Grand Coulee, where someone was charged with child pornography and was let out with conditions, back into our community, the day he went to court. That is what the Liberals have done to this country.</ParaText>

This is what they bring when they come to government. They come to government and scandals follow them everywhere they go. It is similar to the NDP members in Saskatchewan.

People used to call it “Roy's revenge.” Roy Romanow was the NDP premier of Saskatchewan who closed 152 hospitals in our province, devastating health care. Roy Romanow closed 175 schools; that was one school for every week he was premier in our province. This devastated rural Saskatchewan.

              <ParaText id="8785558">It seems as though, while many Canadian parents are struggling to put food on the table or put gifts under the Christmas tree for their kids, the Liberal members, insiders and bagmen are the ones who are making off with the Christmas spirit this holiday season. Hard-working Canadians are seeing their paycheques eroded by out-of-control spending, higher taxes, higher inflation and scandal after scam, with the arrive scam, the WE scandal and SNC-Lavalin. Even among their members, the former minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, is getting caught in his own scandals, one after another. He tried to take advantage of his position as a cabinet minister to enrich his own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785559">It seems that, with one hand, the Liberals are taking every scrap and every penny from the Canadian taxpayer, while with the other, they are enriching their friends and doling out taxpayer money to their friends, contractors and insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785560">Today, we are speaking about one specific scandal. I wish I could say it was just the latest scandal, but there have been more since this first came to light at the committee stage. This scandal in particular is egregious, not only because of the price tag, that this is a misuse of perhaps more than 400 million taxpayer dollars, but also because of the scale, in that it has more than 180 documented conflicts of interest. That is one every second day of the year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785561">Members of the board of directors, who were appointed by the member for Papineau, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, were taking SDTC money that was meant to go to innovation and projects as part of a climate change initiative. The green slush fund was being funnelled to members of the board of directors, who were themselves voting to have money go to their own companies or companies they represented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785562">I think that the scale of this kind of insider trading, for lack of a better description, is what frustrates so many Canadians and, certainly, members of the official opposition. This is not just government money. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> loves to say that the Liberals are investing in Canadians, that they are investing in these projects. He is investing with Canadian taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. Actually, he used to do that. He is now just having to borrow because he has blown through whatever the taxpayer has to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785563">Those hard-earned dollars that the taxpayers are giving to the government have been directly funnelled into the hands of Liberal-appointed board members and the companies they represent. Aside from the fact that this money was going to Liberal insiders and Liberal friends, the majority of projects that were approved did not even qualify for the funding from this program. They were illegitimate, yet the Liberal-appointed board members found ways to bend the rules, circumnavigate procedure and ensure that they were enriching their own companies and lining their own pockets. It is no wonder that the level of trust from Canadians in the political structure and the Liberal-NDP government is at an all-time low. The polls certainly show that the most recent two-month tax trick and $250 cheques are not what Canadians are buying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785564">The list of promises that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has broken would probably make Santa's naughty list blush. It seems to happen over and over again. I would just like to go over a couple. He promised that there would only be a few teeny-weeny deficits in his first three years as Prime Minister. After three years, he would balance the budget. He promised electoral reform. He promised to reduce taxes on the middle class. He promised to build more affordable housing. He broke every single one of those promises.</ParaText>

In the 2015 election, he promised Canadians he would have the most open and transparent government in Canadian history. That statement now, in retrospect, is laughable. He is anything but transparent and open.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785566">In fact, this is the second time the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has ignored the will of the House and a ruling by the Speaker of the House to table documents in the House of Commons. The first time, he actually took the Speaker to court. He prorogued Parliament and then called a pandemic election that no Canadian wanted just to hide the level of his scandal. He was trying to hide documents from the Winnipeg lab scandal from being tabled in the House of Commons. If at first one succeeds, I guess try and try again. Those documents were never tabled in the House of Commons because an election was called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785567">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is trying to do the same thing here with the green slush fund documents that the Speaker of the House has ruled must be tabled in the House of Commons because Canadians have a right to know how their money is being spent. I would say Canadians want their money back. They want that $400 million to go back to the government and spent on things that will benefit Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785568">Not long ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also promised, with the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, in the most recent budget, that the deficit would not go over $40 billion. In question period, almost every day for the last two weeks, members of the official opposition have been asking the Prime Minister and the finance minister if they will stick to that $40-billion guardrail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785569">I would argue that a $40-billion deficit is still outrageous, but we are asking, if the government is not going to stick to that guardrail, what the size of the deficit will be. Is the government going to stick to that self-imposed guardrail, or is it driving Canadians off a fiscal cliff? I think Canadians deserve to know that. I think it is pretty clear, by the government members' unwillingness to answer that question, that this is going to be yet another promise broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785570">The Liberals have blasted through that $40-billion debt promise. We do not know what will be announced on Monday. The Liberals will try to spin this as a win. They will fudge numbers and come up with great phrases like debt-to-GDP ratio, or that they are sticking within this window, but Canadians feel it. They feel it every single day when they buy groceries, put gas in their cars, or are looking to renew their mortgages or heat their homes. They understand that life is not as good as the Liberals will profess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785571">In fact, we are seeing these levels of scandal and mismanagement, when it comes to Canadian taxpayer money, continue to pop up almost on a daily basis. We have learned from the Auditor General that the Liberals' CEBA program is yet another billion-dollar boondoggle. In fact, $3.5 billion of taxpayers' money was paid to more than 77,000 recipients who did not meet the eligibility requirements. That means about 10% of the total 900,000 loan recipients were ineligible for the money they received. We are asking the government if it has a plan to get the taxpayers' money back. Thus far, we have not heard a single plan to accomplish that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785572"> On top of that, the Liberals gave a non-competitive contract to Accenture. Accenture was allowed to lead the procurement process, which led to Accenture receiving $313 million, or 92% of the total value of the contracts awarded to Accenture to deliver the CEBA program. Even worse, it was administering this program from Brazil, despite telling the government it was going to be using Canadian experts and Canadian labour. That did not happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785573">It is frustrating how the Liberal government is trying so hard to block the tabling of these documents that they are willing to seize their own Parliament. For all intents and purposes, they have a majority government. The NDP has made that very clear every day. They should be able to control the calendar of the House of Commons. While the government says that the Conservatives are holding everything up, the government has a majority. It can make sure that the House of Commons works as it should, but it is refusing to table these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785574">In the meantime, Canadians are lined up at food banks in record numbers. While the NDP-Liberal government is lining the pockets of Liberal friends and insiders, a record-shattering number of Canadians are now being forced to access food banks. We have said this ad nauseam: When they increase taxes for the trucker who moves the food, they increase taxes for processors who manufacture the food, they increase taxes for retailers who sell the food and they increase taxes for farmers who grow the food, do members know what happens? They increase the cost of food every single day at the grocery store, making it that much more difficult for Canadians to afford it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785575">One aspect of that is the fact that, once again, the Liberal-NDP government has voted to quadruple the carbon tax, which will cost Canadian farmers more than a billion dollars a year. An average 5,000-acre farm will be paying $150,000 every single year just in carbon taxes. How is that going to ensure that family farms are economically viable, let alone environmentally sustainable?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785576"> I am going to go off some numbers of the impact that the carbon tax is having on Canadian food production. I think it is very important that we talk about that term. This impacts not only farm families but also Canadian food production and food security. For greenhouse operators alone, this is costing $22 million a year. By 2030, it will cost between $82 and $100 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785577"> Nearly one in five farms in Quebec are unable to manage their debt because of rising transportation costs and high interest rates caused by the carbon tax and inflationary spending. This is leaving them unable to compete on the domestic and international markets. We have 44% of fresh fruit and vegetable growers already selling at a loss, and 77% of those cannot cover their production costs. We have 77% of produce growers in Canada on the brink of bankruptcy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785578">Alberta farmers paid $17 million in carbon taxes last year just on natural gas and propane to dry their grain, and to heat and cool their barns. On April 1, when the carbon tax increases by 23%, that number will go to $20 million a year. By 2030, that will be $210 million just for Alberta farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785579"> Last year, Saskatchewan farmers paid more than $36 million in carbon taxes just to ship their grain by rail. That is not every other cost. That is not the cost of natural gas and propane to dry their grain, heat and cool their barns or manage their greenhouses. This is just the carbon tax bill that is passed on to them by CN and CPKC rail. Next year, when that carbon tax goes up 23%, that number will be $57 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785580">The Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, the chair of the agriculture committee, was stunned when he asked the representatives of the rail lines at committee last week if they were passing on the entire cost of the carbon tax to grain elevators and farmers. Their answer was that, yes, of course they were. Is that member serious? Did he think the rail lines were going to absorb the cost of the carbon tax, that they were not going to pass that on to the farmers and the grain elevators? Why would they pay that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785581">Every day, the Liberals cannot believe that the carbon tax is costing farmers money. They do not qualify for the rebates. They do not qualify for the Canadian entrepreneurs' rebate because the vast majority of them are incorporated. This is exactly the consequence of creating bad policy without actually talking to producers. The government could have done so much for Canadian farmers when we pointed out the mistakes in its policy, such as the original legislation on the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8785582">We brought forward Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which would have eliminated the carbon tax on natural gas and propane, saving farmers that $1 billion a year. However, Liberal-appointed senators and now, unfortunately, the Bloc, who at one time used to stand for rural Canada, rural Quebeckers and Quebec farmers, have now withdrawn their support of Bill C-234, which Liberal-appointed senators gutted in the Senate, eliminating 90% of the benefits of Bill C-234. Every single agriculture stakeholder supports Bill C-234. Whether cattle, grain or supply management sectors, all of them support Bill C-234, except the Liberal government and now, unfortunately, the Bloc, who have turned their back on rural Quebec farmers. All of this was just to save the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s carbon tax and perhaps to continue to prop up the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785583">It is frustrating. Certainly, we hear from farmers every single day regarding how difficult it is for them to manage the increase in input costs, especially when the Liberal government puts on a carbon tax, and a tariff on fertilizer which has increased fertilizer prices more than 150%. I know, that is incredible, right? When we add a tariff to fertilizer, it impacts global prices, despite what our Liberal members might want us to believe. The Liberals put in front-of-pack labelling, changed Canada's Food Guide and are pushing for a P2 plastics ban. All of these things have impacts not only on farmers, but also on the Canadian consumer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785584"> The new numbers are quite staggering. The Daily Bread Food Bank recently released its updated report on food bank use. Just in Toronto, there were 3.49 million client visits to Toronto-area food banks, nearly one million more than in the previous year; and a 273% increase since the pandemic. That means that one in 10 people in Toronto are being forced to rely on a food bank just to feed their families. Food bank use in Ontario has risen for eight consecutive years. In the last two years, the number of Ontarians accessing food banks has increased 73%. That is nearly triple the jump of the 2008 recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785585"> I know that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said earlier today that this is a global recession that has impacted these prices. That is simply not true. This is a Liberal-NDP-made problem that the Liberals refuse to fix. In fact, they are doubling down by voting to increase the carbon tax yet again on April 1 and quadrupling that carbon tax to 61¢ a litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785586"> The facts are clear. Food inflation in Canada is 36% higher than it is in the United States. That clearly shows that this is not a global recession; this is an NDP-Liberal recession that is caused by increasing taxes and increasing spending and is having a trickle-down effect on every aspect of Canada's economy. Rather than learn from those mistakes, the Liberals are ploughing ahead, as I said, by increasing that carbon tax yet again. The Liberals like to say, “Well, Canadians just do not understand what we are trying to do; they are just not listening.” The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> liked to say, “We are in the midst of a vibecession. Canadians have really never had it so good.” The finance minister just is not communicating it well enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785587"> Well, I guess the truth is that the Liberals are clearly out of touch because the people they are talking to truly have never had it so good. They are the Liberal insiders, Liberal members and their friends in corporate Canada who are benefiting from these slush funds and these scandals. Again, while Canadians are lined up at food banks, the Liberal-NDP government is lining the pockets of its insiders and its friends to the detriment of Canadian taxpayers, who are the ones who are truly paying the bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785588">It shows just how out of touch the government is when the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said that she knows people cannot afford to put food on the table, but the solution to that is just to cancel their Disney+, park their car and ride their bike. I would love for the finance minister to come to my rural Alberta riding, where we had two feet of snow a week ago, to say, “I just need you guys to park your truck and ride your bike.” It seems like a joke, but this is not a joke.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785589"> I will finish with this. This is about the level of this scandal. This is $400 million of taxpayer money and the Liberals need to explain to Canadians why they blew it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785619"> One thing I would like the member to talk about is the absolute disaster that is the capital gains tax increases on farmers and how it is going to hamper succession planning. We heard heartbreaking stories about young farmers who are not going to be able to continue on the family farm because of this capital gains increase. The fact is that the minister has not talked to anyone and did not even know that it was in the budget. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785621">The member is exactly right. This is another example of the Liberals ploughing through a policy without giving it the least bit of due diligence. When my colleague, the member for Regina—Lewvan, asked the <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> whether he knew that the capital gains inclusion rate change was going to be in the budget, he said no. He asked how many farm groups and farmers they had consulted with after the fact, and whether they had brought those comments to the cabinet table. There was no answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785622">At the committee, we have had farmers literally crying about the impact that this is going to have on their ability, that young generation, to take on the family farm, burdened by additional debt, and more so for the years of succession planning that has gone into it that is going to devastate the retirement of many farm families, which is going to be detrimental for our farmers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785623">Madam Speaker, it is always an honour and a privilege to be able to rise to speak on behalf of the great people of southwest Saskatchewan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785624">I just want to take a moment to wish everybody a merry Christmas and a happy new year. I want to point out that we are in the Advent season. The first two candles of the Advent wreath have been lit, with the first candle, of course, representing hope and the second candle representing faith. The third candle, coming up this Sunday, will be the candle that represents joy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785625">I want to take some time to speak a bit about some of the good work that is happening around southwest Saskatchewan. I think of all the families and businesses that have been put into hard times based on the cost of living crisis, a lot of which has been caused by the government. Many of the scandals the government is being caught in are leading to a lot of the issues being caused. When we hear on Monday what the deficit is going to be, when the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> finally lets the House know what that number is, it is going to be shocking to a lot of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785626">It is no surprise to a lot of people what is happening, when they look at what is going on with our food banks and what all the different organizations are up to. I want to highlight a couple of great organization I read about in the news, as well as a couple of individuals. Last week, when I was flipping through the local news, I saw the story of a family in Swift Current. They were shopping at Canadian Tire, and they said that one of their family traditions is to fill an entire shopping cart full of toys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785627">The Salvation Army runs a program called Toy Mountain, and over 500 children are signed up for the program, to be able to get a couple of Christmas presents this year. The Harlos family, including daughters Kaylee and Taylor, filled an entire shopping cart with toys and piled them up on day one of this event that the Salvation Army puts on in Swift Current. I really want to give a big shout-out to the Harlos family for doing that. I also read that Haubie Yard Maintenance and Landscaping filled a couple of shopping carts as well to be able to pile onto the mountain of toys, so I give it a quick shout-out as well for doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785628">I also read that in Kindersley a couple of different things have happened. The Kindersley &amp; District Food Bank, the Salvation Army there and the West Central Crisis and Family Support Centre hold a drive as well to gather food and toys for people in need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785629">Also, the Kindersley &amp; District Co-op and the RCMP held a toy drive day called Cram the Cruiser, and they managed to fill an RCMP truck cruiser four times with food and toys for kids in the area. That was remarkable. They filled 360 food bags for families in the area, and they also had over $7,300 in cash donations that was donated to the Salvation Army to help families in need this Christmas season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785630">I know that there are several other great organizations also doing similar things. I do not have enough time to list all of them here tonight, but a few of the great groups include the Kinsmen and Kinette Club, among others in various communities that are doing great work to try to make sure everybody has an opportunity to have a warm meal, to have a few presents underneath the tree for their kids and to truly celebrate the joy, hope and love that Christmas really means and that are reflected upon. I just want to give a big shout-out to the people who have done these great things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785631">With the SDTC fund, there were over 180 conflicts of interest and $330 million that the Auditor General was able to find in her time auditing it. There are many irregularities that have occurred over time. I will be able to spend more time tomorrow, when I finish my speech, to be able to really break it down and get into a lot of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785632">When I look at the number of $330 million identified by the Auditor General, I start to think about what $330 million could mean for organizations and families. We look at the inflationary crisis we are still dealing with and how much money people now have to pay to buy essentials to put on their table; $330 million that was misappropriated and given to organizations and individuals would have gone a long way toward helping to keep the cost a bit lower for families for the groceries they need to buy and the toys they are looking to buy at this time of year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785633">I look forward to continuing the discussion tomorrow.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8785635">Madam Speaker, I am speaking tonight about the Liberals' indigenous procurement scandal. We need to be very clear about what indigenous leaders have repeatedly told us at the various committees that have been studying this: that abuses of indigenous procurement under the Liberal government have become systemic. The Assembly of First Nations said “the majority” of those who benefit from these procurement set-asides are actually not indigenous. Liberals have trumpeted a 5% target, but Chief Joanna Bernard from the AFN has said it is closer to 1%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785636">We have repeatedly heard from indigenous witnesses, and every indigenous group has said there are serious, major problems in this program. Sometimes it is people like the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, outright pretending to be indigenous for personal advantage. In some cases, they are shell companies or shady joint ventures that are set up to exploit these programs with all the benefit going to non-indigenous actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785637">This week, we had another example revealed of this, a very significant example. This was a non-indigenous company, a Canadian health care agency, that was supposedly in joint venture with an indigenous company. The reality was that, according to the evidence we heard, the indigenous side of the partnership was exploited. All of the benefit and all of the work went to the Canadian health care agency. This was years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785638">At the time, the auditor himself came forward with the fact that he thought there was criminal activity, the invention of names of employees and fraud going on. People attempt to defraud the government, we know that, but in this case the auditor told the government about an instance of fraud, and he was told the government did not want to bring it to the RCMP. He recommended it be brought to the RCMP, and unbelievably, the government decided not to share this information with the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785639">We have the issue with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> pretending to be indigenous and his company, Global Health Imports, misrepresenting itself as indigenous-owned to try to get these contracts. We have now this issue of a Canadian health care agency. More broadly, we have indigenous leaders saying that, systematically, there are abuses of this program. Then, the Liberal government is interested in championing claims that it has made progress in terms of its target, so it has an incentive to turn a blind eye when these abuses take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785640">On the one hand, we have bad actors, non-indigenous companies, that have an incentive to misrepresent their identities, to pretend to be indigenous to get these contracts. On the other hand, we have a government that is more interested in virtue signalling than in actually achieving results. It is more interested in being able to make statements claiming it has realized its targets when it has not. Companies misrepresent themselves as indigenous to get these contracts and the government turns a blind eye to be able to say it has achieved targets that in reality it has not achieved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785641">We have seen over the months that Conservatives have been looking into this and bringing attention to this abuse that Liberals have tried to cover it up, tried to cast aspersions at us and make all kinds of claims to bury the reality. However, here is the reality: We know now that they had information brought to them about criminal activity, fraud, by those pretending to be indigenous in order to take contracts intended for indigenous people. The victims of this are the taxpayer and indigenous communities. This evidence was brought to the government, and the government, in fact, buried it. It did not bring it forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785642">Why have the Liberals failed so badly and why have they not prioritized results?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785644">Here we are again. It is truly incredible that the member would suggest he supports indigenous people the day after every single MP in his caucus voted against essential funding for indigenous health care, housing, school food and school infrastructure, including two schools in my home province of New Brunswick. Earlier last week, his party blocked the first nations clean water act from moving forward to the Senate. We will take no lessons from Conservatives when it comes to standing up for indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785645">Many allegations are being made in the House that have not been backed up. Specifically, I would like to address the issue of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>. The company in question was never listed on the indigenous business directory. I want to be crystal clear about what this means. It means that the company has never been part of the government's procurement strategy for indigenous businesses. The company was not awarded any contracts through the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785646">The member has spent hours at the government operations committee hearing about this program. I would think it would be well understood by now, but here we are again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785647">I will say that relevant concerns have been raised in our committee work, and I will point out that, if a problem is suspected with the supplier's business integrity, the case can be referred to Public Services and Procurement Canada to be assessed. Based on the assessment of each situation's specific circumstances, PSPC may then take steps to suspend or debar the supplier from future contracts awarded by the Government of Canada, and rightly so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785648">It is most important to note the good this program has done, as well as that it is supported by indigenous leaders and has benefited many indigenous businesses across the country. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> also heard about this yesterday at the indigenous and northern affairs committee, where witnesses such as Brian Doxtator, an entrepreneur and member of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte, told the member how a joint venture allowed his business to grow and create more jobs for indigenous people. Specifically, this was with a non-indigenous company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785649">Fundamentally, these programs are a building block toward economic reconciliation, which is a cornerstone of supporting strong, healthy indigenous communities. The procurement strategy is a catalyst for forging long-term relationships that help businesses build capacity and achieve self-sufficiency. Involving indigenous businesses in the supply chain creates a wealth of opportunities that often stay in their home communities. This, in turn, supports local economic development, helps to develop employment opportunities and skill building, and generates revenue; all of this can help support the preservation of indigenous cultures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785650">Indigenous leaders have told us that they support the program and that they want it to stay. Moving forward, we will work with indigenous partners to ensure ongoing improvements of the program.</ParaText>

She has said that there is now going to be an investigation, yet we have the <Affiliation DbId="311628" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> taking this defensive posture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785653">Indigenous identity fraud is when people who are not indigenous pretend to be indigenous in order to take benefits that are supposed to go to indigenous people. In fact, this is rampant in programs run by the government. Over 1,000 businesses have had to be removed from the indigenous business directory, but there have been zero consequences for any business.

              <ParaText id="8785656">Again, there are some leaps being made here. The <Affiliation DbId="278911" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has also committed to an external audit of the program to encourage the ongoing improvement in collaboration with partners, as well as always listening to those indigenous leaders, not only when it benefits the narrative that they are trying to spin. The continued exclusion of indigenous people from our economy costs the Canadian economy $27.7 billion every year. The Indigenomics Institute projects that the indigenous economy has the potential to grow from $32 billion to $100 billion in the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785657">When first nations, Inuit and Métis communities have access to economic opportunities, we all benefit, and that is what this program is about. It seems that we all agree that such initiatives as the 5% minimum target are important and worth protecting. As I already said, we will continue to improve and support the program, to make sure it is delivering for first nations, Inuit and Métis businesses and communities.</ParaText>

I want to draw the attention of the <Affiliation DbId="311645" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> to annex 4, this loose-leaf piece of paper that was added to the annex. It was actually a separate document. There was a printed document and a bunch of loose-leaf pieces of paper from a photocopier. I want to draw the attention of the parliamentary secretary to the following numbers, because they are in the plan: The plan assumes that, in 2025, 816,900 persons will be allowed into the country and that, in 2026, 659,036 will be allowed in. If we look at the outflow numbers, it assumes that 1.26 million will leave the country in 2025 and that 1.1 million will leave the country in 2026.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785662">To that end, we are working on a strong, smart and tough border plan, which includes immediate actions at the border as well as short-term investments and measures to bolster our posture. Our government has made significant efforts in the past years to combat cross-border criminality and transnational organized crime, particularly around the issues of human smuggling, drugs and firearm smuggling, as well as trafficking. In budget 2024 alone, we announced funding totalling $399.5 million over five years, and $69.2 million ongoing, for the CBSA to support the processing of asylum claims and facilitate removals. The results speak for themselves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785663">We have recently seen record-breaking seizures of methamphetamine as well as cocaine, alongside arrests linked to firearms trafficking. Collaborative efforts between the CBSA, the RCMP and other Canadian and international law enforcement partners, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have been central in clamping down on cross-border threats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785664">Partnerships with U.S. law enforcement agencies and partners have already enabled several successful law enforcement actions, including Project Moneypenny, a collaboration that saw the disruption of a firearms trafficking operation and led to the seizure of 173 smuggled firearms, drugs and other proceeds of crime, coupled with dozens of arrests. These great examples of co-operation between all partners and successful stories of seizures show, clearly, that our system is working, that our border is secure and that Canadians and Americans are safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785665"> We have no intention of stopping here. We will continue to invest and support our law enforcement and border agencies to ensure that they have the human resources as well as the tools they need to enhance the security and integrity of our border and to respond to any potential threats or surges well into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785666">That is why, in coming days, our government will make further announcements to strengthen Canada's border security posture. These additional measures will focus on providing the resources and tools the RCMP and the CBSA need, whether it be by leveraging new technologies, providing additional drones and helicopters or putting more boots on the ground and boats in the water to ensure that all areas are controlled. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8785671"> Just today, the first ministers were meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to go through many issues, such as the one we are discussing this evening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785672">I have total confidence in the ability of these brave women and men, who every single day work tirelessly to keep our border safe and secure. We will continue to support them, because they support us, by increasing human resources, technologies and the equipment they need to continue to protect the integrity of our border and ensure border security readiness in the face of uncertainties. We will do so while also strengthening our collaboration with provincial, municipal, indigenous and American law enforcement partners. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8785673">I invite my colleagues to leave their political agendas behind and to join us in speaking in unity to show that Canada is and will continue to be a strong, reliable and trustworthy partner.</ParaText>
