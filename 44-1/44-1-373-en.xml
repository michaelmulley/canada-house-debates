              <ParaText id="8719925">Madam Speaker, I move that the third report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, presented on Monday, April 25, 2022, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719926">I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278224" Type="2">Sturgeon River—Parkland</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719927">Today, we are discussing a report from the public safety and national security committee about guns and gangs, and frankly, we have been on this for quite some time. We began this study over three years ago, and boy oh boy have things gone downhill since then regarding gangs, guns and gun violence in this country. In fact, over the last nine years of the Liberal government, gun violence has gone up 116%, despite all of the announcements and all of the promises. We see that every day in the headlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719928">Violent crime has doubled in the past nine years. Sexual assaults are up 75%. Sexual violations against children are up 120%. Canadians may be wondering why their once safe neighbourhoods have become havens for criminals. Why do we keep hearing announcements from the Liberals that something will be done about gun violence yet it is getting worse? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719929">One of the reasons is the soft-on-crime legislation the Liberal government continues to bring forward. In 2019, the Liberals brought forward Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which was specifically to reform the bail system. Members may have heard about the bail system from police and premiers across the country, because in the last few years, police associations, police unions and premiers from every political stripe have been screaming for change from the Liberal government. Of course, that has been falling on deaf ears.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719930">They are demanding bail reform because it is exhausting our police services. They are unable to keep up and keep our communities safe because of the catch-and-release policies brought forward by Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. They are rearresting the same repeat violent offenders every other day, who are apparently going without being held accountable under the current Liberal government. We can see that right in the legislation. The aim of Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> was to bring forward the least onerous conditions for bail. In essence, it made bail the default position for violent repeat offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719931">That was in 2019. Here we are a few years later, and the impacts of that legislation have really come home to roost. Gangs and those committing violent gun crime in our communities are getting off scot-free in the revolving door of the so-called justice system under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719932">That same year, we saw Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>, which made changes to the parole system so that it was least restrictive. Some people may wonder what all these things mean. These are legal terms. Unless they are a Crown prosecutor, it is difficult to understand them. For Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>, I will talk a bit about what the Harper government was doing. Remember that under the Harper government, violent crime went down 26% and there was a decrease in gun violence in Canada. However, since the Liberals have come in, there has been over a 50% increase in violent crime and, as I said, over a 100% increase in gun violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719933">If we look at Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>, we see the priority for parole. Again, this is about violent offenders in jail with reason: They have committed atrocities in neighbourhoods, have hurt innocent people, have used guns illegally and have been involved in gangs causing crime and chaos in our streets. Under the Harper government, the parole parameters were as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719934">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">the Service uses measures that are consistent with the protection of society, staff members and offenders and that are limited to only what is necessary and proportionate to attain the purposes of this Act</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719935">The number one priority under Harper, under a tough-on-crime government that saw a decrease in violent crime among parolees, was for Correctional Services to use “measures that are consistent with the protection of society”. Under Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>, under the Liberals, this was changed to the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719936">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">the Service uses the least restrictive measures consistent with the protection of society, staff members and offenders</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719937">The first priority became the least restrictive measures. That is important in a legal context. That signals to the Parole Board, corrections, judges and lawyers that the priority is the least restrictive measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719938">Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document> also facilitated, as we have heard, the movement of folks from maximum to medium to minimum security. For example, with Paul Bernardo, we have heard a lot about this in the last year. Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document> helped facilitate his move from maximum security, where he should spend the rest of his days, to medium security. This bill has further permitted actions like that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719939">These bills have an impact. We debated them. The Conservatives fiercely fought these bills. We said this was going to happen and, of course, it did happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719940"> Since I have been elected, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> has passed, in 2022. This bill, astoundingly, had soft-on-crime measures for criminals committing violent acts with guns. It removed mandatory prison time for individuals who commit drive-by shootings, robbery with a gun and extortion with a gun, or who discharge a firearm with intent to injure or use a firearm in the commission of an offence. All of these things had mandatory prison time. Someone who did a horrible crime and endangered their neighbourhood and community would go to jail for sure. They would be removed from society for a while, and rightly so, but Bill C-5 took away that requirement and, in fact, codified house arrest for a number of offences, like sexual assault. Someone can rape someone and serve their sentence in the comfort of their home. The priority of the Liberal government in bill after bill is making parole and bail easier to get for violent offenders and having less accountability and less jail time for people who commit gun crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719941">We now have police associations across the country calling out the Liberals for their lack of action. Actually, that is not true. They have done a lot of things, have they not? They have done a lot of things on guns, but what they have not done is gone after the people responsible for gun violence. They have gone after people like me and the colleagues behind me, law-abiding citizens with firearms, which have been in Canada since its inception. They are part of our heritage of hunting and sport shooting and competing in the Olympics, and represent national pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719942">That has been the target for the Liberals over the last nine years, people like us, innocent, law-abiding Canadians. They are the least likely to commit crime. Why is that? They are heavily vetted by the RCMP. They are tested. They are trained. We should take pride in our system, which ensures that only lawful, responsible people can own firearms. That is how it should be, yet those people have been the targets and punching bags, repeatedly, of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719943">Over and over, the Liberals fought election platforms targeting these people. Our hunters, like Grandpa Joe with his hunting rifle, have been the number one target of the Liberal government over the last nine years. Gang violence is up, violent crime is up and gun violence is up, and meanwhile, legislation after legislation is coming after lawful gun owners. That is going to cost the taxpayer billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719944">We know about the Liberals' so-called buyback program, which is a misnomer because they are not buying back anything but confiscating lawfully owned property from lawful Canadians. So far, their confiscation regime has not taken one firearm from the hands of criminals and has already cost the taxpayer $100 million. It will purportedly cost, when all is said and done, as high as $6 billion. That is to go after Grandpa Joe while the Liberals, with their legislation, let criminals in and out of jail, with no jail time in many circumstances, and out early if they do finally get to jail for committing violent gun crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719945">That is the priority of the Liberal government. That is why we are in this situation today. Those in Brampton, for example, see headlines every single day. The police, who are on the front lines risking their lives every day to protect society, saying goodbye to their families in the morning and praying that they come home, have to face these gangbangers every day. They know them on a first-name basis because they have arrested them so many times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719946">What are the police saying? They are saying that 85%, minimum, of the firearms and handguns smuggled in from the United States are being used in crimes. That is where the problem is coming from: violent criminals smuggling guns into Canada from the United States. We need to do better at our border. We need to ensure that police are being invested in. We need to ensure that legislative tools are being put in place that finally hold criminals accountable after getting off scot-free over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719947">Ultimately, we will have a lot of work to do should the Conservatives get into government in the next number of months. Priority number one is going to be to stop the crime, cut taxes, of course, and finally make life more affordable. Stopping the crime is going to be a top priority for our government, finally holding criminals accountable. That is our mission, and we will fulfill that for communities and keep them safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719948"> Madam Speaker, we just heard what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has instructed his Conservative caucus to talk about: crime in our communities. It is consistent with much of the misleading information that the Conservative Party puts on social media virtually every day. The bill the member is so critical of, the bail bill, is a bill the Conservative Party voted in favour of. It is the very same bail bill that provinces in all regions of the country supported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719949">I am wondering if the member can reflect on whether the Conservative Party today, because it might have flip-flopped on this, still supports the bail reform legislation that was brought forward by the government not that long ago, the bail reform bill that she herself voted in favour of.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719950"> Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> was not listening to my remarks. I was talking about Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which was passed by the Liberals with support from the NDP in 2019. That is what caused all of the mayhem that police are now having to deal with. The member is talking about Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document>. Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> was a seven-page bill in contrast to Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> that was 200 pages. It was a measly effort for the Liberals to say they were doing something about bail. That passed well over a year ago and it obviously has done nothing to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719951"> In fact, if the member does not believe me, as he is saying I am spreading misinformation, let us hear from the Toronto Police. I will just conclude on this. The Toronto Police Association, which represents 8,000 police officers, said, “ Our communities are experiencing a 45% increase in shootings and a 62% increase in gun-related homicides compared to this time last year. What difference does your handgun ban make when 85% of guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States?” It continued with, “Your statement is out of touch and offensive to victims of crime and police officers everywhere.” That is what the police say to the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719952">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for her speech. The Standing Committee on the Status of Women is currently studying this increase, this femicide epidemic. Yesterday, former senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu came to testify, and I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about Bill <Document DbId="11474386" Type="4">S-205</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719953">My colleague spoke about violence against women, but we do not understand why, in Bill S-205, the maximum period of good behaviour was reduced from 2 years to 12 months, when, for some criminals, this is an extremely critical period of time. This is precisely the time when they harbour animosity towards their former spouse, and that can last more than 12 months. Reducing this maximum period from 2 years to 12 months is only one of the ill-advised measures adopted when we finally voted again on Bill S-205.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8719955">The member has pointed out a number of things that happened at status of women last year by Liberal and NDP members who looked to gut the bill. Really, the goal of that bill was to ensure that an abuser, an intimate partner, who is a life threat or a physical threat to a woman and her children, was held accountable. What ended up passing was one good step, but there were many provisions to be tough on those abusers, to keep them away from the people they violate and abuse, that were gutted by Liberal and NDP members. That is just another example of them going soft on the criminals at the cost of the victim's safety. We can go on all day, in fact, about what they have done.</ParaText>

Tony Clement stole $50 million of border security money to buy gazebos in his riding that left us open to handguns coming in. Stephen Harper cut 1,100 CBSA positions to allow handguns in. Crime prevention programs were cut under Stephen Harper. This party has manipulated and falsified information to scare people while they supported criminals and while Tony Clement was taking money, which should have protected people, to buy fake boats and create fake lakes all across Muskoka.

              <ParaText id="8719988"> Madam Speaker, after nine years, the NDP-Liberals are not worth the crime or the chaos that they have unleashed on Canada's streets. This study on gun and gang violence was conducted back in 2022, two years ago. In rereading our common-sense Conservative recommendations and conclusions that were made at that committee and in that report, I see that everything we said at the time has come to pass. Liberal policies have done nothing to stop gun crime in this country. The legacy of the current Liberal government will be a weak justice system, the absence of good enforcement and a border that is leaking smuggled guns and stolen cars as it never has before. In fact, violent gun crime has increased by over 100% since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office with the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719989"> Now, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been saying that he will ban the firearms of law-abiding Canadians while completely ignoring the crime wave that his government has unleashed with its soft-on-crime policies. After nine years, committing a crime and getting away with it has never been easier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719990">Professional organized criminals are taking note; they are taking full advantage of the government's soft-on-crime policies. Canada has become a massive exporter of stolen cars and a net importer of illegal firearms under the current Liberal government. At one time in 2022, there was a vehicle being stolen every five minutes in Canada, and we know what these stolen vehicles are used for. They are used to fund organized crime and international terrorism, as well as to finance the purchase of drugs and guns, which are wreaking havoc on our streets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719991">These sophisticated, industrial-level organized criminals are targeting Canada precisely because of the soft-on-crime policies of the government. Auto theft is not a victimless crime, despite what some have said. It is a crime that costs all Canadians because our insurance premiums go up; moreover, as we increasingly see, these desperate criminals are carjacking people's vehicles in broad daylight. In fact, in some cases, vehicles are being stolen with children sitting in the back seat. It is an absolute disgrace. Why does it only take $1 billion in insured losses in our auto-theft sector for the government to finally start taking action?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719992">Conservatives have been consistent in calling out the Liberal government's abysmal record. In fact, back in 2022, at the public safety committee, we had the then chief of the Toronto Police Service come to testify about the government's gun buyback programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719993"> I asked the chief of police, “If the government's policy was that they wanted to buy hard drugs off the street [in a drug buyback] as a means to reduce the proliferation of drugs on the street, would that be an effective tool to get hard drugs off the street?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719994">This is what Chief Demkiw said: “I do not believe it would be an effective tool.”</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> I would not suggest it was effective for gun policy. The City of Toronto's experience is that guns that are being used in crime are not from law-abiding citizens. They're guns being smuggled from the United States. Those engaged in handling those firearms are not law-abiding, licensed gun owners; they are criminals with no firearms licence.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719998">That is coming from the Toronto chief of police. The Liberals have now squandered $70 million, and they are promising to spend over $1 billion more on this gun confiscation program. They have yet to seize a single firearm. Conservatives, experts and frontline police officers have all said that this is a flawed approach to crime on our streets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8719999">Let us talk about this border under the Liberals. Conservatives have repeatedly said that this gun confiscation regime was useless. Taxpayer money needs to be spent on the technology and the manpower to secure our borders. The brave men and women of the CBSA have not been given the proper support by the government. At the public safety committee in 2022, the CBSA union representative said, “not only is Canada's ability to prevent smuggling lacking, but its capacity to gather reliable and sound data is also inadequate.” That is after nine years of the current Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720000"> The Liberals can come here and talk about what the Conservatives did, but they have had nine years to take action, and this is what the CBSA union is saying today. Moreover, the representative said, “[T]here's...a zero per cent chance that any illegal weapons entering the country via rail will ever be found.” There is a huge gap at our border. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720001">Canadians have lost faith. As we saw with numerous alleged cases of terrorists who crossed our borders in this past year alone, we have seen ISIS-inspired terrorists evade our borders. United States border statistics have shown that, in 2023, there were 484 matches on the U.S. terrorist watch-list at land ports of entry along the Canada-U.S. border. Since 2017, these numbers have gone up by 123%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720002">How many more of these terrorists are being allowed to cross the border from Canada into the United States? Why is Canada not taking action to protect our border and to assure our ally that we are taking the necessary actions needed not only to protect Canadians but also to protect our allies?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720003">With crime and chaos skyrocketing, police unions have come out publicly. I have never seen such a thing. It is quite unprecedented. They have taken the step of calling out the government's failed record. I am just going to quote some of these police experts. We have the chief of Peel Regional Police, who said that “90 per cent of...firearms that we seize are directly traced back to the U.S.” and that “the remaining 10% are likely also from the U.S.” He also said, “The availability of firearms has just saturated the community”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720004"> The Surrey Police union is saying, “The federal handgun freeze fails to address the real issue: the surge of illegal firearms coming across our borders”. The Toronto Police Association says, “What difference does [their] handgun ban make when 85 per cent of the guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States?” The National Post says, “Peel Police are seizing an illegal gun...every 30 hours — an 87 per cent increase over the year prior.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720005">People can maybe say that they like the government's intent, but if we are judging it by the outcome of this policy, it has been an abysmal failure. In fact, back in 2022, when we had the previous <Affiliation DbId="278567" Type="2">minister of public safety</Affiliation> come to committee, he was more concerned about Canadians who are going to the RCMP and the Canadian firearms program and getting their firearms licence than he was about stopping organized criminals from smuggling guns over our border and committing crimes in Canada. That just shows us what the priorities of the Liberal government have been after these last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720006">Liberals prefer to go after law-abiding hunters, sport shooters and indigenous hunters rather than the real criminals, whom they are giving softer bail sentences to. They are cutting minimum sentences. They are not doing anything to stop the flow of illegal guns over our border or that of stolen vehicles leaving our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720007"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s radical catch-and-release policies are allowing repeat violent offenders to avoid jail. Since the government passed Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which gave a high priority to releasing repeat violent offenders and took away mandatory jail time for certain violent crimes, a crime wave has been unleashed across this country as a result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720008">Data shows that, in 2022, 30% of people who were murdered in Canada were killed by somebody who was out on bail. The outcome of these Liberal policies is shocking. Regardless of what we think about the Liberals' intent, the outcome has been an abject failure. Experts at committee have also said that 68% of car thieves in Ontario spend under six months in jail. These are the ideal conditions for organized criminals, who are carrying out violent crime on our streets, and our communities now offer a low risk but a high reward for criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720009"> In conclusion, in 2015, our country was far safer than it is now. We have become a huge exporter of stolen vehicles. We have also become an exporter of fentanyl. Canada has become the top exporter of fentanyl to the country of Australia. It is absolutely shameful. Canada is becoming a playground for organized crime, and criminals are using our country's lax laws to commit mayhem, bringing crime, death and destruction across the world. This was not the case before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came into power, and it will not be the case after the Conservative government gets into power. We are going to axe the tax, fight the crime, get rid of the corruption and make our streets safe.</ParaText>

The Liberals have increased crime and made our country less safe. It is going to take a Conservative government to fight the crime in this country, to bring back common-sense public safety and justice policies. These policies will ensure that repeat violent offenders stay behind bars so that Canadian streets, Canadian children and Canadian vehicles are safe, and Canadians can walk our streets again. Not that long ago, Canadians felt safe in this country; however, after nine years of the Liberal government, that has changed, and it is a tragic thing. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720034">Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for bringing up that question. Technology is absolutely going to be essential in the fight against not only smuggled guns but also stolen vehicles. However, we cannot view technology as a crutch or an entire solution when we have a policy that lets repeat violent offenders or repeat car thieves out on the street in months. Humans are very capable of adapting to situations, and I worry that whenever we do bring in a new technology, there will be a very smart criminal out there trying to find a way around it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720035">Yes, we need to implement new technologies; however, we also need to do the very basic thing, which is to keep these repeat violent offenders, these repeat car thieves, behind bars. We also need to get people out of a life of crime, especially children, who are very vulnerable to being recruited into crime. We need fewer criminals, and then we will not need the technology as much. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that we have a technological approach, but we also need a strong criminal justice approach. That is what a common-sense Conservative government promises to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720039"> However, I think it is also somewhat of a simplistic solution to say that we need to hire more people. Of course if there are people who are ready and willing to do the job, then we need to give them an opportunity to do the job, but we are facing a recruitment and retention crisis across this country in the military, in the RCMP and at CBSA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720040">We do not need simplistic slogans about how we are just going to hire 2,000 more people to fill jobs.

We also need force multipliers to give those people who are continuing to work all the tools they need to complete the job so they can do the job that two people, three people or four people did previously. That is a solution we need, as well as hiring new people.</ParaText>

What I am asking for is clarity so we know in the future how procedures are going to take place in the House. The practice in the past has been that when the Speaker makes a ruling and asks a member to withdraw and apologize, the matter is dealt with prior to hearing other points of order. What happened today was that you made a ruling, waited a few moments, entertained several other points of order and then chose not to enforce your previous ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720045"> I think this is a very dangerous road for us to go down, and I take my Conservative colleague's point that there has been precedent for this just recently from the Speaker. It does not matter which party is proposing the point of order. I think we need to uphold a situation where the Speaker's ruling is respected and enforced in the moment. If that is not going to be the case, then we are certainly going to increase points of order in the wake of other points of order so we can argue our points and try to overturn the Speaker's ruling.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720091"> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to contribute to this debate on the concurrence of a guns and gangs study that I was pleased to be part of at the public safety committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720092">I am reflecting back on how, since just two years ago, times have changed. That study, which was on something that could have been quite controversial, ended up being one for which we had agreement amongst the members of the committee. We produced a report that the Conservatives actually agreed with when we tabled the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720093">I find it surprising now that, here we are, two years later, and we have rhetoric and nonsense coming from the Conservative Party of Canada on a report that I am really proud of. At the time, I think that all of the members were very proud of it, especially of the way we were able to come together on an issue that is impacting our communities. Young people are joining gangs because of poverty and addiction. We know, and the report reflected this, that investments in communities can make a difference for these young people in whether or not they end up in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720094">I am really disappointed that, once again, the Conservatives are trying to derail our current studies at the public safety committee. We are studying India and foreign interference, through which a Canadian was killed on Canadian soil, as well as Tenet Media and Russia's influence on misinformation in our country. This is something the Conservatives have tried to do repeatedly during both those studies. Today, they are trying to derail those two studies again. Twice we have had Conservatives move motions, once when we had the social media companies in to testify on Russia and once when we had national security experts there, and they were moving motions on completely unrelated topics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720095"> These are issues that are impacting Canadians' lives. It seems like the Conservatives, much like their leader, who refuses to get the security clearance necessary to review, do not really want to study foreign interference. They make a big deal about having an interest in it, but they really do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720096">There is a lot of revisionist thinking going on in this place as well. Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document> passed, and I was proud to be part of the committee when we passed that bill, but the Conservatives keep referring to how the Liberal government brought in the least restrictive measures. It is funny that, when that bill went through committee, Conservatives did not oppose that clause, which was introduced by the NDP. Conservatives did not oppose the least restrictive clause on Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document> when it went through committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720097">However, now, with the revisionist history that has happened over the years, the Conservatives seem to think that they did. Perhaps they want to go back to just check the record of when that bill passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720098"> I am reading a book right now called <I>Indictment</I> by Benjamin Perrin. He was the man who shaped Stephen Harper's tough on crime policies as a special adviser and legal counsel to the prime minister. I want to read a quote from his book. He said, “In fact, I’d like to officially replace the term ‘tough on crime’ with ‘stupid on crime.’ It doesn't work. It makes us less safe, while costing a ton of taxpayers money.” To paraphrase former prime minister Harper's top guy on crime, he is saying tough on crime is tough on taxpayers and stupid on crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720099">The Conservatives like to talk about how they want to keep Canadians safe, yet, time and time again, they have opposed smart gun control measures when we have brought them through the House. In Bill <Document DbId="9710291" Type="3">C-71</Document>, there was a clause that ensured that firearms would be forfeited to the Crown in cases of domestic violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720100">I had a friend whose husband was abusing her, and he was a firearms owner. When she went to court, the judge said that he had to give up his guns. Do members know where those guns went? They went to his brother because there was no requirement at the time that those guns be forfeited to the Crown. My friend lived in fear because she knew that her husband knew where those guns were. We changed that through Bill <Document DbId="9710291" Type="3">C-71</Document>, something the Conservatives have said they are going to repeal. If my friend were to go to court today, those guns would go to the Crown, not to her husband's brother.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720101"> In Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>, we put in three clauses to make women safer: subsection 6.1, which would make an individual ineligible to hold a firearms licence if they are subject to a protection order or have been convicted of an offence involving violence; subsection 70.1, which would oblige a chief firearms officer who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a licensee may have engaged in domestic violence or stalking to revoke the licence within 24 hours; and subsection 70.2, which would automatically revoke the licence of an individual who becomes subject to a protection order and requires them to deliver the guns to a peace officer within 24 hours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720102"> In my opinion, that keeps Canadian women safer. It is unfortunate that the party opposite wants to revoke Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>, which includes those provisions. It also includes provisions around assault-style weapons, something that was used at Polytechnique Montréal, and that anniversary is coming up on December 6. The Conservative Party still refuses to acknowledge that the individual who killed those women on that day was a legal gun owner at the time, much like the person who went into the Quebec City mosque and killed and injured people.</ParaText>

Our amendment is calling on the public safety and national security committee, which the member and I are both part of, to review in detail the situation of crime and bail going on in this country, given what we are seeing day in and day out in the headlines about violent crime committed by those out on bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720130">I have concerns because the member's subamendment, in essence, pushes off the responsibility of committee to look into the violent crime surge we are seeing, and I am just not understanding why she does not value the public safety committee studying this right away. I know we have a lot of priorities. There are a lot of competing important priorities at committee, but surely, given what we are seeing, to push this off by months is, frankly, not responsible.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8720133"> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to talk about this issue, although we discussed the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security's report years ago. It was when the Bloc Québécois proposed to discuss the increase in gun violence. At the time, gun crimes were being committed in broad daylight next to day care centres in cities like Montreal. There had been a shooting in a library. In short, a lot of events led us to determine that we needed to talk about the issue with some urgency. The parties worked really well together to have the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security conduct a study on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720134">We then did an exhaustive study in committee, and a report containing 34 recommendations was released in April 2022. That was a few years ago, when the Hon. Jim Carr was chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. We salute him. We miss him. All that to say that, rereading the various recommendations this morning, I was disappointed to realize that most of them, although the report was published in 2022 and a major firearms act has since been passed, were never implemented by the government. That is really too bad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720135">I welcome the opportunity that we have today to once again talk about the Conservatives' idea, because it still seems to be a hot topic. There has not been much of a decline in violent gun crime in recent years, at least not since this report was tabled, so it is a good idea to talk more about this issue and to put more pressure on the government to do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720136">Earlier, I mentioned to the parliamentary secretary that Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> was indeed a step in the right direction, but that there are a lot of regulations attached to it that have not yet been finalized, even though these are important regulations that could have a positive impact on people's lives, especially the lives of women who are victims of domestic violence. Red flag and yellow flag provisions can provide better protection for these women. It is important to put these measures in pace. We worked hard in committee to create these measures, but they have not yet been implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720137">It is the same thing with all these models of firearms that are still available on the market. People still own assault-type firearms, and they are still in circulation, even though the government banned many of them a few years ago. Some models are extremely similar. As I was saying to my colleague earlier, it does not make sense to me to set up a gun buyback program when people who own a gun on the banned list can hand it over to the government, take the money in return and go out and buy another gun that is basically the same. Why set up a buyback program if that is what is going to happen?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720138">Let us go with a complete ban. Let us sort out the guns that could be used for hunting, because some of the firearms that we identified during the study of Bill C‑21 might be used for hunting. What we proposed to the government at the time was to set up an advisory committee. Why should this be a political decision? We suggested leaving it to neutral experts from all fields to study the matter. We were talking about nearly 500 models that are still out there, and maybe a dozen models that could be used for hunting. We were saying that we should ask these experts to provide recommendations to the government so that the government could then act on them, and that this would then be an opportunity to set up a more serious buyback program instead of taking taxpayers' money just to allow someone to go out and buy a different model.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720139">I will come back to this in more detail, but I also want to talk about the list of 34 recommendations adopted in April 2022. I have to say that we worked well together in committee, and it is quite rare to get unanimity on any topic at the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720140">It was nice to see all the parties agree that the government should do more to make progress on the firearms violence file. The committee made very good recommendations. I will mention a few of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720141">In particular, we wanted to improve data collection about firearms smuggling. This is a very big report. It discusses legislative changes concerning assault-type weapons, as well as illegal firearms trafficking at the border. In particular, it mentions the border crossing at Akwesasne and the collaborative efforts between the various police forces. It also deals extensively with the tracing of firearms and the training of law enforcement officials in this area. In particular, it recommends ongoing training for RCMP officers. Many of the recommendations in the report relate to tracing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720142">We wanted the Government of Canada to make an effort to divert young people away from gang culture. That is very important. We need to implement preventive measures to reach young people, often from disadvantaged communities, who might be attracted by criminal gangs and commit crimes. It is all related. When we talk about firearms trafficking, about gun violence, we can assume that it is related to drug trafficking, human trafficking or even auto theft. We also discussed that aspect extensively. These are criminal activities that finance other criminal activities, including firearms trafficking. We asked the government to do more to prevent this type of criminal activity. In particular, we asked the government to broaden the national crime prevention strategy by adding more measures. We also asked that it hold a national gun and gang summit in Ottawa. That has not happened, despite the fact that it was recommended in 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720143"> Take auto theft, for example. A few months ago, when I raised the issue in the House of Commons, the Conservatives were on board because it is a widespread phenomenon, particularly in Montreal and Toronto. The government wanted to act quickly and launched a national summit on auto theft, which appears to have yielded results. I visited the port of Montreal and the Canada Border Services Agency site nearby. We saw that the police, Équité Association and the Canada Border Services Agency were working together to search containers. We saw how it all works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720144">Sometimes when we raise issues in the House of Commons, we think it might have an impact on real life. It is interesting. I figure that, if it works for auto theft, why would it not work for gun violence and gangs? A national summit is always a timely idea, and it allows everyone to sit at the same table and talk about what to do next. That is still a useful recommendation that can be implemented any time with little expense. It is always good to establish communication between all the stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720145">We also asked the government to tackle the illegal drug trade. As I said earlier, there is still a connection to the opioid epidemic, which leads to things like gun violence and illegal tobacco sales. All these things are related. It is important to bulk up police resources to fight gang violence. People often talk about how important it is to have more officers who can do this work. It is the same with indigenous policing. I talked about the Akwesasne police earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720146">Indigenous police services have been seeking recognition as essential services for years now. They want more resources so they can do their job. I am not targeting that particular indigenous nation at all, but everyone knows this is a very strategic location between Quebec, Ontario and the United States where there is a lot of trafficking. Many people can intervene in that territory, but they have to work together, and they have to work with the Akwesasne police. The report called for enhanced funding and collaboration. Simply put, it called on the Government of Canada to give them the means to achieve their objective of taking action against trafficking in guns, drugs, tobacco and humans.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720147">We see it with migrants who try to come in as part of an irregular arrival. Some have died trying to cross at this very spot. Increased control is really key.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720148">The government was asked to “investigate the need for enhanced border surveillance of international commercial rail operations and ocean freight shipping operations.” The Bloc Québécois produced a supplementary report to this study. Our recommendation was to improve recommendation 19, by pointing out that it is not just a matter of investigating the need, which is quite broad, but rather of strengthening border surveillance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720149">Many, many, witnesses appeared before the committee. Several of them, including the president of the Customs and Immigration Union, told us that containers arriving by rail and ship are very poorly monitored. If someone can hide cars in there, they can certainly hide firearms. That is why there must be increased surveillance. We asked for that recommendation to be tightened up a little. That is why we included it in the Bloc Québécois supplementary report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720150">Recommendation 20 called on the government to “allocate additional human and financial resources to the Canada Border Services Agency”. It is a bit ironic, then, to see that hours of service are being reduced at 35 border crossings in Canada, including 10 in Quebec. The media reported it this week. Meanwhile, the President-elect of the United States, Mr. Trump, is threatening to deport millions of people. Understandably, these people may try to cross irregularly into Canada, because there is a loophole in the safe third country agreement that allows them to come to Canada. If they remain undetected for 14 days, they can make a refugee claim at a border crossing or on the Government of Canada's website, with a perfectly regular application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720151">In other words, people are being encouraged to break the law, enter Canada illegally and then submit a perfectly legal application to remain in Canada. Meanwhile, our integration capacity is already stretched to the limit. That is definitely the case in Quebec, and we are starting to hear other provinces say that it is getting difficult for them to properly receive these individuals as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720152">We are telling the government that it needs to pay attention. We are hearing reports that the next U.S. government intends to deport millions of people, but we have no plan for the border. For years, we have been saying that there needs to be more staff, more human resources, but now the government is saying that it is going to reduce operating hours and staff numbers at certain border crossings, including strategic crossings at the Canada-U.S. border. It worries us a bit to hear that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720153">This morning, I had a meeting with the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and I raised this issue with him. If the staff are being reassigned, where are they going? Is the government planning to deploy them to another part of the border to prevent this scenario? I asked the minister that question in the House several times, and he said that everything was going well for now and that when a crisis does arise, it will be dealt with then. That is the problem with this government. Instead of anticipating problems and crises, it waits until the problem blows up in its face before taking action. It is always just a little too late. That is too bad. As far back as April 2022, when it released this report, the committee was already recommending that additional resources be allocated to the Canada Border Services Agency. That still has not been done. In any case, that is what the Customs and Immigration Union is telling us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720154"> Recommendation 22 calls on the government to “develop a standardized schedule and definitions of prohibited firearms within the <I>Criminal Code</I> of Canada, with an emphasis on simplicity and consistency”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720155">The government decided to do the exact opposite with Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> by proposing an evergreen definition of prohibited firearms. It is difficult to explain what that means in lay terms, but it basically means that the government is prohibiting firearms that do not yet exist. Those that are already in circulation can remain in circulation, but new firearms that are created will be prohibited. As a result, manufacturers are deciding not to create firearms that meet those criteria. They are already getting around the law. In my opinion, this shows that the government's approach did not do much good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720156">We were forced to adopt that proposal because the previous one was even worse. The government proposed adding a list of just over 1,000 firearms to the Criminal Code. With an endless list of firearms, making changes to the Criminal Code would have been a total nightmare. Although there does not seem to be one perfect solution, that one was far from ideal. As I was saying, firearms that can be extremely dangerous, that can be used for malicious purposes, are being left in circulation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720157">We know there are law-abiding people out there. That needs to be said. For years, there have been gun owners who have done everything that was asked of them and who take good care of their firearms. They are not a problem for society. We always hear the argument that it is the illegal guns, criminals and street gangs that cause trouble, but the honest gun owners who pay the price. That said, when someone chooses to own a firearm, they have to be aware that there are regulations around gun ownership and that they have to be careful.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720158"> That is why I think it is always good to have regulations and laws for people who decide to keep an object in their home that is capable of taking someone's life. However, it is true that it may seem contradictory to leave the door open for criminals and gun traffickers and always go after law-abiding gun owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720159">The government's approach was to lump them all together. Even though some of these weapons were used for hunting, the government included them in its bill to ban them. People told the committee that indigenous communities have used firearms like the SKS for hunting for years. Even though mass murders have been committed with SKS rifles, it does not necessarily follow that this weapon should be banned. That is why we asked the government to create an advisory committee with independent experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720160">I remember that when I got home after Parliament rose in June 2023, I wrote an email to the <Affiliation DbId="278567" Type="2">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>'s team to recommend individuals and experts who could be part of the advisory committee. I was told that it was coming and that they would take my suggestions, so I was hoping it would come soon, but it has been radio silence since then. It has been a little over a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720161">Members will recall that there was a cabinet shuffle about a month later, in July 2023. I understand that this can lead to delays, but nothing has happened to this day. Some groups are still sounding the alarm. In fact, I am meeting with PolyRemembers later today, and they say that they have only received half of all the things they were promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720162">I want to come back to the infamous gun buyback program. It is a good idea, but if a person can sell their gun to the government and then buy another one that does exactly the same thing, the whole exercise was pointless, and taxpayers' money was spent for nothing. There is still a lot that needs to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720163">Earlier this week, the Police Association of Ontario wrote a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. The <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> of the Bloc Québécois received a copy. The letter mentions that a significant number of illegal guns are making their way into Canada. We need to look into that. So many gun-related issues remain to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720164">I like the new Minister of Public Safety. I trust him. The two of us have good conversations, but since he took office, it seems like things are not getting done. It is too bad, because we, the opposition, did our part in the parliamentary legislative process. Whatever we could do, we did. Now the ball is in the government's court. Addressing this issue will require regulatory measures that only the government can take, but the government is not budging. That is too bad, because the government was elected and re-elected on the promise of improving gun control. Soon it could lose power, and the issue will remain unresolved. It is too bad for the people who believed its promise, like women of PolyRemembers, who have been fighting for nearly 35 years now. They will not get to see these much-touted regulations take effect. It really is too bad. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720168">Madam Speaker, it is abundantly clear that the Conservatives' intention is to hijack the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security's agenda, either with this motion or another one. Every time our committee meets, they move that we talk about something other than the two studies on the agenda, namely Russian disinformation in Canada and Indian interference or India-Canada relations. I am having a hard time understanding why the Conservative Party does not want to discuss these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720169">At the same time, it is becoming a partisan sideshow when it really should not be. Foreign interference is an extremely serious issue for our democratic institutions, particularly since an election is imminent. We do not want to go through the same thing as last time. I get the feeling that this is giving the Liberals the opportunity to repeat ad nauseam that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> still does not have his security clearance.

Since then, we have been pushing the Liberal government to rehire them. It seems to have a lot of money when it comes to spending on the Trans Mountain pipeline, $35 billion; $18 billion in fossil fuel subsidies; hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants like McKinsey, but it cannot afford to invest in our border security to ensure illegal weapons do not come into Canada.</ParaText>

It is a great report; it is a powerful report, but nobody has wanted to act on it until now.

              <ParaText id="8720197"> When I say violence, I am talking about young gang members who are coming into very small communities, like Kirkland Lake and Timmins, up the James Bay coast, to prey on people suffering from addictions. We dealt with the Hells Angels 10 years ago. They were organized gangs; they were big gangs, but what we are dealing with now are gangs that have a certain level of chaos. When I talk to frontline workers and OPP officers I have known for years, they say they just want to survive and get home at the end of the day.

              <ParaText id="8720209"> Madam Speaker, I was speaking about the policies that we had in place up to the time of Brian Mulroney and Paul Martin, when we had investments in public housing. We were then told the great lie of Paul Martin, who delivered that lie with a straight face, that the private sector would step up and build all the housing we need. It did not happen and people began to fall through the cracks. How did that lead to where we are today? It was a slow-moving hurricane. Slowly, year by year, the housing crisis and the homeless crisis got worse, to the point we are at today, where 235,000 Canadians face homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720210">That was the first part of the undermining of our communities. The second part was the opioid crisis. We know that it started with Purdue Pharma and the licensing of OxyContin, which was first licenced in the mid- to late 1990s in Canada, despite the fact that there was a massive increase in opioid per pill. It should have been in a restricted category but it was not. Why was OxyContin so key? It was not until about 2008 or 2009 that we began to see serious devastation in our communities. That was 10 years into the opioid crisis in Kentucky and West Virginia, with mass lawsuits being launched against the predatory practices of Purdue Pharma after its 10-year track record of abusing this supposed medicine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720211">The government at the time, under Stephen Harper, paid no attention to what was coming over the border. I remember that in 2008-09, people were beginning to get addicted. People going to the doctor because they had a wrist problem and people who went to the dentist for wisdom teeth were being given OxyContin. We began to see people becoming addicted who would never have been addicted before. People did not go on the streets and get heroin in our little communities, but they got OxyContin and became addicted. By the time the federal government stepped up and banned OxyContin, which was around 2011-12, we already had a massive problem of opioid addiction across demographics that had never suffered something like this before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720212">That is when fentanyl came in. I remember the very first fentanyl death in our region. I remember that young man; I remember his family. We were so unprepared, because, again, there was nobody at the federal government level at the time, under Stephen Harper, paying attention to what fentanyl was doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720213">At this stage, we have had over 21,000 opioid deaths in just the last four years. It has cut through every community in our country. Every community has suffered. We have a rising homeless population and have a rising addiction problem. Fentanyl and the other drugs that come with it have created an incredibly destabilized situation at a time when government was walking away from mental health services and at a time when government was not there for the people who needed supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720214">That leads us to the crisis of the abandonment of mental health and basic programs, the opioid crisis and the inability to get people into safe housing, many of them in the population aimed at by the gangs that have become increasingly violent and dangerous. We need a strategy that addresses this and we do not have a strategy. What we get from the Conservatives are bumper sticker slogans. They say they are going to fight the crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720215">Then there is what we have heard again and again in testimony. Myron Demkiw, chief of police of the Toronto Police Service, talked about the need for safe supply and wraparound services. The member who lives in the big house Stornoway has been lighting gasoline fires all over the opioid crisis in all our communities, claiming that safe supply means the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is giving out drugs on the street, which is an absolute falsehood. We do not need slogans and incendiary language. We need solutions. We need to keep people alive. That is number one. We also need to give the police the tools to go after predatory gangs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720216">Something that I have not heard from the Liberals is the ability to target the gangs who are coming in, and to get them out. It is certainly one of the issues that has been raised to me in the first nations communities of the north. People want the ability to police and protect their communities. When someone suddenly comes into a fly-in community, who has never been there before and is selling fentanyl, community leaders want the power to say, “Buddy, you are out the door; we are not even going to let you off the plane.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720217">In fly-in communities in the north, we can get on a plane to get into Fort Albany or Attawapiskat or Neskantaga with our bag, and we can be carrying as much fentanyl as we want. We cannot get on an Air Canada plane with a bag without being searched. What I have heard in Treaty 9 is that people want Transport Canada to give them the authority that if someone is flying into one of the fly-in communities they have to go through security searches so that they are not carrying guns and fentanyl. This is a straightforward thing. It is about keeping people safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720218"> I want to be able to go home to the communities that I represent and tell police officers who have done 35 years of service in small-town Canada that they can go home at the end of the day and be safe. I want to tell our frontline workers that when they go out on a call, they should not need a flak jacket; they should not need two OPP cruisers outside the door because there are predatory gangs who have taken over that housing complex. That is the reality in small-town Canada, and solutions are not being talked about; what is being talked about are the excuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720219">One of the things that I find very concerning is that my Conservative colleagues' solutions only work if we all live by the fact of having no memory. I remember when Vic Toews was the minister of public safety. Some members may not remember Vic Toews. He was convicted of violating the Elections Canada Act. That is a black mark and Stephen Harper made him pretty much top of the justice department anyway. He brought in the legislation that was going to force telecoms to create backdoor routes into every Canadian cellphone so he could spy on them. The Conservatives accuse this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of spying on Canadians. This Prime Minister is an absolute amateur compared to what Vic Toews was going to do, which was a total violation of civil liberties of every single Canadian so he could listen in on their phone calls. That same Vic Toews, of course, then was found guilty of breaking conflict of interest guidelines for hustling gigs for groups that were “seeking relief against a decision in which he had been involved as a minister of the Crown.” Let us talk about dodgy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720220">I mention Vic Toews because he also stood in the House one day and accused the opposition members that they were either on the Conservatives' side or the side of the child pornographers. This was at a time when he was cutting 1,100 jobs from border security. They were the people whose job it was to keep out fentanyl gangs, guns, predators and child pornographers. Let us remember that Jean-Pierre Fortin, who was the national president of the Customs and Immigration Union, stated that because of what the Harper government was doing on cutting border security, “more child pornography entering the country, more weapons, illegal drugs will pass through our borders, not to mention terrorists, and sexual predators and hardened criminals.” That does not fit on a bumper sticker, but that was the fact and that was the reality of what the current Liberal government inherited because of the Harper cuts. Vic Toews, at the time, said that was all fearmongering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720221">Vic Toews cut the intelligence unit on border security in half. How were we going to defend ourselves against international criminal gangs when he cut the intelligence service? He cut the sniffer-dog teams. That is a no-brainer. Sniffer-dog teams are not all that expensive, but sniffer-dog teams will tell us where the drugs are. Stephen Harper did not care. He fired those people because it was going to save some money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720222">Therefore, when the Conservatives say that they would get tough on the crime and they would take on the blah-blah, let us remember what they did. Let us remember how they cut the police crime prevention programs that helped communities support themselves so that they could keep the gangs out and support their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720223">Let us remember Tony Clement. There was $50 million in border security that he hoovered into his personal office to give out. What did he do?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720224">He paid for a sunken boat. That was not a good use of money. There were the Muskoka gazebos; he was building gazebos all over the rural parts of his riding. He built a fake lake. Muskoka has the most beautiful lakes in the country, except for those in <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>. There was Tony Clement. The lakes were not good enough. He had to create a fake lake. I remember Steamboat Tony. He was another one who went down in ethical flames.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720225">We are not even going to go through all the famous dark ethical violations of the Harper government. I mention Tony Clement because Stephen Harper thought it was a great idea to take money for border security to keep Canadians safe and give it to Tony Clement to buy sunken boats in Muskoka. Imagine what is going to happen under the guy who is living in Stornoway, if he ever gets in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720226"> The other thing that I find really concerning is we have these serious issues of gun violence and gangs that we have to focus on. The Liberals have dropped the ball a thousand times on these issues. I want to be able to go home to Northern Ontario and tell our frontline workers and families who are suffering from addictions that they can be safe, and that our communities are never going to be bases for this kind of violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720227">I cannot assure them of that now, and it worries me. It worries me when I have seen what is happening to communities that have always had each other's backs and have looked out for each other. Communities cannot do it on their own. If we talk to the municipalities anywhere in the north about the homeless crisis, they are going to say, “Where's the federal government?” When we talk to the communities about the opioid crisis, they are going to say that what the member who lives in Stornoway has been saying is like pouring gasoline on their efforts of keeping people alive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720228">If we talk to the police in Timmins or the OPP, they are going to say that we cannot arrest our way out of this crisis. It is complex. I am proud of the people on the front lines in my region, like the Mushkegowuk Fire Keepers who walk the streets of Timmins to keep people alive and safe. That is a program we initiated in Timmins—James Bay. It should be a national program, in the indigenous urban regions, people on the streets keeping people safe. They deserve better than this political Punch and Judy show. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720229">Rather than talking about these issues, this morning the Conservatives were talking about Grandpa Bill's hunting rifle. That is a total falsehood. I am a gun owner. My wife is a gun owner. Imagine the member for Stornoway out in the bush. He is saying, “They're going after your turkey gun.” No, they are not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720230"> The government is going after the assault weapons that have killed people. It is going to go after handguns that are coming over the border. In the latest falsehoods, from the guy who used pictures of Serbia and Malaysia as Canada, and hunters from Oklahoma, they said they were going to defend Pa and Joe Jr. going out with their orange hats. That is a total falsehood. We have freaking fentanyl gangs in our communities that need to be dealt with. The government is not going after Grandpa Joe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720231"> That is the misinformation that is coming from the Conservatives. The Liberals, with their Punch and Judy show, do not even remember how to punch anymore. I need to be able to go home to our communities and say that we will keep people safe, we will keep families alive and we will restore balance with those wraparound services that the police have talked about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720257">This December 6 will mark the 35th anniversary of the Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, a tragedy that forever marked my community.

I do not know about my colleagues, but I do not want an American-style gun culture and neither do the survivors or the PolyRemembers activists.

              <ParaText id="8720259">Let us be very clear. There is still work to be done and I am determined to continue to do that work. We need to work for stronger gun control, not just to honour the memory of victims, but also to prevent other tragedies, like the one that occurred at École polytechnique, and to take real action to protect the lives and safety of all. That is our duty as a federal government. We do not want any more mass shootings. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720260">I was born and grew up just a few blocks away from Polytechnique. The night that 14 women were gunned down, in 1989, I was just a little kid. I was waiting for my dad to come home and he did not. It was late and getting dark and I waited by the door. It was before everyone carried around cellphones. By the time he did get home, I saw the look on his face. He was there that night, outside Polytechnique, watching as bodies were taken into ambulances. When I asked why and how, no answer was forthcoming. What does one tell a little girl about a femicide?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720261">When I was first elected, I promised my community I would make stronger gun control a priority in my work in Ottawa, and I did. Our government has since banned 1,500 models of assault weapons, including the gun that was used 35 years ago at Polytechnique. I support PolyRemembers' call to finish the job that was started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720262">Assault weapons belong on the battlefield, not on our streets, despite the fact the Conservatives are desperate to bring these guns back into our communities. By doing the gun lobby’s dirty work in Parliament, they show their true colours. They are weak on security and soft on crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720263">They are also weak when it comes to securing our border, including by voting against more funds for border enforcement. Our police and border officials have been very clear on multiple occasions that the measures we implement to strengthen our border are key to keeping back the flow of illegal guns coming into our country. When the Conservatives talk about the importance of protecting our borders, they should remember that they cut funding for the borders when they were in power. Since then, our government has invested nearly $1.5 billion in border enforcement and security, as well as border policing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720264"> We are investing in gang prevention strategies. We increased the RCMP's capacity to trace gun crimes and to build a national system that allows for the flagging of the illegal purchasing of firearms. We also provided the RCMP and our border agency, the CBSA, with additional resources at the border to target firearms smuggling and trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720265">We have signed 82 agreements with municipalities and indigenous communities to stop gun violence before it starts and to help stem the flow of illegal guns crossing our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720266">Two years ago, we banned the importation, sale and purchase of handguns. That means handguns are not allowed through our borders. That means the law does not allow stores to sell handguns. It means people cannot go out and buy handguns. Handguns are not used for hunting; they are used against other people. They are getting into the hands of our young people through gangs. They are getting into the hands of people who are scared and feel they need to be packing one in order to feel safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720267"> Statistics show that the proliferation of guns does not make people more safe; it makes people less safe. Handguns are used in more than half of violent crimes involving firearms. The Conservatives like to talk about police, selectively quoting from some police unions, but we know that the head of the police chiefs has supported our gun control measures and our ban on the sale and importation of handguns. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720268">I do not think we can close our eyes to the reality just south of our border. For the third year in a row, gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teens in the United States. This is not the culture we want to import into Canada.

My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278406" Type="2">Avignon—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia</Affiliation> gave a speech earlier explaining all the work that has been done by the Standing Committee on Public Safety on the issue of better gun control and on Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>.

I will also address this issue when PolyRemembers appears before the Standing Committee on the Status of Women next week for a study on femicide. The Standing Committee on Public Safety made a rather important recommendation about enlisting a committee of independent experts to provide a more informed opinion to clearly define and determine which firearms should be prohibited and which are indeed used for hunting only. This will require people who are truly independent. My colleague has been waiting for such a committee to be set up for over a year and a half. She even sent the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> some names of people who could join it. This is important.

              <ParaText id="8720290"> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278315" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation> for splitting her time with me. I appreciated her comments and what she has provided today in terms of the substance of the issue and the report, which is a very important report. She spoke very passionately about why that is and the deep connections the issue has to her community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720291"> I am going to spend my time talking about why I think we are even debating the report today in the House. In order to do that, I have to set the context of what is currently going on at the public safety committee. Members of the committee, except for the Conservatives, are trying to undertake a study on foreign interference by Russia and India. The Conservatives on the committee have been using tactic after tactic, by introducing new motions or by filibustering at times, to prevent any study on foreign interference from occurring. They have been successful at times and unsuccessful at others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720292">What the Conservatives have done today is really interesting. The report was tabled in the House by the late Jim Carr, who was the chair of the committee at the time, on April 25, 2022, over two and a half years ago. What is even more remarkable is that it was not even a contentious report; the report was adopted by the public safety committee unanimously. Everybody agreed to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720293">For those watching at home, I will say that reports are brought to this place and tabled all the time. Very rarely do they get brought into a motion of concurrence like this, but it is happening today. Anyone following the proceedings over the last couple of months would have noticed, quite frankly, that the Conservatives have been doing this a lot lately in order to just interject new ways to slow down Parliament and make it very difficult for it to function, if not bring it to a complete standstill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720294">What makes the matter interesting is that not only did the Conservatives use the concurrence motion to do this but they also brought a report that was introduced in the House over two and a half years ago and was voted on unanimously. Then they put forward an amendment that clearly they had no interest in when the report was tabled, because they would not have otherwise voted for the report unanimously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720295"> I did challenge the individual who moved the amendment. In the amendment they brought in when they introduced this, they have added a whole list of things. First, they want to send the report back to committee, a unanimous report that was sent to the House two and a half years ago. They say they are not happy with it and they want the committee to look at it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720296">The Conservatives want the committee to hold four more meetings, to bring the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation> to committee and invite the Toronto Police Association, the Surrey police union, the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies and John Howard Society of Canada to attend. Why this is important is that an order of the House, which would be made through the motion, would direct the committee to do the work. The committee would then have to stop everything it is doing and undertake the direction of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720297">I bring colleagues back to how I set the stage at the beginning of my speech as to what is going on at the committee. The Conservatives cannot get away with what they are trying to do at committee by preventing the study on foreign interference, so they are now using an opportunity to amend a unanimous consent report from two and a half years ago to direct the committee to undertake new work, which would further delay the work it is supposed to be doing on looking into foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720298"> We must ask this question: Why would the Conservatives dig up a two-and-a-half year-old report and put a huge amendment on it to force the committee to do all this work to avoid talking about foreign interference from India and Russia?</ParaText>

Every other leader of a political party of the House has a security clearance. They use the information they obtain when they get that security clearance to make sure they can keep their members safe, their party safe and all Canadians safe. The Leader of the Opposition is the only political party leader who refuses to even apply for a security clearance. Why is that? We also know that there have been reports that the Conservative leadership contest through which he was elected was interfered with by foreign agents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720300">This is what we know: We know that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> refuses to get a security clearance or even apply for it. We know that it is alleged that the Conservative Party was interfered with by foreign actors, and we know that the Conservative members on the public safety committee are willing to dig up a two-and-a half-year-old report that they voted on unanimously and moved massive amendments to, to force the committee to do new work so they can avoid continuing on with the study on foreign interference. I think I do not need to elaborate or to take any kind of liberties in terms of drawing a conclusion; most people can draw the conclusion on their own. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720301">What is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> hiding? There is something in his past that he knows would prevent him from being able to get a security clearance, and Canadians have a right to know what that is, so I am very concerned not only with the lengths to which the Leader of the Opposition is going to hide whatever it is in his past, but also with the members of the public safety committee, because they are complicit when they help him do the work to hide it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720302">We should not be surprised by any of this, because the Conservatives are good soldiers, at least after they get caught, because we know that 18 or 19 of them were sending letters behind their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s back to the government, looking for help.

The Conservatives do not want anything to happen in terms of a study on foreign interference at the public safety committee. They are stopping that from happening. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> refuses to get his security clearance. That is a second fact. Another fact is it has been widely reported that foreign actors interfered in the Conservative leadership. </ParaText>

This member says, “We are trying to help the government govern,” but anybody who has been watching this for any longer than 30 seconds over the last two months will know that is completely untrue.</ParaText>

However, I am curious, because we did rise for a unanimous consent motion to have a special committee on India, and it was the member for Winnipeg Centre who opposed when we thought we had unanimous consent of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720326">Mr. Speaker, my guess would be, why do we need a special committee when we already have multiple committees that could look at this? For example, the public safety committee is trying to look at this. Nobody from this side is trying to avoid looking at the issue. Conservatives are literally blocking the ability to do that. The foreign affairs committee could also look at it. I imagine we would get the same response.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720333">Mr. Speaker, I rise here today to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security entitled “A Path Forward: Reducing Gun and Gang Violence in Canada”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720334">This report was completed and tabled in April 2022, two and a half years ago. Now we want to debate and vote on this report. However, the report is no longer valid, given that a lot of information about public safety has changed in the past two and a half years. When we look at what was proposed in the report, it is important to first note that the report was not unanimous and that the three opposition parties all presented supplementary reports. The initial report, although lengthy, was not good enough for all the parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720335">That is why we brought forward an amendment today calling for this study to be reopened in order to complete it and obtain much more up-to-date information on the public safety situation and the criminal use of firearms in Canada. We also need information on the rise of street gangs in cities across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720336">We need to talk about this. We have known this for a long time, but, for the past nine years, it has always been clear to us that the Liberals and public safety are not synonymous. Measures were taken. Each time, the government said it was making investments, but the fact is, the right hand was spending money while the left was amending the Criminal Code to reduce the law's impact on criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720337">Consider Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C‑5</Document>, which was brought into force, and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C‑75</Document>. Among other things, Bill C‑75 allows criminals to be arrested and released multiple times in the same day. Bill C‑5 allows criminals to serve jail time at home watching Netflix instead of in a penitentiary, where they belong. The public figured that out pretty quickly when these bills came into force. Most police services and victim protection groups have said it makes no sense. The report was tabled two and a half years ago, and nothing has been done about it since. Meanwhile, the government has enacted bills that have made the public safety situation in this country even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720338">The report contains a number of recommendations. One of them calls on the government to acknowledge the fact that a public safety problem exists. This is unbelievable. The idea that the committee would have to tell the government to wake up because we have a problem is disturbing enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720339">On top of that, a huge number of witnesses who appeared before the committee clearly told us that the gun crime problem was not caused by registered gun owners. Representatives of the Toronto Police Association, the Toronto Police Service and police associations in Quebec and across the country told us the same thing. We have been saying this for a long time, and the witnesses confirmed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720340">Unfortunately, the main report neglected to take the police recommendations into account. The Conservative Party had to draft a supplementary report to highlight the various recommendations made by these organizations, which clearly explain that street gangs and criminals are using trafficked guns arriving mainly from the United States. They say that over 80% of crimes involve guns that are not registered anywhere and were purchased illegally. That is the real problem. That is the main problem right there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720341">Rather than tackling the main problem, the recommendations call for guns to be taken away from all Canadians who have firearms licenses. This led to the infamous 2020 ban, which sought to take away all firearms. The Liberals and the Bloc Québécois were scaring Canadians by saying that law-abiding gun owners were criminals. Meanwhile, real crimes are being committed in the dark, behind the scenes. That is the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720342">I have a firearms licence myself, and I own guns. I am a law-abiding citizen and my guns are registered. I have been vetted. I am a member of a gun club. I do what I have to do. All gun owners are law-abiding citizens. However, the thugs on the streets of Montreal who drive around with guns hidden in their cars did not buy their guns at a firearms retailer. They bought them on the black market. They commit their crimes with these weapons, and they do not care.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720343">It is important to understand that it is going to cost at least $3 billion to buy back the firearms that law-abiding citizens, who are doing nothing wrong, have at home. We could take that money and invest it in control mechanisms for the police, for the border, so that we can work with Akwesasne to check what is illegally entering the country. Unfortunately, that is an area where there is a lot of gun trafficking. The reserve abuts the U.S. and Canada in both Ontario and Quebec. We need to focus our efforts on gun control. That is where we need to put our energy and money. We should not be buying back firearms from law-abiding citizens, hunters and sport shooters who have done nothing wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720344">We have been talking about this for years. We are not even close to reaching an agreement. I do not know why my Liberal, Bloc Québécois and NDP colleagues cannot understand this logic. Instead of saying that this is what we should do, they are trying to scare people. We need to crack down on criminals. That is where we need to focus our efforts and investments. That is the situation with gun control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720345">Arms trafficking is another issue. We are talking about crime on the streets, especially the rise in gang crime. Even the Hells Angels are afraid of these criminals. They are incredibly violent and dangerous. Every police force and victims' group will say that this is the biggest problem. I introduced Bill <Document DbId="12269389" Type="4">C‑325</Document>, which was unfortunately blocked by the Liberals and the NDP. Its aim was to undo the legislation that came out of Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C‑5</Document>. That law is completely stupid. When criminals on the streets saw it, they rubbed their hands together with glee and thanked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> because now they can go about committing crime without the least bit of concern. At worst, they will serve a prison sentence at home. They will take a little break, drink a beer, watch Netflix, and then go back out on the street. They will not be out of commission for long. That is what is happening; we predicted it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720346">We said during debate that this was what was going to happen, as in the case of Bill C-75, and it is happening. It is happening now. None of the studies that were done prior to Bill C-5 and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C‑75</Document> mention it. That is why we need to reopen the committee's study. We need to confirm what has been happening for the past two and a half years, since these two laws were passed and came into force. Crime has skyrocketed. If we do not, the current report might as well just sit on a shelf. It is really not up to date. Things have changed, and that is because the government has implemented completely stupid measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720347">When it comes to firearms, Conservatives think that law-abiding citizens, sport shooters and hunters who have a licence and who are monitored should be left alone. First, Canada's laws are very strict. It is very complicated to own a gun. People who do own guns obey the law. Measures already exist. They are already in place. Why is the government attacking these people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720348">Second, we have to go back to the criminal side of things, strengthen the criminal laws, undo the laws that came out of Bill C-75 and Bill C-5, restore order in the Criminal Code to allow judges and police officers to do their work and apply justice that is reasonable and makes the streets safer. It is simple, really. The rest is political gobbledygook that I do not understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720349">I was the Conservative Party public safety critic for three years. I heard people, Liberal and NDP colleagues, say all sorts of things. I wondered what planet they were living on. We are not dealing with the same reality. We might say that there are virtual realities in Canada. We do not all have two feet on the ground. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720350">Let us come back to the report and the recommendations. The Conservatives' supplementary opinion was essentially what I am saying today. That is what we want. That is what police services want. The victims' groups I met with, who supported my Bill C‑325, do not understand what the government, backed by the other parties, has done. They want us to restore order to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720351">It is simple. Change the law. Restore order. Instead of buying back firearms from law-abiding citizens, put money into border control to help police services do their job. That will solve the vast majority of the problems in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720374">Petitioners describe how parental alienation is a discredited theory used in family courts to undermine survivors of family violence and undermine children's wishes. It has disproportionate impacts on the safety of women and children. The petitioners note that over 250 feminist and women's organizations, along with the United Nations, are urging the government to legislate protections against parental alienation claims in family courts. This would provide supports for survivors of gender-based violence. They are calling on the <Affiliation DbId="299999" Type="96">Minister of Justice and Attorney General</Affiliation> to amend the Divorce Act to protect against these claims in parental disputes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720394">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government, supported by the NDP and led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has demonstrated a lack of financial acumen, with the case in point being the mismanagement of the green slush fund. The green slush fund, with its mismanagement, waste of tax dollars and rewarding of friends and insiders, represents the overall style and approach to governing by the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720395">I am new here, as we have just heard, and I may never have been in government. This was well pointed out by the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation> a few days ago as he answered a softball question posed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278303" Type="2">Don Valley East</Affiliation> in an unsuccessful attempt to throw me under the bus. The tenor of the question was about my commitment to the people of Toronto—St. Paul's because I did not advocate for a $471-million transfer to the city to increase housing. That $471 million is about $40,000 per home that the city state it could build. Let us remember that number. The fact is that after that $471 million, housing starts have declined in Toronto. Where is the accountability?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720396"> That means wasted money and misallocated resources, resulting in a drag on GDP. It is the same result from the same government, and that is bad for the people of Toronto writ large and bad for the people of Toronto—St. Paul's. However, we have a solution to the loose-wallet Liberal largesse: Let us cut the GST on homes under $1 million. The quick math is that on a home of $800,000, a buyer would save $40,000 from a GST cut, which is the same amount the city got for the decline in starts. Who wants the money? Is it the people or the government? Unlike the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and unlike the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation>, who prefer to give money away to projects with dubious outcomes, I have a background in finance, so I know what the math says: The buyer of that $800,000 home will save somewhere between $100,000 and $150,000 over the term of a 25-year mortgage. That is the power of common sense and a GST cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720397"> Let us now return to the pressing issue of the slush fund. Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a federally funded not-for-profit organization whose purpose was to invest and support the development of new green technologies for a better environment. Fulfilling this purpose and supporting sustainable innovation would have been a great opportunity for the Liberal government to follow through on its promises to fight climate change. However, instead of a well-managed, respected organization to help Canadian companies develop sustainable green technologies, we have a Liberal green slush fund, a multi-billion dollar boondoggle filled with corruption, devoid of accountability and, most troubling of all, with no regard for the people who funded it: hard-working Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720398"> We have heard countless promises from the Liberal government to take bold action on climate change and green innovation, but as time passes, it becomes clearer that these promises are hollow. The reality is that it appears the Liberals are only interested in making themselves and their friends rich. When the Liberals overtook SDTC, it was never about green energy; it was about lining the pockets of Liberal insiders. As the Auditor General found, Liberal appointees gave 400 million taxpayer dollars to their own companies, involving 186 conflicts of interest. This was only a sample of the total mismanaged capital allocations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720399">Meanwhile, food bank visits are at an all-time high in my community. Constituents tell me they cannot afford the cost of living. That $400 million could have better benefited people in St. Paul's and elsewhere who are suffering from out-of-touch Liberal policies. Now the government is refusing to table the necessary documents in Parliament so that the RCMP can thoroughly investigate the corruption and scandal of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720400">Parliament has been stalled for numerous weeks because the Liberals refuse to hand over the documents. Parliament ordered the documents. Why is there such a lack of transparency surrounding these projects from the transparency <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? Why are we seeing such a rigorous lack of accountability for how taxpayer dollars are being spent? Well, as one SDTC whistle-blower said in committee:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720402">That is from a whistle-blower. This is not a fabricated scandal. The whistle has been blown by courageous individuals who saw first-hand what was happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720403">The Liberals do not want the public to find out that instead of investing in our farmers, who know a thing or two about stewarding the land, or supporting innovation that can improve the lives of Canadians, they used this fund as a slush pool for insiders. They do not want Canadians to know that instead of investing taxpayer dollars into the most promising projects and companies, the Liberals' hand-picked and hand-appointed chair and her board funnelled taxpayer dollars to projects and companies that were run by their friends or where they had a financial interest. It seems to me that the green part of SDTC is less about the environment and more about the colour of the cash lining the pockets of their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720404">One of the reasons my constituents elected me, according to what I have heard and am hearing when speaking to them in the community and at their doorsteps, is that I have experience in business. I think about that and I wonder, “What if somebody did this in a properly run public company? What would happen to that person once the paper trail was analyzed?” That person would be fired. It really makes us think: What fate awaits the Liberal government should it just hand over the documents and drive on? This is the kind of situation they teach us to avoid in any business school or ethics class. Perhaps our financial leaders on the other side of the House missed those classes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720405">Still, the misallocation of money leads to the destruction of capital in this country. This causes a loss of Canadian competitiveness, a reduction in productivity and a decline in GDP. These misallocations compound over time, just like the lost opportunity on the interest we all pay for our government debt, including on this $400 million. That is at least another $16 million per year, which could go a long way to solving issues in Toronto like gun crime. Instead, it is a drag on the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720406">Just a couple of weeks ago, StatsCan came out with the news of just how horrible the Canadian economy is under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and how the government's mismanagement has compounded the misery of the Canadian economy. For the eighth time in the last nine quarters, our per capita GDP has declined. It is also the fifth consecutive quarterly decline in per capita GDP. It has now fallen more than any other G7 country since 2019. In my analysis, that is a recession for most individuals, and the average Canadian is worse off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720407">This is the direct result of higher taxes on capital gains, on energy, on work and on just about everything else we buy. The government is driving out investment by hiking taxes on everything. That is indisputable. The community members I spoke about earlier tell me the same thing. The people I meet in St. Paul's on the doorsteps can see what is happening. In fact, they expressed their dissatisfaction this summer. After three decades, the people of Toronto—St. Paul's have asked for change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720408">The Greeks had a myth, the myth of King Midas, who was granted the power to turn anything he touched into gold. What a gift that would be. Ultimately, this became a liability for King Midas, as his greed led him to make foolish decisions on what he would turn into gold. His food, for example, turned into gold, so he could not eat; he was hungry. In another section of the Midas story, he becomes fearful of his power and embraces his beautiful daughter, who is immediately transformed into a golden statue. In his despair, he prays to Dionysus, who, to make a long story short, reverses the spell and all those golden objects are returned to their natural state. Midas went on to share his wealth with all and become a beloved king for the ages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720409">Unfortunately for the Liberal government, the green slush fund is not a myth and is not so easily reversed. Greed and its dangers were the moral of the Midas story, and what happens when we become beholden to our own selfish interests. As we have here, Liberal insiders turned dubious projects into gold for other Liberal insiders. Now, as with Midas, the Liberals in charge of the gold are finding out it was not, after all, free. The chickens are coming home to roost.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720410"> Incidentally, there is another version of the Midas story where he must judge a musical contest. However, when the gods are not happy with his choice of winner, his ears are turned into donkey ears, and he must run around with donkey ears tucked up under his hat hoping that no one will notice them. However, I digress. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720411">The Liberal government's financial incompetence and corruption are causing a weak investment environment. People told me this weekend that they are not investing here because of the brutal tax regime. I am not making this up. Canadians are the ones who are suffering because of it. We on this side of the House believe in fiscal responsibility and that hard-working Canadians deserve to bring home powerful paycheques. We are not here to play games with tax dollars. We believe that if we are going to put our taxpayers' money toward green initiatives, they should be green with measurable outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720412"> At the heart of the issue of the green slush fund, in my view, is public trust. Canadians trust their governments to act in their best interest, to steward public funds responsibly and to be forthright about how decisions are made. When this trust is broken, it is incredibly difficult to rebuild, except perhaps by starting fresh with a new government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720413">The refusal to release the green slush fund documents erodes this trust. It sends a message to the public that their government is not interested in being transparent and that accountability is a secondary or tertiary concern. When citizens no longer trust their leaders, it weakens the bonds that hold our country together, and the consequences are severe. We are seeing them on a daily basis in our streets.

When governments refuse to be transparent, they open the door to corruption and abuse of power, and when governments refuse to release documents that Parliament has requested, they betray the trust that underpins our system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720416">This is not the Liberals' Parliament; this is Canada's Parliament, the House of Commons, and we must not allow this to happen in Canada. As Parliamentarians, we all have a responsibility to demand better. We must hold our government accountable for its actions and ensure that transparency remains a central tenet of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720417"> The controversy surrounding the green slush fund and the government's refusal to release key documents is a serious issue that deserves our full attention. It is not just about the management of public funds. It is about the mismanagement of the entire government. It is about the very nature of democracy itself. As Canadians, we must stand firm in our commitment to transparency and accountability. We must demand answers from our government, and we must not accept anything less than full disclosure.

We have seen the umpteen scandals of the government, which come down to mismanagement. There was the WE scandal, the ArriveCAN scandal, the Aga Khan scandal and others, for which we have not seen proper management come forward.

              <ParaText id="8720458">Mr. Speaker, I do not relish the opportunity to return to this debate, but it is important because it is about a thoroughly corrupt government hiding documents that would shed light and transparency on one of the biggest spending scandals in Canada's history. In fact, this green slush fund scandal, which has been laid at the feet of the Liberal government, is far bigger than the sponsorship scandal that cratered the Chrétien government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720459">This is important because it is about accountability. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="310385" Type="2">Toronto—St. Paul's</Affiliation> said, it is about accountability, transparency and the responsible use of Canadians' hard-earned dollars, all of which have been wasted by the government and Liberal insiders, who are involved in graft and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720460"> Now, before I delve more deeply into this green slush fund scandal, I did want to chat very briefly and direct some comments to the residents of Abbotsford. This is a community that has supported me for 19 years. By the time I leave this chamber, it will be probably closer to 20 years. They have been very loyal to me. I have been able to win six elections. Each time they have trusted me to represent them with integrity in this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720461"> I have had the opportunity during that period of time to help shape Canada's trade policy with trade agreements like the European free trade agreement with Canada, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, our trade agreement with South Korea. By the way, that also included negotiating Canada's free trade agreement with Ukraine. It is not a Liberal accomplishment. The original free trade agreement with Ukraine was negotiated under Stephen Harper.</ParaText>

I was able to deliver on some social priorities, like the youth and gang crime prevention funding that keeps youth out of gangs and violent crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720463"> However, the biggest ask I have made of the government, and I ask members to take note of this, was that the government step up to the plate and help Abbotsford avoid future natural disasters. As members may recall, back in 2021, Abbotsford suffered through the worst natural disaster in British Columbia's history. The damage was in the billions of dollars. International trade was brought to a halt because goods could not come to and from the Vancouver port, because railways could not get their products to the port. Highway 1 one was completely severed. All this was because of a massive flood in the Abbotsford area on Sumas Prairie. Thousands of livestock drowned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720464">With billions of dollars of economic activity at stake and with lives at stake, one would think that the government would have stepped up and helped Abbotsford.

The Prime Minister said no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720469">In case any of my Liberal colleagues over there suggest that this promise was never made, more recently, one of the members of the government approached me in a moment of candidness and said, “Ed, we really failed Abbotsford. I am so sorry. We promised to deliver support and we did not.” That is at the feet of the Liberal government. It is only one in a host of scandals that have surrounded the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his corrupt, unethical government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720470"> That is only the tip of the iceberg. Today we are talking about the green slush fund scandal. I want to explain a bit about what that scandal entails. There is an organization called Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which was created to support small and medium-sized businesses that had innovations in the green technology space that would help Canadians become more technologically advanced and environmentally sustainable. There is merit in that. We all want to do our part for the environment. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asked this organization to create a new fund, let us call it the billion-dollar fund, to help young entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized businesses to perhaps expand markets, do further research, develop their products, market their products in a way that Canada could find a way of leveraging our strengths and educational expertise to deliver value for Canadians and at the same time respond to the emergent environmental challenges that our world faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720471"> Instead of doing what was right, which was to evaluate each application to the green slush fund on its merits, something quite different happened. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a board to administer, evaluate and assess these applications. The directors of the board, who have a fiduciary duty, not only to SDTC, but to the taxpayers of Canada, instead of evaluating these projects on their merits and declaring conflicts of interest when they arose, enriched themselves by awarding these monies to themselves through their own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720472">Remember, this is a government organization that is supposed to administer taxpayer money. It is basically holding this money in trust for taxpayers to make sure that Canadians get value for that money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720473"> Instead of the directors doing their job and discharging their fiduciary duty, they said that they had companies and that they would love to skim millions of dollars off the top to give to their own companies, which would benefit because that would increase profits in the companies. The directors would get dividends and become rich as a result. That is exactly what those directors did. They stole money from taxpayers and funnelled it to their own companies. By any account or standard, that is a scandal. It is corruption and graft of the highest order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720474">As I said when I spoke earlier, I fully expect that people are going to go to jail as a result of this scandal. Will it be members of this House of Commons who go to jail as a result, or members of the cabinet? We do not know. Will Liberal insiders go to jail as a result of this? We do not know. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720482">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear these interruptions, because obviously my words have touched a nerve on that side. It is very clear that the NDP-Liberal coalition is really worried about where this scandal is taking it and the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720483">What was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response? There was a request that came from the House of Commons that the government deliver to the House of Commons, to parliamentarians, all the documents having to do with this green slush fund scandal, a Liberal scandal. The Speaker specifically directed the government to deliver those documents. Of course, what the Prime Minister did not want to do was deliver any of those documents, so he did what his government has done so regularly. He engaged in something called “redaction”. That is just a fancy word for censoring documents. They took all those documents and they blacked them out, pages and pages of just black. There is nothing, no information of value, to glean from those documents. The Prime Minister then delivered those documents. The Speaker had expressly instructed that those documents be delivered in unredacted form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720484">What did the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> do? He thumbed his nose at the Speaker, at the Speaker's chair. The Speaker understands. He is the highest authority in Parliament. There is no appeal from his decision. When he orders the government to deliver documents, there is no appeal from that decision and it must be complied with. The Prime Minister thumbed his nose at parliamentarians and at the law. He thumbed his nose at Canadians. That is why we are in the House and why the business of the House has ground to a halt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720485">It has nothing to do with obstruction. It has to do with our intent to get to the bottom of this rottenness that has infected the Liberal government. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has presided over the most corrupt government in Canadian history. In fact, one of my colleagues on the Conservative side recently cited statistics that showed that one-third of all major scandals in Canada's complete history, from 1867 until now, had taken place under the Liberal government. It is unbelievable that this should happen in today's day and age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720486">
                <B>Mr. Jeremy Patzer:</B> That's a lot of scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720487">
                <B>Hon. Ed Fast:</B> Yes, it is a lot of scandal, and it is way too much scandal, because it involves billions of dollars of taxpayer money that has been recklessly spent and has been defrauded from taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720488">Mr. Speaker, we as a country can do so much better. We as a Parliament can do so much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720489"> When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, he issued mandate letters to each of his ministers, in which he demanded that they be transparent and accountable to Parliament. Now this very Prime Minister is violating the very mandates that he had purported to impose on his ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720490"> It should not surprise anyone that minister after minister becomes embroiled in their own scandal, like the other Randy scandal that we have been dealing with in the House, where a minister of the Crown got involved in a shady company, pretended that he was indigenous when he is not, and then got government contracts by pretending his company was indigenous when it is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720491">It has been said that a fish rots from the head down, and that is an apt description of the government. When the head of a government, the prime minister himself, is not willing to comply with ethical standards imposed by the law and is convicted on two occasions of conflicts of interest, we can expect that all those on his team will follow suit, and here we are today. We have this scandal, one of dozens of scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720492">We as a country can do better, and surely we as a Parliament can do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720524"> Mr. Speaker, although progress has been made to reduce impaired driving, it remains a scourge on Canadian society. Every year, hundreds of people are killed and thousands are injured in crashes involving alcohol, cannabis and other drugs. These tragedies are entirely preventable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720525"> That is why Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada's annual Project Red Ribbon campaign raises awareness about impaired driving, especially during the holiday season, a time when the risk is higher.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720526"> This year, the campaign honours Jacob Simmons, a young man whose life was tragically cut short in my home province of Prince Edward Island by an impaired driver. Unfortunately, Prince Edward Island also has the highest rate of impaired driving in Canada, despite consistently imposing the most severe sentences in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720527"> I encourage all Islanders and Canadians to support this campaign by making responsible choices and wearing a red ribbon to honour victims and survivors of impaired driving. Together, we can create a safer future.</ParaText>

After nine years of the carbon tax coalition, something has changed. Parents are skipping meals and mothers are adding water to their children's milk. In fact, between 2019 and 2024, food bank usage in my province increased by 42.1%. The primary causes are the growing cost of housing and food inflation. By 2030, the NDP-Liberals will quadruple the carbon tax, driving up costs on everything even more.</ParaText>

Across Canada, 30% of food bank users are children. In Saskatchewan, that number jumps to 39%, which means 39% are children. The “spend-DP” love the carbon tax and voted to keep it 24 times. The result is that taxes are up, costs are up, crime is up and time is up. Canadians want and deserve a carbon tax election so they can kick these champagne socialists to the curb.</ParaText>

We all may love the warm, happily ever after, Hallmark homecoming feel that a reconciled relationship can bring, but while the coalition's renewal of vows may be restoring its fanciful hopes of retaining power, it is leaving Canadians feeling cold and rejected.

Then Canadians will get to choose between a hypocritical, high-carbon, high-flying, honeymooning coalition government on the far left and a common-sense Conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720795">We have been debating a privilege motion, with which the government has chosen to paralyze Parliament through its refusal to comply with a lawfully passed production order wherein the House of Commons demanded that all documents related to the $400-million green slush fund be handed over to the RCMP so it can conduct a criminal investigation. The government has refused to comply, and as a result of its decision, Parliament has been seized with this question of privilege over that refusal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720796">As such, my question to the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> is this: I understand that she made a big show of some documents being handed over to the law clerk. The law clerk then informed the Speaker and other House officers that some documents were still being withheld and many of the documents that were handed over were still redacted, so I wonder if the government House Leader would tell us if she is finally ready to comply with the House order and allow this gridlock to be solved, and whether there will be any other legislation coming next week or if the Liberals will continue to keep Parliament paralyzed with this privilege motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720797"> Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague well knows, it is him and his party members who are keeping Parliament paralyzed because they are obstructing their own motion of instruction. The Speaker very clearly ruled that this matter should be sent to the procedure and House affairs committee for further study. We agree with that. We are just waiting for the Conservative Party of Canada members of Parliament to do the same. In the interim, they continue to filibuster their own filibuster, and we have seen that, because they continue to amend their amendments on this matter, but when they are ready to get back to work, we are here to work for Canadians, and we look forward to that.</ParaText>

We would be giving a tax break to all Canadians and putting more money directly into the pockets of the middle class. These are important measures to help Canadians pay their bills. We encourage Parliament and all parties to get this legislation passed quickly and unanimously, so workers and working families can get more money in their pockets. We are committed to getting things done for Canadians in Parliament. Important legislation is before the House, and we believe the Conservatives should stop playing obstructionist, partisan games so that MPs can debate those bills.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720807">Since September 26, 2024, the House has been seized with privilege motions.

              <ParaText id="8720812">The House also has an undoubted responsibility to grant supplies, which are the sole gift of the House to the Crown, as outlined in Standing Order 80(1). This is the reason estimates are tabled in the House periodically. On Monday, November 18, 2024, the <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> tabled the supplementary estimates (B) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. The Standing Orders, notably Standing Order 81(17), prescribe a mechanism to dispose of those estimates no later than December 10. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720813">In addition, the responsibility for the estimates must be balanced with another fundamental principle, that of allowing the opposition to present its grievances, through motions examined during supply days, before the House can adopt supplies. These days are commonly referred to as opposition days. Four more opposition days must be held during the supply period ending on December 10.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720818">Normally, the Chair does not intervene on hypothetical questions, but this one is becoming more and more likely every day and could have very real implications. As we know, we have two privilege motions before the House and probably a third one coming up. However, we also have to vote on the supplementary estimates that the government has tabled for consideration during the supply period ending December 10, not to mention the four remaining opposition days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720819">For some time now, many people have been wondering what will happen to the opposition days and the estimates this fall. On the one hand, Standing Order 48(1) states:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720823">In fact, this has been our reality for the past two months. On the other hand, however, Standing Order 81(10)(a) provides the following:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720825">Although we think of them as opposition days, they are actually intended for supplies that are, of course, listed in government orders. The use of the word “shall” in the Standing Orders implies that it is imperative that we have opposition days, and here is what we read at page 857 of Bosc and Gagnon:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720826">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If the government fails to designate the prescribed number of allotted days, the remaining days in that period will be designated by default.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720827">That statement is important. It echoes Speaker Fraser's rulings on March 22 and 26, 1990, at pages 9628 and 9758 of the Debates. In the second ruling, he said the following: “The Standing Orders list the number of allotted days there will be in each supply period and where the Government has failed to designate sufficient days to meet the requirements of the Standing Orders, by attrition those days left in the period must become allotted days, when no other alternative is possible in order to comply with the Standing Orders.” That is what happened in this instance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720828">The events of 1990 are not identical to today's circumstances. In fact, there are a few distinct features to consider. First, Speaker Fraser's ruling was about the order of precedence for Government Orders. It was essentially intended to limit the government's usual flexibility in scheduling Government Orders. Today, we are dealing with motions of privilege that are different from and procedurally superior to Government Orders. Second, the old principle underlying our supply procedures is described as “grievances before supply”. It would be unwise for the government not to respect the power and authority of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720829">Consequently, we will only take up the matter of supply if, and only if, the House succeeds in adopting Government Orders on the scheduled dates. Page 151 of Bosc and Gagnon explains the following: “However, the debate does not interfere with Routine Proceedings, Statements by Members, Question Period, Royal Assent, deferred recorded divisions or the adjournment of the House”. We experience this on a daily basis, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720830">Simply put, under our Standing Orders, all these things need to happen, and they are happening. Standing Order 81(10)(a) states that four more opposition days need to be held this fall. By way of analogy, does that mean that even if the privilege motions remain outstanding, we will debate opposition motions on December 5, 6, 9 and 10?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720831">Mr. Speaker, I understand that these matters are important, and that is why I wanted to raise them immediately, both to give you time to reflect on them and to give the parties time to make arrangements in response to your decision.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8720835">Mr. Speaker, as I rise today for this debate, there are a lot of things I could say, but what I would like to focus on, at least in the initial part of my remarks, is what is at heart here. Sometimes what happens in this place when we debate issues is that some members lose sight of what exactly is at the heart of the matter. It is not just, as in this case, a privilege motion. It is not even just about a scandal. What we are talking about, at least in my view, is $400 million of taxpayers' money. It is important that we remember that. It is something we should always have at the very top of our minds when we are looking at issues in the House, whether it is a matter like this of privilege, the litany of scandals of the Liberal government, government legislation or any legislation for that matter. We should always be mindful of who pays for all of this, and it is the taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720836">In this case, at the heart of the matter is $400 million of taxpayers' money that has been forcibly removed from their wallets. That is the reality of the situation. Anytime a taxpayer sends their hard-earned money to Ottawa to the CRA, or what I refer to as the place where people's tax dollars go to die, the money is being forcibly removed from their wallets. They do not have a choice in the matter. They have to pay tax dollars, whether they like it or not and whether they think they are being used wisely or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720837">I hear from a lot of my constituents, and a lot of people from all across this country when I am out in different parts of it, about their feeling that their money is not being used even remotely close to wisely by the current government. There is a lot of frustration in this country about the fact that people see their money being treated like it is some kind of personal slush fund for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his friends and Liberal members of Parliament and their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720838">I can understand why people would be frustrated about that. They work incredibly hard for this money. There are many people across this country who strap on their work boots, throw on a hard hat and get their hands dirty. They do it for long hours, and in some cases it is back-breaking. Then they watch their money get forcibly removed from their wallet and sent to Ottawa, to be used as some kind of private, personal slush fund for Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720839">It has to be tough some days when the alarm clock goes off at 5:30 in the morning. Maybe someone was out with their buddies a little late the night before, maybe had a beer league hockey game or something and only managed to get a few hours of sleep. They have to get out of bed, and then they realize they are going to work until probably two o'clock in the afternoon, just for the government to take all of that money. Then after two o'clock comes, maybe they work until six or seven o'clock, working hard on a construction crew or something, and that is the part of the money they get to take home to their family. All of the other stuff they got out of bed at 5:30 in the morning for until sometime early in the afternoon is sent to Ottawa so that these guys over here, these Liberals, can give it out to their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720840"> This is exactly what we are talking about when we talk about this green slush fund. It is $400 million of the money those people have worked hard for, doing back-breaking work, to try to provide for their families. Instead, it has gone to Liberal insiders. It is important to have that in mind, and it is important to have some context around that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720841"> I would like to get to that, but first, as I mentioned, people are paying taxes and sending dollars against their will to a government that wastes them. Ten days ago, every single Canadian, I hope, spent some time remembering and commemorating the sacrifice and service of the men and women who serve this country in our Canadian Armed Forces. When we talk about having to do hard work, there is no one in this country who not only works harder but also makes more sacrifices and puts more on the line than they do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720842">On November 11, I hope we all paused in remembrance. I love that we do that as a country and I love that in the lead-up to that day, there is now Veterans Week and Indigenous Veterans Day. These are all opportunities for us to commemorate and remember veterans' service and sacrifice, but it is something we should do 365 days of the year. Veterans have sacrificed so we all in the chamber can have the opportunity to stand and debate issues like we are doing right now and so we can represent our fellow community members here in Parliament. There is huge gravity that goes with that, and it would be good for some members to remember that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720843">When we talk about issues like the one we are talking about today, a slush fund for Liberal insiders, that is not what men and women in service sacrificed for. They sacrificed so we could all come here and try our best to better our communities, our provinces and our country, and to do things we believe are in the best interests of Canadians to try to make their lives a little better and a little easier, and to provide hope and opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720844">That is the kind of thing we should be debating; however, there has not been much of that in the last nine years. In fact, I do not think there has been any of it. There have been people who have come here to enrich their friends and have forgotten about the taxpayer I talked about, who gets up and packs their lunch in a plastic bag and goes to work for 12-hour to 14-hour days doing backbreaking work. The very epitome of that, of course, is the men and women who serve in our Canadian Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720845">Service members are asked to go to places in the world that, in some cases, they may never even have heard of before to defend the freedoms of people they do not know. When they do that, all they ask in return is that we do our best to ensure that those freedoms are protected and to ensure that we use our democracy to make sure there are the opportunities and the security we talked about. Instead what they have received over the last nine years is a government that, following the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s lead, just looks for what is in it for them. What can they do to enrich their friends? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720846">The SDTC fund is an example of that. In some cases, the $400 million went to companies that SDTC board members were involved in personally. If we look up “conflict of interest” in the dictionary, the board would be pictured there. That is not right. That is not what this is supposed to be about. The men and women who served our country just wanted us to show them good government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720847"> On top of all that, imagine what we could have done for our veterans and their families with the $400 million. I have a number of other examples that I want to share with the House in a moment, of what could have been done with the $400 million had it not been spent to enrich the personal interests of people who were involved. Imagine, just for a second, what we could have done for our veterans and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720848">As the Conservative shadow minister for veterans affairs, I hear heartbreaking stories every single day from veterans, from their families and from the families they have left behind in some cases, of just a complete and utter lack of support. I have often heard this referred to, by veterans and their families many times, as a triple-D policy. The policy entails delays and denials, and the third D stands for “die”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720849">There are long delays in trying to get the benefits or services that veterans and their families are entitled to by virtue of the service they gave this country. They deserve the benefits and services. It is the least we can do. However, they face not weeks or months of delays, but we are literally talking years of delays. I hear every single day from veterans who have waited years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720850">I would like everyone to stop and let that sink in. Veterans served this country. Then they come back home and want to be able to get on with their life after a transition out of the Canadian Armed Forces. There are things they need in order to be able to do that. There are benefits and services they are entitled to, that they have earned, in some cases with their blood, but they wait years and cannot get those benefits. That is absolutely ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720851">In some cases, veterans are denied over and over again, and they have to fight tooth and nail. They fought for this country. They should not have to come back and fight with the government to get what they deserve. That is what they have to do, and it becomes so difficult. In some cases, this is where the third D comes in. Many veterans tell me they believe it is actually intentional and there is an effort to try to delay and deny for so long that a veteran will give up. They will lose all hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720852">It does not matter whether that is actually what happens or not. If it is the perception a veteran has, and many of them do have it, then it is the reality. It is not right and it absolutely must be fixed. We have lost far too many veterans. Too many veterans end up homeless in this country. Veterans are using food banks to such a level that some veterans association food banks are telling me that they actually are having trouble keeping the shelves stocked to be able to help our veterans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720853">We should never even be uttering those things in the same sentence. The idea of a homeless veteran should not exist. The idea of a veteran using a food bank should not exist. The idea that a veteran has to give up hope because they have fought with their government for years for something that they fought for and deserve should not exist. It should be simple. The effort should be to try to make sure we are there and to make it easy for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720854">Instead, I hear stories every day of veterans being asked to prove something. For example, I heard the story of someone having lost two legs because of a roadside bomb, and then they have had to prove every single year that they are still missing limbs. That is just one example of many I have heard. Veterans fought for this country. They literally gave life and limb for this country. The injured ones then have to fight to prove they were injured serving this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720855">I might have the figures slightly wrong, but they would not be off by much. The Veterans Review and Appeal Board is an agency to which veterans who have gone through all of the possible different channels can take an appeal. I have heard many times that on certain types of claims, the Veterans Review and Appeal Board often ends up, if the veteran persists long enough and fights long enough to get there, approving well over 90% of the claims at that level. Why did it have to take years of fighting with the government to get there? Why could we not approve the claims and let veterans have what they need to move on with life?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720856">On top of it all, I could get into the fact that situations come up in this country where, in the last few years under the Liberal government, veterans have come looking for help to live their life. The words that have been used by officials at Veterans Affairs to veterans are that if living their life is so hard they could offer them assisted death. That has actually happened; I have heard it from a number of veterans. I have heard of cases like this numerous times. It causes what is called sanctuary trauma, where the institution that is supposed to help someone actually causes more trauma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720857">I was talking to a veteran last week who told me that his wife knows before he even tells her when he has been on the phone with Veterans Affairs, because he is agitated. He said that the worst days he has are the days he has to talk to Veterans Affairs on the phone. Before she even asks him whether he has been talking to Veterans Affairs, she knows the answer, because it affects him that badly. I can only imagine what a veteran like that, after all of that, must think when they hear about stuff like the SDTC fund on top of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720858">The government is fighting tooth and nail to ensure that it does not pay out benefits to a veteran who has earned them. Then $400 million is given to its friends through a green slush fund. Can members imagine what that must feel like to a veteran who has fought for years, and in some cases has had to take the government to court, to get what they are entitled to? I think it is important we remember that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720859"> I have heard Liberal members talk about the fact that they feel like the debate is a big waste of time and that we should be doing all these other things here, and so on. I do not disagree; it would be nice to be doing those things. However, at the end of the day, the heart of the matter is about the $400 million that was forcibly removed from the pockets of taxpayers and given out to their friends, Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720860">Veterans have had to scratch and claw to try to get what they have coming to them, what they deserve and what they are owed by virtue of the service they gave to this country. Then they watch the Liberals steal it for their friends. I can only imagine how horrible that must make a veteran feel. It is disgraceful and shameful.</ParaText>

It is the right thing to do. If it is the right thing to do, then why can the government not just do it? We could then all work together on a number of important things. I would be thrilled to be able to do that. This government just simply needs to comply with what is being required here. Also, while I have the floor, I may as well say that it needs to start showing some respect and appreciation for those who serve this country and have served this country, because right now, it is not happening. </ParaText>

We are not talking about a liver, we are talking about legs. Legs do not grow back. </ParaText>

If we multiply the time that takes by the doctor's salary and by the number of people living with a disability, it costs Quebeckers and Canadian taxpayers approximately $1 billion a year to prove that a person is living with a disability.</ParaText>

For her benefit and for the benefit of everyone in the House, I want to tell another story, briefly, about a veteran in Quebec. She has a back injury as a result of her service and she requires a wheelchair lift to be able to get out of her wheelchair and into her home. Right now, she has to literally drag herself across a gravel driveway to get into her home. The Liberal government has been fighting with her for years trying to deny her that wheelchair lift. She was actually one of the individuals I mentioned who, when she was begging for help, was told that, if it was so difficult, they could offer her medical assistance in dying instead.

              <ParaText id="8720875">Madam Speaker, let me first comment on the comment my colleague made about the Veterans Association Food Bank in Edmonton. I have visited that food bank on a couple of occasions to just check in with them to see how things are going for veterans. There are actually two veterans food banks in Edmonton. They both have trouble keeping the shelves stocked. I see that in communities all across this country. It should never be the case that we even need a veterans food bank, let alone that we cannot seem to find ways to keep the shelves stocked because the demand is so great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720876">To the point he raised, those who serve and have served see things like he mentioned, and they see that they are so underfunded. In some cases they are buying their own helmets. Can we imagine the ridiculousness of that? They are having to buy some of their own equipment because they cannot get it provided to them. We hear stories like the ones I have told about veterans who cannot get the benefits they are entitled to for years. Then we hear that the very thing those people went to fight against is receiving funding. There is so much more we could do to ensure our military members have the equipment and resources they need, so much more we could do to ensure our veterans have what they deserve. Instead, we send this money away to places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720877">It is just disgraceful. It is time we start to rechannel that into making sure our forces have what they need, into ensuring our veterans have what they need. That is going to have a big impact not just on the morale, which is an incredibly important thing, not just on our ability to be operationally ready in this country to do the job we need to do to defend this country, but also on our ability to work with other governments and to have Canada have a place of influence in the world.

              <ParaText id="8720878"> Madam Speaker, here we are, five weeks in, and we are still debating the Liberal government's refusal to produce documents relating to the latest scandal, the green slush fund scandal, as ordered by Parliament on June 10. This is the third time that I am rising to speak on this issue, so I want to take a slightly different approach. I want to talk about the legal principle of subsequent remedial measures, in the law, of evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720879">That rule says that evidence of a defendant or a possible defendant in a civil case effecting repairs to some obstacle that injured a person in order to avoid future similar injuries is not admissible in the court of law. The principle behind that is that we do not want to disincentivize people from actually making repairs to prevent future injuries. The example that is often given is when a homeowner repairs the steps up to the front door on which the postal delivery person was seriously injured the day before. Is doing the repair effectively an admission of liability? The answer is yes, probably, but here is the point. That evidence is not admissible in a court of law for the basic public policy principle that I stated before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720880">How does that apply to the current case relating to the green slush fund? A little bit of background is in order. The Auditor General revealed some shocking findings in her June 2024 report, which was tabled in Parliament on June 6, I believe, about how the Liberal government had turned SDTC, a federally governed and owned business, into a green slush fund for Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720881">Here are some of her findings. She found that SDTC gave out the following in taxpayer dollars: $58 million to 10 ineligible projects without even ensuring that contribution agreements were in place and the terms met. On some of them, the applicants could not even demonstrate the development of green technology or any environmental benefit at all. The purpose of SDTC was just ignored. There were $334 million and over 186 cases where there were clear conflicts of interest. This is board members at SDTC voting for each other's applicant grants, clearly a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720882">One of the whistle-blowers had this to say:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720884">This is very serious, not just mismanagement, but allegations from a credible source that there is criminal activity under way. Where there is smoke, there is fire. We, the opposition, did what we are supposed to do, which was to hold the government to account.

              <ParaText id="8720887">The Conservative motion passed on June 10 with the help of the NDP and the Bloc Québécois. I thank them very much. It was only the Liberal members of Parliament who voted against it, because they were worried. They did not like it. They did not like the order. Over the summer months, they just ignored it. They delivered some of the documents but clearly not all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720888">When we got back here in September, things got ugly pretty quickly. Our House leader, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation>, on the first day back, rose on a question of privilege “concerning the failure of the government to comply with the order that the House adopted on Monday, June 10.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720889"> That was presented to the Speaker, and the Speaker agreed with us, confirming that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and all relevant government departments had not fully complied, but that they must comply with this order made in June for unredacted documents. At the time, the Speaker said, “The Chair cannot come to any other conclusion but to find that a prima facie question of privilege has been established.” In parliamentary terms, that is a serious allegation. There was a breach of privilege and that should have embarrassed the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720890"> It is pretty clear and easy to understand what the Speaker meant, so why are we still here, five weeks later, debating this question of privilege? The answer is simple. The Liberal government is still not complying with it. Why not? We do not know. The government has raised some smokescreens and innuendo, but it has not come clean to say why it is not complying. As long as that goes on, the longer this fiasco drags on, the more suspicious we become that perhaps the aforementioned whistle-blower is right that there was criminal activity going on here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720891">I want to get back to my original comments about the principle of subsequent remedial measures. Such evidence, as I said, is generally not admissible in a court of law. Did the Liberals actually take remedial action to try to fix SDTC after they claimed they were as surprised as the rest of us were that this corruption and mismanagement was going on? The answer is no, they did not do anything. As a matter of fact, they just wound up SDTC. There was so much corruption, so much smoke, so much contamination that even the Liberals were embarrassed by it. Rather than trying to fix it, they just wound it up altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720892">Now we are really suspicious, along with Canadians. What are the Liberals hiding? What was going on at STDC? Why are we not getting the documents? Canadians want to know. What does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office know? What is in those documents that the Liberals are refusing to produce? What are they hiding? Was there criminal activity? Can we recover some of the taxpayer money, $400 million altogether? Canadians deserve to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720893"> The total amount of money, as I said, was $400 million. What could we do with that money? We could do a lot of good, positive things, as the previous speaker, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278422" Type="2">Banff—Airdrie</Affiliation>, just said. It could certainly help veterans and parents. It could help people who have been going to food banks who cannot afford groceries in these high inflationary times. Four hundred million dollars goes a long way to solve many problems. It could have been much better used than having it distributed by Liberal insiders among themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720894">I would like to compare this to the scandal of some years ago, the sponsorship scandal that brought down the previous Liberal government. That was only $40 million. This is 10 times as large. This is very significant and taxpayers, I think, need to understand what is going on here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720895">Things were not always corrupt at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It had a great reputation at one time. It was created by an act of Parliament back in the Liberal days of former prime minister Jean Chrétien to promote investing in green technology, a laudable goal. It continued its work under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper and likely it would still be thriving today if the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had just resisted getting his fingerprints all over it. However, he just could not resist the temptation of putting his own friends in there. He and his industry minister at the time, Navdeep Bains, could not resist putting their own close friends in charge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720896">They fired the old board and put in their own friends. Many of them owned businesses that were applicants or potential applicants for grants under this program. Maybe somebody could have raised a red flag to say there was a lot of potential for conflict of interest, but that did not seem to concern anybody on the government side of the House. The result was that the Liberal-appointed board created an environment where conflicts of interest became the norm. Conflicts of interest were tolerated; they were managed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720897">In that orchestrated manner, these Liberal-appointed board members were able to, nicely, award grants to each other. This is the way it went: “Hey, you vote for my project, and I'll vote for your project.” That is what the whistle-blower told us. That is what the Auditor General uncovered. The Liberals broke SDTC, as they have broken so much else in Canada. I just want to raise a couple of examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720898"> Recent statistics from Statistics Canada about crime in Canada are really quite shocking. During nine years of the Liberal government, violent crime has increased by 50%. Homicides are up 28%. Sexual assaults are up by 75%. Gang violence has nearly doubled, and auto theft is up by 46%. Extortion is up by an astonishing 357%. Recently, the Liberal government has been forced to admit that 256 people were killed in 2022 by criminals who were out on bail or other forms of release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720899">This all happened under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s watch, with his Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which eliminated many of the mandatory minimum sentences for serious crimes, and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, the catch-and-release bill that puts accused people out on bail on the least restrictive conditions possible. Canadians are concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720900">This is what our police are saying about the Liberals and how they have been mismanaging criminal law responsibilities and, specifically, their record on gun crime. The Toronto Police Association had this to say, speaking to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: “Criminals did not get your message. Our communities are experiencing a 45% increase in shootings and a 62% increase in gun-related homicides compared to...last year. What difference does your handgun ban make when 85% of guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720901"> The Vancouver Police Union had this to say about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s record on managing gun crime: “Guessing he’s not aware of the ongoing gang war here in B.C. which is putting both our members and public at risk on a daily basis.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720902">The Surrey Police Union, right next door to my community of Langley, says, “The federal handgun freeze fails to address the real issue: the surge of illegal firearms coming across our borders and ending up in the hands of violent criminals.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720903">It is not just the police who are concerned about the drastic rise of crime in our streets and our cities. I heard from a group of CEOs and other directors of a group of downtown business improvement associations from across British Columbia. I am familiar with the work that business improvement associations do because I sat on the board of the Downtown Surrey BIA for a few years before I was elected to Parliament. That is where my law office was, so I am very familiar with the area and very familiar with the work the BIA does. I was happy to meet with this group to hear their concerns and their solutions to some of Canada's toughest problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720904"> I found it remarkable that this is what these community organizations are asking for. Number one is to invest in mental health, addictions and homelessness support across Canada. Indeed, homelessness is a problem right across Canada, but particularly so in our downtown cores. I am thinking of the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, which at one time was a beautiful place but is not anymore because of homelessness, crime and chaos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720905"> The second ask is this, from the community organizers of our downtown cores: to ensure Canada's downtowns and main streets are safe and inclusive spaces by initiating a systematic review across the country concerning the bail system and implementing further changes to the system by reforming Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which is a bill that went through the House not too long ago that took a small step in the direction of bail reform. They are saying it needs to be extended, not just for serious repeat violent offenders but also for theft offenders.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720906"> They are saying we need to stop the easy bail practices that have become the norm in Canada with the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="13180632" Type="3">C-75</Document>. The Vancouver Police Department talks about the same 40 individuals having negative interactions with the police 6,000 times in one year; that is every second day for 40 people. Imagine what the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver would look like if those 40 people were not on our streets. This is the message we are getting from community organizers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720907"> The third thing they are asking for is to incentivize local entrepreneurs and commercial entities to form businesses in downtowns and on main streets. This is what they are asking for: give people shelter, keep repeat thieves off the streets, and create an environment where businesses and entrepreneurs come flocking back to the downtown core. This is what ordinary Canadian citizens want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720908">People are reporting that they feel less safe on our streets. Those fears are now being supported by evidence from Statistics Canada and from credible and, I would say, non-partisan organizations like police unions and business improvement associations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720909"> The <Affiliation DbId="299997" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> should meet with people like that instead of just left-leaning law professors from Liberal-friendly law schools who teach their criminal law courses from a pro-accused perspective instead of from a pro-victim perspective. Our Attorney General would benefit, indeed, all of Canada would benefit, if he and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would listen to the concerns of ordinary Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720910"> These are the things we should be talking about, or would be talking about if the Liberal government would just comply with the order so we could get down to business again. We should be talking about stopping the crime, building homes, implementing a fair and competitive tax regime by axing the tax, and fixing the Liberals' out-of-control, never-ending, inflation-producing deficit budgets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720911">Until the Liberals come to their senses and comply with the order, I guess we are just going to remain in this holding pattern. Here is a better idea: The Prime Minister could walk to the Governor General's house and acknowledge what everybody knows, that he has lost the confidence of this House and that the 44th Parliament should be dissolved and we should call an election. I spoke to many people when in my home community last week for Remembrance Day, as well as in the neighbouring community of Cloverdale—Langley City, where there is a by-election going on because the Liberal member of Parliament resigned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720912"> I am hearing from people on the street that they are very anxious and eager to have a general election. They are happy with a by-election, but they want a general election. They want to stop the corruption, they want to fix what the Liberals have broken and they want a government that is going to have common-sense solutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720913">Canadians deserve a government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Canadians deserve a government that does not play favourites for Liberal insiders but creates an environment where non-insiders can work and get ahead. They deserve a Canada that delivers on its promise to all who call it home: that hard work earns a powerful paycheque and pension, and buys affordable groceries and affordable homes on safe streets, in beautiful neighbourhoods, where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720914">This is all achievable, but first, we need to have a general election and a common-sense Conservative government that will start working seriously on these issues that concern ordinary Canadians.</ParaText>

A select few felt, for whatever reason, that maybe the government should not comply with the will of Parliament. I read about 30 of those answers into the record last month, and I am going to use the opportunity again in this speech to read their words into the record again.

              <ParaText id="8720972">What does this subamendment get to? Basically, it is highlighting the conditions for ending this blockage of Parliament, this Liberal filibuster, by simply turning over the unredacted documents related to SDTC, more commonly known to most Canadians as the Liberal green slush fund. While the Liberals claimed that they have turned over thousands of documents, it has been reported, and the counsel to the House of Commons has reported in committee, that many of them have been redacted and the Liberals have not complied with the order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720973">I noticed that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has given three speeches on this question of privilege already, and he has had, I am pretty sure, over 300 interventions on this topic alone. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8720974">He somehow continues to claim that this is a Conservative filibuster. In reality, the Liberals have the ability to end this blockage in the House of Commons today if they simply turn over the documents. Members from all officially recognized parties in the House have been speaking to this question of privilege for quite some time now. An important aspect I did not get to in my first speech is what this fund is about. It is a fund that has been around for over 20 years. It was given a clean bill of health back in the 2018 time frame, with no issues. It was established to promote research and development, to support green technology funds right across Canada. That is a good cause; I think this is something that members in the House totally agree on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720975">Unfortunately, this scandal, this mismanagement of 400 million dollars' worth of funds by Liberal insiders, with over 186 conflicts of interest, has created a huge problem for a lot of these green technology companies across Canada that are not part of the scandal. They were not tied to this insider corruption. Back in June, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> announced a new governance framework for clean tech funding and said, “Effective immediately, SDTC will also resume funding, under a reinforced contribution agreement with ISED, for eligible projects in a sector vital to our country’s economy and clean growth transition.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720976">“In line with the Auditor General's findings,” the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said, “[his] Department will enhance oversight and monitoring of funding during the transition period.” Here we are, five months after that announcement, and there are still unknowns. There is a green technology company in my own riding, employing approximately 70 employees. Those 70 people are working hard to make Canada a global leader in green hydrogen. Where is the money they were pre-approved for? They are not one of the organizations tied to the corruption and these conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720977">I guess I will pre-propose a question I might get from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. He is normally the one who likes to ask me questions. He will have time; my speech still has approximately 11 minutes left. He can go talk to the government and try to get an answer, as the spokesperson in this place for the government, about when that money is going to start to flow. In my riding alone, there are 70 people depending upon this flow of money that is supposed to be still going through for the companies that were not in conflict. If there are dozens just in my own riding, I guarantee that there are hundreds of Canadians across this great country who are sitting in a status of unknown. They do not know whether they are still going to have a job. The funding is supposed to be flowing in the new year or whenever it is supposed to be coming; it has been already pre-approved, but they do not know when they are going to get that funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720978">I ask the parliamentary secretary to do some digging into that over the next few minutes or encourage the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to come and inform all members this decision has an impact on, to give them a status update in a timely fashion. These businesses are doing phenomenal work to help address green technology across this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720988">Bill from Kemble said, “The Liberal government must obey the wishes of Parliament and deliver the un-redacted documents over to the RCMP. Failure to do so should invoke charges of obstructing justice against the prime minister and his minions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720989"> “All persons or companies that illegitimately obtained funding must be made to pay back with interest all monies received. Additionally, criminal charges relating to fraud should be brought against the CEOs and other top executives.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8720990">Deborah from Georgian Bluffs wrote, “The Liberal horse is long out of the barn. As far as I can tell, the Liberals have executed a number of activities that are highly suspect at best, possibly criminal, some by commission and others by omission, and yet they remain in power and have been in no way held accountable.

But, unfortunately, I am sure nothing will be resolved and those who received the money will never pay it back and nothing will be done to the politicians who gave this money to their friends.

              <ParaText id="8720995">Gary said, “The Liberals should absolutely adhere to the will of Parliament. Isn't that what democracy is all about?

              <ParaText id="8720996">Bill said, “Yes, the Liberal government should definitely turn over the requested documents immediately to the RCMP, and any Liberal insider who was awarded a contract illegitimately through the SDTC should be required to repay the amount.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8720999">That gets to a key point, which is important for everybody to remember. This approximately $400 million of money that was handed out was only a sample set of the billion-dollar slush fund.

              <ParaText id="8721000">I do not know how many comments I just read into the record. Ultimately, the key message from them to us here in this chamber and to the government is to provide transparency and accountability. It is the role of parliamentarians and Parliament to hold the government to account and to oversee the government spending of Canadians' hard-earned tax dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721001">By refusing to comply with the Speaker's decision to produce the documents, the government is undermining the principle and integrity of the House.

              <ParaText id="8721002"> Parliament is the House of the people, the people of my constituency of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound and, for that matter, all the constituencies across this country who trusted us and elected us to represent them. We are here to be the people's voice in Ottawa and ensure that we are good stewards of every single one of their tax dollars. Perhaps more than ever, as people struggle with the cost of living crisis and try hard every day just to put food on the table and pay to have a roof over their heads, Canadians deserve to know their tax dollars are being spent prudently, responsibly and on programs that will impact their lives in a positive way, not to line Liberal insiders' pockets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721003">In preparing for my speech today, I reviewed some of the excellent speeches by my Conservative colleagues. I appreciated learning something new from my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278374" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation> when he highlighted some claims the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> made back in 2013, which was before my time and privilege to be in this esteemed chamber. The then leader of the Liberal Party proclaimed that a future Liberal government would “be coming out shortly with a way to open up and be more transparent about all our expenses in a way that will restore Canadians' confidence and trust in holders of public office”. He stated, “We will certainly offer a level of transparency that hasn't been seen before.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721004">A lot of Canadians believed those words and rewarded the member for <Affiliation DbId="278369" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> in 2015 with a majority government. Unfortunately, when the Prime Minister said we would have a level of transparency and accountability like we had never seen before, Canadians, I am pretty sure, assumed then that there was going to be more transparency and more accountability. Unfortunately, over these last nine years, we have seen exactly the opposite. As we have seen, the government and the Prime Minister have slammed the door shut on accountability and transparency when it comes to Canadian taxpayer dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721005">In summary, the Liberal government is accountable to Parliament, and Parliament's will is supreme. It is not my Conservative colleagues who are obstructing the business of the House of Commons. It is the Liberal government that is going against the will of the democratically elected House of Commons. The Liberals have the ability to end the blockage in the House of Commons today if they simply hand over the documents. We are here to hold the government to account, to be honest, be transparent and make sure the hard-earned taxpayer dollars of Canadians across this country, in my riding, in the Speaker's riding, in all ridings, are being spent for the right reasons and in an accountable, transparent manner. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721006">I am hoping the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has an answer to my question. Hopefully, he can explain how the money is going to flow to the green tech companies that are doing so much to address important issues like climate change across this country, trying to make a difference and make Canada a global leader, but are being held up because of the Liberal scandal and this mess that has been created. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721017">Mr. Speaker, that is a good question, and it is something I talked about in my first speech. How did we get into this mess? I highlighted that this fund worked really well for 20 years, but where did it go off the rails? It was when the former Liberal minister, Navdeep Bains, decided to appoint a chair of SDTC who had conflicts of interest, despite being forewarned about the appointment of that member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721018">Ultimately, the issue, after we dug into it, was that the Liberal government-appointed board members of SDTC did not seem to have any ethics. There were 186 conflicts of interest. That is the key.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721042">Canadians have lost faith in the NDP-Liberal coalition, which seems to be alive and well. Nearly 20% of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s caucus, 24 members, signed a letter asking for a leadership review. What happened yesterday? One of his ministers resigned. Some people think he may be the other Randy.

Things are crumbling on that side of the House. Canadians can see it. The business of the country is falling apart.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721043">On June 10, a motion was adopted calling for documents related to the SDTC fund to be produced to the law clerk. What happened over the summer? Nothing.

              <ParaText id="8721044">The common-sense <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> raised this question of privilege because of a failure to comply with that House order. On September 26, the Speaker ruled that the House's privilege had been breached, give or a take a day or two. What is a day or two?

As members heard me say today in a question, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> why he will not call an election and let the people vote on his crime record. I attended a town hall this past Friday in a town of 800 people, Friday afternoon. Nearly 300 people showed up at that town hall on crime. RCMP members were there too, talking about how their hands are tied.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721047">The criminal justice system is not being supported for rural Canadians. They do not even see the point in laying charges in a lot of cases, because minimum sentences will be thrown out of court, and cases take so long to make their way through the criminal justice system in Newfoundland and Labrador. In fact, not long ago, a murder case that was pretty much cut-and-dried got thrown right out of court because it had waited so long without having one day in court. This is happening all over the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721048">When the police have to have everything perfect, and if the RCMP has to wait three or four years to get the ducks in a row to do a major cocaine bust or crack bust, to shut down a crack house, how many more addicts are being created week after week, month after month and year after year? The NDP-Liberals' soft-on-crime criminal justice system favours the criminal. However, it disadvantages those who are impacted by crime and those families whose loved ones are addicts or are becoming addicts where the crime is addiction related.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721049"> People who worked hard all their lives, senior citizens, attended a town hall, and not just one, not just two, not just three but a multitude of them stood up and told the RCMP that they were sleeping with a gun next to their bed. That is an infraction of the Criminal Code, but what can the RCMP do? It does not have any resources, and the people feel like they are left to fend for themselves. It is becoming like the Wild West; it is crazy. It is deplorable and it should not be happening in Canada, specifically in rural Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721050">During the pandemic, people moved from metro regions of Canada back to their rural communities, to where they grew up and where they felt safe, but where now, just a short two or three years later, they are so afraid that they are telling us they are sleeping with a gun next to their bed. I heard it with my very own ears. The RCMP heard it. It is not hearsay. It is not something about which the media is going to say, “Oh, [the member for <Affiliation DbId="278784" Type="2">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame</Affiliation>] is a big bluff. He is hyping it all up. He is making this stuff up and being dramatic.” This is very real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721051"> I spoke to a member of the clergy a few days before I went to the town hall meeting. I said to him, “You're a man of faith and you're in the community”, and I asked him, “What are you hearing?” I told him what I am hearing. He said, “MP, what's going to happen is that vigilantism is going to take over and somebody is going to get shot.” This is absolutely deplorable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721052">The police do not have the resources. The depot was shut down for two years while every university, every community college and every high school in Canada was full on. The education system found a way to operate. Why did the RCMP depot have to be shut down for two years while the members that the RCMP has are moving into retirement age? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721053">The RCMP knew what the shortfall would be with no recruits graduating from the college for two full years. Whose directive was it? I do not think it was a directive from the RCMP to shut down the depot. I think the directive came from the soft NDP-Liberal leadership. It is absolutely terrible, and I am sure my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278182" Type="2">Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan</Affiliation> understands that the RCMP college could have kept graduating members.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721054">Right now rural crime is on the rise and addiction-related crime is going through the roof. The latter is a tricky kind of crime for the police to address because it is addiction-driven. There is absolutely, in most cases, no motive, no logic and no nothing. It is just driven by the need for the next fix, and the poor addicts cannot even think through the process of right and wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721055">Where else could some of the $400 million have been spent? I think about the oyster industry in Prince Edward Island. I visited there this past summer. An industry that means over $100 million to the economy of Prince Edward Island is completely in peril. The people of Prince Edward Island were promised a million dollars to conduct research to try to solve the MSX parasite problem that is going to completely wipe out the oyster industry in Prince Edward Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721056">It would probably be safe to say that members would like to enjoy a nice Malpeque oyster once in a while. They are not going to be enjoying any in two years' or three years' time, because the parasite kills any oyster that is infested with it within two years, and it is going to completely wipe out the entire oyster industry in Prince Edward Island. We are not hearing anything from the members who represent Prince Edward Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721057"> I am glad as an Islander to stand here and speak on behalf of the oyster industry in Prince Edward Island, and just a little ways away on another island, Îles de la Madeleine, the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> announced not long ago lots of money from the blue slush fund for small-craft harbours. The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, one member of the House out of 338, delivered 20% of all small-craft harbour projects to her own riding, and P.E.I. gets $500,000 a year. In August, a summit was promised to bring in industry experts to discuss the oyster MSX problem. There has been no talk of it whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721058">There are so many things happening in this country that affect rural economies and rural security, and they are being neglected. It is a burden we carry, representing the people who sent us here to speak up on issues that matter to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721059"> Another very, very big matter in my province of Newfoundland and Labrador is the failure of DFO science in carrying out adequate and accurate stock assessments on our northern cod. Right now, rumours are flying around that the vessel that was conducting the ground trawl survey has been having all kinds of mechanical issues, and that once again, for the fourth year in a row, we are in jeopardy of not having a complete, accurate northern cod survey.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721060">For the people who are involved in the fishing industry back home, it is complete neglect. When there are questions about the cod biomass, the finger always gets pointed at the survey. If the survey is incomplete, that is the best that we have. Follow the precautionary principle, and the maximum harvest potential can never be realized. Those are dollars that do not flow into our coastal communities and our coastal economies. They are new dollars that never get a chance to enter our economy, and that is not good enough.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721061"> In the spring of 2022 I brought forward a bill to address the ecological disaster and the imbalance that exist in our ocean ecosystems due to the overpopulation of pinnipeds. Pinnipeds include seals, sea lions and walruses. Just the available quota this year, if it were taken, would reduce the consumption of fish by over a million tonnes. All of the nutrition, the value of clothing and everything that goes with it, is sitting there. It is a waste, and it is destroying our marine ecosystem and reducing the GDP in our blue economy. Maybe some of the $400 million could have gone into redeveloping our markets for seal products, but it is just not happening. All we hear is promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721062">There are lots of groups. They do a little study, and it is $500,000 for one, $100,000 for another, and $750,000 for another, but there are no results. We need results. The taxpayers' dollars could be invested in something that is going to give results. We do not know what the money is being invested in. We cannot get the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721063"> We need the documents, and we need to get on with the business of the House. We need to start tackling crime. We need to fix the budget, and I guess we will soon find out what that looks like. We will have something to chew into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721064"> Then we look at the issue we are continually bringing up here in the House. The number one thing I hear about, next to crime, is “When are we having a carbon tax election?” It is time to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Everything I have spoken about here so far included three of those four pillars, so I cannot lose the opportunity to talk about the one that is taking the most money out of the wallets of Canadians: the carbon tax. The farmers who grow the food are taxed, the truckers who truck the food are taxed, and the factories that produce the food are taxed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721065">I am sure the member from <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg</Affiliation> has eaten the odd can of Campbell's soup in his day. I wonder what he thinks it was cooked with. Was it a grass fire? I do not think so. A good old bit of diesel fuel is now getting the big factory burners going, cooking up the soup for the member. The trucker trucks it into a Loblaws somewhere. One good thing about a can of Campbell's soup is that it can be stored on the shelf. It does not need to be put it in the big freezers and refrigerator units that the government supplied. It is very efficient sitting on the shelf.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721066"> When the Liberal government wants to dish out money to its friends, like Loblaws, that is no problem, but when the oyster fishermen and the oyster aquaculture industry are in peril in P.E.I., they are thrown to the wolves like the rest of Canadians who are depending on better from the government.</ParaText>

The Harper administration, in 2012, put in a three-year plan, not a one-year plan, to take $143 million out of the CBSA budget, to get rid of frontline workers and others who protected our borders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721069">This member was also part of the current group that, over a year ago, went line by line through the budget against funding CBSA and its workers. Back in 2012, the union and many other experts identified that guns coming illegally into Canada would come in a more diverse area and at a significant threshold. They said there would be more pornography coming into Canada and that there would be more people entering illegally. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721070">Will the member apologize and own up to the responsibility that Stephen Harper started attacking workers who defend our border every single day? Also, why was the $143 million not restored after they found out it was true that all those things went up because of Harper's cuts?</ParaText>

The government that is in place is nine years old. The member just went back 12 years. Who is responsible for the last nine years? We are not talking about 2012 here. We are talking about the present and the conditions people are living in from coast to coast to coast. They keep bringing back Mr. Harper. There have been nine years of NDP-Liberal rule. It is time for it to come to an end and to call a carbon tax election right now.</ParaText>

These EVs are just not safe. When they catch fire, it is impossible to put the fire out. It is a safety issue to even have lithium batteries in a vehicle. People are getting stuck in these vehicles. The rules surrounding them are so weak. In Canada, EVs just do not work. They are not selling. The government is dishing out $35 billion to battery plants in Montreal and in southern Ontario for products that are not going to be sold. That is another waste of taxpayers' money. We can tack that $35 billion onto this $400 billion. </ParaText>

My friend is actually the member for <Affiliation DbId="278738" Type="2">Calgary Confederation</Affiliation>. He and I collaborate on a lot of things because we are both the downtown members from Calgary. We have great constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721102">We are here tonight, again, because the government refuses to turn over documents the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> demanded. The Speaker demanded that the government provide these documents to Parliament, which is the Speaker's right. It is Parliament's right to get these documents, in their unredacted form, as we call the government to account on a report the Auditor General gave on a fund called SDTC, the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund. The Auditor General reported $400 million of unaccountable spending, which we have referred to many times as the green slush fund because of the way the government has spent its money. The Auditor General's findings were telling in so many ways. When we look at the conflicts of interest upon conflicts of interest, none of these funds should have been disbursed the way they were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721103">Many of the projects funded through SDTC did not even meet the eligibility requirements. At the end of the day, this happened because a bunch of Liberal-connected insiders were writing cheques to each other and approving money going into each of their companies. This included companies that are partially owned by people who sit on the Liberal bench, which is a shame. It is the definition of a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721104">The government does not want to disclose this to Parliament. However, we can go back to the constitutional set-up, how we function in this place. The government is the executive; we are the legislature. In Canada, the legislature is supreme. We are all elected across Canada, 338 of us. The Speaker has talked about showing respect to each other; this is legislative respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721105">The government must obey the rules of Parliament. If we do not have these rules and we do not know how to function together anymore, we will not be able to continue as a country in the way we govern ourselves, and have for so long, as a democracy. What is at stake here is the governance we have as an actual democracy. This is reminiscent of what happened during COVID; then, the same government took the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s predecessor to court because it was ordered to provide documents on the Winnipeg lab scandal. In that scandal, a whole bunch of information was provided to a foreign government through a bunch of agents. The head of the Public Health Agency of Canada was brought to the bar to testify in front of Parliament about why he would not provide those documents. It was demanded that he provide them, and the government subsequently took the Speaker's predecessor to court to say it did not have to provide Parliament with those documents. That is a clear aberration of democracy, the way we practise it in Canada, and so is this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721106">This is an aberration. We have to get back to the way we govern ourselves effectively together. Canadians need to understand how their democracy works, and it is not in the way the government is treating their democracy. This is not an autocracy; this is a democracy. There are 338 people elected. I think we are up to about 120 now on this side of the House in the Conservative Party of Canada, and it looks as though we are going to do quite a bit better going forward. However, the government is going to abnormal lengths, at this point in time, to subvert the will of Parliament. We can think about that: subverting the will of Parliament. I am not sure this will continue, but so far, we have managed to hold the three opposition parties together to make sure we continue on this path. We are not going to commence with any of the government business until these documents are provided to the House of Commons for our inspection to find out where $400 million of taxpayer money actually went and whose pockets this money went into.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721107">This is our right to claim, and we are doing that. We are standing here. I hope the other two parties stay with us in this and do not crumble because they are getting some kind of bribe. I do think that is part of the card game that the Liberals want to play. They have to bribe one of these other parties to no longer commit to this effort to make sure Parliament is held in the respect due to it. There is a lot at stake. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721108">In Question Period, every day, we talk about the opposition parties holding government to account. Most Canadians think that happens in Question Period, but it is no longer even a functional part of holding the government to account.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8721109"> Questions are asked and answers are not given. The government sometimes thinks it is its job to ask questions of the opposition about what is happening over here. Question period is about the functioning of government, and every one of those questions we ask should be about the accountability of government and what the government is doing at any one point in time, but it is not functioning that way. Canadians are watching the practice of democracy being whittled down on a daily basis. I beseech you, Mr. Speaker, to get hold of question period, hold the government to account and make the Liberals provide answers during that 45-minute session every day when Canadians get to watch the government's answers to the questions asked by responsible members of the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721110">We are talking about a $400-million slush fund here, and I want to get to the root of it. Exposing this slush fund will expose a lot because there are a bunch of actors here that the government goes hand in hand with. They are shaking each other's hands and effectively moving money into people's pockets. It is a great redistribution of wealth from Canadian taxpayers to friends of the government. I say that with some reservation because it is almost an accusation and it is not my style to make direct accusations, but why are the Liberals not providing the documents? It has been almost two months. They are withholding something for very good reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721111">I will go back to what we are looking at. It is a redistribution method the government has at this point where it is taking money from taxpayers and giving it to people it believes are on its side. This cannot go on forever because despite the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said we would only have a $40-billion deficit, it is going to be more than $46 billion this year. That adds to the $1.3-trillion federal government debt we have in this country, which is about $30,000 per Canadian, not per family but per Canadian. That is $120,000 of debt for a family of four. On top of that, there is a provincial debt, which is almost the same, but call it $55,000 of debt per Canadian between our two levels of government, which is obscene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721112">We are $2.2 trillion in debt across this country. We are spending more on interest now than we are spending on anything else. We could spend all this money, coming up to $90 billion a year, on something besides debt if we got a hold of this. It is an awful amount of money to be coming off our income statement every year. It is unsustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721113">What happens once we go through all that? Inflation is going to make sure there is less money in everybody's pockets for their take-home pay, their rent, what they provide for their kids and their families, for their futures and their pensions. The government is inflating peoples' savings down so it is worth less and less as far as what they buy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721114">I am going to divert at this point to talk about what happened last week. It is relevant because the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was over in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29, the Conference of the Parties, about new environmental measures. When he went over there, he pledged more money from Canadian taxpayers, an extra billion dollars per year or thereabouts, going through a fund the government set up called FinDev. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721115">This is a manufactured corporation; it is the people of Canada's money at the end of the day. It is going to provide what they call “blended finance”. I know what that is in the real world, but it is nothing when it is a government organization; it is just taxpayer money the government is throwing at a wall. It is more money, more spending. The problem is that a week earlier, the same minister, the Minister of Environment, put a cap on the Canadian oil and gas production industry. The cap was not even where we are right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721116">Every actor in the Canadian economy says we are going to have to cut our oil production by about a million barrels a day. Right now, the country produces about 5.3 million barrels of oil per day, most of which goes for export. It is our number one export in this country at about 30% of our export value. Cutting oil production by a million barrels a day is going to cost the Canadian economy about $100 million per day.</ParaText>

He is going to say that. We have a country that is already going broke because of our high debt and we are pledging more money and we are going to have less in the economy here to pay for anything going forward. I worked in finance for a number of years. Everybody here knows that. I can guarantee us that this is not a lesson we give people in high finance. This is a lesson we give people in grade school. We cannot continue to spend more and earn less without this going upside down very quickly. It is going upside down very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721118">There are a number of quotes here that I want to give with regard to that cap that the government is putting on Canadian oil and gas production. They say, “The proposed regulations put a limit on pollution, not production...the oil and gas sector is well positioned to reinvest record profits into projects that drive cleaner production...The draft regulation will encourage the sector to redirect these record profits into decarbonization.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721119">I think the people over at Environment and Climate Change Canada do not understand what records are, do not understand what climate change is, do not understand anything about economics here, and do not understand how businesses in Canada actually make money and how they lose money significantly in commodity downturns. These are cyclical, as we will know. Every commodity industry is cyclical. We make our money when the product is up. We lose money, often, when the product goes down in price, in the world price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721120">They then make these false statements. This is Environment and Climate Change Canada, which is a fabrication of an organization. It is really a passenger organization that is there to take care of the non-governmental organizations that feed it misinformation. I can say that very clearly because I have watched it through my five years here. It is an inane department that needs to be cleansed of all the influence that is coming into it that is purely self-serving at the end of the day. It no longer serves Canadians. It serves itself and serves the cannibalistic organizations that are more or less taking advantage of Canadians in this respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721122">I have the emissions profile from China, all Asian countries and other countries around the world. Canada's oil and gas industry is an environmental producer, and it is very effective at reducing its emissions. It has been. It has gone down by 30% in the oil sands over the last two decades, more so, from an emissions reduction perspective, per barrel of oil produced, than any other producer in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721123">Does that make any sense to anybody on the other side of the bench? The industry, the sector that is performing the best as far as our pollution profile, our emissions reduction, is the one we are going to punish here by actually saying we cannot produce anymore. We are not only punishing the Canadian economy, we are punishing technology around the world. We are punishing the environmental solutions as they come forward here. All this is based upon what is going on here in the green slush fund. A lot of green stuff is going through this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721124">Here is something that they actually got partially right: “Oil and gas companies in Canada have proven repeatedly that they can innovate and develop new technologies to produce more competitive oil and gas with less pollution.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721135">Everything the government is spending billions of dollars of Canadian taxpayer money on is failing as far as emissions go. There are provinces and industries around this country that are doing very well in making sure we reduce emissions per barrel, per unit of GDP and on an energy efficiency basis. However, that is not the result of anything the government or Environment and Climate Change Canada is responsible for. It is a complete sham. If they do not like the results, they just change the numbers, get some different inputs and change the modelling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721136">Here is another one: “This issue of the lack of transparency in the modelling continues to be an ongoing concern, which can undermine the trust and credibility in the reported progress.” The environment commissioner is telling the government that it cannot be trusted, that its modelling is wrong and that, effectively, the numbers it is putting on paper are a bunch of hogwash. This lack of transparency means that accountability for reducing emissions remains unclear. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721137">The gist, of course, is that the government's approach to greenhouse gas emissions is a complete failure. It does not know what it is doing. It does not know how to accomplish its goals. It does not even know how to measure the outcomes it seeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721138">This goes back to the parasitic organizations that are well-funded by the government. That is where the $400 million that I am talking about comes in, the relevant part of this equation. This was a green slush fund that accomplished nothing green, which is the problem. It was just a wealth transfer. It was money going into a whole bunch of pockets that was not reducing anything, nor accomplishing anything environmental for Canada or the world. We were just spending taxpayers' money, and that spending of taxpayers' money was going toward nothing effective. It was just going into the pockets of a whole bunch of insiders. It was a sham. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721139">How did this nonsense arise? This nonsense arose four years ago when the pandemic happened. I would like to quote some of the insiders who were getting rich off the government, and when I say rich off the government, I mean off taxpayer money. The government does not have any money; it is a government going broke, but it continues to take money from taxpayers across the country and give it to rich organizations that are profiteering from the largesse that the government foists upon them. </ParaText>

The task force was put together to look at Smart Prosperity's work, and Smart Prosperity was doing the research for the task force. Have members ever seen such a bunch of circular nonsense?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721144">Let us look at that. The Smart Prosperity Institute is a joke. It is an organization cobbled together from the government's friends to funnel money into their pockets and the pockets of a whole bunch of other friends of the government. It is an absolute atrocity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721145">Fifteen people were on the task force for a resilient recovery and four of them had business experience. About 13 of them were just government grifters, people riding the tails of government and making sure they got paid all the way along. However, when they got paid, who did the paying? It was the Canadian taxpayer who did the paying. These are the people we need to hold to account, and they will be held to account. There is a reckoning to be had here, and that reckoning is part of the $400-million slush fund that we need to address very clearly. </ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278177" Type="2">Mr. Jacques Gourde (Lévis—Lotbinière, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8721175">Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by congratulating you on having succeeded in restoring some peace in the House. The government members opposite are calmer than they were during question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721176">It is a privilege for me to rise once again to discuss the Liberal green fund scandal. It is another opportunity to shed light on the devastation felt by thousands of Canadians from coast to coast to coast for having been sold the Liberal idea of a responsible, democratic and free country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721177">I have been the member of Parliament for Lévis—Lotbinière since 2006, so for nearly 19 years. During the 19 years of trust placed in me by my constituents, I have been fortunate to witness the birth and growth of an entire generation. That is significant. I am moved and very honoured by that. Many are related to me, some were my children's playmates, still others have heard about me from their parents, at school or even on television. I have taken part in many activities that have given me the opportunity to get to know these fine young people, from skating and hockey to the choir and the theatre, from school graduations to our traditional Canada Day celebration at the Saint-Agapit agricultural fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721178">We are proud of these young people and all the people in my riding, and we are proud to share the values we hold in common and a vision for our society where everyone knows they can trust their parents and their community without worrying about whether the people governing our country are trustworthy, honest and just. Unfortunately, that is not the way things are today. The Liberals' latest green fund scam is once again upsetting the balance we had before the Liberal government was elected in 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721179">They say we do not miss what we do not know, but losing something good can sometimes be devastating, and our whole society is now paying a heavy price. Debt is at an all-time high, and crime is rampant everywhere. Young people are born at a disadvantage to parents who do not have the resources to raise them, or to families grappling with addictions that set them on the path to poverty or even violence. Why has it come to this? I will explain in the rest of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721180">It is because of the Liberal promises about legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing hard drugs. It was a fantasy to think that allowing this to happen would lead to better control. The outcome is that we have reached the end of the road and nothing better lies ahead if we continue down this path. Throughout this Liberal reign, I have held on to my Conservative values, and I have not stayed silent in the House, even at the risk of appearing old-fashioned or over the top. I have stayed true to my values and beliefs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721181">I keep speaking out at every opportunity, with each new scandal, like the green fund scandal before us today. I have never lost hope that each small seed would eventually bear fruit and lead us back to a better understanding of what our government should be. Despite the many opportunities we have given to the Liberals, who are backed by the NDP and the Bloc Québécois, we have never given up on the goal of bringing back common sense to this government and to this Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721182">On November 12, TVA Nouvelles reported on a recent Leger poll showing that more and more young people are turning to us Conservatives. It is clear to me that young people are coming back to us because they are tired of living in a world with no rules or guidelines, where they see their childhood friends and loved ones sinking into the hell of drugs and addiction. They are tired of seeing people who were once full of life and full of hope now struggling to hold down a job and keep a roof over their heads.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721183">When we look at where we now rank in the G7, it would be an understatement to say that the Liberals' policies have left us in a very sad situation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8721184">Returning to the poll, it clearly shows that family values, a strong work ethic, wealth building and pride in being able to put food on the table and create community solidarity are making a comeback. People want to go back to acting in accordance with their core morals, their true nature, without deceiving anyone, especially the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721185">I believe that young people clearly understand that their future is at risk and that making the right decisions as quickly as possible is essential. Separating from Canada is not what young people in Quebec dream about or need. That is why the Bloc Québécois is lagging so far behind in young people's voting intentions in Quebec. Young people are not looking for another empty dream. They want to feel united with other people and pull together in the same direction, to keep what gains they have and create a prosperous future, like we once had, before 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721186">We have strong young people in Canada with visions and values that show their hearts are in the right place. They see their parents worrying about the fact that they work day in and day out but never get ahead. Parents are stunned when they hear about all the crooked stuff that the Liberals have been involved in and have yet to be punished for. In fact, many constituents of all ages come up to me in my riding to say that they are completely baffled that the Bloc Québécois and the NDP are supporting measures that make no earthly sense. People can see that they are using blackmail to buy time just so they can keep warming their seats until October 2025. Because of the support of the Bloc Québécois and the NDP, it is costing us a lot of money to keep this three-legged government going. It has been limping along for far too long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721187">I am very happy that young people have learned from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this shady Liberal government. They have learned what not to do. We are learning the hard way, even more drastically, that thugs are not nice, whether they wear ties and ride around in limousines or supply drugs and roam our alleys with illegal weapons. How did we get here?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721188">Unfortunately, I think that many people fell for the Prime Minister's charm. The Liberals' political tactics are as old as the hills and well known to all. They offer free membership, but then make members pay dearly to attend cocktail parties and fancy dinners that provide access to certain well-placed individuals in order to obtain favours. Then the best members are appointed to key positions and bingo, that is how we end up with all those fine people defending each other, protecting each other, giving each other contracts, and getting their vacations paid for, all by reaching into Canadians' pockets without the slightest scruple or remorse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721189">I am already looking forward to answering my colleagues' questions at the end of my speech. Some will be blue with anger, others will be red with embarrassment, and maybe some will even be pale green over this whole green fund business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721190">I would love to keep going, but since I have only a few seconds left, I will gladly continue my speech tomorrow morning, in the first hour, as soon as the House opens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721192">Mr. Speaker, I asked the independent, non-partisan environment commissioner if Canada's emissions reduction targets could be achieved without a carbon tax. He said yes. Does the government agree with him?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8721193"> Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Budget Officer has confirmed once again that the vast majority of Canadians will receive more money back from the Canada carbon rebate. In Manitoba, that is $1,200 annually, and it is even higher for residents in rural areas. In fact, there is a 20% top-up. It was 10%, but our government decided to double that to give rural constituents and residents across Canada even more money back. Experts agree that putting a price on pollution is the most cost-effective way of fighting climate change. The Premier of Saskatchewan has even confirmed this. Premier Moe has said that his government looked at alternatives to carbon pricing, but they were too expensive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721194">Our government is committed to fighting climate change while also making life more affordable, and that is exactly what putting a price on pollution does. The Bank of Canada has confirmed this. The Governor of the Bank of Canada said that carbon pricing contributed less than 0.15% to inflation. That is 15¢ on $100 spent. That is not a significant amount; moreover, with the carbon rebate, eight out of 10 families get more money back in their pockets, and those are predominantly lower- and medium-income families. That is a fraction of half a per cent. That puts it in perspective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721195">The Conservative Party keeps claiming and have continued to claim that they have a plan to fight climate change, but it has yet to produce any kind of comprehensive plan. It has a few slogans here and there, but there is no plan that I can see. In May 2023, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> held another fundraiser with more than a dozen lobbyists from the oil and gas industry, accepting over $60,000 in donations. They wanted to ensure that he would not fight climate change and do the opposite of climate action. In essence, he would make pollution free again in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721196">When I knock on doors in my riding, I ask people at their doors who should pay for pollution, the average Canadian or industry. Even among those who are somewhat critical of the price on pollution, every single person says it should be industry. That is exactly what our government does. By putting a price on pollution, we are incentivizing innovation. We are setting a significant price signal in terms of changing behaviour in the market, and that is exactly what we are seeing. If members listen to the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>'s responses in question period, they will hear that there is a significant amount of emissions reduction in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721197">It does not end there. Since the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> was elected 20 years ago, he has voted against climate action and protecting the environment over 400 times. We cannot find a member in the House who is more opposed to fighting climate change. It is embarrassing and shameful. When I look my two daughters in the eye, I want to make sure that I am doing everything I can to protect our clean water and the environment for a healthy future for all Canadians, including my daughters. I do not know how the Conservatives can look themselves in the mirror when they never take climate change seriously. Not once have I ever heard them say that they believe in climate change and have a plan to address it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721200">Mr. Speaker, it is kind of rich to hear the Conservatives ask such a question. It is very interesting because they seem to want to fire every independent expert who happens to disagree with them. They want to fire the independent Governor of the Bank of Canada when he does not agree with the slogans and misinformation the Conservatives spew in the House every single day. I wonder if they want to fire the guy they quote regularly about food price inflation, Sylvain Charlebois, who was at the industry committee not so long ago. I posted the clips of him saying very clearly that climate change is the biggest challenge in our agri-food sector in Canada and that we must address it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721201">If the Conservatives are so interested in price inflation in Canada, why do they not have a plan to address the biggest challenge that our agri-food industry is facing, which is climate change? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8721202">Mr. Speaker, I am rising to ask a follow-up question to a question I had about a month ago in the House of Commons. We are listening to all kinds of stuff, and this pertains to the debate we had today, which was about providing documents to the House of Commons on the green slush fund, the SDTC scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721203">What we are trying to get, of course, is real information that the government has to provide from one of its documents. We passed a motion in the House, supported by all the opposition parties, demanding those documents from the government, as is Parliament's right. However, when I asked for that, I asked if the government thought it was not providing the documents because of incompetence, an oversight or actual corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721204">There are different degrees of a problem in there, but the one we are most worried about is that the Liberals are complicit with some of their friends in giving this money to a whole bunch of people connected to the Liberal Party and not providing a type of oversight, which is what the Auditor General has provided. The response I got back was, effectively, “We have warnings from the Auditor General and we have warnings from the RCMP that this might be a charter issue.” The issue with that fabrication, if I may say that, is that normal jurisprudence on this has us collecting the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721205"> Let us remember who is supreme in Canada, in our Canadian Constitution. Parliament is supreme, not the executive, not the RCMP and not the courts. Nevertheless, each of these organizations has a purpose here. Those documents that have to come before Parliament for us to look at and provide to the police authorities are not something they have normally looked at before. In this respect, we are driving that bus forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721206"> The RCMP will look at the documents and find out if there are charges to be laid. We are not the ones laying the charges. We are the ones who are going to be putting the documents to people who have the ability to make that decision. That is our role, and every one of these organizations has a role. This is Parliament's role. Somehow the government does not think Parliament has a role in this process or any process going forward. It just looks at Parliament as a speed bump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721207">The government is disrespecting the Speaker because it is he who delivered the request on behalf of Parliament to provide those documents. The government members are asking if they should listen to the RCMP, the expert legal person they spoke to or the House of Commons, which is the Speaker. I am going to tell them right now that, hands down, there is one person they should listen to, and that is the Speaker, in providing that actual ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721208">I am not concerned about the House treading on charter rights, because those charter protections happen at the judicial level. We do our job here, and sometimes Parliament passes legislation that gets overturned by the Supreme Court. That is where that judicial interpretation of charter rights happens, not here. We do our job and do not let a whole bunch of bureaucratese and certain legal opinions move us in one direction or another. There are far better legal opinions at the end of the day that will determine what happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721209"> I can guarantee members, and I think the Speaker knows this from a previous legal background, that if we seek a legal opinion, particularly on a charter issue, we are going to get six opinions, each pointing in a different direction. Let us get our job done here in Parliament. I beseech this government again to get us those documents so we can see what is behind them, come to the bottom of this and move on with the work of Parliament.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8721210">Mr. Speaker, let me set the record straight. For months now, the House has been paralyzed by Conservative politicians who are putting partisan politics ahead of delivering real results for Canadians. Instead of focusing on delivering for constituents, which is what we were all elected to do, the Conservatives have chosen to filibuster their own motion in the House, to avoid sending it to the procedure and House affairs committee, which is exactly what was recommended by the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721211">The member opposite is voicing serious accusations, and I want to be clear: ensuring public funds are disbursed ethically and transparently is of utmost importance to this government. That is why, when allegations of financial mismanagement at SDTC first came to light, our government acted swiftly and decisively, and commissioned a range of independent audits and studies to get to the bottom of the troubling allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721212">There is absolutely nothing to hide. The evidence is there for all to see. This government took immediate action to undertake the proper due diligence to understand the facts, which is what we do when there are allegations of mismanagement in an arm's-length foundation the federal government set up over 20 years ago. We have submitted thousands upon thousands of pages to the House, and are willing to further study this issue at the procedure and House affairs committee, if the Conservatives ever allow the House to proceed in its normal functioning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721213">What we are not willing to do, however, is compromise the independence of the RCMP investigation. The RCMP commissioner has said very clearly that he does not need or want the information that the Conservatives are asking the Auditor General to provide, that they already have an investigation under way, that they have all of the documentation they need, and that providing the information in the way the Conservatives have proposed would actually compromise their independent investigation. This would compromise one of the pillars of our democracy, which is judicial and police independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721214">Conservatives have this reputation. When they do not get their own way, they want to undermine the independence of our institutions. They want to run rampant right over top of them because they want to get their way. They want to paint this with the brushstroke of their partisan politics for political gain. That is just wrong. We have also heard from former House law clerks and from the Auditor General herself, who have warned us that this partisan overreach is a dangerous precedent to set in the House. We know weaknesses were identified in the SDTC governance model, and that is exactly why we have taken definitive action. We have followed up on all of the recommendations that were made by the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721215">In addition to having done a number of third party reviews, we have moved forward on improving the governance model at SDTC. The board's chair and CEO resigned. The board was dissolved and let go. There is a new board that is transitioning under the National Research Council. That is intentional to ensure the minister and our department have better and clear oversight for this organization. Previously it was independent, it was at arm's-length, and that is one of the reasons we felt the monitoring and supervision was not as tight as it needs to be in the future. We take these matters seriously. We have gotten to the bottom of this. This is the accountability all of us should expect.</ParaText>

I do not think they are proper responses; there are a whole bunch of holes in what he has provided here. Number one, the RCMP is the agency looking into whether there will be charges here to press or not. All we are providing, at the end of the day, is the unredacted documents. Those unredacted documents right now are unavailable to the RCMP because they are unavailable to us. The government member says he has nothing to hide. Then why are there hundreds and thousands of pages of pure black ink in redacted documents here? Nothing to hide means that would be a lot more transparent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8721222">The dock is a community hub. It is where people go for a walk on a nice summer day in northern Alberta. It is where children, including of course indigenous children, swim and play. It is where a young couple might go for a walk to talk about the day and to enjoy each other's company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721223"> In this picturesque surrounding there is trouble, though, and here is the challenge. Recently, just this year actually, the indigenous communities contracted an environmental firm to look at the water in and around the dock to see what the condition of it was. What it found was extremely troubling: The water was contaminated with above-legal limits of toxins, including arsenic, mercury, iron and hydrocarbons. Many of these are carcinogens that can and do cause cancer in people. Keep in mind that young couples, fishers and indigenous children swim in this contaminated water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721224">Of course, that in itself is extremely troubling, but let us add a couple more facts. The dock is owned by the federal government, by Transport Canada. The really difficult and challenging part is that, according to the consultant's report, Transport Canada knew about the contamination in 2017.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721225">I do not think it is for me to speak for first nations, so I am just going to reiterate to the member what is being asked. Remember, the member is answering not just to me; he is answering also to first nations and indigenous people, so I am hoping the member will not take take this as an opportunity to pontificate about various Liberal accomplishments or other things and that he will answer the requests of the chiefs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721226">First, they want to meet with the <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>. Second, they want the dock repaired and brought up to code. They of course want the site remediated, meaning the removal of the toxins. They want to dredge a canal to the channel to Lake Athabasca for boat access. They want a temporary dock, further testing to be conducted along the waterfront and for any and all documents to be made available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721227">I will add that I did ask at the transport committee, and received unanimous consent, to get all documents and correspondence relating to the big dock from Transport Canada, but we still, nearly a month later, have not received a single document. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, and quite frankly I agree with him, there is no relationship more important for the federal government than that with the first nations, so I am hoping we get a substantive response.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="311629" Type="18">Mr. Ryan Turnbull (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and to the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8721228"> Mr. Speaker, I am glad I am here tonight for this late show to answer this question. The reason I say that is because I spent three years of my life, before I got into politics, going up to Fort Chipewyan and working with the first nations there on environmental monitoring. It was a great privilege to be in that community, be invited into it, to meet with the elders there, and to understand the issues of those first nation communities and their community members. I take this matter very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721229">I want to preface what I am saying with something that I think the member opposite should also take seriously. These contaminants that are being monitored are directly from the tailing ponds of the oil sands. I know the member to be an hon. member, and I think he does care about the environment. I hope he can convince his party <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> one day to take the matter of climate change and the contamination from our oil and gas industry seriously enough so that we can work together across the aisle in the House to address these issues for these first nation communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721230">Those contaminants did not come from anywhere else. The first nations there have started a collaborative initiative to monitor the water, the contaminants in the water and the impacts on their ecosystem. They also employ their community members to do that work. That is really important work, and I think it has led to the realization that the moving of the dock and the dredging that would need to take place to replace it is going to be a difficult issue. It is not as simple as just funding the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721231">However, I do take the matter seriously. The reason I say that is that, when we dredge that toxic waste up from the bottom, we are essentially going to spread it throughout the watershed. The Peace-Athabasca Delta, for generations and generations, has been the water source and the home to those first nations. They identify with that place. They identify that water and that watershed as being the most important thing for their lives, their livelihoods, their identity, their culture, their traditions and their traditional knowledge. All of these things connect back to that watershed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721232">I think this is really important. I know that <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister Anand</Affiliation> has been in touch directly with the nations to discuss their concerns. Transport Canada has previously disclosed the presence of contamination in Transport Canada-owned lands at Fort Chipewyan. The Fort Chipewyan public port facility has been listed on the federal contaminated sites inventory, an open public list, since 2014. For almost a century, the wharf at Fort Chipewyan has been active with multiple users and uses. Studies show that contaminants in the sediments in the Transport Canada-owned water lot and in the lands adjacent to the wharf may have come from a variety of sources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8721233">I really think this is an important issue. I would say there are a number of different steps that the department has taken, and I would think that we could work together with the first nations. I know that <Affiliation DbId="311722" Type="4">Minister Anand</Affiliation> is taking this matter seriously. Transport Canada has taken some immediate steps and retained a qualified third-party environmental consultant through Public Services and Procurement Canada, and is working with the first nations and the consultant to address this very issue.</ParaText>

However, there are several issues that I do want to drill down on because we did not get a response.</ParaText>
