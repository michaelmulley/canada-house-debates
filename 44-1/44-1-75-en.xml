Every year, we take one day to remember our veterans: Remembrance Day. We might remember them on the anniversary of a battle or conflict, but we do not do enough to recognize veterans' sacrifices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170411">Other countries have recognized this and have reviewed the citations given to veterans who ought to be appropriately recognized for their valour, but here in Canada we have not done that appropriately. In fact, a Canadian has not been awarded the VC since 1945. Over 14,000 Canadians who signed the petition are clear that this must change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170412">I want to acknowledge the unprecedented grassroots movement bringing together the veteran community, including organizations such as the Royal Canadian Legion, members of the military community, municipalities and grassroots Canadians, who together are calling for Private Jess Larochelle's citation to be reviewed and to award him the Victoria Cross he deserves.</ParaText>

This is a bipartisan effort, so we cannot split those 14,129 signatures, but as a veteran and a former minister of veterans affairs, I want to pledge bipartisan support for the work done by Valour in the Presence of the Enemy, which gathered these signatures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170415">All veterans groups, including the Royal Canadian Legion, want a proper review, because valour in the presence of the enemy was demonstrated by Jess Larochelle, who in 2006, while injured, defended against 20 to 40 insurgents. The 12-year mission in Afghanistan was our longest. We need a process to review the valour of our citizens, much like all of our major allies have.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170446">Mr. Speaker, the following reflects a consolidated response approved on behalf of Global Affairs Canada ministers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170447">In response to parts (a), (b) and (c) of the question, in coordination with allies and partners, Canada will continue to escalate sanctions and close loopholes to maximize pressure against the Russian regime until President Putin stops his war on Ukraine and turns to diplomacy. The measures the Government of Canada has put in place are designed to hit at the heart of Russia’s economy and limit its ability to fund its illegal and unjustifiable war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170448">Under Canada’s sanctions, it is prohibited for persons in Canada and Canadians abroad to engage in activities related to the property of sanctioned persons, including the provision of financial or related services. As a result, the assets of sanctioned persons are effectively frozen. They cannot be sold and they cannot be transferred, making transactions involving them simply impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170449">Through budget 2022, the Government of Canada is proposing amendments to the Special Economic Measures Act and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act that will allow courts to order seized or restrained property belonging to sanctioned persons, including Russian elites, oligarchs and their proxies, to be forfeited to the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170450">The proceeds generated from forfeited assets may be used for the reconstruction of a foreign state adversely affected by grave breaches of international peace and security; the restoration of international peace and security; and the compensation of victims affected by grave breaches of international peace and security, gross and systematic human rights violations or acts of significant corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170451">The management and disposal of assets are expected to be handled by the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada under the Seized Property Management Act. These changes will make Canada’s sanctions regime a leader in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170452">Federally regulated financial institutions, or FRFIs, are regulated and supervised by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, OSFI. This includes foreign banks operating in Canada. OSFI expects FRFIs to comply with all relevant Canadian sanctions legislation and to ensure they have adequate procedures in place to comply with the existing and any future laws on an ongoing basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170453">Disclosures on the existence of sanctioned assets are made by reporting entities, such as Canadian financial institutions, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170454">Global Affairs Canada is not in a position to provide the requested figures, given that they may not fully reflect what has been effectively frozen under Canadian sanctions and would represent only those assets that have been reported to the RCMP. Such an exercise could lead to the disclosure of incomplete and misleading information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170455">In response to part (d) of the question, G7 finance ministers released a joint statement on March 17, 2022, outlining their commitment to take all available legal steps to find, restrain, freeze, seize and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit the assets of those individuals and entities that have been sanctioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170456">With regard to part (e) of the question, the information provided in response to this question is current as of March 31, 2022.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170479">I am always honoured to rise on behalf of the constituents of Thornhill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170480">More than two years ago, travel and many other parts of normal life came to a compete standstill. Countries around the world shut their borders, their airports and virtually everything else, and it was necessary to do so. We were faced with a new virus that we knew very little about. We had to do this until we found a way to live with COVID. We had to do this until we learned more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170481">Two years ago, all of our allies were in the same place. We all shut our borders. We all had restrictions in place. Today, that is no longer the case. Countries around the world have dropped their restrictions and have cancelled mandates. Canada is no longer in line with the rest of the world. Canada is an outlier. We know that most governments make decisions based on science, research and advice from the experts. All of our allies are lifting the restrictions, so surely they cannot all be wrong. Surely the science cannot be different in Canada than anywhere else. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170482">We might be able to understand the government’s thought process on this, if it would share the advice it has received and when it was received from the experts it claims have given them this advice. However, it has refused to tell Canadians what metrics it is using, what plan it has and what evidence these rules are based on. In fact, we have not been able to find anyone who has told the government to keep the legacy health restrictions and the assault on mobility rights in place. That leads us on this side of the House to believe that there is no evidence, there are no metrics and there is no good reason, other than the ideological drive to punish those who do not agree with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170483">Not only are these restrictions vindictive and discriminatory, which we have said a lot in this place, because it is true, but they are causing chaos at our airports, which the House and the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> ought to be concerned about. We have all seen photos of passengers lined up for hours and hours on end, with no chance of making their flights on time. They wait on the tarmac, only to be shepherded into a lineup that exceeds the size of the terminal or the CBSA hall. Passenger processing times have quadrupled, and in committee this week, industry experts told us directly that these restrictions and mandates are, in part, to blame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170484">Our airports are famous for all of the wrong reasons, and we can fix that today, at least in part. The world is opening and people are finally travelling, which is a good thing. Businesses are growing again. Canada should be a world-class destination for people to work and play, but what do people abroad see? They see long lines, chaos and a place they want nothing to do with. They see COVID restrictions that their countries did away with months ago. They see lineups that take longer than the flights themselves. They see a big neon sign at the border saying that Canada is closed for business. They will choose to go elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170485">The Toronto Region Board of Trade said that about 50% of travellers at Pearson, my home airport, as well as that of the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, as it is the airport he goes to most often, had “extensive delays” last week. How does that create a good first impression? Our tourism sector cannot afford this. Our small businesses cannot afford this, and our country cannot afford this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170486">It has been two long years. They need as much help as they can get, and it is not just dollars and cents. These are peoples’ livelihoods, their years of hard work and their life savings. It is simply hypocritical for the government to claim that it has businesses’ backs when it continues to dig in its heels and stand by the measures that are now affecting everyone, not just those who opposed its views in the first place. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, tourism associations, the Canadian Airports Council and now doctors have all called for an end to border restrictions, vaccine mandates and the broken ArriveCAN app. They just want their livelihoods back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170487">There are acute labour shortages in this sector, we know that, and while the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> blames travellers, saying that they are out of practice, we know the problem lies in part with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, which is under his purview. Of the security workers lost during the pandemic, 10% to 30% were never replaced. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170488">Surely a room full of people, many of whom use airports on a regular basis, would show an ounce of humility and listen, instead of doubling down on outdated practices and more outdated talking points. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170489">The Ottawa airport alone needs 350 staff to operate properly. Right now, it has 172 who are fully trained and cleared. That is less than 50%. In every sense of the word, that is a failure, and we saw it coming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170490">Canadians should know that CATSA is a user-pay model. That means those who use it actually pay for it. It is not a run-of-the-mill government agency. It should be the best. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170491">The government runs a profit off travellers. What are travellers buying with their money? They are buying longer lineups, some of the most archaic screening in the western world, and missed flights. Airlines in Canada are fined for delays and poor service, but what is the government’s liability when it is responsible? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170492">Even the president of PHAC told carriers and airports it would remove testing from airports in January. It is May. Instead, the government launched a new strategy consultation this week. I cannot think of a more worthless remedy in this environment: A government that cannot provide services that have already been paid for by the traveller is going to develop a strategy for people it has punished and blamed already. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170493">The workers who have not been fired yet are subject to this incompetence as well. They are being forced to keep families on airplanes in 30° weather. There is more outrage when a dog is found locked in a car in the summertime in a Costco parking lot. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170494">Why will the Liberals not listen? We know they have problems accepting diversity of thought and differing viewpoints, but are they seriously vindictive enough that they will continue to allow our economy to suffer, just to prove a point? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170498">Some of the hon. members forget that those they have othered, the ones they continue to actively disparage and look down upon, are people too. They are parents and grandparents and they are nurses and tradespeople. They are everyday Canadians whom we know in our communities. They have missed birthdays, weddings, anniversaries and funerals. They are hurting. Now the ideological crusade on them has crossed into affecting everyone else. It is affecting everyone who did everything they were asked to do throughout this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170499">The vaccine mandates imposed by the federal government do not just restrict travel. They restrict our workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170500">The <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> acknowledged that the issues we are seeing at airports would not be solved immediately. Some say those delays and long lines could last until Christmas or later. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170501">We are not saying removing the restrictions is a magic bullet. It is not going to solve all of the problems overnight, but surely airlines, associations, unions, chambers of commerce, businesses and now doctors cannot all be wrong that these restrictions are causing delays. We owe it to them to support them after two years of closures and lockdowns in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170502">We owe it to our constituents to listen to their concerns. We owe it to the millions of struggling Canadians who just want to see their economy reopen and start getting real paycheques again. We owe it to travellers to allow them to finally travel quickly and easily. We owe it to everyone in this country and everybody coming to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170503">Surely the government trusts Canadians enough to allow them to travel freely. Surely members in this place want to see our economy back on track. Surely they want to support our tourism sector and our small businesses. Therefore, surely they will vote with our party to lift the mandates, end the restrictions and immediately revert to prepandemic rules and service levels for travel. Our economy depends on it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170523">Mr. Speaker, I salute my colleague, who does incredible work on her transport file. She speaks on behalf of thousands of Canadian travellers who are asking themselves a lot of questions about why the federal government truly wants to maintain the health measures in airports and at land borders. We have a lot of questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170524">We have been asking for evidence and documentation from the beginning and have been calling on the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to table any advice in the House that he has received telling him to maintain the restrictions. We are unfortunately not hearing anything from the government, which has no justification for maintaining the many health measures that are no longer required here in Canada. The government is not listening to experts, who are saying that we must now start thinking about transitioning back to prepandemic times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170525">Like always, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government are doing nothing, which is the main reason our airports have been plunged into chaos—not to mention the chaos with immigration services at Service Canada and with every single public service that the Liberal government has its hand in. The government cannot deliver. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170526">What we have seen at airports in recent days and weeks is particularly concerning: long delays, endless lineups, never-ending processing delays, bottlenecks and missed flights. People are missing their flights while others have to wait for hours on an aircraft before being able to disembark. That is the new reality. If we let the Liberals continue, this will unfortunately be the new Liberal standard at Canadian airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170527">This spring, Toronto's Pearson Airport even advised passengers departing for other countries to arrive a minimum of three hours before their flight to make sure they do not miss it. For some travellers, that is longer than the duration of the flight itself. That is completely unacceptable, but that is what the government has unfortunately brought us to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170528">I remind members, as did my colleague, that for months, the United States and the main allies of the European Union have been gradually eliminating the restrictive health measures imposed on passengers. They are even talking about eliminating the requirement to wear a mask during flights and in airports, among other things. The situation is evolving everywhere else, but, here, in Canada, we remain attached to measures that the government was late in implementing at the start, and we should remember that. In fact, when the time came to protect people, the government was slow to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170529">Now, however, the time has come to realize that the measures adopted, such as vaccination—which had a lot of uptake—and mask wearing have had the desired effect and we have begun another stage. However, the government is not moving forward. It is sitting back, to put it mildly, and prefers to wait for everything to sort itself out, just like the budgets. The Prime Minister has previously stated that the budgets would balance themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170530">However, the pandemic is not going to resolve itself, and people's freedom to resume their activities and the life they lived before the pandemic will not return by itself either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170531">Tourists arriving in Canada, foreigners and business people are extremely disappointed when they arrive in our country and have to face extreme delays at the airports because of the government's inaction. Then there is the infamous ArriveCAN application, which asks them to answer personal public health questions and complicates their arrival.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170532">On that topic, let me tell you about something that happened in my riding, not at an airport. These situations happen to real people who want to travel. My riding, Mégantic—L'Érable, borders the United States and includes a border crossing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170533">A man from Lac‑Mégantic came to our office to get the infamous ArriveCAN receipt that border officers at the Woburn crossing asked him to obtain. However, he did not have his passport with him and was forced to come back to the office, the first unnecessary step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170534">Mr. Paré, who is 85 and does not have a smart phone or a computer at home, also had to come to our office. We had to open an account for him and fill out the ArriveCAN papers so that he could travel from one side of the border to the other. If we had not helped him out, he would not have been able to go see his relative, who lives 15 or 20 minutes away on the other side of the border. That is the reality. At 85, will he have to buy a computer and a smart phone? No, he will not. He came back to our office to get his paperwork filled out to be able to cross the border again. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170535">The government is not considering that reality, what Canadians have to go through. It is unacceptable how disconnected this government is from reality. Their many measures, now unnecessary, are causing delays and inconvenience to Canadians, particularly at airports. Who is affected by them and who is suffering? Travellers, tourists, business people, that is who. Plus, it is easy to forget, but the people working at airports have to endure the wrath and anger of the public, of everyone who is kept waiting. They have to enforce the rules that this government is imposing, even though they know full well this should not be the case. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170536">As we know, the last two years have been very hard on the airline and tourism industries. Both have suffered greatly from the pandemic as they were among the hardest hit. For the past two years, my Conservative colleagues and I have been staunch defenders of these two sectors that are vital to our economy, especially because they are also vital to Canada's economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170537">Unfortunately, once again, the Liberals seem to be completely blind to this reality and to all the damage they are doing now, which will have long-term consequences. The Liberals, with their harmful policies and their usual who-cares attitude, are a real threat to the Canadian tourism industry. Something has to be done before this Liberal government completely destroys Canada's reputation as an international tourism destination of choice and as an investment destination for business people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170538">In 2019 and 2020, before the pandemic, it took about 15 to 30 seconds for a Canada border services officer to process an international passenger on arrival. Now, health questions and COVID‑19 measures have increased to the point that processing takes two to four times longer. Sometimes it can take as long as two minutes. If we multiply two minutes by thousands of people, that makes for endless wait times and people complaining and dreading having to travel by plane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170539">Instead of accepting full responsibility for this, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> chose to blame delays at various entry points on out-of-practice travellers. That is how the Liberals always operate. When they do not have an answer or a solution, they find someone else to blame. This time, they are pointing the finger at travellers, the people receiving services from this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170540">I hope members of the House will send a clear message to the Liberal government that enough is enough. We have to do what other countries around the world are doing. Those countries have experts and scientists too, and they understand that we need to get back to a more normal prepandemic period for everyone. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favour of this motion. In particular, I encourage the Liberal government to show us why this motion should not be adopted. The Liberals will not be able to do that because they like chaos and they like not being able to deliver services.</ParaText>

Individuals may also submit travel information on behalf of someone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170543">I find it remarkable that many members of the Conservative party supported the anti-vax protesters who blocked critical infrastructure earlier this year, slowed down our national supply chain and occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks. The protesters made life miserable for residents and caused significant economic damage to local businesses. It is also worth noting that most of his party's leadership candidates are now competing with each other to pander to these blockaders and their supporters.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170552">We agree with several aspects of his analysis. However, when talking about a pandemic that caused many deaths, we must be responsible. Both sides must avoid politicizing—in the least noble sense of the word—a debate like this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170553"> I sat with my colleague on the Standing Committee on Health. Earlier, he said that we should go back to the way things were before the pandemic, but I would like to qualify that statement. We know that the world's population is far from fully vaccinated. As long as vaccination rates are low and people are travelling, there is the potential for a variant that could completely compromise the benefits of vaccines, particularly in terms of the possibility of developing a severe form of the illness. I am sure my colleague agrees with me on this. In any case, I hope he will mention that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170554">The tourism industry's GDP has dropped 50%. This is serious.

              <ParaText id="7170557">My colleague from Montcalm and I were both members of the Standing Committee on Health. He is right about one thing, but I do not share his concerns about the other. We have to be able to take all the recommendations and see how we can learn to live with the pandemic. I think that is the goal when we talk about getting back to a prepandemic normal. We have to learn to live with the pandemic. Unfortunately, as my colleague said, and I fully agree with him, the government does not seem to have a plan for learning to live with the pandemic. What criteria is it using?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170558">We know the government said that 75% of the population would have to be vaccinated for herd immunity. Then they raised that number to 80% and then they raised it to some unknown point because there was no threshold. There was no benchmark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170559">I just have one little thing to add. If the government were less focused on misinformation and more focused on transparency, we would have a plan to get back to normal and an explanation for why airport public health measures are still in place. Unfortunately, the government does not care about that. It is holding fast to its ideological ideas.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170565">I will begin by saying that I understand and share their frustration. I myself am a traveller, and I have experienced delays at the airport. I know it can be aggravating. I also know that airport delays have an economic cost and that they do not help the recovery of our airline and tourism sectors, which are major economic drivers for our country. I also recognize that all Canadians, myself included, are tired of the COVID-19 protocols and hope to return to a prepandemic normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170566">Since the vast majority of Canadians are vaccinated, and since we have observed an improvement in the situation in our hospitals and communities, it is understandable that many Canadians are increasingly eager to see the remaining public health measures relaxed so they can return to their prepandemic lives. COVID-19 fatigue is a real thing and a perfectly normal instinct. Like many of my colleagues in the House and many Canadians from coast to coast to coast, I do not want these measures to stay in place any longer than necessary.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7170567">I hear every day from Canadians who are angry that some mandates remain in place. I am sure we all do. Like them, I would like to put this long ordeal behind us, and yet COVID is not behind us. It is very much still in our midst. One lesson that many Canadians learned over the course of this pandemic was the danger of relaxing public health measures prematurely. Over and over, we saw this play out in different jurisdictions across the country and around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170568">Policy-makers, eager to deliver a return to normal to their constituents, eased measures prematurely only to be faced with a new variant: a new wave of disease that started filling up ICU wards again. It was overwhelming our health sector and prompting new, sometimes stricter, lockdowns. This back-and-forth pattern was very damaging for our economy, as it made it difficult for businesses to make future plans and to retain workers and customers. What is more, it sapped hope and exhausted Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170569">Luckily, the remarkably quick development and deployment of very effective vaccines has greatly improved the outlook we currently face. However, we should remember the hard-fought lessons we learned. Countries such as Canada may have successfully vaccinated much of their populations, but lower-income countries have not had the same access to vaccines, which is providing opportunities for new variants to emerge. While we know much more about COVID than we did a couple of years ago, much remains unknown about aspects of the virus, such as long COVID.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170570">Given these unknowns, let us remember the benefits of a cautious approach. That has been the approach taken in Canada in general, and by this government in particular. By deploying a series of public health measures, including in the airline sector, we were relatively successful in protecting Canadians' lives and health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170571">COVID-19 claimed the lives of approximately 40,000 Canadians. That is tragic, but let us compare our situation with that of our neighbours to the south, where more than a million Americans died of COVID-19. Even if we take the different populations into account, the difference is staggering. According to the latest estimates published by Our World in Data, the United States suffered three times more deaths per million people than Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170572">Lastly, here is the most important yardstick: Although we need to take into account the inconveniences and economic disruptions caused by airport delays and find solutions to minimize these impacts, we also need to weigh them against the lives of Canadians, our grandparents, our spouses, our children and our friends.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7170573">Let me turn now from the big picture to the more specific topic raised by the opposition motion today dealing with airport delays. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170574">First, let me say that Canada is not alone in seeing such delays. There are, in fact, reports from all over the world of similar delays. They are not always caused by the same factors. Sometimes there are shortages of baggage handlers, sometimes of border agents and sometimes of security screeners, and sometimes large numbers of flights are cancelled unexpectedly. It all amounts to passengers stuck in long lines, some of whom miss their flights and all of whom experience frustration and stress.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170586">This may sound familiar to consumers of Canadian news over the last couple of weeks. The fact that other countries are also experiencing similar problems does not make things any less frustrating for Canadian travellers. However, it does provide some necessary context in the face of commentators who claim that we have never seen the chaos we are experiencing at Canadian airports currently or that Canada's reputation will be irreparably harmed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170587">With a view to providing the necessary context, let me explain why there are delays at Canadian airports. The simplest and most common explanation is that the delays are caused by a shortage of CATSA screening officers. However, there are other factors that also come into play.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170588">CATSA is indeed having difficulty rehiring staff in prepandemic numbers. However, as Minister <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Alghabra</Affiliation> recently pointed out, CATSA's staffing levels have returned to approximately 90%, while the travel volume has returned to only about 70% of prepandemic levels. It is more than a simple labour shortage issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170589">What appears to be happening is that the airlines are providing less accurate information about anticipated passenger volumes, and in a less timely manner. It is therefore difficult for CATSA managers to properly plan staffing levels. I am not saying that it is the airlines' fault. It is not surprising that they are finding it hard to predict how fast the number of passengers will increase and to plan the number of flights accordingly. This highlights the need for better communication between the various stakeholders in the airline sector, and that is exactly what the minister and Transport Canada are working on. I will get into more detail shortly.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7170590">Another example of the complexity of the problem is that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are also having problems rehiring staff to prepandemic levels. This sometimes results in U.S. officials asking CATSA screeners to slow down or pause the security screening of travellers. CBSA is also experiencing similar staffing issues, resulting in longer than usual lines for travellers arriving from international destinations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170591">In fact, worker shortages being experienced all across airports, the air sector and the labour market more broadly are affecting how efficiently our airports work. For example, some CATSA employees who were laid off during the pandemic have since been hired by airport subcontractors as baggage handlers or in other roles at airports. Again, I offer this to provide necessary context so that Canadians can understand what is behind some of the delays at our airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170592">My friends on the opposition side will oversimplify things and suggest that it is only public health measures that are slowing down air travellers and clogging our airports, but that is simply not the case.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7170593">They are also unaware of the advantages of the measures still in place. For example, random testing in airports helps us detect in a timely manner new variants that might be entering the country and to trace their origins. This will not prevent variants from entering Canada, but it will provide invaluable data and help our health care sector prepare for any changes. It could help slow the spread of new variants and save us precious time. Contrary to what some have suggested, we cannot get the same result simply by analyzing the general population's wastewater.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170594">Other measures such as mandatory vaccination, ArriveCAN and mask wearing provide travellers and airline workers with additional layers of protection, while offering Canadian travellers peace of mind, since they know they are travelling with other people who have chosen to be vaccinated. Vaccination is the best protection against the most serious consequences of COVID-19.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170595">My Conservative colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> has selectively chosen to quote from testimony heard from business groups, but she neglects to mention that when asked at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities whether they would disregard advice from public health officials to maintain certain public health measures, they demurred, acknowledging they were not public health experts. I think this is important for Canadians to retain. They should weigh this when considering calls to immediately dismantle public health protections and should consider who is proposing such a step and what that person's qualifications are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170596">This also reminds me to consider another source: the Conservative Party of Canada itself. I think it is important for Canadians to remember this is the same party whose former leader allowed unvaccinated candidates to go into seniors' homes during the most recent federal election. It is a party that had in its ranks an MP who presented a petition calling on the government to suspend the use of all COVID‑19 vaccines. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170597">Another Conservative member claimed his own research showed that people were “13 times more likely to die from the delta variant if [they] were double vaccinated than if [they] were unvaccinated.” Needless to say, this was completely false.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170603">For now, I will leave aside the many billions of dollars our government has provided to help support the airline sector during the pandemic, including some $1.4 billion earmarked exclusively for airports under the airport critical infrastructure program, the airport relief fund, the enhanced airports capital assistance program, the rent relief for airport authorities, and broader initiatives from which airports benefited, such as the Canada emergency wage subsidy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170604">As I mentioned earlier in my speech, at first glance, many of the problems currently being experienced in our airports seem to stem from more than a simple shortage of security screeners. The larger problem seems to be that different parts of the system are not communicating effectively with one another and not working together to better plan for increased passenger volumes as the air sector recovers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170605">As I have mentioned throughout, we recognize the impact that wait times at some Canadian airports are having on travellers and we are working with our partners to take action and find solutions.

They talk about a lack of testing at the borders, a lack of response to the emergence of new variants, a lack of quarantining when waves were at their peak, a lack of service in French from the companies responsible for screening, a lack of coordination with quarantine hotels, delays in providing screening test results, a shortage of staff to ensure compliance with home quarantine orders, and little or no follow-up with travellers who failed to follow quarantine orders. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170646">Mr. Speaker, I will start by saying that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170647">I am grateful for the opportunity to address this subject today. I was very happy to see the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>'s motion. There is a lot of talk in the media and from our constituents about wait times for passports and delays at the airport. People pretty much everywhere, including in my riding, are eager to get back to normal. The pandemic is winding down, and people want to start travelling and visiting sun destinations again after two difficult years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170648">That is why I think this is an important matter. Moreover, we have been in a pandemic for more than two years now. That has forced governments to implement measures that may have curtailed our freedoms, but that were needed because they were there to protect the health of the population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170649">The Conservative Party has always opposed these measures. It has constantly tried to limit their scope. We saw this with the many questions they have asked in the House since the beginning of the 44th Parliament, as well as with the opposition days they devoted to the issue, when they demanded the immediate lifting of all measures. They did not adopt a gradual approach. They really wanted to lift all measures immediately.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170650">Although it is true that the Conservatives were pandering to libertarians on this matter, it is also true that the Liberals also did not hesitate to politicize the issue and to use unvaccinated people for political purposes. We saw this in the last election campaign. The government suddenly announced a vaccination requirement for all federal employees, while still refusing to present a plan for lifting the health measures. At every turn, the two parties accused each other of dividing the population, on the one hand with health measures, and on the other with disinformation. I think that it is crucial to avoid politicizing this issue. As members of the Bloc Québécois have said many times, the only thing we should do in this situation is listen to the science. We are not the experts. We must listen to the public health experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170651">As I mentioned earlier, the member's motion addresses problems at airports. Just this past Monday, the Canadian Press reported long lineups at airports and even said that it was taking four times longer to process incoming passengers than it had before the pandemic. It seems likely that the more travellers there are, the worse the problem will get. The Conservative Party is therefore asking the government to immediately revert to prepandemic travel rules and service levels. According to the Conservatives, the problem is the restrictions, the mandates they have been condemning for months. Their solution is to lift them all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170652">In my opinion, the Conservative Party is misguided in laying all the blame for airport wait times on the COVID‑19 restrictions, when that is not necessarily the case. Just yesterday, the Customs and Immigration Union publicly called on the <Affiliation DbId="278921" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and the Canada Border Services Agency to increase the number of border officers assigned to passenger operations at Canadian airports, in order to alleviate the pressure on both airport staff and passengers. Union president Mark Weber said that there are simply not enough officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170653">These delays are a source of frustration for everyone, but the union's solution is to bring in more officers, not to get rid of measures that are designed to keep the public and travellers healthy. The union said that this situation was foreseeable, noting, “Over the past decade, the number of officers assigned to passenger operations has decreased dramatically”. At present, at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, it is estimated that fewer than 300 officers are active in the passenger operations section, which is nearly half of the number needed to process inbound travellers in a timely manner. This is not unique to Toronto, either, with both Vancouver and Montreal facing similar issues.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170654">One sentence caught my attention in the press release I read this morning. To quote Mr. Weber:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170655">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The reality is that even with the eventual lifting of current public health measures, significant delays will likely persist, not only due to the critical shortage of officers in most border operations across the country, but also due to an over-reliance on inefficient technologies.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170656">Mr. Weber said that an officer can process a traveller twice as fast as the automated primary inspection kiosks. Essentially, he attributes the excessive delays at the airports to the staffing shortage and the inefficient technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170657">At the end of the day, these delays should come as no surprise. They were foreseeable. Mr. Weber says that we could have seen them coming for the past 10 years, having watched the situation deteriorate. What he is asking the <Affiliation DbId="278921" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and the Canada Border Services Agency to do is to add more staff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170658">We are seeing the same issue in almost every domain. I met with representatives of the National Police Federation last week who told me the same thing: The police is short on human resources, staff and security officers, including at the borders and at airports. Lifting the health measures will not necessarily make the lines shorter. There needs to be more people on the job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170659">I would like to come back to paragraph (iii) of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>'s motion, which states that several countries “have moved to lift COVID‑19 restrictions at airports and other points of entry”. That may be true, but only partially. Some countries have gone ahead and lifted all restrictions, but most still have some restrictions in place, particularly when it comes to people who are unvaccinated. For instance, the United Kingdom and Ireland have lifted most of their measures. However, in France, only fully vaccinated travellers can arrive in the country without having to be tested, and those without proof of vaccination must show a negative test upon arrival. In the U.S., our biggest partner, travellers must be fully vaccinated in order to enter the country. It is the same in Spain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170660">No matter what standard of comparison we use, I think that it is reasonable to say that so far, Canada has followed the science and public health advice on what should be done to protect the public. However, if anyone asked me whether the government has managed the borders properly since the start of the pandemic, I would instantly answer no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170661">I refer to what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> said about the Auditor General's comments on border management over the last 27 months. There is a pretty long list of things that did not go well: a lack of border testing; a failure to respond properly to emerging new variants; a lack of quarantines during peak waves; a lack of service in French from testing companies; a lack of coordination with hotels to provide accommodation for quarantining travellers, and members will recall that the chaotic quarantine situation at hotels made the headlines several times; delays in getting test results, as many people took a test and sent it in, but never got the result, leaving them unsure about their status; no follow-up for travellers who complied with their quarantine; and a lack of staff to enforce the requirement to quarantine at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170662">I am not even going to delve into the passport saga because I will run out of time. Passport Canada is in total chaos right now. Call volumes have doubled or tripled because, as I said, people are itching to travel again. They realize that their passport expired and want it renewed quickly, but that is impossible because there is not enough staff. The fact that the government decided to keep these offices shut for so long, while public servants worked from home as a precaution, may also explain the current situation. In some cases, the government waited until May 17 to call employees back to work to open service points. This could have happened more quickly, considering that it has been demonstrated that certain businesses and service points could provide services to the public without endangering the workers. This government's failure to be proactive could very well explain this whole thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170663">Unfortunately, we are experiencing a labour shortage, which is why I do not fully agree with all the points raised in the Conservative Party's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170664">As I said a little earlier when I asked the parliamentary secretary a question, I think we could work out a compromise instead of demanding the immediate lifting of all health measures, even it it is stressful to arrive at the airport and have to wait, and even if we are fed up with all that. We were very happy in Quebec when the mask mandate was lifted last week. I think it is still important to listen to and respect what public health experts are telling us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170665">I believe that the government could come up with a plan for gradually lifting the health measures. The Bloc Québécois will therefore be moving an amendment to the member for Thornhill's motion to ensure that we can find common ground.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170668">Mr. Speaker, I think it is difficult to make comparisons, even within Canada. The provinces did not all have the same measures in place. Quebec was the last to lift the mask mandate. I think that it really listened to Quebeckers, while monitoring the number of cases and the number of deaths. Although these numbers are dropping, they are still high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170669">If we had lifted the mask mandate and other measures too quickly, we might have faced another wave. That was the case in recent months; each time we thought we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, another wave hit. I think we need to listen to what public health has to say. To a certain extent, that is what the government did. Is an update needed? Yes, absolutely. I think that we have reached that point. However, that is different from saying we need to lift all measures right now. I think it is a bit too soon, despite the fact that, as I mentioned, we are all tired of the measures.</ParaText>

I saw less of that at the federal level. There is a lot of uncertainty among the public, and people keep asking for clear information.</ParaText>

I hope she will not take offence at the comments I am about to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170681">On the last Bloc opposition day, my Conservative colleagues talked a lot about the relevance of our motion, which had to do with prayer. They wondered why we had raised that subject at a time when no one was talking about prayer and when, in their opinion, we should have been talking about inflation and gas prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170682">I am therefore surprised that my Conservative colleagues have not put forward any motions on gas prices or inflation on their last two opposition days. I do not hold it against them, but I would like to do the same for them. I may not talk about the relevance of their motion, but I would like to talk about their intent. What is my Conservative colleagues' intention? What is motivating them today to call on the government to immediately revert to pre‑pandemic rules and service levels for travel?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170683">First, I believe that, before we can immediately revert to prepandemic rules, we must necessarily rely on public health guidance. Here, I would like to make a first distinction. On the one hand, there is the science and public health objectives, which involve establishing truths that are sometimes difficult to establish, especially during a pandemic. On the other hand, there is political partisanship or the desire to promote a political ideology, which often involves advancing a political agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170684">In my view, the purpose of the motion before us today is to advance the political agenda of the Conservatives rather than really determining whether the public health situation permits a full reopening and the lifting of certain measures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170685"> I do not want to hurt the feelings of my Conservative friends, because, after all, I am a caring person. That said, the reason why I am talking about the Conservative political agenda is because I think that there is a phenomenon that is plaguing my Conservatives colleagues, and that is populism. There seems to be a form of populism embedded in Conservative Party rhetoric, and the proof of that is in the favourite topics of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, whom I admire. In the cut and thrust of debate, the member for Carleton is exciting and interesting, and we want to hear him, but, unfortunately, the issues that he brings up often relate to some form of populism. I am thinking of all his speeches about the need to take back control of our lives. I will come back to that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170686">I do not know what other people are going through, but I for one have not lost control of my life. I may have lost control of my weight, but sooner or later I will be able to get that back under control. However, I have not lost control of my life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170687">I am also thinking of that word “justinflation” that the member for Carleton is always mentioning, and, of course, his rhetoric about freedom.

              <ParaText id="7170692">Mr. Speaker, that was a judicious intervention. I apologize for offending my colleague. It is an unflattering play on the word inflation and the Prime Minister's name that I feel conveys that populism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170693">Before I go on, I would like to define the word “populism”. Generally speaking, it is a style of politics that divides by attempting to simplify issues and amplify antagonism. It is us versus them. In this particular case, there are travellers on one side and the government on the other. A simplistic interpretation is that the government is preventing travellers from moving freely and that all it has to do is change the rules to solve the problem. That is simplistic because we know this is a public health issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170694">When we talk about populism, we can also say that we are talking about personalized speech and behaviour that relies on rhetoric that combines utopia and demagoguery. In an ideal world, we are not affected by the pandemic. It does not affect us, and everyone can come and go as they please. If we were to take a demagogic approach, we would say that all of the border crossings can be reopened tomorrow morning, and there will be no problems. Generally, this sort of thing is done to pander to the people and pit them against the elite. The travellers, the people, the truckers, to use a term dear to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, have a view of society that is against the elite. That is populism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170695">Populists usually condemn institutions that do not sufficiently consider the public's aspirations. The government and public health do not care about the aspirations of the average person. Populists characterize political opponents as elites who care very little about the ideas of the people and popular common sense. Generally, when it comes to populism, the truth is in popular common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170696">That sets the table for a debate which, in my opinion, is a perfect example of what is wrong with politics today: the democracy of opinion. Those of us who know a bit about philosophy make that distinction. On the one hand there is opinion and <I>doxa</I> and, on the other, <I>episteme</I>, the sciences. Opinion is based on appearance. You say “it appears to me that,” without having checked the facts. On the other hand, science involves a deeper reflection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170697">I feel that that is what today’s debate is about. Conservatives are saying that it appears that the measures in airports are far too restrictive and that we are further along in the pandemic, but they have not taken care to consult a public health expert. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170698">I said that I wanted to help my Conservative colleagues, who are poisoned by populism. I would like to cite Pierre Rosanvallon, an author I particularly like. When he speaks of populism, he says we must beware of the “threefold populist simplification”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170699">I would like to explain what threefold simplification means using my friend and colleague from Carleton. First, according to Pierre Rosanvallon, there is political and sociological simplification, where “the people” is a defined homogeneous subject. Considering the people a defined homogenous subject is the same as saying “Canadians think that”; for example, all Canadians think that we should immediately lift all measures in airports. It defines the people as different from the elite, in other words, from other politicians who think differently, as if the people were a monolith. On the one hand, there are truckers and unvaccinated people and, on the other, a form of elite that is completely disconnected from reality and that is hostile to freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170700">There is also, according to Pierre Rosanvallon, procedural and institutional simplification. This involves attacking institutions and politicians who think differently. I will give you an interesting example. My colleagues may have followed the debate between the hon. member for Carleton and Jean Charest. In the debate, my colleague from Carleton said to Jean Charest, “to hear you talk about law and order is a bit rich, given that your party, your [Quebec] Liberal Party, took a half-million dollars of illegal donations when you were the head of that party. The average trucker has more integrity in his pinky finger than you had in your entire...Liberal cabinet.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170701">We can see here that this is a populist discourse that attacks, in a manner of speaking, populist adversaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170702">Let us take this a bit further, and consider what we heard from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, who finds that what our friend from <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> is doing on cryptocurrency is entirely inconsequential. Moreover, in response to a recent direct attack on institutions by the hon. member for Carleton and his threat to dismiss the Governor of the Bank of Canada, the hon. member for Abbotsford said, “We lose some credibility when we do this. It is fair to ask questions, to demand solutions to the skyrocketing cost of living. But we also have to respect the institutions that have been granted independence to ensure that they function apart from political interference.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170703">Members can then see a dynamic that reflects the lowest form of populism, which can even lead a member to call our colleague from Carleton to order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170704">I will conclude by addressing simplification that arises from populism. The hon. member for Carleton said in the House, “We are going to give Canadians their freedom back and make them the authors of their own stories. That is the approach we will take as Conservatives. Everybody has their story, and the story that I am hearing right now is that people feel like they are losing control of their lives.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170705">In my opinion, this is what is poisoning my Conservative colleagues in today’s debate: They want to make people believe that institutions are preventing them from taking control of their lives, and they are doing it to the detriment of science. It is a very dangerous game.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170720">It is a pleasure to rise and speak about the situation in our major airports, a situation that I think by now pretty much every Canadian across the country is familiar with. It is a situation that is chaotic, and it is a situation that is having real impacts on a lot of people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170721">For over two years, Canadians were asked to put off travel plans. They could not visit family members; they missed major life events; they had to cancel long-awaited holidays; they could not travel to other parts of Canada or other parts of the world. People made significant sacrifices to protect each other, to protect their loved ones and to protect their communities. They helped buy time for frontline health workers before we had vaccines, and they kept it up when new variants emerged and threatened to derail our collective efforts. The vast majority of Canadians did their part, and for that they deserve our thanks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170722">With many restrictions now lifted, people are excited to travel again, which is understandable, and they are returning to our airports in huge numbers. Last week, an average of 120,000 travellers went through our major airports each day. That is a huge number, but once at the airports, they are being stuck in long screening lines. Planes are stuck on the tarmac without passengers able to leave. People are missing flights, and much more. Of course, people are rightly frustrated by this situation. These delays are creating stress and anxiety for travellers and they need to be addressed. This situation was foreseeable. It has been going on for weeks and the government needs to fix it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170723">Why is this happening? As we heard at the transport committee from the Canadian Airports Council, the biggest factor is staffing, especially the lack of screening personnel needed to move passengers through security. Screening capacity is a federal responsibility through the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, CATSA. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170724">Like many sectors of our economy, aspects of the air transport sector have struggled to rehire employees laid off earlier in the pandemic, and we have heard about that challenge in today's debate already. As the hospitality industry has experienced, some staff simply are not available to hire back because they have moved on to other positions with better work conditions, better compensation and better terms of employment. The minister needs to ensure that the terms of employment related to these positions, the positions at our airports that are needed to screen passengers, are adequate to attract and retain the skilled workforce that we need to ensure safe air travel for all those who fly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170725">The other issue, of course, is the fact that the pandemic is still very much with us, and it is hard to maintain staffing levels when employees are catching COVID and leaving work because they are sick. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170726">The government should have been able to predict that these challenges would emerge. It should have hired sufficient staff, and if it struggled to find people to do the work, it should have reviewed the terms of those positions to ensure that they are competitive and able to attract and retain the people it needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170727">The Liberal government first announced it was relaxing travel restrictions on February 15, with mandatory arrival testing and quarantine scrapped at the end of February. Liberals were happy to go around saying how exciting it was that travel was back and Canada was reopening in time for the tourism season, but over three months have passed since those announcements, and it is clear that the government has not done enough to ensure that our airports are ready. Now Canadians are facing the consequences of the government's mismanagement and lack of preparedness. This was entirely avoidable. It should have been anticipated and it needs to be fixed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170728">We have seen the same mishandling from the government with passport applications. I am sure everyone in the House has heard from constituents who are facing incredibly lengthy delays and long lines at Service Canada offices because the government failed to anticipate an increase in demand for travel when the restrictions were relaxed. The same folks who were left scrambling to get their passports on time a few weeks ago are now at the airport experiencing long lines at security screening. They are frustrated and anxious because of the delays they are seeing. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170729">Instead of acknowledging the government’s failure to prepare, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">transport minister</Affiliation> had the audacity to blame the travellers themselves, saying that it was their lack of practice and the slowness with which they took the liquids out of their bags that were leading to these long delays at the airport. Frankly, that is offensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170730">Shifting to the riding I represent, I am particularly mindful of tourism operators in northwest B.C. and across Canada, who have looked forward to a season of welcoming back clientele from across Canada and around the world. I think of operators in the Bulkley Valley, the Bella Coola Valley, Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert. They are looking forward to finally getting their business back, and the last thing they need is their clients hearing that travelling to Canada is a hassle because of the delays at our airports. That is going to hurt the tourism business right across Canada, and it needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170731">The Conservatives have brought this forward because they see a very particular opportunity in this crisis, which is the opportunity to once again try their hand at removing every health measure, every restriction and every tool we have to protect Canadians and safeguard our country against future waves of the virus. We disagree with that approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170732">We disagree because the pandemic is still very much with us and because there are some public health measures, we believe, that are likely still advisable for the ongoing protection of Canadians and the detection of the virus at our border. Most of all, we disagree because we believe important public health measures should be informed by public health science, not by politics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170733">The motion before us makes the claim that Canada’s international allies are removing all travel restrictions. Simply put, that is not the case. Just to the south of us, the United States still requires a predeparture COVID test. That is more restrictive than here in Canada. Almost every country requires proof of vaccination to enter. Saying that our international allies are lifting all restrictions is simply not accurate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170734">We have an opportunity to strike a balance between enabling the mobility of Canadians and keeping in place tools that allow us to respond to future public health threats. The question is, do the current pandemic travel measures strike the right balance? Are they defensible? Are they based on the best available evidence? How are they better than other, similar measures that have been proposed as alternatives? This is where the blame goes back to the Liberal government, which has been less than forthcoming of late when it comes to these pandemic measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170735">In fact, the NDP wrote to Dr. Tam in March and called on her to conduct a full re-evaluation of Canada’s pandemic measures and report back to Canadians. The letter from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278623" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278634" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> simply highlighted that creating trust in public health measures requires explaining the arguments and sharing the evidence on which they are based.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170736">I have asked questions on this topic in this very debate today. I have asked the government to tell us when it will be reporting back from its review and how that information will be shared with Canadians, yet we do not get a response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170737">The questions are growing. Just last week, infectious disease expert Dr. Zain Chagla from McMaster University published an article stating that, in his view, Canada’s “current rules for travel do not make sense”. A few days ago, a Globe and Mail editorial asked whether the measures in place are still needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170738">The government needs to be more transparent with Canadians about the evidence behind any remaining public health measures. It needs to clearly communicate the data and the science informing these decisions. The government needs to stand up and answer. The truth is that it has become less transparent and less forthcoming precisely at a time in the pandemic when the public needs answers more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170739">It was not always this way. We remember the beginning of the pandemic, when Canadians received in-depth explanations of every measure and the evidence justifying it. The result was high public trust, high compliance with restrictions and guidelines, and a sense that we were all pulling in the same direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170740">The situation at the airports is frustrating. People who are having their travel plans cancelled are under extreme stress. The government should have seen this coming and it should have fixed it. We need more answers and more transparency from the Liberal government.</ParaText>

I would like to clarify that a review of measures is ongoing and constant. Health Canada is always reassessing the latest public health data to better dictate our decision-making at airports. There is no completion date, as this is ongoing. It will also likely vary depending upon the scientific measure: vaccine mandates, masking, random testing, etc.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170742">What would my colleague do differently? Would he set an arbitrary date for when measures should be lifted, or should it be as soon as possible as new data is assessed?</ParaText>

To say that things are constantly being reviewed really undermines the whole concept of having something called a “review”, which most Canadians understand to be a process that has a start and finish and a process through which results are communicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170744">The parliamentary secretary said some things that I do agree with, one of which is that we need this to be based on science, but we need the government to be instilling public trust by providing answers to the basic questions. These are reasonable questions that, in fact, public health experts themselves are asking, and Canadians deserve answers.</ParaText>

It should also respond to the independent public health experts, who have asked very rational and important questions. That is how we build public trust at a time when we need it more than ever. The reality is that unfortunately at this juncture in the pandemic, public trust is at a very low level. We need to correct that and we do that through transparency and communication.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7170754">Madam Speaker, as always, it is a privilege to rise in the House to speak to important issues of the day, not only on behalf of the great people of Vancouver Kingsway, but on behalf of Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170755">I want to start with an observation. As health critic for the New Democratic Party of Canada, I have had a front-row seat to the issues, unfortunately, since the beginning of this pandemic, having sat on the health committee way back in 2019 to 2020 when COVID-19 first emerged. One thing I can say for sure over the last two-and-a-half years of policy for COVID-19 is that Canadians are never well served when any political party plays politics with the pandemic. I think we have seen that practised by the government at various times. In fact, government members themselves have publicly stated that their own government has sought to use the pandemic and abuse the pandemic for partisan political purposes. I think we see it here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170756"> Any time that politicians prey on frustration, ignore science and data, use partial facts or misleading statements and practise poor public health policy, Canadians are not well served. I regret to say to the House today that this motion really has all of that. As my great colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278635" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> just stated, this motion does contain some things that are true, but unfortunately it also contains some statements and conclusions that are dangerously false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170757"> It is interesting to me that this motion was introduced by the Conservative transport critic, not the health critic. As the underlying issue here is public health policy and the pandemic, that speaks volumes about the motivation behind this, because the motion ignores fundamental truths and facts from the health world and attempts to exploit the frustration of travellers to result in what would be an incredibly ill-advised health policy decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170758">I want to start with some things I agree with. I agree that the vaccine mandate ought to be questioned and replaced if it proves ineffective. There is growing and significant evidence that there is little impact of vaccination on the ability to transmit the virus, at least post-omicron. It is also the case that Canadian public policy has failed and continues to fail to recognize infection-acquired immunity. There is overwhelming evidence that infection-acquired immunity is real. There is substantial evidence that it is as strong and durable as immunity achieved from vaccination, and perhaps even more so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170759">Countries such as Austria have recognized this for many months. Citizens in that country can access public facilities and services by proving they are vaccinated, as we require in Canada, but if they can produce serology tests that prove they have been exposed to COVID and recovered, that is accepted as well, because it is basic vaccinology 101 that no matter how we recover from an infection and how our bodies produce antibodies, it has the same result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170760">Those two facts suggest that disallowing unvaccinated Canadians, particularly those who have been exposed to COVID and recovered from travelling, may not be science-based any longer. That, to me, should be explored and changed based on data and evidence. In fact, I have spoken to many constituents, as recently as last night, who question the vaccine mandate policy today in light of the mounting evidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170761">Unfortunately, that is not what this motion before us states. It goes far beyond that to indefensible and unsafe areas. It wants us to agree that we should revert to all prepandemic rules. The motion says:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170762">

              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170763">That is completely irresponsible and belied by the science. For example, requiring foreign travellers arriving in Canada to be vaccinated is absolutely still necessary for one major reason, among others: to protect our strained health care system so that travellers do not get sick and clog up our ICUs. It is still the case, as we know, that being vaccinated significantly reduces one's chance of becoming seriously ill or dying.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170764">Here is another example. Mask mandates are probably the single most effective measure we have for helping to reduce the spread of airborne viruses. This is especially the case in crowded indoor places, where physical distancing is not possible. I would venture to say that airplane cabins are, perhaps, the quintessential example of this, yet this motion introduced by the Conservatives states we should have no rules in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170765">Every single expert who has appeared at HESA and been questioned on this issue has agreed that we need to maintain masks as a precaution. Not a single one has said it is wise or time to abandon them, yet the motion and the Conservatives ignore this fact. It is only common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170766">We know COVID is spread in aerosolized fashion as a respiratory illness. It is well established that masks help to stop the spread of such viruses. It is no surprise that the Conservatives would ignore that fact, as they continue to refuse every day, and in fact today, to wear masks in the House, a crowded indoor place, despite public health advice to do so—</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170767">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Why aren't you speaking with one?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170768">
                <B>Mr. Don Davies:</B> Madam Speaker, someone asked why I am not wearing one. We take masks off when we speak, and they know that. It is for the interpreters. The Conservatives understand that, but the fact that they would heckle on that point shows how bereft of rationality and evidence they really are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170769">Again, this motion calls for the policy to immediately revert to prepandemic rules. That assumes things have returned to normal. Like every Canadian, I wish that were so, but it is not. This motion presumes to refer to experts, but not one epidemiologist or public health expert has testified at the health committee that we are in an endemic phase. The Conservatives know that or they should know that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170770">I predict there is a high probability we will see a resurgence, perhaps a seventh wave, in the fall. Why? It is because nothing has changed. The virus is still present, mutations are occurring, the omicron BA.2 variant is still in circulation and there is detection of others, including something called the “deltacron” variant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170771">Vaccination in the developing world is still shamefully behind. We know vaccine efficacy wanes, and it does not prevent infection. Sloppy habits, like the Conservatives refusing to wear masks in crowded indoor rooms like this one, help contribute to the spread of airborne respiratory illnesses.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Don Davies:</B> Madam Speaker, I hear the Conservatives laughing at that. Maybe they should go back to medical school and take a beginner's course in virology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170774">This motion also attempts to blame the problems of Canadian airports on public health rules. This fundamentally misunderstands what is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170775">The core problem is that there are few flights due to reduced traffic and, more importantly, reduced staffing due to the shortages of workers, especially in security and baggage handling. The causes of this are poor pay, poor hours, shift work and poor working conditions. Airports are having trouble attracting workers back to work because of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170776">Did I say that? No. People in the airline industry say that, yet the Conservatives vote against every attempt to improve workers' conditions. They will not raise minimum wages, they oppose better unionization rules, they fight occupational health and safety improvements and they even wanted workers to work until they were 67 years old before they could retire, which would be especially hard on blue collar workers, who find physical work and shift work more difficult as they age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170777">If we want to do something to help workers and get airports flying better, let us get improved conditions for workers in every airport in this condition. We are never going to get that from the Conservatives, but we will get that from New Democrats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170779">He raises a really interesting point in his discussion, and I was thinking about it. When it comes to the Conservatives' approach to vaccines, they have always taken the approach that the vaccine only has to do with them: It is their choice because it only has to do with them. In reality, the science behind vaccines is really about not just the individual, but how a community is affected by individuals making a choice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170797">My hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation> has brought forward an excellent and timely motion today, one which I will be fully supporting. Ultimately, it calls on the government “to immediately revert to pre-pandemic rules and service levels for travel.” In short, the Liberal government's outdated COVID-19 protocols at airports and other international ports of entry are causing extreme delays, lineups, bottlenecks and missed connections. Worst of all, they are acting as a disincentive for those wishing to travel to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170798">While the focus of our opposition motion today is on airports, it is very important and relevant that other international ports of entry are mentioned and included as well, because they are all connected in our economic ecosystem. These ports of entry support businesses and economic opportunities in many sectors, including tourism, which is very important in my riding, as we have the city of Niagara Falls and the towns of Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170799"> My Niagara Falls riding has four international bridge crossings. They are managed by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission and the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority, respectively. These are the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, the Rainbow Bridge and the Peace Bridge. All have been hit hard by the two-year pandemic, and the federal government has done nothing to support these bridges, despite the heavy hardship of lost traffic due to extended border closures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170800">One of the biggest issues I hear about at our international bridge crossings is that of backlogs and delays being caused by the ArriveCAN app. In an email from March 24, 2022, the general manager of the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority warned local politicians that their analysis showed the continued mandatory use of the ArriveCAN app would result in much longer processing times and lengthy border waits, which would significantly depress cross-border traffic at a time when we were moving into the 2022 summer tourism summer season.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170801">Fast forward two months, and here we are. His prediction was right. I raised this issue with the federal government as soon as I could. What did it do to prepare for these border backlogs? It doubled down and decided to spend $25 million more in budget 2022 to continue to support the mandatory use of this application. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170802">Along my border community riding, there are also a number of CBSA marine reporting sites for small vessels. They include the Niagara-on-the-Lake Sailing Club, the Smugglers Cove Boat Club, the Greater Niagara Boating Club, Miller's Creek Marina, Bertie Boating Club, and the Buffalo Canoe Club, amongst others. Out of all these sites I just listed, only one is operational. Miller's Creek in the upper Niagara River and Fort Erie is open, but all the other sites are closed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170803">Members can imagine, if someone is boating on the lower Niagara River in Niagara-on-the-Lake, they would have to travel all the way to Port Weller in St. Catharines to report in with CBSA. If they are on the upper Niagara River but closer to Chippawa and Niagara Falls, then they have to travel all the way to Fort Erie and all the way back just to report in with CBSA. This adds many kilometres to a voyage and is a huge waste of time and money for boaters, especially as fuel prices skyrocket to record highs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170804">These closures are a huge issue for local recreational boaters, especially as we approach the May long weekend and enter the summer boating season. We need the government to reopen all sites immediately. There is no time to waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170805">Tourist businesses in my riding were hit first. They were hit the hardest, and they will take the longest to recover from COVID-19. The effect these failing Liberal policies are having on our boaters will only make recovery take that much longer. Tourist businesses in Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie depend on domestic and international visitors travelling to our communities, spending their time and dollars and enjoying all that Niagara has to offer. The operation of attractions, historic sites, restaurants, wineries, craft breweries, cideries, casinos and many other businesses depend on this visitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170806">In communities such as Niagara, international visitation is important. While they make up approximately 25% of our total visitor base, these international visitors account for over 50% of the dollars spent in our tourism communities. This spend helps support over 40,000 jobs that are reliant on a strong tourism industry, which we had in Niagara before this pandemic. That is why it is essential we welcome back our international friends, guests and visitors. That starts by giving them a great, quick and efficient experience at our international ports of entry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170807">No one is going to choose Canada as a travel vacation destination if they have to risk waiting hours upon hours in stressful and frustrating lineups at an airport or a border crossing. Economic damage and missed opportunities are already being incurred. As the world reopens from COVID and other countries lift their restrictions, Canada looks to be stuck in the past and out of touch with reality. For example, the European Union and the United States have dropped their mask mandates for passengers on flights and in airports. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170808">As countries around the world are reducing red tape and making it easier for citizens to travel again, the Liberals in Ottawa continue to impose their outdated and unjustified mandates, which are leading to longer lines and a slower recovery. As an example, fully vaccinated travellers arriving in Canada are still subjected to random COVID-19 testing, and in some cases, these travellers are not even told they have been selected until they get a surprise automated phone call or email a few days later from Switch Health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170809">This happened to Kathryn and her daughter, two constituents of mine. On May 10, they had an uneventful Nexus border crossing at the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia. They were never informed that they were selected for random testing, nor were they given a random test on their exit from their Nexus inspection. Three days later, they received multiple phone calls and emails from Switch Health warning them to get a day-one random test or else risk contravening a public health order with severe penalties, including fines upwards of tens of thousands of dollars and mandatory quarantine. It seems illogical for people to be told they have to take a random test and then wait for Switch Health to send it to them by courier so they can complete it a few days, if not weeks, later. How is this in the best public health interest of Canadians? Simply put, the incompetence of the government knows no bounds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170810">Many experts have called for the end of these ridiculous requirements. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has called for a step back to improve regulations in order for Canada to become more competitive. The president of the Canadian Airports Council has called for the removal of legacy public health protocols, noting that mandatory testing is leading to bottlenecks and hurting Canada's competitiveness. These requirements are stifling our hard-hit tourism industry and are leading to long delays for Canadians just looking to travel after a long two years of obeying government-induced lockdown measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170811">All of these terrible travel experiences at our airports and border crossings are hurting Canada's economy, competitiveness and international global reputation as a top tourist destination. Since the world started reopening months ago, Canada has lagged far behind our international tourism destination competitors due to these bad federal government policies. On a scale this large, every port of entry across our country is negatively impacted, and this ripple effect negatively impacts every riding of the House of Commons, especially those, like Niagara Falls, that depend on tourism as a major economic driver. We all benefit from a strong tourism industry, and we all lose when it is weak and chaotic, like it is now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170812">After two long years of government shutdowns, lockdowns, border closures and stringent travel restrictions, many tourist businesses in my riding are counting on a significant rebound this summer. Unfortunately, due to these travel measures and issues at airports and borders, government policy is working to stifle, rather than support, an urgently needed recovery in our tourism economy in 2022. Through their lack of preparedness to keep Canadians safe and preserve our economic best interests, the Liberals and NDP are abdicating their responsibility to govern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170813">In my opinion, before COVID, Canada was the best place to visit and vacation. We can get back to being the best, and we should strive for nothing less, but we have a lot of work ahead of us, and it starts with objective of this motion, which is to get the federal government to immediately revert to prepandemic rules and service levels for travel. Niagara badly needs to achieve economic recovery this summer, and that is simply not going to happen if ArriveCAN and other federal travel and health restrictions continue at our airports and borders. It seems as though everyone wants to achieve economic recovery from this pandemic and a return to normalcy, everyone except the Liberal-NDP government, but it should know there is still time to save the 2022 tourism season if it acts quickly, and it should start by supporting today's common sense and timely motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170827">Madam Speaker, almost every week, I have the privilege of travelling across this great country, from Vancouver to Ottawa and back. With a three-hour time zone difference, it is basically a day in travel each way. It can be a tiring part of a cross-country commute job, as it would be for any Canadian, but now it is gruelling. I am witnessing first-hand the Liberal government's outdated COVID-19 protocols at airports. They are causing extreme delays, lineups, bottlenecks and missed connections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170828">Travellers are frustrated and unhappy. They can watch a hockey game with thousands in an arena without a mask, but must wear that mask on a flight in between Canadian destinations, and in and out of Canada, with sometimes well over 150 other people. It is not rational or even logical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170829">The European Union and the United States have both dropped their mask mandates for passengers on flights and in airports. Meanwhile, travellers arriving in Canada are still being subjected to random COVID-19 testing and must answer personal, private health questions on the ArriveCAN app. Why is Canada's science different from the science followed by many of our international allies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170830">These unnecessary protocols are causing severe delays at Canadian airports. Customs has become so backed up that there is not enough physical space to hold the lineups, leaving passengers stuck on planes for over 75 minutes. I recently had the experience, on my Washington trip with the <Affiliation DbId="278899" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, of having to deal with the ArriveCAN app. Imagine seniors like me dealing with the issues on this app when trying to come home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170831">Every airport and airline is complaining that it is severely understaffed in all aspects. At YVR on Sunday, there is now a sign at the screening entrance stating, “Limited capacity due to staff shortages”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170832">Bags are not making the transfers between flights if a person has a layover in Toronto, despite long layovers. Security lines are ridiculously long. They do not have enough staff to open all the scanner lines, despite having the traveller traffic to warrant that level of operation. Meanwhile, airlines are ramping up their schedules very slowly, because they simply do not have the staff to service that many flights. I was told by one airport employee that Toronto's Pearson alone is 600 staff short. This means that if a person checks a bag and it gets on the flight, but the person does not make it because they are stuck in security, they may not see that bag for a long time. It may be days. Then, when the person misses that flight because security lines are so long, they cannot get another flight for several hours or they get one with a long, multi-hour layover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170833">Vancouver, like most international airports, has standard and express security lines, but even the express line was taking over one and a half hours last weekend, with people lined up way down to the international check-in areas. That means, for domestic flights, which usually recommend being at the airport 90 minutes in advance, we now need to allow for arriving two hours or more in advance to get our bags checked and through security on time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170834">Staff at the airports are so overworked and confused, with scarce resources and so many flights, that they are sometimes giving travellers false information about flights being held for them when they are not. Not only do we have the frustration of waiting, but then we have the surprise of no flight at the end of the security check-in process. I cannot even imagine travelling with young kids and dealing with these major hurdles. At YVR on the weekend, I saw a very pregnant woman with three kids racing through the airport, because the screening had taken so long, and no one was helping her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170835">It will come as no surprise to anyone in this place that the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, or CATSA, is a federal Crown corporation responsible for all passenger security screening, and it is experiencing ongoing staffing shortages. CATSA said that it has been actively supporting its contractors to recruit and develop new staff. Screening resources are scheduled according to airline traffic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170836">Prior to the pandemic, resources could be utilized across the board between domestic and international checkpoints due to staggered passenger peaks, but as air travel has recovered we are observing simultaneous peaks with passengers flooding more than one security checkpoint at a time. Because of uncertainty about baggage handling, passengers are also travelling with more carry-on bags, resulting in additional time required to process them at screening and creating storage issues on board.</ParaText>

We are not suggesting at all that security measures be lost. What we are saying is that they should be reasonable, logical, rational and based in science. If, as the Liberal government says, it has science to back up these ongoing restrictions that other countries are abandoning, then it should tell us what it is. It should tell us who it is listening to. It refuses to answer those questions.</ParaText>

If I understand the question correctly, he is asking if this is based in policy, and we are saying it is absolutely based in policy. Every provincial health authority in every province has lifted vaccine passports and mask mandates. We see our own <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> travelling abroad in countries with low vaccination rates and he is unmasked, with groups of people, anywhere from bars to restaurants to formal meetings. We walk out of this place, out of Parliament, take our mask off, and we can go to any restaurant and to any place we want to shop without a mask.

That is why we will see members on all sides of the House from all political parties wearing these beautiful embroidered shirts, as the people of Ukraine and people well beyond the borders of Ukraine get an appreciation of Ukrainian heritage in a very beautiful way. This morning we had members of Parliament, as I say, from all sides of the House, along with interns, showcasing the embroidery and an appreciation of Ukrainian heritage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170869">Having said that, and Mom always says to try to say something nice, I would like to get into the meat of what we are talking about today. There are a couple of things that I want to focus a bit of time on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170870">If we listen to the Conservative Party, that could be a bad thing, because we get this impression that Canada is alone in the world, that we are the only country in the whole world that has any sorts of mandates in place in our airports. That is what we would be led to believe. That is the Conservative spin, or the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s spin, I should say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170871"> I just did a very quick inquiry and found out this. The U.S., Japan and Israel continue to require predeparture testing. Italy, Japan, Australia and Israel require intercountry testing for some travellers. The U.S., Japan, Australia and Israel require some form of vaccine in order to enter the country. France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Australia and Israel still require masking in their transport sectors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170872">If we listen to what the Conservatives are saying, not only today but for a long time now, it is this: We do not need mandates. It is as simple as that. That is the Conservative Party's line. Is it based on health or science? No. It is based on the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. The member for Carleton has said mandates are not necessary. That should not surprise us; he has been saying that for months.</ParaText>

                <Affiliation DbId="279316" Type="18">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</Affiliation> Madam Speaker, he is consistent. The member is right. I will give him that much. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> is consistent. If someone is a Conservative member of Parliament, they do not need to listen to health experts. They do not have to look at science, but just look to the member for Carleton and they will understand why it is they do not need mandates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170875"> Members will understand why it is that everyone else in the chamber is more skeptical in terms of what members of the Conservative Party of Canada are saying. We believe that we should have more faith in health measures, with the experts and the science. Therefore, as the members of the Bloc and the NDP and the Green Party and, yes, the Liberals, we will continue to follow the science and listen to the health experts. We will do what is right for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170876"> We are very much aware that Canadians are feeling frustrated with regard to the lineups and the delays at airports. We are very much aware of that. In fact, not only am I aware, but I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278652" Type="2">Pickering—Uxbridge</Affiliation>, and members will find that she will no doubt even be embellishing on some of the points I am making. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170877">Before I get back to some of the other things that I was going to say, I will just pick up on the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. It is an interesting thing when the member for Carleton will say “freedom” and “speaking truth to power”. Do members remember him saying that? What happened to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>? My goodness, did members catch the news lately?

I am inclined to agree with the member for Abbotsford. Speaking that kind of truth to power and having the freedom to be able to say that has been kind of lost within the Conservative Party under the leadership potential of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

They do not have to listen to the health experts or science. I think that is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170880">We have recognized that what is happening in Canada is not unique to Canada alone. There are airports around the world that are experiencing the same sorts of issues we are facing here in Canada. It is not to try to marginalize the issue. Whether someone is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> or any other member of this House, they are concerned about what is taking place in our international airports. The Minister of Transport is actually getting committees together. Transport Canada is working with stakeholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170881">We understand the importance of the tourism industry to our country a whole lot more than the Conservatives do. In fact, we were there to support them during the pandemic. We provided direct support to airlines and industries such as restaurants, and to a festival that I often make reference to, which is a great tourist attraction in my own province of Manitoba, Folklorama. Talking to restaurant owners or reps in the hospitality industry, one of the most common comments I receive is that they were very happy and grateful to see that there was a wage subsidy program. They understood the importance of a government taking action to support the hospitality and tourism industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170882">We understand that the peak season is around the corner. We would like to get back to our new normal as quickly as we can, but we are not going to do what the Conservative Party of Canada/member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has to say on the issue. Rather, we are going to continue to look at the science. We are going to continue to listen to what the health experts say. At the end of the day, that is where we are going to fall on the issue of policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170883">If colleagues take a look at our record as a national government, working with Canadians and other levels of government and stakeholders, they will find that Canada is doing quite well going through this pandemic. The Conservatives might like to think that we can just wish it away, but it does not work that way. There is a process in place to ensure that it is done in an orderly fashion, so that we can, in fact, ensure that the health and well-being of Canadians in all regions of our country are being taken care of. We continue to look forward to the weeks and months ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170884">Earlier this month, in May, the province of Quebec lifted the mandatory masking requirement. Quebec is not alone. There are other jurisdictions in Canada and around the world that still have some form of mandate out there. It seems to be only the Conservative Party of Canada/member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> that believe mandates have no role at all. I would hope that the membership of the Conservative caucus will have the freedom to get onside with science and health experts and defend what is important: the health and well-being of all Canadians. That would be my recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170885">We have seen the hiring of 400 people to help out with security clearances. Airports are working with airlines and Transport Canada on ways in which we can speed up the process. We understand the issue, and we will do what we can to try to fix it as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170900">I had the great pleasure and responsibility of being the parliamentary secretary to the former minister of health during a large portion of the pandemic. I sat through committee meeting after committee meeting with our health officials and with experts, witnesses and members from all sides of the House. Instead, in the heart of the pandemic and of dealing with some of these most crucial issues, the Conservatives chose to be obstructionist and chose to just attack and “own” the Liberals at every stage of this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170901">When I sit here and see the opposition day motion that we have in front of us, it brings me back to those days, remembering what the Conservatives actually brought to the debate and brought to our country during one of the most challenging times that I think many generations will see. I am reminded of those days when I had the opportunity to serve our government in that role. I remember the Conservatives screaming and shouting, saying that we need to close the borders, that we need stricter mandates and that we need all of these things, and then, when we do those things, they scream and say to get rid of mandates and get rid of masks. At no point did they ever base it on science, facts or evidence. They based it only on “owning” the Liberals. If they had any ability to actually govern in this country, Canada would be in serious trouble, because their policy playbook is simply the opposite of the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170902">The members continue to heckle me because they cannot stand a member standing on this side of the House “owning” them, and that is precisely what—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170921">Madam Speaker, that is not a problem. I will not use things that excite the members, when they are unable to control their emotions in this House. I will move on to the rest of the point, because I clearly upset the members opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170922">What I will speak about is simply the fact that the Conservatives have not based policy decisions in this House on experts, on science or on the testimony we heard at the health committee, when I was a member of that committee. We stand here today and members opposite talk about listening to the science. Time and again we heard experts. Our chief public health officer, Dr. Tam, was personally attacked by Conservatives when they disagreed with her expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170923">I find it a bit rich to stand in this place and to hear the Conservatives say, “Bring out the experts; bring out the testimony.” When we do that, when we table that information, when we have witnesses at committee, when we have reports and when we have that expert testimony, the Conservatives make personal attacks against our chief public health officer. I notice that the heckles went silent, because the Conservative members know it is true, that there are those on their benches who made personal attacks against public health officials who disagreed with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170924">In addition to that, we talk about the mandates or any protections across the country throughout the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, we constantly said that there is no silver bullet and that vaccines are the safest, most effective way for us to get through this pandemic, but there are also layers of protection, and that is crucially important. Those layers of protection are going to help prevent people from getting severely ill and clogging up our emergency rooms and hospitals, and that is what the Conservatives do not understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170925">There are layers of protection, not only to protect the most vulnerable, but to protect businesses by not having to enter lockdowns. If we remove every layer of protection throughout this pandemic and businesses have to close, where would the Conservatives be to defend and support those businesses? I know Conservatives did not support them when we moved measures in the budget and in Bill <Document DbId="11496808" Type="3">C-8</Document>. They voted against the supports those businesses needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170926">We put in place layers of protection to help ensure, as the pandemic unfortunately is not over and COVID is still around, that we protect society, protect individuals, protect businesses, and protect our health care workers and our health care system. These are the very people those members call heroes and then attack at committee and try to discredit on social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170927">I find that, while the Conservatives might try to position or package some of their motion to act like they are on the side of people, throughout this pandemic they have flip-flopped consistently whenever they felt the political mood suited them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170928">I turn to some of the comments I heard in this place earlier that accused the government of simply trying to punish people who have differences of opinion or who want the freedom to have a different view on things. I find this incredibly rich, considering what we all saw last night. Among the Conservative benches, they do not have the freedom to listen to science, and they do not have the freedom to speak out and have their own opinions. I heard heckles yesterday when members of our side voted in a free vote. The Conservatives criticized our members for having free votes, yet yesterday the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> rightly pointed out the dangers the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> was spreading about our democracy and the independence of the Governor of the Bank of Canada. What happened to the member for Abbotsford? He got the boot.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170929">When it comes to Conservatives, the only freedom of choice they have is to listen to whatever leader happens to be running the show at the time. Therefore, it is really hard to take the Conservatives seriously when they talk about mandates, the health and safety of Canadians, and freedoms, when the Conservative benches do not even have freedom of opinion or freedom of speech. Frankly, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> spoke truth to power, and he got booted to the backbench.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170930">It is really hard to sit here and listen to Conservatives try to defend the health and safety of Canadians when they themselves are not open to listening to experts and scientists or understanding the layers of protection in place to help keep Canadians safe, keep businesses open and keep travel available. They speak about restrictions around the world, but Canadians going even to the U.S. still require testing. There are protections there. There is nothing wrong with the Canadian government doing everything in our power to ensure that there are no lockdowns in this country, that businesses can stay open, that Canadians can remain safe and that our health care heroes can have the ability to keep our health care system functioning well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170931">The key here is that, if we truly believe in freedom and supporting Canadians across this country, then we should not be listening to the Conservatives, who block freedom of speech and ignore when their own members speak truth to power.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170946">I have had the misfortune of listening to this debate for the past hour and a bit. When I use the term “misfortune”, it is because of the absolute opacity of the government. It refuses to answer even the simplest of questions during debate. Liberal members give speeches where they are obsessed with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, when we are supposed to be discussing the very serious issue of chaos at airports and the restrictions that are in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170947">Rather than talk about that, the Liberals are going on long diatribes about independence, other members and leadership matters. I think we have to ask ourselves why. If they cannot talk about the subject matter before us, it is probably because they have almost nothing to say. That is the absolute problem with the government and these members participating in the debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170948"> Why are we here? Day after day, questions are asked about when the mandates will end, and what circumstances are needed in order to do that. These are not ridiculous partisan attacks, as the members across seem to suggest. I did not know they were so fragile that a direct question would be seen as a terrible partisan attack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170949">We keep coming back and asking reasonable questions. We brought forward a motion ages ago, just asking what conditions, metrics or benchmarks the country had to hit so restrictions could be removed. This is not asking for them to be removed. It is asking what the benchmarks are and what Canadians could look to. The Liberals would not even vote for that. The government cannot do anything reasonable with respect to things like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170950">When we ask questions, we get answers like the one from the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, who said that travellers are out of practice and that is why the airports are backed up. Actually, that is, unfortunately, probably the best answer we have had from a minister or a member of the government with respect to what is going on, because at least it was an answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170951">We have questions, real questions, the questions Canadians are asking. I know these members get the same emails from Canadians. They cannot live in some strange Liberal bubble where everyone thinks things are perfect. They must get questions about what is happening at the airports and what are they going to do to fix it. I know I get them. I bet the Speaker is getting them as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170952">We put forward a motion like this to say that Canadians have had enough, that they want to see some action. They want something done. We would expect a reasonably serious response. However, for some reason, Canadians are not entitled to that. When we are here, we are the voice of not only our constituents, but also of other Canadians as well. These are the serious questions that are being asked. It is so insulting to them.

              <ParaText id="7170955"> That is fine. If the Liberals do not want to say to Canadians that they are sorry they are going through this, then that is on them. However, Canadians deserve an explanation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7170956">The Liberals must have meetings. They must be talking to experts, because they say, “We follow the experts' advice.” How hard is it? Throw Canadians a bone. They could give us a scrap of information, or maybe put a tenth of the report on the table so that we can see that there actually is a report, but they will not. If they will not do it, we have to ask ourselves why, right? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170957">When a child goes to school and says, “The dog ate my homework”, the teacher asks, “Show me the shredded pieces and then I will believe you.” That is what these guys are doing all the time.

              <ParaText id="7170958">Canadians are frustrated. There are a lot of Canadians who cannot travel. I do not know if members have heard the stories, but I certainly have in my riding about people who cannot travel and miss all kinds of things. The Liberals might say, “Well, get in a car.” However, an 80-year-old unvaccinated woman from my riding cannot drive 1,800 to 3,000 kilometres to B.C. The Liberals' answer is: “We do not care. We refuse to give any information on when that person is going to be able to travel. We refuse to give any information as to why we are saying that person will not be able to travel. We refuse to give any information as to when that person can travel.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170959">It is as though we are asking for the most unreasonable, unrealistic things. That is how the Liberals paint the debate. They cannot answer the debate directly. They cannot answer the debate forthrightly. If they really wanted to debate this issue, they would put their advice on the table so that we could all see it and debate it like adults, but they do not want to. They would rather give speeches talking about the former shadow minister for finance. They want to talk about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, because that is so pertinent to the debate. It is so childish and insulting to Canadians who are asking the very serious questions that we are raising in this motion to have members over there treat them with so much disdain and disrespect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170960">I cannot believe it. Canadians who are unable to travel, unable to visit family and relatives, are watching this debate and listening to the kinds of speeches that these people are putting out, joking and laughing about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. It is beyond shameful. It is embarrassing, and they should be embarrassed for participating that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170961">We want things to move forward for Canadians. We want answers. We tried for a motion to ask the Liberals to put the benchmarks out for everyone to see: When we get to this, we will do this, and when we get to that, we will do that. The Liberals voted down the motion, unfortunately, with help from the NDP. We had a wonderful NDP member asking some great questions, but they voted down that motion as well, and I am disappointed about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170962">We have to ask ourselves: Why will the Liberals not do any of these things? It is probably because they have not set that plan out, because this is a government that cannot do more than one thing, as we have learned. They sort of stumble from one crisis to another. We choose to joke and say: “You cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.” That is kind of what we have happening here.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7170984">Madam Speaker, today I rise to support this motion and add my constituents' voices to the growing concern about the legacy of Liberal-made backlogs. Canada faces massive delays for passports, veterans and seniors’ services, and 2.1 million people are stuck in the IRCC’s backlog. Now, we are seeing the same backlogs happening at airports due to inconsistent policies by the Liberal government. If there is one thing the Liberal government is good at, it is making everyone miserable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170985"> The government's biggest example of mismanagement is the mess in our immigration system. This is just an example that I will use to lead to the mismanagement happening at the airports. People looking to come to this country face growing processing times and absolutely no communication. Their applications disappear into a great bureaucratic black hole, along with their emails and phone calls. Newcomers can end up stuck waiting for months, if not years, to have their cases processed. As a result, families are left separated from their loved ones and refugees are left stranded in the hands of the Taliban. This is the reality that backlogs impose on real people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170986"> Our country faces a labour shortage crisis and there is a real need for new immigrants to help fill these gaps, yet instead of taking action the government has economic-class newcomers waiting in limbo. The economic-class backlog stands at over 235,000 people. That is 235,000 lives that are now on hold: workers who are unable to contribute to Canada’s economy and families who do not know if they will have a future here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170987"> For families of new Canadians, family sponsorship is also a nightmare. The backlog there now stands at almost 109,000. That means families remain separated, their mental health suffers and divorce and suicide rates are going up. I imagine all MPs' offices hear about these cases every single day, as mine does. I speak to constituents who tell me they do not know when they will see their spouses or children. They do not know how to go on, and it is heartbreaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170988">Backlogs are also hurting Canadian businesses and our economy. Employers and businesses share with me that the work permit and temporary foreign worker situation in Canada is alarming. My office heard from a small business owner in northern Ontario. She cannot get workers, and is now relying on one person on a work permit to help her husband run their mechanic shop. In tears, she explained that her last employee has been unable to renew his work permit because of this Liberal-made backlog. Most likely, he will lose status and have to leave. She told me that she would have to close her shop because it is impossible to quickly get LMIAs and work permits. The hospitality and tourism sector are other industries hit hard by this backlog, but if no one can travel or afford to go on vacation, I guess the government does not really care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170989">Inflation is now at 6.8%, which is a new 31-year high, yet as inflation for food grew by the largest increase since 1981, and shelter and fuel inflation increased by 22% and 64%, respectively, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his<Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4"> finance minister </Affiliation> ignored Canadians' pain. Experts warn that inflation will continue to rise while wages barely grow and fall way behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170990"> If inflation was not enough, the government went ahead and increased the carbon tax yet again. That is after years of kicking the energy industry when it was down and hating on it when it made gains. Those negative effects on the oil and gas sector directly affect our ability to afford groceries and home heating, or to drive ourselves to work; that is, if a person even has a job. The government’s unscientific and vindictive COVID policy has made millions of Canadians second-class citizens. That includes public sector employees and workers in federally regulated industries. For people exercising their freedom to make their own medical decisions, the government will take away the right to work, travel and be an everyday Canadian. Not only is it not enough for the government to make everyone’s life miserable economically, but it is also discriminating against our fellow Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170991">For those who can travel, the misery does not end. If Canadians planned on getting away from the high inflation and division of the Liberals, they apparently should have planned that back when they first got their passport. For some reason, the government could not figure out that if someone got a five-year passport five years ago, they would need to renew it now. After two years of lockdowns, it is no surprise that Canadians would want to travel and get away from the mess these Liberals have created, but they have even made that hard to do. The fact that, in 2022, someone must line up for three or more days or pay hundreds of dollars for someone else to stand in line to get essential government services is ridiculous. What choice do people have? The hotline has gone cold and people cannot get through to a human who can answer their questions or provide status updates. The website tells people to call, so the only option is to stand in line.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7170992"> Like in the immigration system, people's applications for passports are now disappearing into the system. They cannot even get an estimated time when the government will send their passport back to them. Canadians are paying higher fees and extra payments to expedite applications, but then nothing happens. This should not be the way it works. Instead of letting public sector workers come back to the office, the government's solution is to throw more money at the problem and promise to hire more workers. It makes for a nice announcement, but we have seen what this promise has done in IRCC; the backlog has only grown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170993">The reality is that the Liberals have both failed to plan and planned to fail. After keeping public service employees at home and putting unvaccinated workers on leave, the government failed to prepare for the influx of travellers and passport requests. Now we see that failure impacting the lineups at airports. The out-of-date mandates and COVID policies are forcing significant delays. The ArriveCAN app, random testing and other protocols mean customs services have become so backed up that there is not enough capacity at some airports to accommodate the lineups. That is leaving passengers stuck on planes on the tarmac, because they have nowhere else to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170994">Before the pandemic, CATSA had 7,400 employees and now, even after bringing back its staff, it has only 6,500 employees. Airports are also facing staffing shortages because of the mandates. This is at a time when the air travel and tourism industries in Canada usually reach their busiest season. Instead of working with the industry and addressing the real issues, the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> would rather blame passengers. People are sick of the long lines and never-ending flight delays, and of the Liberals blaming them for the government's failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170995"> Even airports and airlines are calling for eliminating out-of-date, unscientific restrictions on travellers. The EU, the U.K. and lots of other countries worldwide, many with lower vaccination levels than Canada, have scrapped the mandates. In these countries, families can reunite with their loved ones, people can work without government discrimination, and travel is not the chaotic mess that we see here in Canada. As the Liberals continue to discriminate, divide and promote fear, Canada, our economy and Canadians are the ones that suffer. The government seems to want to make as many people miserable as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170996">We still face an immigration system unable to meet our labour demands, let families reunite or even get our friends and allies out of war zones. The financial situation for Canadians is devastating, and inflation and affordability have hit a crisis point. Our travel and tourism sectors are in chaos. Passports are impossible to get, and lineups and delays at airports are never-ending. This is the result of a government that is failing to plan and planning to fail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7170997">The COVID-19 pandemic affected all of us, but we now need an approach that will fix this disaster for all Canadians. We have an opportunity today to support this motion and show our support for the people of this country. I ask my colleagues in the other parties to do the right thing and join the official opposition in calling on the government to revert to prepandemic rules and service standards and to begin the process of cleaning up its mess, ending the misery for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171050">Mr. Speaker, inflation is not like the weather. It is not something that just happens like a snowstorm in May. The inflation that Canadians are suffering from today is a direct result of the deficits the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> racked up, bankrolled by the money printing of the Bank of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171051">When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ran out out of other people's money to borrow, he turned to the bank, and the governor was only too happy to oblige. The Bank of Canada created over $400 billion in brand new money to purchase the government bonds to pay for the out-of-control Liberal spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171052">Any time we get more dollars chasing fewer goods, we get inflation. The decision to bankroll the government's deficit spending undermined the bank's independence. It has one main mandate: to keep inflation at 2%. It has completely failed and Canadians are right to demand accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171053">To restore the bank's independence, the leadership at the bank needs to stop acting like it is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal ATM. As Milton Friedman said, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. We cannot expect the Prime Minister to know that. He brags that he does not even think about monetary policy.</ParaText>

The Chair ruled that the Board of Internal Economy was seized with the matter, so it was better placed to address the allegations. Since then, the board has held eight meetings, but there have been no reports, no consequences, no investigations and no news whatsoever.</ParaText>

As he may know, the board is required by law to discuss employment and legal matters in private, so I cannot say what, if anything, has been decided or discussed at those eight meetings. I would note, though, that the board's July minutes, which have been tabled in the House, indicate that my predecessor asked for an internal review but that the board did not approve. Of course, my friend is experienced and savvy about Parliament and would know that the board works on a consensus basis, so if any single political party were to veto taking action on the allegations of Liberal partisanship, there would be no board action or decision to report.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171348">Mr. Speaker, that is a tall order to follow. Before I get into talking about the motion at hand, I want to take a moment to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278588" Type="2">Mississauga—Lakeshore</Affiliation> for his service in this place. I am confident that his community is better for it, and definitely our country is better for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171349">It took me down memory lane when he was talking about immigrating from Germany and his parents telling him and his siblings that they were coming to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171350">I had a similar experience when my family and I were immigrating to Canada. My parents came in one day and said that we were moving to Canada. As I was a teenager at the time, that was obviously big, life-changing news. We probably did not understand the full impact of it, but it was one of the best decisions that my parents made for my siblings and me. Living in this great country definitely changed our lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171351">I want to come back to this motion and speak about it. I think it is an important conversation that we are having in the House around the impact of the pandemic that we all have faced in our lives. Now that we are getting, hopefully, to the tail end of the pandemic, there are questions around how we get back to resuming our lives. As for all of the different functions that the government performs and that we had done before the pandemic, how do we get them to a normal place, as they were before?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171352">I think it is important to note, and it is important to remind all of us, that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. I often hear debate in the House and it sometimes feels as if we have forgotten that the pandemic is not yet over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171353">We still do not have complete control over this disease. This virus has taken countless innocent lives from us, not only here in Canada but around the world. I believe that the number is about a million or so. I may be understating it, but it is a large number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171354">We are still in the midst of this global pandemic, so we have to be mindful about that particular important fact and be able to work together, not only as parliamentarians but also as members of the society of citizens of Canada, to put an end to this pandemic. That is why our government here in Canada, federally, and the provincial and territorial governments, in line with global governments around the world, took the important steps they took over two years ago to control the spread of this highly transmissible disease: the coronavirus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171355">As a result, we all recall, our entire system got shut down. It had to be done overnight. Nobody did that because that was what they wanted to do. Nobody did that because it was part of some grand conspiracy, which some people out there believe but is absolutely false. It was done so that we could protect lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171356">Members can just imagine for a moment if those important steps had not been taken to shut down our airports, to limit travel and to make sure we worked from home as opposed to going into large, congregating settings. Members can imagine how many more lives would have been lost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171357">All of those steps, and all of those precautions, were taken on the advice of public health officials so that we could protect each other. There is nothing more valuable, as we know, than human life. That is why we all took those steps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171358">Thanks to our scientists here in Canada and around the world, and how quickly they worked to develop a vaccine that could then help us immunize ourselves from COVID-19, which is another remarkable achievement, a vaccine was created in a very short period of time. It got tested. It was proved that it actually saves lives. There was a massive effort here in Canada, which is ongoing around the world, to vaccinate ourselves so that we could fight this virus as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171359">Can members imagine if that had not happened? How many lives have been saved because Canadians really stepped up and got vaccinated with both shots? The number for the booster shots is continually rising. Hopefully, more Canadians will get their third shot, as I have, and I am sure many members of the House have. That is being done so we can protect lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171360">The question now is what do we do next? Perhaps that is the essence of this motion we are debating today as we are hopefully at the tail end of this pandemic. We have to continue to listen to the advice of public health experts, who are telling us that we cannot rush to lift the mandates when it comes to requiring people to get vaccinated, to wear masks or to make sure they keep a proper distance.</ParaText>

I again remind hon. members in this place that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Just because we wish for it to be over, and I am sure everyone wishes that, including me, it is not done yet. We are not fully immune to COVID‑19, and we need to continue to work hard because it is about saving lives. This is not about politics or ideology: it is simply and purely about saving lives. We have to do everything in our capacity. That is what compassionate societies such as ours do to save lives. Therefore, let us make sure that the mandates with respect to travelling and vaccinations are maintained until we feel comfortable that we are all protected.</ParaText>

It is interesting that the Liberals who sit here with their masks on during the debates in the House of Commons are the same Liberals who go to receptions all over downtown Ottawa with their masks off, where there are hundreds of people. I would ask my colleague across the way why it is the Liberals wear their masks in the House of Commons, but not when they go to receptions such as the Sir John A. Macdonald one last night? If they are concerned about their safety and the safety of others, why is it okay for them to not worry about wearing their masks in public when they are not on Parliament Hill? </ParaText>

In fact, when my two young children go to school, they wear masks, even though they are not required to. They know better. They are six and 10 years old, and they continue to wear their masks. I do not even have to remind them and they do so because they want to protect themselves, but most importantly, they want to protect others. Do members know who my children talk about protecting?

              <ParaText id="7171393">I guess what I am saying is that when people are in a rush to catch their flight, they use their NEXUS card and go through security, but they go through the exact same security process as everybody else. In the U.S., people have a preferred traveller status, so when they go to the U.S. and they have their NEXUS card or a global entry card, they get into a separate line. They put their luggage on the rack, put their jacket on the rack, although they do not necessarily have to take their jacket off, it gets pushed through and away they go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171394"> People do not have to take their liquids out of their one-litre Ziploc bag and put them into a Toronto-approved Ziploc bag. They do not have to take their shoes off. They do not have to take their belt off. They do not have to take their computer out. They do not have to do any of those things, because they have already gone through the security screening process up front. They are not viewed as a threat. It is just like every time people apply for a NEXUS card, which is also a global entry card in the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171395">Here is an example of what the government could do right now with labour shortages. It could have a specific line for those members, because they are not a risk. They are zero threat. Why would we not take the best practices out of the U.S. and apply them here in Canada to speed up the line? If we speed up that line, we could give more resources to the other lines that are lacking resources at this point in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171396"> In Saskatoon, as I said, when people go through the screening, first of all, they take their jacket off, they take their belt off, they take everything out of their pockets, they take their computer out, they take the liquids out and put them into the one-litre bag they have to use, and then they go through the screening. Then, they get to the secondary screening. There is one thing we are noticing in the airports. For example, in Toronto, with the new system, I call it the scatter system. People go into a line, right next to four other people, and they put their stuff into their bucket. The bucket goes, and then another person's bucket goes, and another. There is actually four to five times more secondary screening in that process because of how it is going through the system. More people are waiting for their bags at the other end, and they are all scattered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171397">How is this becoming more efficient and faster? How can this work when people are bumping into each other and going around each other trying to figure out where their luggage is, where their bags are, where their shoes are, where their belt is and trying to keep their pants up while they are doing it? It is craziness at its greatest. We see that here in the Ottawa airport over and over again. There are some little things that could be changed to make this a lot smoother and a lot more efficient, if the Liberals wanted to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171398">I mentioned the NEXUS card. I go to the gate. I go to board the plane, and I show my NEXUS card. The Air Canada agent says, “Wait a minute, that is an expired NEXUS card.” Yes, I know it has expired. I was told I could use an expired NEXUS card. The agent says I cannot use it for ID. I say that is fair enough and go to apply to renew my NEXUS card. I did it two years ago, and I am still waiting for that interview. I have been online checking to see where I could get an interview done in Canada. I cannot. I live in the Prairies, just north of Saskatoon. Before COVID, I had to go to Calgary or Winnipeg, and now, after COVID, they are saying I would have to go to Buffalo or New York in order to get the interview to get my NEXUS card renewed. Does that make sense? Is that proper planning, knowing that we are going to come out of the pandemic at some point in time? Why is it that way?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171399">Coming through the airport, I have seen lots of things, looking at the way things have been operating. I saw one of the more horrific scenes when I was coming in through Montreal. I walked through Montreal airport and looked at the lineups, and they were outside the door, not a line straight outside the door, but weaving back and forth, going around the counters and out the door, to get through security. I asked the security guard what was going on and why it was that way. He said that some of the workers were unvaccinated so they got fired and could not work, some of the workers were laid off and have not been rehired, and the workers who were there were getting so stressed that they were not showing up for work. They are being overworked. He said they are finding it frustrating. They are tired of people yelling at them, because people are at their wits' end by the time they get to the security screening process. I can understand why they are frustrated and why it is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171400">People get through that process, and then they get through secondary screening. I was at the gate at 9:30 at night, waiting for my flight at 10:30, and I saw these four ladies running to beat the devil. They were sweating and they were upset, because they had just found out their flight had gone without them. The door had just closed. In fact, they were looking out the window at that plane. They were trying to get back to Toronto to their family on a Sunday night. They could not spend the night. One lady said out loud that she was a diabetic and she did not have any more insulin with her for the evening. They had spent four hours in the lineup. They took it out on that poor agent. They were mad, and rightly so. They were yelling and screaming and demanding action. What could he do? The plane had left. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171401"> The reality is that the fault lies with the government. It lies right at the Liberals' feet and it lies at their feet in so many aspects of what is going on right now. The government cannot be proactive on anything. It will not react until the crisis hits such a level that it is forced to react. We knew this was coming. We knew that Canadians were going to start travelling again. There is no question about that. The airlines knew that. If the airlines had been given a bankable schedule, they could have scaled up accordingly. They are doing the best they can to accommodate the number of people who want to travel again. Now the bottleneck is our airports, our airport security and the processes that we have to go through in order to board that plane.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171402">The Liberals could have preplanned that. For example, on passports, the Liberals could have said, “We have a lot of people who have 10-year passports coming up for renewal. Maybe we should start approving and processing passports.” They could have said that a year ago. Maybe they should have had things in place so they would not get bottle-jammed right until now and try to do it all at once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171403">When I hear people tell me that they get faster service if they go through their Liberal MP's office than they do through a Conservative MP's office, I get very concerned because that should not happen. I have heard of two instances of that happening now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171404">When I look at that, I think that if they had planned properly, they could have avoided that. If they had properly planned for NEXUS cards being renewed, they could have avoided people not having interviews and waiting and waiting for their interviews. If they had properly planned for bringing the airports back into service, we would not have seen the lineups we have in place today. CBSA would have been able to start hiring and training people sooner if the Liberals had a proper plan. These people do not plan. When they do not plan, what do they get? They get failure, and that is what the government has produced time after time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171405">What can the Liberals do now? They say they are protecting Canadians and they are following the science. They say it is very important to follow the science, and they think they are doing everything right to protect Canadians, which is fair enough. The Saskatchewan public health officer does the same thing. It is the same with the person in Quebec, in Alberta, in Ontario and in B.C. They are following the science, and they are actually being transparent with the science. They are saying that based on the science they can do this and they are allowed to open it up to this level or that level. We have seen that just lately in Quebec, where they made decisions based on what their needs were to reopen their economy accordingly. It was transparent. People knew what was going on, when it was going to happen and why it was going to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171406"> The government will not give us a plan. Not only that, it will not give us the dataset or the points it is using to make the decisions it is making. Then the Liberals wonder why people are suspicious. They wonder why people do not trust them. All they need to do is show some transparency, which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in 2015, said he would show an abundance of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171407">With this issue, when it is health-related, why would the government not have transparency? What is the reason the Liberals want to hold back the dataset they are using to make their decisions? There should be no reason. They should be able to do that without any type of qualms. If they showed the dataset and said, “Here is the justification. This is why we have to do what we are doing today”, and showed the science to back that, we probably would not be having this debate today, but they are not. The hypocrisy is that the Liberals are saying that the science says we need to do all this stuff, yet they are letting everything go back to normal and they are not following with it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171408">Yes, we needed to have lockdowns. I can remember being in the Toronto airport in November of last year, I think, and looking down the hallways. I could have said my name and it would have been echoing through the hallways because there was nobody there. There was nobody travelling. Let us also keep in mind what we did not have then. We did not have any therapeutic treatments. We did not have vaccinations. We did not know what we know today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171409">There are lots of things the government can do. I will end it there and I look forward to the questions.</ParaText>

If people have already gone through the NEXUS process and done their pre-screening beforehand, the chance that they are a risk is very small, so why are we worried about the containers, the shoes, the belts, the jackets or the computers? If somebody had thought through that process, yes, they go through the full screening. </ParaText>

It is not the federal government; it is the provinces that manage health care.

              <ParaText id="7171421">Madam Speaker, just as with most problems in this country, Liberals are the cause. Over the past seven years, it feels like they have removed common sense from the dictionary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171422">They will try to deny it, and they will try to shift blame. They have blamed out-of-practice travellers for the delays, backlogs and travel-associated horror stories that we see coming out of Canadian airports right now, even for domestic flights. Certainly, their globally outdated mandates, red-tape-bundled policies and general lack of compassion is not at fault. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171423">They are vindictive. They are smug, and their leadership is power hungry. The government is the root of the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171424">If I have not been clear enough already, the rest of the world is moving past the pandemic. Even Canada's provinces have learned to live with COVID, but our federal government has not. This is no longer about safety. It definitely is not about common sense. It is about control. Once the Liberals took control, they did not know what to do with their new-found power, and Canadians have suffered long enough for their half-witted initiatives. It is way past time for Canada to return to prepandemic rules and service levels for travel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171425">Lack of staff is not an excuse. They have had plenty of time to plan for reopening, just like they have had years to plan for passport renewals, another thing the Liberals have dropped the ball on hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171426">I am hearing from many constituents about the delays they are experiencing at the passport office, how people wait for hours in line to get to the door just to be told to go home. They then phone, and the phones ring and ring, but they never get answered. I am also being told that Passport Canada is no longer accepting electronic documents and is telling people to go to their MP's office to print the documents. Where is the common sense in that? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171427">It gets worse. It gets a lot worse, and I wonder who or what the government will blame next for the mistakes this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171428">The provinces have dropped their mask mandates, yet federal buildings still require people to wear a mask regardless. People wait in those long lines at passport offices, sometimes for hours, get to the door and then they find out that they are required to wear a mask in order to get service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171429">When they get inside to find out they need a mask, the federal offices have none to give them and there are none to be found. What is a person supposed to do? People are sharing masks. Multiple people, strangers, are using the same mask because the government refused to have a plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171430">I am no doctor, but I am pretty sure that wearing a used mask from someone else is far worse than not wearing a mask at all. It seems like the Liberals prefer to have conflicting, arbitrary rules that cause outrage and confuse people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171431">Do people want more proof of Liberal political theatrics? The drama teacher in charge is ready to act stern and frighten Canadians into compliance. Afterward, when the cameras are all turned off, he is happy to rip off his mask, smile, socialize and jet set around the world just as though restrictions no longer exist. There is one set of rules for the people in power, and one set of rules for the rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171432">The rules are different for people like Julie from my riding. She did the responsible thing. She applied for her family's passports months in advance of their trip, but since then, Service Canada has delayed responding to her inquiries, sent her for new passport photos multiple times and told her that she needs to pay $95 per person just to speed up processing times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171433">The government is using backlogs caused by its own incompetence to extort Canadians who played by the rules. It is simply shameful and unbelievable, and again, there is no common sense. If members thought that passports was a wild ride, it gets far worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171434">Let us take a look at what the Liberals have been doing to boaters. Southwestern Ontario is bordered by the Great Lakes, and my riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex sits on the beautiful southern shores of Lake Huron. Other parts of my riding are along the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171435">As boating season starts, boaters are wanting to go across the river to Michigan. Before the pandemic, the number of small vessel reporting sites was 400. That number has now been cut to 84. As boating season opens up, boaters will have to travel out of their way to report their vessel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171436">Do members not believe me? Constituents like John have written to me to say that, instead of taking their boat across an 800-metre wide river to get to and from my riding and Michigan, the CBSA wants them to reroute for 76 kilometres round trip just to check in. This is ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171437">John has calculated that it would cost him over $1,200 per trip just to meet this requirement. He has even calculated that this will create an extra 1,140 kilograms of carbon emissions just for one trip for him. The hypocrisy is that the government is pretending to care about the environment and Canadians but, in practice, it is needlessly adding emissions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171438">I just found out, minutes ago, that the government actually announced that it is going to reopen those reporting sites, but that is only after Conservatives pushed it for common sense and to lift these restrictions from the boaters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171439">Federal restrictions are being made and enforced without common sense. These mandates unfairly punish Canadians, and the government is giving no indication that it will ease off any time soon. It has consistently missed the mark on marine travel, from Walpole Algonac Ferry in my riding, which was shut down due to marine transportation not being included in cross-border travel exemptions earlier this year, to those recreational boaters who are not going to have points of access entry this spring. Canadians are being left behind. Continuing temporary closures for over two years is unnecessary, costly and irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171440">When I previously asked the <Affiliation DbId="271245" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> if they will allow CBSA's regular points of entry to be reopened, he laughed. I will spell that out again: Liberal ministers are laughing at the pain they are causing Canadians. They are taking joy in the prospect of crippled tourism and empty rural small town shops during what would normally be a busy season and the busiest time of the year, which will hurt small businesses in communities such as Mitchell's Bay, Port Lambton, and Wallaceburg. This is not a joke.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171441">The behaviour displayed by these ministers was despicable and very telling of how little a priority the concerns of my constituents are to the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171442">Did members know that Canada is the only country in the world where non-vaccinated people are not allowed to travel domestically? Let that sink in. That is not okay. Requiring a type of passport for Canadians to travel domestically, creating second-class citizens, needs to end. The government is going out of its way to punish fully vaccinated travellers, no matter if they cross by land, sea or air.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171443">I have had personal experience with this when waiting in line for security at airports, watching people struggle with delays and fighting the mandatory use of the barely functioning ArriveCAN app, something that the government insists on using. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171444">Remember how I mentioned earlier how it would only take paper documents? Well, now it wants an app, something that is totally digital, which is another decision that spits in the face of common sense-loving Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171445">Liberals refuse to compromise. They will not give people the choice to use paper or electronic documents. That would make too much sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171446">At the land border crossings, what is happening late in the evening? Well, there is one overworked stall that is still open. Americans do not know about the ArriveCAN app when they are crossing and the requirement to use it. The government has failed to explain to them and to advertise to would-be border crossers of this requirement. This makes for frustration and delays for tourists coming to support our economy and for Canadians returning home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171447">For example, I spoke with a senior couple in my riding who are fed up with how little is being done to help them. They are in their 80s, and they are very cautious. They care about the rules, and they want to try to follow them. They asked their son for help to buy a phone, their very first smart phone, something that they were forced to buy, because they were excited to resume day trips across the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171448">When they put the ArriveCAN app on, it was not working and they did not know what to do. They told me that they took time and drove down to the store to see if the young clerk could help them. Unfortunately, though, they all tried, and it still did not work. They returned their new phone, they shelved their excitement and returned home wondering why the government would make visiting loved ones for a day so hard for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171449">I know that Conservatives are asking for the Liberal government to do something that is very difficult for them, which is to finally adopt some common sense and listen to Canadians instead of to themselves. People want their lives back and one way to start giving them this is to return to prepandemic rules and service levels for travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171450">Everything the government touches is an absolute failure. On behalf of all Canadians disappointed with how their plans are being ruined, I will ask this: If Canadians do not have a smart phone, can they get a smart government, or at least one with common sense?</ParaText>

I am sure Canadians would like to see that information to know if they are hiding something from Canadians and from our public health officers in the provinces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171466">I found that last comment about a leadership crisis to be quite amusing coming from Conservatives, given what is going on in their party right now. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> tried to speak his truth to power yesterday, he was silenced by the individual who is not even the leader yet.</ParaText>

If there is a leadership crisis, I think it is very clear to Canadians where it exists right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171468">I have been listening to this debate throughout the day, and I have found a number of comments to be quite interesting. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> had an exchange I found very interesting. He went on about listening to science and making sure we listen to science, because listening to the science will point us in a certain direction. Then, I asked him where the science was in the Conservatives' motion. They introduced this motion today that asks the government to change a particular policy. Where is the science in that? Do members know what his response to that was? It was that the Conservatives are not the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171469">Apparently, according to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, people can try to influence policy if they are Conservatives, because they happen to be in opposition. It does not require any science to do it. When people are in the government, they need to be taking the Conservatives' version of science, which they do not even have.

As a matter of fact, that member answered a question today in question period. It was completely unorthodox, but nonetheless it happened anyway. Why was the question not to the member from BOIE, his very own member, about this issue?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171475">A rule was made that until this session was complete, masks were required to be worn in the House unless members were standing in the House speaking. If the member for <Affiliation DbId="278501" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation> has a problem with that, I suggest he take it up with his leadership on BOIE who helped to make that decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171476">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278200" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> recently said, about wearing masks, that he forgot his mask and had to go back to his truck and get a mask for the airport. He said it as if we are the only place on earth that requires people to wear a mask in an airport. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171477">What about the United States? On April 30, it extended the mask mandate in airports. It just happened. We have to do the same thing in the United States, but the member for <Affiliation DbId="278200" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> would make us believe, as a number of Conservatives have today, that somehow Canada is taking a completely foreign approach when it comes to dealing with this on an international basis, with people coming and going in and out of the country in particular. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171478">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> listed a number of countries that still have various mandates in place to keep protection for their citizens. I will not repeat those, because they are already on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171479">I also found something very interesting that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278200" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> said a few moments ago. When he was asked a question from the Bloc about listening to advice from the experts, he referred to Dr. Tam's recommendations, her professional medical advice, as her “suggestions”. Those are Dr. Tam's “suggestions”. Those were his words.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171480">This goes to a key point about how Conservatives treat science. They are ready to wrap themselves in the science, provided that it is science that backs up what they already believe. That is the problem. For the member for <Affiliation DbId="278200" Type="2">Prince Albert</Affiliation> to say those were Dr. Tam's “suggestions” basically passes her off as though she makes suggestions just like anybody else can. She is the Chief Medical Officer of Health for the country. She makes recommendations. She provides advice to the Government of Canada so it can inform itself on how to implement policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171481">There has been criticism after criticism, and I will pre-empt the question by answering it now from members from the opposite side who are saying, “Table it, table it.” Can they tell me one time that Stephen Harper tabled recommendations to cabinet or the Privy Council? Can they tell me one time that Stephen Harper did that? The suggestion is that the government is taking advice from its professionals. The Conservatives want to frame this like it is being hidden from the public. It is very normal to receive advice and then make decisions based on that advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171482">I am sorry if the Conservatives are not privy to that. Guess what? I am not privy to it either. I am not in cabinet, so I have not seen the advice. I do have faith in those who are providing the advice, and that they will give their professional advice. We hire individuals in this country in many different forms, whether at the federal, provincial or municipal level, to advise policy makers based on their professional advice. It has been no secret from day one that the Conservatives have been willing to trample all over that advice, time after time. If they believe that they will get the slightest political gain out of it, they will walk over anybody. That is what they are trying to do here. That is exactly what they are trying to do here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171483">From my perspective, the best speech today was actually given by the Bloc member for <Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation>. His entire speech was on populism and the manner in which the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> is using populism for his own personal political gain, full stop. It does not matter what happens in the process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171484">I really encourage those who were not able to listen to the speech by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278335" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> earlier today to go back and listen to it. He hit the nail on the head with respect to what is happening in this country right now as it relates to the populist movement and those, like the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who are literally walking over top of the freedoms that they somehow want to make Canadians believe do not exist and that they are the only ones who will be able to provide those freedoms once again to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171485">It was actually a really good speech. It was extremely germane to the discussion. The reason is because this discussion today, in my opinion, is about why the Conservatives have continually used the same tactics day after day, trying to sow this idea of the government being the enemy and the only individuals in this country who can save Canadians and give them back their freedoms are Conservatives. It is so incredibly dangerous when we allow that kind of politics to dominate the discussion, and when we allow politics like that to shape the manner in which discussions are being had in public that are based on conspiracy theory and people peddling misinformation. That is exactly what is going on here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171486">I have no problem with voting against this motion today because I have faith in those who we have employed to provide advice to the government in order to make the best decisions possible on our behalf. I have no doubt that at times there is conflicting advice. It is the government's job, whatever government that may be, to receive that advice and make the best decision on behalf of people, and I have faith that is exactly what has been happening in Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171508">Madam Speaker, it is always a great privilege to rise and speak in the House of Commons, and in particular today on the opposition day motion from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>. I consider the member for Thornhill a friend. She is someone I have had the opportunity to get to know in the last few months, and I thank her for her work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171509">Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to put into context the role of government in our society, noting Adam Smith's work about what governments should and should not do. The first thing a government should do is protect the health and safety of its citizens. In fact, the most important role of government is to protect the health and safety of its citizens, whether it is through delivering the services of health care, ensuring that all people have health care and access to health care or ensuring that we have a proper defence system in place and are protected. Those are the fundamental duties of government, as is ensuring public safety. Those are the duties I look to in what a government's role is in society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171510">During the pandemic, our government has done a lot and continues to do a lot. As we say, our government has has the backs of Canadians. It has had the backs of Canadian workers, families and businesses as we have gone through the pandemic and as we are exiting it. I am proud of our government's record on many facets of the pandemic. I offer my prayers and condolences to the many Canadians who have unfortunately had loved ones pass away due to COVID-19. We must always remember what happened during that two-year period and what continues to happen, though maybe at a more gradual pace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171511">I am happy to participate in the debate today on the Conservative motion and to have the opportunity to discuss the government’s commitment and efforts to ensure the recovery of Canada’s tourism industry, including wait times at Canadian airports. Tourism is important to every region and every province. It is an inclusive industry, providing jobs and opportunities to newcomers, women, youth and indigenous people. These are specific groups that have experienced some of the worst impacts of this global pandemic. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171512">The tourism industry is the engine of family-owned and family-operated businesses in communities from coast to coast to coast. Virtually all tourism businesses, some 99% of them, are small businesses. They are the backbones of communities across all 338 ridings in this beautiful country we are blessed to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171513">The Government of Canada understands the important role that these businesses play in our communities. They are the lifeline of Canada’s economy and employ nearly two million people across the country. That is approximately 9% of our workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171514">We recognize that pandemic restrictions have placed an economic burden on businesses. Since day one of the pandemic, entrepreneurs have adapted and taken on the challenge of remaining viable. That is why the government introduced financial support for employees’ wages, subsidies for rent and loans to provide liquidity relief to ensure business survival through to the recovery period. As a result of the programs we put in place, tourism businesses across Canada are in a better position to recover.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171515">COVID-19 has impacted the tourism industry, its businesses and entrepreneurs in particular, as demand has been affected by the required public health restrictions. The government understands the impact on the tourism industry, and for that reason, it has put a number of targeted measures in place to help these businesses outlast the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171516">For the tourism, arts and culture sectors, businesses and non-profit organizations have received over $23 billion through federal emergency support programs. Budget 2021 introduced a three-year, $1-billion commitment for the sector. This included a $500-million tourism relief fund, which was created to help Canada’s tourism businesses not only survive but come back better. Of that, we earmarked a minimum of $50 million specifically to support indigenous tourism. It also included $100 million for Destination Canada marketing campaigns to help Canadians and other visitors discover and explore the country, $48 million of which is expected to be spent this fiscal year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171517">Last October, when the overall economy bounced back and general relief measures expired, the government introduced targeted wage and rent subsidy programs in Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document>, another bill the opposition party voted against, even though it was for supporting tourism businesses and their workers across the country. We have also invested $4 billion in the Canada digital adoption program, announced this month, which will help upwards of 160,000 small and medium-sized businesses to expand digital capabilities and adopt digital solutions. This is especially important in the tourism industry, where success hinges in part on the capacity to motivate visitors from around the globe. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171518">This year, budget 2022 proposes to provide $20 million over two years in support of a new indigenous tourism fund to help indigenous tourism recover from the pandemic and to position itself for long-term, sustainable growth. It also announced a commitment to develop a new federal tourism growth strategy focused on recovery, stability and long-term growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171519">The federal government will work with tourism businesses, provincial and territorial counterparts and indigenous tourism partners to plot such a course. On May 18, the Government of Canada launched the formal engagement period to develop this new strategy, and the government wants to hear from Canadian tourism stakeholders from coast to coast to coast as it charts the path forward for the sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171520">Furthermore, to help restore Canadians' confidence in the safety of air travel and to support the recovery of Canada’s air and tourism sectors, the government invested in COVID-19 sanitization and testing infrastructure at airports and in the development of advanced technologies to facilitate touchless and secure air travel. This April our government also lifted testing and quarantine requirements at international borders for fully vaccinated travellers, including for unvaccinated children under 12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171521">The health and well-being of all Canadians have always been the Government of Canada’s priority during the COVID-19 crisis. Canada’s continuing requirements are based on the latest and evolving scientific evidence. The government is committed to seeing the tourism industry thrive once again, and this funding has played a role in keeping businesses open during the past two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171522">Prior to the pandemic, tourism was a growing, high-potential sector that supported almost two million jobs across Canada. Last month, tourism gained almost 40,000 jobs. We are seeing the beginning of the recovery. We are moving in the right direction. With our high vaccination rates and the ebb of the omicron variant, we are confident that the summer 2022 tourism season will outpace that of summer 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171523">While there is no denying that the tourism sector has been deeply affected throughout the pandemic, I believe there is much built-up demand and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to come back stronger. As international travel reopens, tourists' pent-up desire to visit friends and family is being realized. I believe that in one week, two or three weeks ago, over one million arrivals and departures came through Canada's international airports, which is great to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171524">Canada has much to offer: wide open spaces, beautiful vistas, bucket-list adventures, welcoming people and authentic indigenous tourism experiences. These are the kinds of meaningful and sustainable experiences that today’s travellers, from both Canada and abroad, are craving. Canada also holds a strong appeal for those seeking to learn more about first nations, the Inuit and the Métis, and for those seeking an inclusive experience or a francophone language and cultural experience.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171525">Canada is also of great interest to people who want to learn more about first nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, and to those looking for an inclusive experience or a francophone linguistic and cultural experience.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7171526">We know that Canadians are currently experiencing long lines at airports, and we are working closely with our partners and CATSA to address the wait times and make sure the travel industry continues to bounce back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171527"> Canada has a huge advantage due to its high vaccination rates, and I encourage all Canadians to get their vaccines if they have not or to get their boosters. We are focused on health and safety, and with all governments in Canada working together collaboratively, we will make sure the rest of the world appreciates this advantage, sees Canada as a destination of choice, particularly in the coming summer months, and visits all parts of Canada from east to west, from B.C. to P.E.I. to Newfoundland and Labrador, and all the beautiful places in between that all 338 members of Parliament get to call home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171547">Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Conservative opposition motion calling on the Liberals to immediately lift remaining travel restrictions, which leaders in the tourism and hospitality sector and the airline industry say are harming business, damaging Canada's international reputation and resulting in chaos at our airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171548">Let me say that, while the government certainly needs to lift these travel-related restrictions, it frankly needs to lift all remaining federal mandates and restrictions, which are draconian, discriminatory and unscientific. They are mandates and restrictions that have hurt everyday, taxpaying, law-abiding Canadians and are hurting our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171549">Under the Liberals' watch, thousands of federally regulated employees were fired, not because they did not perform their job ably, but rather because they made a personal health choice. The Liberals can point to provinces that imposed similar mandates. Those provinces have lifted the mandates and rehired workers who were let go, but the federal Liberals have not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171550">There are 3.7 million Canadians who are landlocked, unable to leave the country and unable to travel freely within Canada, because they cannot get on a plane or a train, again, for having made a personal health choice. As it stands, Canada is the only country in the world, save perhaps for North Korea, where it is required to show one's vaccine status to get on a plane or train and travel internally. It is the only such country in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171551">To make matters worse, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has repeatedly demonized and stigmatized fellow Canadians for making a personal health choice.

What they provide is political rhetoric aimed at pitting Canadians against each other. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171555">It can be said that their policies are inconsistent with those of all 10 provinces and inconsistent with just about every country in the world. Just about every country in the world has lifted mandates and restrictions. The few that have not have set timelines to lift such restrictions, but not the federal Liberals. It begs the question: If the government is truly guided by science, why is its science so different from the science in every other jurisdiction in the world, not to mention all 10 provinces?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171556">The mandates and restrictions the government has imposed and is so invested in, for whatever reason, have not affected just unvaccinated Canadians; they have done great harm to the economy and to vaccinated Canadians.

              <ParaText id="7171557"> In recent weeks, we have seen many reports of passengers being stuck on the tarmac, on the airplane, unable to disembark because there is no room within the airport to properly process them. At Toronto Pearson, the Toronto Region Board of Trade reported that last week over 50% of passengers faced substantial delays. Just last Sunday, 120 planes were stuck on the tarmac at Pearson due to a backlog of the Liberal government's making. Pearson is hardly alone. These backlogs and delays are happening at border crossings and at airports right across the country.</ParaText>

He said that it is their fault. I say, respectfully, that the Minister of Transport ought to look in the mirror. The problem rests on his shoulders. It rests on the shoulders of this Liberal government and on what at best can be described as completely outdated COVID travel measures. Members should not take my word for it; they can take the word of key stakeholders, which I will cite momentarily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171559">I should note that these mandates have contributed to staffing shortages at airports. We have seen, here in Ottawa, staff levels at just a little over half of what is required to properly and efficiently run the Ottawa International Airport, the airport of our capital. We have seen estimates that there are about 30% fewer security personnel than there were prior to COVID, due to the government's lack of planning and due to the mandates that led to the firing of employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171560">Then these restrictions were added. The random testing and health questions that are put to travellers are estimated to quadruple processing times according to the Canadian Airports Council, and the minister says we should blame travelling Canadians. When we have staffing shortages and measures that are quadrupling processing times, it is pretty clear where the problem lies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171561">What about stakeholders? Monette Pasher, president of the Canadian Airports Council, has called on the Liberals to begin to lift these health restrictions, calling them cumbersome and contributing to the backlog.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171562"> Chris Bloore, president of the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario, has said that these measures, these health restrictions, are damaging Canada's international reputation and resulting in a loss of revenue for businesses that rely on tourists and international business travellers. That association has called on the government to lift these restrictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171563">Glenn Priestley, president and executive director of Northern Air Transport Association, has said that these mandates are slowing things down. We need to get them under control.</ParaText>

That is the root of the problem. That is precisely what we are asking the government to fix.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171588">Before getting to the heart of today's debate, and I may not get all my time because we are seeing some interference with that, I want to talk about an issue that happened in my riding of Edmonton West. My office is about a two-minute walk to one of the local Service Canada offices. Two months ago, and I brought this up in the House then, there was an issue when I went into the office to visit BDC. It shares the office with Service Canada. As I left, I noticed there was a lineup wrapping around the building.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171589">Two months ago, in Edmonton, as we can imagine, it is wintertime still, and the lineup wrapped around the building. I chatted with some of the people waiting in line. There was a gentleman who was 85 years old. There was a handicapped lady, an elderly handicapped lady, forced to wait outside. I asked her how long she had been waiting out there. She said, ”Well, several hours. They will not let us in.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171590">I went into the building and, of course, security was blocking me, but eventually they let me in. I asked, “What is going on here?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171591">They were told, under government orders, that they were only allowed four people in at a time. They had four security guards to ensure that only four Canadians at a time could access Service Canada, to access the services that Canadians are entitled to and pay for. I looked inside. One wicket was open to serve one person and three people sitting in the chairs in a very large office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171592">At the same time, provincial mandates had been lifted. At that time, across every province, except for Quebec, which was still halfway through, they had been lifted. We had hockey games with 17,000 people allowed in. We, at the same time, saw parties and receptions in Ottawa, with members of Parliament from the government and ministers attending crowded receptions, masks off, but in Canada, in Edmonton, we make an 85-year-old citizen wait for hours in line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171593">I brought it up to the House and the response, oddly enough, was from the <Affiliation DbId="278906" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, who responded to this by thanking the members of Service Canada for their hard work during the pandemic, which is great, but it does not address the fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171594">This was two months ago. About a week after that, one of my staff sent me a photo. It was of a blizzard in Edmonton, which not uncommon in March. It was a blizzard, and people, again, were waiting in line at Service Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171595">We have mask mandates in federal buildings. We can go into an airport masked. We can enter this building masked, but Canadians are not allowed into Service Canada, even masked or even vaccinated, because the government says it is unsafe for more than four Canadians to be inside. In a blizzard, there were close to 30 or 40 people lined up. They were waiting so long that one of the people actually ordered from DoorDash to be fed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171596">Can members imagine that happening in this country? We will not allow people in because it is not safe indoors. It is safe enough for a hockey game. It is safe enough, funnily enough, for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to meet with Her Majesty The Queen without a mask, but not safe for Canadians, even masked or vaccinated, to be indoors. This is why I say that the bill should be the “get the government's act together” bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171597">I realize my time is very short, but I want to read a couple letters and comments from constituents about their experiences. One reads, “I arrived outside Service Canada's office. I have been waiting since 5 a.m.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171598">People are waiting since 5 a.m., and it is like this a big surprise to the government that, after introducing the 10-year-passport 10 years ago, they would be expiring about this time. We had 10 years' notice. We knew this was happening. We knew restrictions were being lifted months and months ago, and that people would be travelling again, yet it seems to have been a surprise to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171599">Can we imagine having to get up at about 4 in the morning and wait, in the dark, at 5 a.m., just to get served by the government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171600">Another letter reads, “I had a walk-in appointment in March 8 and was told it should have been done before April 12. If nothing, call.” He called back later, but there was no reply or it hung up on him as the system was busy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171601">Yet another letter reads, “I applied on March 1. On March 23rd, $160 was charged on my credit card. I went to Service Canada to see if they could help expedite the process because at this point I had already been waiting for two months. When I arrived, I was sent home and was told they were only serving people who are leaving within 48 hours and told me to contact Service Canada.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171602">After he left the Service Canada building, he called them multiple times. He was finally able to get a hold of them and was told to call back a week later to request an emergency transfer to Edmonton. This is just for a simple passport.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171603"> We knew this issue was going to happen. We have Canadians waiting months for a simple passport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171604"> Another person applied for a renewed passport, so not a brand new one. The person was just renewing an existing passport on April 25. The person said, “I had gone in person, waited in a long line for hours in the cold,” again, in Edmonton, “and locked outdoors because it was unsafe to be inside. At that time, they were only letting one person at a time into the building. There were four security guards to watch one person. Eventually, they came out and said, 'All of you go home. You won't be served today.' Those of us in line were literally freezing and we took turns warming up in our cars. A snowstorm had blown in and we were all kept out in the cold for hours. It was unnecessary to make us do that when there was a warm building right in front of us. When I went back in a week, I got there with another person at 5 a.m., so I could ensure that I would be seen that day. I was the third person in line.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171605">This is the state of the service from the current government. At 5 in the morning, they were the third person in line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171606">I beg the government to act on this issue, to please get its act together and get it done for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="18">Bill C-253. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="7171623"> He said: Madam Speaker, it is truly an honour to rise today and speak to my private member's bill, Bill C-253, the Bank of Canada accountability act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171624">Members may know that the Auditor General is empowered, under the Auditor General Act, to perform audits on government agencies and departments. However, there is a special carve-out, an exemption, in the Financial Administration Act that specifically excludes the Bank of Canada from the oversight that the Auditor General provides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171625">We are all familiar with Auditor General's reports. It is always a big day on Parliament Hill when the Auditor General tables a report after an investigation on behalf of Canadians into various departments, agencies and programs. Of course, it was the Auditor General's report many years ago that first brought to light the excessive expenses of the long gun registry. It was thanks to her work, at the time, that Canadians got to know the billion-dollar price tag of that useless and ineffective program. We can all think to times when the Auditor General has identified massive problems with the government's handling of everything from immigration protocols to transportation, and that is what this bill is all about: Bringing the Bank of Canada into line with other departments and agencies to provide that oversight so that the Auditor General is empowered to do the same types of audits that he or she does on all other agencies and departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171626">Many in the Liberal establishment are opposed to this bill. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> once said that “sunlight is the best disinfectant”, and then he ran around pulling the shades down on all the windows to keep things hidden. He is afraid of accountability and transparency now. In fact, he is so allergic to it that he has made a deal with the NDP to help cover things up at committees and in the House. It is not a surprise that Liberal parliamentarians and Liberal politicians are opposed to this bill, but Canadians are demanding this type of accountability and oversight. They are demanding it, because we are seeing unprecedented action by the Bank of Canada and unprecedented decision-making that is directly affecting the value of the money they have worked so hard to earn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171627">Many of the arguments against this bill that I have already heard through corporate, taxpayer-subsidized and government-subsidized media and Liberal politicians are all bogus. First of all, one of the critiques is that the bank is already audited. That is true. The bank is already audited by private-sector firms in Canada, but those are not the same types of audits that the Auditor General does. The Auditor General does not simply do a balance-sheet audit. It is not like the Auditor General goes in and tallies up everything on the left side of the ledger and makes sure it balances with everything on the right side of the ledger. No one is assuming that someone is leaving the Bank of Canada with bags of cash over their shoulder. In addition to balance-sheet audits, the Auditor General does performance audits, and that really is the whole point of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171628">The Bank of Canada has made many decisions that have had a profound negative impact on Canadians. It decided, for example, to buy corporate bonds. It had a corporate bond purchasing program. Now, if we go to its website, it spells out some of the general criteria of what minimum thresholds companies would have to meet in order to have their bonds purchased by the bank. I should point out that it is a huge advantage to a company to have its bonds purchased by the central bank. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171629">A bond is basically an IOU. It is debt. It is a company saying, “We don't have the money today, but loan it to us now and we will pay you back later.” Corporations have to pay for that. They have to pay interest on those bonds. When fewer people are willing to buy the bonds, those corporations have to raise their interest rates to sweeten the deal to attract more potential buyers, and that costs the corporations more money. When the Bank of Canada comes along and says, “We'll buy some of those bonds”, that is a huge benefit to the corporation that is selling the bonds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171630"> Which bonds did the Bank of Canada buy? Why did it buy a bond from company A and not company B? Those are the types of things that we do not know. We do not know all the criteria that led to the decision-making. It could very well be that in very competitive marketplaces, say the airline industry, one airline's bonds were purchased by the bank and another's were not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171631">It is the same thing in the telecommunications sector. Perhaps one company's bonds were bought and another's were not. Let us be clear. It is not buying these bonds with its own money. The Bank of Canada creates money. When it buys these corporate bonds, it is creating new money right out of thin air, which has an impact on the purchasing power of the money Canadians have worked so hard to earn. In fact, it dilutes that every time new money is created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171632">In addition to the corporate bonds, it has been buying government bonds, and boy has it ever. It has been on a buying spree for almost two years. From the beginning of the pandemic, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ran out of other people's money to borrow, he had to turn to the Bank of Canada, and the Bank of Canada was only too happy to oblige.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171633">The Bank of Canada, since about April of 2020, has been bankrolling the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s deficit spending to the tune of about $400 billion. That is $400 billion of new money created right out of thin air. That is what is causing the inflation today, and that is why Canadians have a right to know what the bank was doing and what criteria it was following, and report back to Parliament and ultimately to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171634">We have never seen this type of intervention in our monetary policy in our nation's history. Back in the great global recession of 2008, the previous Conservative government held the line on monetary policy. It was a difficult time. Many of my colleagues were in the House at that time. A lot of difficult decisions had to be made, but the previous Conservative government understood that if money starts to be printed out of thin air it makes an already difficult situation even worse. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171635">That is what we are seeing today as we are coming out of the pandemic, after two years of hardship and the emotional toll it took on Canadians individually. People had to go long periods of time without seeing their loved ones. Many small business owners were watching their entire life's work evaporate as restrictions prevented them from opening their doors and serving their customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171636">Coming out of that, now Canadians are being faced with punitive rates of inflation. Things that had cost $10 or $12 are now going for $18 or $20. One almost needs to get a pre-approval on a new loan to go grocery shopping these days as we see the prices escalating. Tools, lumber and all types of everyday purchases Canadians make are going up and up. The government would have us believe this is just something that happens and that it is like the weather: “We are going through an unexpected cloudy period, and inflation is up a little this quarter.” That is nonsense. Inflation does not just happen. It is a direct result of the monetary policy of the Bank of Canada working hand in hand with the government of the day. That is why this proposed act is so necessary. We need to restore the independence of the Bank of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171637">The Bank of Canada's independence has been undermined by the government's decisions to bankroll its deficit spending with all that new money creation. That is why prices are going up today. It is actually rather simple. If we have the same number of goods but dramatically increase the number of dollars going around, prices will go up. It is not rocket science. In fact, these are basic laws of economics. More dollars chasing fewer goods equals inflation. That is precisely what we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171638">The government will try to have us believe inflation is happening because of external factors. Do members remember when it tried to blame the war on Ukraine? It tried to blame inflation on Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Guess what? Inflation was happening long before the invasion of Ukraine. The previous summer, on the eve of the election, inflation was already ticking up to record levels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171639">We all remember the famous quote the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in the middle of an election when inflation was only at about 4%. Do members remember those days, when inflation was only as bad as 4%? Our party started to challenge the Prime Minister and the Liberals on this and highlighted to Canadians it was their economic policy causing the inflation. What did the Prime Minister come back with? He said, “you'll forgive me if I don't think about monetary policy.” Well, we do not forgive him. He should think about monetary policy. I guess he does not understand it, otherwise he would know that he is to blame for all that inflation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171640">Liberals try to say that it cannot be the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s fault, that, yes, there is inflation in Canada, but there is inflation in other countries, too. That is true. Other countries that made the same foolish decisions to run the printing presses during a time of economic contraction are also experiencing record levels of inflation. Some countries did not do that. There are several countries around the world that preserved the value of their currency and are not experiencing the same punitive levels of inflation that Canadians are having to pay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171641">The government's argument is a little like if someone told me I was putting on a bit of weight and I might want to look at my eating habits, and I said that obesity is a North American problem, that obesity rates in North America are the real challenge and that it cannot be anything I do because I live in a continent where it is a challenge for a lot of people. No, of course not. It is because of the decisions of each individual, just like it is the decisions of each individual country that are causing the inflation we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171642">At the end of the day, the dollars that we carry around with us, the ones and zeros in our bank accounts, have no intrinsic value. We cannot do much with a 20-dollar bill or a 100-dollar bill. The only reason why other people accept it as payment is that there is a level of trust. There is a level of trust that someone else will accept it as payment and give the same value that was received. When the Bank of Canada undermines that trust by creating all that money washing through our system, it devalues the value of the money that people work so hard for. It is a form of fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171643">If people agree to provide labour to an employer for a given salary and then at the end of the quarter or the end of the year the money they receive for the work they have done is worth less, they have been defrauded of what they agreed to. They cannot go back and take away 6% to 10% of their labour. They cannot go back and tell the employer that the dollars they were paid with are now worth less, so they would like some of their time and energy back. They cannot do that. They have already given that to their employer, and the money they receive is now worth less than what they agreed to. That is why inflation is the worst form of tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171644">Of course, governments love inflation, because it makes the debt they have accumulated easier to pay off. Inflation is great for people who have the ability to borrow, and that is what we saw during the pandemic. As the Bank of Canada washed all that money through the system, the people who got the money first got to buy things before prices went up. These large financial institutions and investors who had access to that early money first were able to accumulate all the assets. By the time the rest of us get the money, through wage increases and other phenomena, the prices have already gone up and those wealthy investors get to sell at record profits. That is why there have been such big winners during the last two years. Members should look at the stock market and check what bank shares have done in the last two years. Bank shares have gone up dramatically since the start of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171645">When we look at the Bank of Canada's balance sheet and the money supply charts, factoring in all the money in Canada, everything from the ones and zeros in our bank accounts and the digital money that we all have in our chequing and savings accounts to the cash and all the various credit products that exist out there, the rate of increase in the money supply tracks almost identically with the balance sheet at the Bank of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171646">That is what this bill is all about. It is about providing the first steps toward accountability and transparency so that Canadians can have their confidence in the Bank of Canada restored. The independence of the Bank of Canada has been undermined by the political decisions of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. If we want to get our finances under control, if we want to get the value of the money that we have worked so hard to earn stable, we need this first step toward accountability so we can understand what the decision-making process was and what the costs were to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171647">I have one final point. We are going to hear arguments from the opposite benches about why this bill will undermine the Bank of Canada's independence. In fact, it is quite the contrary. The Bank of England is subject to parliamentary oversight through its equivalent of the Auditor General. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has the same types of audit provisions that I am proposing today. The European Central Bank has similar types of provisions, with its version of the Auditor General. In fact, Canada is a bit of an outlier in the fact that it is allowing its central bank, which has such enormous power over our economy, to be excluded from this oversight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171648">This bill is long overdue and I hope all members of the House will support it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171672">Madam Speaker, internet-fuelled populism is like a twister. It is a twister that sucks in any and every manner of grievance against the so-called elites, the so-called gatekeepers, the experts or at least the well-informed. This twister is driven by conspiratorial narratives shared on and amplified by the Internet, more specifically social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171673">They are narratives like vaccines do more harm than good; the government is insisting on vaccination to help the pharmaceutical giants; the World Economic Forum is secretly working to subjugate us to their dastardly interests and oppressive vision; and climate change is an idea promoted by eco-socialists and the world government villains at the United Nations who use Greta Thunberg as their apprentice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171674">This one was mentioned by the member opposite in his speech: The mainstream media is simply an arm of the government, and we cannot believe a word they say, even if what they say is well researched and supported by fact. Here is another conspiratorial narrative: The Bank of Canada is working hand in hand with the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to create inflation, especially asset price inflation, to benefit the Liberals' friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171675">It all makes sense to a receptive but uncritical mind. Bill <Document DbId="11538111" Type="4">C-253</Document> is intended to feed the conspiratorial populist narrative. There is not much to the bill itself. It is short. It is so short that it makes one wonder why even take the time to introduce and debate it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171676">The bill would require the Auditor General to be one of the auditors of the Bank of Canada. The bank's auditors are selected by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and approved by cabinet. KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young currently audit the bank. Bill <Document DbId="11538111" Type="4">C-253</Document> impugns these independent auditors, suggesting that somehow they do not do their job properly, even though they are bound by professional codes of conduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171677">The other problem with appointing the Auditor General as one of the bank's auditors is that the Auditor General is not equipped to audit the bank. The Auditor General's role is to audit departmental programs against stated goals and objectives and to highlight shortcomings in the effective execution of those programs. The audit process is meant to be constructive, but it is also, in essence, a critique of the government. Naturally, opposition parties use AG reports in their efforts to undermine public faith in the party in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171678">This is fair game and an essential part of maintaining democratic accountability, but the Bank of Canada does not have programs per se. It has policy objectives and policy instruments. The success of its actions depends on a host of extraneous factors, such as government fiscal policy and international economic trends, including supply shocks and the like. These are all things the bank does not control, unlike a government department that has direct control over its programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171679">The Auditor General does not have the capacity to cast credible judgments on the bank's policy performance in a dynamic economic context, as compared with the static context of bureaucratic programs. The trap the Auditor General could easily fall into if it were called on to judge the bank's economic policies, assuming it agreed to do so in the first place, is to come to tenuous if not potentially false conclusions masquerading as truth and fact, in the process undermining the bank's credibility with the public and risking a populist backlash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171680">What the sponsor of this bill does not seem to understand is that the bank's success in, say, meeting its inflation targets depends on the extent to which the public believes it will be successful in doing so. There is nothing worse for the economic welfare of Canadians than a public that has lost faith in the bank and a public that does not believe the bank can control inflation. This is what is at the heart of the dreaded wage-price spiral.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171681">Bill <Document DbId="11538111" Type="4">C-253</Document> is pure populism, a populist attempt to undermine public faith in a highly specialized institution, all being done for partisan political gain in a Conservative leadership race.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171685">Madam Speaker, accountability is already enshrined in the Bank of Canada Act. This act requires that once a year, two independent firms are to audit the affairs of the bank simultaneously. The bank is the only federal Crown corporation subject to this requirement. The act also gives the Minister of Finance the authority to enlarge or extend the scope of the audit and to request special audits and reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171686">Contrary to what the bill might suggest, the auditor general already has the authority to exercise an oversight role in certain areas of the bank's business functions. Specifically, she can review and audit the bank's operations and records related to its roles as the government's fiscal agent, advisor on public debt management, and manager of the exchange fund account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171687"> The Bank of Canada Act also makes it clear that in the event that there is a difference of opinion between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canada on monetary policy, the minister may, after consultation with the governor and with the approval of the Governor in Council, give to the governor a written directive that shall be laid before Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171688">The governor and deputy governor are regularly called to testify before committees of the House of Commons and the other place, including the Standing Committee on Finance, to be held accountable. I commend them for their willingness to appear and their transparency. I also thank them for systematically answering my questions in impeccable French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171689">In addition, there is also an Audit and Finance Committee, which has the mandate to review the bank's annual and interim financial statements; approve interim financial statements; make a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to the approval of the annual financial statements, as appropriate; oversee and ensure that the external and internal audit functions are carried out in an appropriate manner; review the adequacy of the bank’s risk management, internal control and governance framework with respect to financial reporting; and oversee the bank’s financial management, including the medium-term financial plan, the annual budget and expenditure reporting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171690">This bill is an expression of a philosophy and a strategy that should worry us, an attempt to cast doubt on the bank and undermine public confidence in this independent institution. That is exactly what we saw when the bill's sponsor was his party's leader and during the last election campaign. This strategy is still a factor in their leadership race.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171691">The Bank of Canada is a complex institution, and it is difficult for the general public to understand. It just might be the perfect victim for politicians seeking a scapegoat for economic ups and downs. The current Conservative Party leadership hopeful openly attacks the Bank of Canada and has even promised to fire the bank's current governor. This same technique has already been used by none other than Donald Trump south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171692">Firing the governor of the central bank just because the prime minister does not agree with the monetary policy could have a devastating impact on our economy, its stability and its attractiveness to investors. It would put us on par with banana republics where financial and monetary crises happen all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171693">It is of course perfectly appropriate and healthy to be able to criticize the work of a central bank and its governor. We are seeing this now. Economists have said that central bankers waited too long before raising interest rates. The governor has also been criticized for being slow to recognize that inflation was not transitory and that monetary policy tightening should have started well before 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171694">The Bank of Canada has recognized some of its own errors. In a speech given in Toronto on May 3, the deputy governor focused on the importance of maintaining public confidence in the central bank. She said the following:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171696">To bring down inflation, the bank's current policy calls for a sharp rise in interest rates, followed by an end to the rollover of government bond assets held by the institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171697">Once again, criticizing the central bank and its management of inflation is legitimate, but we must also take the time to explain the multiple causes of these price increases, which is a global phenomenon.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171698">The rhetoric that tends to undermine public confidence in the Bank of Canada is beyond worrisome. It can have a real impact on the economy, and this bill seems to serve that rhetoric.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171699">The Bank of Canada is a public entity separate from both the banking sector and the political process, let us not forget. Its fundamental responsibility is to guide the economy in the long-term best interests of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171700">The bank was created in 1934. The Bank of Canada Act established the bank as a Crown corporation with special status and considerable independence to conduct its business. The act sets out the bank's business and powers as they relate to its core responsibilities of monetary policy, the financial system, currency, funds management and, more recently, retail payments supervision. The act also provides for the operational independence the bank needs to carry out its activities and meet its responsibilities, free from political influence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171701">In other words, the act dictates what the bank does, but not how it does it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171702">Over the years, the bank has made major changes to how it achieves its mandate. The most significant was in 1991, when the government and the bank reached the country's first inflation-targeting agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171703"> As its name indicates, it is a sort of contract between the bank and the government that establishes an inflation-control target but confers on the bank the authority to decide how it will achieve this target. The agreement has been renewed on a regular basis, most recently in 2021, following consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171704">From the signing of the first agreement 30 years ago to the most recent agreement, the inflation rate was kept to almost exactly 2% on average. The bank is working to return to that level of price increases while ensuring the economy's stability. I will repeat that it is facing disruptions at a global level, and we are confident it will succeed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171705">In closing, I would like to remind members that the bank has a board of directors composed of the governor, the senior deputy governor and 12 independent directors. The board of directors does not have a say in monetary policy decisions, which fall to the Governing Council, but it does have oversight of the bank's activities and finances. Its independent directors appoint the governor and the senior deputy governor, with the approval of the Governor in Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171706">The bank also enjoys financial independence. The expenditures of the bank are financed by its own activities, and it therefore does not rely on public funding. Its budget is approved by the board of directors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171708">Worst of all, this bill was introduced by someone who ran to be prime minister, but who is now sinking into a kind of crass partisan populism.

              <ParaText id="7171709">Let us turn to serious business. The bill focuses on the role of the Office of the Auditor General, one of the essential tools for our democratic quality of life, government accountability, and the proper functioning of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171710"> As an independent body, the office is able to go in, check the facts and see what really happened in a particular department, with a project, military or other equipment purchase, or government contract. It is able to see whether the rules and amounts were followed and whether taxpayer dollars were spent in a proper, reasonable and rational manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171711">The office does extraordinary work. As an opposition member, I can say that we have often used the studies, reports and investigations of the Office of the Auditor General to ask questions of the government. It would have been difficult to get these data and studies otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171712"> The various commissioners, including the Commissioner of the Environment and the Commissioner of Official Languages, also do work that is essential to the proper functioning of Parliament and our democracy in general. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171713">Unfortunately, under the government of Stephen Harper and the Conservatives, the Office of the Auditor General's budget was cut. They wanted to clip the Auditor General's wings because he was saying things that were unpleasant for the government. He was the one who reminded us that the government had not done exactly this or that, that it had misspent money, that it had not complied with the rules, and so on. The message they wanted to send was that he was not going to have the resources to do his job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171714">Not only did the Conservatives make cuts to the human and financial resources of the Office of the Auditor General, but now they are introducing a bill giving the Office of the Auditor General a new mandate.

It is essentially designed to give more work to the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, but to do what? To investigate the Bank of Canada? Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171723">As my colleague before me already said, the Bank of Canada is already accountable to Parliament for its own administration, its work, its monetary policies and its decisions through House and Senate committees.</ParaText>

As we said earlier, the Bank of Canada is not perfect and we have a duty to criticize it and to demand accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171725">This bill is a thinly veiled threat, an attempt by the Conservatives to intrude on and interfere with the Bank of Canada, an independent body. They are doing this for partisan and political purposes. They want to use the Office of the Auditor General for partisan purposes, in a thinly veiled threat to Canada's central bank. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171726">This bill reeks of populism. I think it is pathetic that they are taking up hours of our time in Parliament to help give a Conservative Party leadership candidate some credibility on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171727">Of course, from a libertarian or far-right economic perspective, the likes of which can be found in the ranks of the Conservative Party, no one blames anything on big business and the massive profits these companies are making. They think it is perfectly normal for the big oil companies and big grocery chains to profit off the pandemic, the crisis and the supply chain issues by unreasonably increasing prices at the expense of workers, the least fortunate and families that are struggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171728">The Conservatives are leaning into right-wing populism and will never explain why billionaires should exist or why companies make billions of dollars at Canadians' expense. Instead, they blame the Bank of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171729">I do not necessarily agree with dramatically raising interest rates as a way to fight inflation. It has tragic consequences for people who, for example, are already having trouble paying their mortgages and bills. That is one way to do it, but it is really not in the best interests of the poor, workers and the middle class. I will come back to that later if I have time.</ParaText>

              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171735">That is not a huge increase. Pollution pricing rose from 1¢ to 9¢. Taxes have gone up, but not that much, just from 45¢ to 60¢. The refining margin, in contrast, has gone up from 9¢ to 48¢. That is the biggest contributor to rising pump prices over the last 15 years, and it is profit for big corporations like Suncor and Imperial Oil, which made billions in profits in the first quarter of this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171736">We have to be able to tell people the truth. We have to be able to tell them that there are solutions other than raising interest rates. The NDP has solutions to help people get through this crisis. Increase the GST tax credit, which helps hundreds of thousands of people in Quebec and across Canada, and increase the Canada child benefit, which is a good way to redistribute wealth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171737">We need to be able to tax these companies that are making billions of dollars in profits so that we can redistribute that money to the people who really need it, people who are suffering right now and struggling to pay their rent and buy groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171738">There are other solutions. I would point out that, in this morning's edition of Le Devoir, a dozen economists went over different ways we could be helping people, including regulating Airbnb rentals, lowering the cost of public transit, building massive numbers of social housing units and bringing in rent control. Not all of these measures would come from the federal government, but there are some excellent ideas and solutions.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278391" Type="2">Mr. John Williamson (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171740">Madam Speaker, New Brunswick is large in its mind, and it is large in its geography as well. Thank you for recognizing me and permitting me to address this important piece of legislation. I should remind the House and members here that when we cut right through it, inflation is the price that we and all Canadians pay for the things that the government told us would be free. That really cuts to the core of this debate and why this bill is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171741">Parliamentary oversight and accountability are key pillars of our democracy that we as legislators should be determined to protect and safeguard. Members of Parliament have a great deal of respect for the work done over the decades by Canada's auditors general, along with the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the other independent offices of Parliament. As chairman of the public accounts committee, I have heard from our current Auditor General, Ms. Hogan, and her deputy, Mr. Hayes, on a number of occasions this year. I can say that MPs from both sides of this chamber welcome their analysis on the machinery of government, through audits of federal departments, agencies and Crown corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171742">The Auditor General's office has historically performed a valuable service to Canadian taxpayers. Their work informs us in this House of both the missteps and the achievements that come from fulfilling policies and programs implemented by the Government of Canada. With few exceptions, these policies and programs are tied to mandates given to them by the executive, that is the cabinet. Of course, those mandates come ultimately from Canada's voters. When civil servants do not adhere to these mandates, it is on us, as parliamentarians, to hold them accountable and to make course corrections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171743">As such, I wholeheartedly support Bill <Document DbId="11538111" Type="4">C-253</Document> to bring the Bank of Canada under the purview of the Auditor General by including the central bank under section 85 of the Financial Administration Act. What this bill would do is authorize the Auditor General to include the Bank of Canada in her normal audit cycle, which means the Bank of Canada would be subject to the same types of routine audits that Crown corporations and departments undergo. That is it. At its core, this is about accountability and transparency, and adherence to its mandate and Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171744">I applaud the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> for introducing this bill, because he, like me, wants accountability from the Bank of Canada to ensure it adheres to its mandate. Some hon. members protest that MPs should not examine or even criticize the Bank of Canada, because it is independent, but this is a view out of step with democratic oversight in the United States, Britain and other countries where lawmakers are today vigorously debating what their central banks got wrong. We can just turn to a couple of headlines, which read, “Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said the central bank erred in waiting to address inflation”, and “The Fed's slow response to inflation was a mistake”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171745"> Another one, from the Financial Times, states, “MPs turn on bank's handling of economy as [British] government feels heat from cost of living crisis”. In fact, even here in Canada, the media are reporting about Bank of Canada officials. In this case, “Carolyn Rogers says the Bank of Canada is learning from its mistakes”, yet some feel that this House has no role in this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171746">Historically, the Bank of Canada has been focused on a stable rate of inflation, and the bank's previous governors successfully kept inflation under control. It was not always easy and it required work, independence and a focus on results. However, in recent years, the bank's references to employment targets has been a consideration. If colleagues look at the bank's website or listen to speeches that officials have made, other considerations are now being added by bank officials in its considerations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171747">More recently, the bank has also started to indicate that other goals, such as environmental and social objectives, would or could influence policy. Since the pandemic, the Liberal government's deficit spending program has been underwritten almost exclusively through the bank's use of quantitative easing. That is a fancy word for expanding the money supply, which is a polite way of saying “printing money”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171748">As my hon. colleague just pointed out, when we expand the money supply, we dilute or reduce its value, and that is what has happened today in Canadian wallets. Their paycheques and their savings are worth less than they previously were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171749">How has all of this worked out? As members of Parliament, we should not be afraid to ask, to probe questions and to seek answers. The bill we are considering would allow the Auditor General to conduct audits of the bank through its normal 10-year cycle. Such audits include performance evaluations, something that is not happening now as it would go beyond the fiscal balance sheet examinations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171750">This is an important and key addition, particularly since the central bank is implementing monetary policies that are without precedent, and this will have massive implications for things like interest rates, inflation, growth and household incomes going forward. It is necessary that the Bank of Canada be subject to more transparency and accountability by Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171751">Of course, there is precedent for allowing the Auditor General to have jurisdiction over arm's-length independent financial institutions. The Public Sector Pension Investment Board operates free of political interference but is still subject to the Auditor General's oversight. This bill follows virtually the same model by amending the Financial Administration Act's exemption for the Bank of Canada to match the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Again, we are calling for the Bank of Canada to be covered in a way that other arm's-length agencies are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171752">Let us return to mandates and accountability. The Bank of Canada and its governor, Tiff Macklem, wield an extreme amount of power by setting our nation's monetary policy, not economic policy, as one of the members on the government bench said, but monetary policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171753">I would argue that the bank's governor is the most powerful unelected civil servant in Canada. At the same time, he is bound by the mandate of his office and therefore subject to accountability, for us to ask how this governor is doing in his job. Unlike other institutions that report to Parliament, the Bank of Canada is audited by external auditors, who are appointed by cabinet on the recommendation of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. Therein lies the problem. There is not enough oversight or independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171754">The bank is responsible for maintaining low and stable inflation, a safe and secure currency, financial stability and the efficient management of government funds and public debt, but at its very core, the governor is responsible for keeping the rate of inflation between 1% and 3%. How is he doing? The rate of inflation, in this country, has hit 6.8%. That is a 30-year high and not a record of success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171755">Political elites do not want MPs or Canadians to talk about the Bank of Canada's shortcomings. This is to protect the governor from proper and legitimate criticism, yet Governor Macklem has blown Canada's inflation targets and, in doing so, was cozy with the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171756">He should have done his job instead of echoing government talking points about non-existent fiscal anchors. The incestuous relationship between the Liberal government and the Bank of Canada should never have been permitted to develop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171757">Because the Bank of Canada did not properly perform its job, Canadian households are paying a high price and, I fear, will pay a high price for years to come. Interest rate hikes will be more punishing, and price increases will last longer than had an independent Bank of Canada acted sooner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171758">Instead of talking about the punishing financial hit on Canadian families and businesses, these gatekeepers, to shield the governor from legitimate public scrutiny, cried, “Respect the bank's independence.” Those cries ring hollow after the governor failed to exercise his own independence from the Liberals. The bank should be held accountable for its errors. This is not interference. This is accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171759">This bill is a modest reform to grant Parliament some oversight, since the Auditor General's audits would be tabled in Parliament and studied by its members. It would bring Canada's Parliament in step with other democracies in probing the Bank of Canada's implementation of its mandate. It would allow MPs to hold the Bank of Canada accountable and to ask and seek answers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171760">Conservatives do not wish to diminish the Bank of Canada's independence, but we want to ensure it is acting independently while fulfilling its mandate to control inflation. I support this bill, and I urge others to do likewise.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171761">Madam Speaker, at the outset of listening to the debate in this House and reading the text of this bill, I cannot help but wonder if the Conservatives have lost faith in the Bank of Canada. I know they are going to say they just want accountability and they just want to have proper oversight. However, as pointed out, not just by Liberals but by members from the Bloc and the NDP, this goes a lot further than just looking for accountability and oversight. This plays into that narrative that, quite honestly, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who is the perceived next leader of the Conservative Party, is feeding. He is feeding that narrative, and it is the narrative that they do not have faith in one of the most important institutions in our country. Have the members across the way lost faith in the Bank of Canada?</ParaText>

                <B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Madam Speaker, we just heard a yes. I heard a yes that was heckled across the way. I did not realize the answer was going to be that easy. I thought I was going to have to fight for it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171764">Madam Speaker, it goes to the heart of the issue, and the heart of the issue here is that this idea and this politicization of the Bank of Canada, which is being led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> and those who support him, for nothing more than the gains that they can make out of this populist movement, is exactly what we are seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171765">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> was asked a question earlier: Will all Conservatives support this? He stood up and said that yes, they would. I am really interested to see the vote from the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation>, because he was extremely critical, and he agreed that the politicization of the Bank of Canada “undermines the party's credibility on economic issues”. That is the member for Abbotsford, the same member who was ousted for making a comment like this, just last night. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171766">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> He resigned.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171768">This is about populism. That has been well documented, and not just by the member from the Liberal Party who spoke earlier but indeed by other political parties in here. I am very glad to see that it is extremely clear what is going on here, and I look forward to my seven minutes that remain the next time this comes up for debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171771">Madam Speaker, Putin's horrific actions in Ukraine are killing children, women and elders, and displacing millions of Ukrainians who are fleeing for safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171772">Since 2017, the NDP has been calling for visa-free access for Ukrainians. It is unfortunate that this has not been put in place, as it would have been the most efficient way to get people to safety. Instead, the government opted for a visa process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171773">Canada's immigration backlog now exceeds two million people, with significant backlogs in every stream. The <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said that he was going to fix the problem, but the situation is actually getting worse, not better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171774">The promise of a two-week turnaround time in processing of the Canada Ukraine emergency travel visa is just fiction. In fact, Ukrainians could not even get an appointment to get their biometrics done in two weeks. Not only that, the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> announced an extended family reunification measure for Ukrainian nationals on March 3. It has been over two and a half months, and there is still no indication of when details of the family reunification PR program stream will be launched.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171775">Aside from the issue of processing visas and travel documents, the government is now relying on Air Miles to help Ukrainians get to safety. I certainly hope that this does not replace what is absolutely essential, which are evacuation flights. If it does, it is clearly not a very reliable way to help Ukrainians get to safety. Not only that, but it will also not help those who need to leave now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171776">What will happen when there are no more Air Miles points available? How will Ukrainians know that they can access points? For booking flights, points are extremely limited as there are limited seats available for each flight. As such, it could be very difficult for Ukrainians fleeing Putin's war to get to safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171777">Ukrainians in need of getting to safety are mired in red tape with delays in getting emergency visas. Now, they need to wait for Air Miles points to be available and hope that they can get a seat to get to Canada. Let us imagine that. The Liberal government needs to realize that this not a vacation for Ukrainian nationals. People are trying to get to safety. They are fleeing a war, and they are in a desperate situation. Canada should be partnering with Air Canada and organizing evacuation flights for Ukrainians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171778">Because the immigration stream made available to Ukrainians is a temporary visitor stream, concerns that they will not have the support they need are escalating. Even though the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that there would be income support for them a month ago, so far there is no information on when or how they will be able to access the support. There is not even clarity on how much income support they would get or how long it would be made available to them. This cannot carry on. Also, children would not qualify for the Canada child benefit, yet we know that newcomers rely on that support to support their access to safe housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171779">Provinces have said that they would help, but it is not enough. We need the federal government to bring forward a national program to address this issue and to ensure equitable access and support for all Ukrainian nationals. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171781">More than 32,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Canada since January 1 of this year. As part of our response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or the IRCC, introduced the Canada-Ukraine authorization for emergency travel. This fast-track temporary residence visa is designed to help Ukrainians seeking a safe haven in Canada while war continues in their home country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171782">As of May 1, we have received approximately 240,000 applications under this new program and have approved over 111,000. We are meeting our target of 14 days for processing applications. We are committed to processing 80% of applications within 14 days, and we continue to meet that standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171783">On May 10, the <Affiliation DbId="278908" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> announced that three charter flights would be offered to approved Ukrainians and their families under the emergency program. The IRCC will be sending an email to those who have received their visas to come to Canada under the emergency program to let them know how they can book seats on these charters. The flights will be available on a first‑come, first‑served basis, and will depart from Warsaw, Poland, arriving in Winnipeg on May 23, Montreal on May 29, and Halifax on June 2.</ParaText>

In addition, on March 30 of this year, the Government of Canada announced temporary federal support to help eligible Ukrainians arriving under the new program to settle into their new communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171786"> These extended settlement program services, which are typically only available to permanent residents, will be available until March 31, 2023, and include the following: language training; information about and orientation to life in Canada, such as help with enrolling children in school; information and services to help access the labour market, including mentoring, networking, counselling, skills development and training; activities that promote connections with communities; assessments of other needs Ukrainians may have; services targeted to the needs of women, seniors, youth and LGBTQ2+ persons; and other settlement supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171787">We will continue to do more to welcome Ukrainians seeking refuge here in Canada from Putin's war as quickly as possible, and we will take care of them when they get here.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171791">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise tonight on this adjournment debate. I want to acknowledge I am standing here on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171792">The question I am pursuing tonight I originally asked on April 27, so it had not been long since we had received the final chapter of the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with its most dire warnings ever. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171793">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> how it could be, given we had been told by the IPCC that emissions must peak globally by 2025 and drop dramatically from there to at least half by 2030, that two days later the government approved the Bay du Nord project, and how it could be that, three days later, the budget included continuing to build the Trans Mountain pipeline, while somehow transferring that monstrosity to indigenous ownership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171794">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s answer, as ever, was that the government was doing so much and had committed $100 billion to be spent between 2016 and 2030. One hundred billion dollars is a lot of money, but it does not save us. The government's plan does not come close to holding to 2°C or 1.5°C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171795">We are facing some very serious realities, and talking points will not do. I have to admit that I made an error in my question of April 27. On how bad things were, I quoted from the IPCC lead author, who said that it was “now or never”. I read the report of the IPCC as saying, as I just did, that we had until 2025 globally to ensure that emissions had peaked and dropped from there. I was wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171796">I went back and reread page 22 of the “Summary for Policymakers” of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report. We do not have until 2025; we have less time. The quote is that “global emissions must peak between 2020 and, at the latest, before 2025”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171797">This is not a political debate. I know the hon. <Affiliation DbId="279287" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> is as good and decent a person as we are ever going to find in this place, and the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is a good person and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a good person, but it does not matter. The difference between policies developed by good people who fall short on climate change and policies by people who do not believe climate change exists, in the words of Bill McKibben, one of our leading champions for climate action globally, is losing more slowly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171798">The Liberal plan before us does not deal with the science. It does not. Setting net-zero by 2050 as if it means anything is spin. It is not science. Net-zero by 2050 is only relevant if global emissions peak before 2025 and drop rapidly from there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171799">I know what the hon. <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has said in this place about Bay du Nord and the emissions not being Canada's problem. Really? When did he lose his moral compass? The emissions do not matter if they happen somewhere else? Canada is to continue to increase producing oil and gas? It is not our problem if the emissions in other countries condemn our children to an unlivable world? That is what we are talking about; nothing less than that.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7171801">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the points raised by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>. I always like discussing this issue with her. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171802">Fighting climate change is very important to me. It is an issue that really guides the work that I do in this place every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171803">I would point out that we are at the point of seeing a flattening of emissions from this country, and that is a very big deal. In 2019, we began to see a decoupling, where the economy grew and emissions were flattening. They were not growing in the same way the economy was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171804">In 2020, our emissions in fact dropped, but that was a different year. We all know that because we were not travelling the way we had before. However, I will point out that some of that drop is a permanent piece that comes from the work that we have done to remove coal-fired electricity from the electrical grid, as we are doing, so there are positives steps. I think it is really important to highlight some of that as well because I feel the anxiety, as I think so many people do, and it is important to point out that progress is being made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171805">The member has also raised the Bay du Nord project. I have pointed out that we are making progress. There is work being done. It is hard work. We put a price on carbon pollution. That was a big deal. We had to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to make it stick. That was a lot of hard work, and it is a having an impact. It is a very strong market mechanism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171806">If we look toward next things, we are mandating zero-emission vehicles so that 100% of all new light-duty vehicles sold by 2035 will be zero emission. We are retrofitting buildings as set out in the emissions reduction plan. As quickly as we seek to make that transition, there are many logistical challenges that we are overcoming to make that happen quickly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171807">Currently, we are still in a place where we rely on oil and gas for our homes and transportation. Even as we transition from the combustion of fossil fuels, and this was something that was a big learning for me, there is going to remain a need for non-combustion related uses. For example, I was at my bike shop talking to someone about my bike. Right now, there is no other quality way to lubricate the chain on my bicycle than to use oil. It is also used for plastics in a medical context. Those are needs that are still there. Therefore, the world will still need some fossil fuels, but not necessarily for combustion, which brings me to the question of Bay du Nord. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171808">The federal government accepted the environmental assessment of the Impact Assessment Agency regarding the Baie du Nord project after four years of consideration and scrutiny by scientific experts. The projected emissions from Baie du Nord are 10 times less than the oil sands on average and five times less than the average oil and gas project. Ultimately, I am going to highlight this, because it is something that is important to me as I look at all of this: The atmosphere sees emissions, but it does not see production barrel numbers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171809">What we are doing is driving down the combustion of fossil fuels in our own country through the work I have outlined above, and there is so much work being done. We are also putting a cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector. Those are all steps we are taking that are important steps forward. I would say we are making tremendous progress. It is a hard mountain to move, but we are doing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171810">I thank the hon. member for all of her feedback and work on this issue.</ParaText>

I did not say the government is not making progress. I said that the totality of what it has proposed does not protect my grandchildren from the <I>Mad Max</I> dystopian future that awaits them on if we stay on the trajectory we are on, so we must be sure we do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171812">There is no excuse for the government wasting billions of dollars on the Trans Mountain pipeline. There is no excuse for an emissions reduction plan that includes an increase of 21% by 2030 of oil and gas production. There is no excuse for approving Baie du Nord. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171814">Madam Speaker, I do understand the urgency. It is, in fact, something I take very seriously in the work I do. It is something that I take to heart, and there is urgency in the work we are doing. In only looking through the emissions reduction plan, it goes through every sector of our economy, putting forward projections to reduce our emissions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171815">We have signed on to international agreements. Canada joined over 100 countries in signing the global methane pledge to reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by 30% by 2030. If we look at all of the work put together, including reducing emissions by 40% to 45% from 2005 levels by 2030, then we are on a path to net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171816">It is urgent, I absolutely agree, and we are working with that urgency. We will continue to do so.</ParaText>

First, there is the creation of jobs, which includes the creation of over 18,000 jobs per year that are created or maintained. In terms of the economic benefit, it is $1.54 billion annually to the economy.</ParaText>

We know that it is essential for all democratic nations to stand united in our support of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian sovereignty. That is precisely what our government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171896">PSPC continues to provide logistical and other support to ensure that Canada's support and assistance are received by those who need them. On the domestic front, defence procurement and defence contract management are important parts of my mandate, and I am honoured to be leading on this front during this crucial time as Canada's defence policy evolves in a rapidly changing world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171897">We continue to make progress on our defence procurements. That includes our government's work to procure 88 advanced fighter jets to replace our aging fleet of fighters. The purchase of new jets represents the most significant investment in the Royal Canadian Air Force in more than 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171898">Since day one, our government has been focused on steering a process that is truly competitive. That is what we have done because we know that it is the right way to get the best value for Canadians and to make sure our defence needs are properly met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171899">Following a rigorous evaluation of the proposals, the government has entered into the finalization phase of the process with the United States government and Lockheed Martin. This is an important milestone in the procurement process, and I can report that we are on track to reaching an agreement later this year, with the delivery of aircraft potentially as early as 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171900">We also continue to work with our partners to renew the fleets of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. Despite the immense pressures on global supply chains, we are making progress on shipbuilding and revitalizing the industry in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171901">There is no doubt that the government's purchasing power is an important lever and we are using it to drive economic prosperity, but we must make sure that prosperity is inclusive for all Canadians. That is why we have recently launched a supplier diversity action plan, which includes pilot projects to increase the participation of under-represented groups in federal procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171902">An example of this is our Black business procurement pilot project, which has led our government to awarding a series of contracts. We received important feedback from the community about the process so we can improve it going forward. Our goal here is to help remove barriers to full participation in procurement for all suppliers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7171903"> We also continue to walk the path of reconciliation by leading in the implementation of a requirement to ensure that a minimum of 5% of the value of federal contracts is held by businesses that are led by and employ first nations, Inuit and Métis people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171904">With our purchasing power comes other responsibilities, such as doing our part to tackle forced labour around the world. I know that all members would agree that we must do everything we can to eradicate this abhorrent practice. That is why our government has updated the federal code of conduct for procurement to clearly outline Canada's expectations for suppliers when it comes to human and labour rights. As of November 2021, all of our goods-related contracts now contain anti-forced labour clauses. That means the government can terminate contracts when there is credible information that goods have been produced in whole or in part by forced labour or human trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171905">The department has done other important work, including major projects in the national capital region. That includes replacing the Alexandra Bridge and implementing a long-term, integrated, interprovincial crossing plan. It is an endeavour led by the National Capital Commission, which is part of my portfolio. Of course, we are also working on the renovation and rehabilitation of the Parliamentary Precinct. Just outside of these doors, we are working to modernize and preserve the heart of Canada's democracy and to keep it a place that can be enjoyed by all Canadians. Our work in this area expands beyond Parliament Hill and its historic buildings. On Monday, I had the pleasure of announcing the winner of the design competition for the city block that faces Parliament on Confederation Boulevard known as “Block Two”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171906"> Renewing the Parliamentary Precinct is an enormous undertaking that will result in an integrated parliamentary campus while moving us toward carbon neutrality and climate resiliency. Of course, greening all of our operations across government will support Canada's commitments to fighting climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171907">Our energy services acquisition program is an excellent example of progress my department has made when it comes to greening government. Under the program, we are modernizing the district energy systems that heat and cool 80 buildings in the national capital region. I am happy to report that we have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 57% from the baseline year of 2005, and we are on track to meet our goal of net zero emissions by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171908">These many initiatives are made possible by Canada's hard-working public servants here in the national capital region and across the country. They deserve to be paid accurately and on time. I also want this committee to know that we continue our efforts to resolve the backlog of pay transactions and stabilize pay operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171909"> At the same time, Shared Services Canada is advancing work on the next generation of human resources and pay solutions: one that is flexible, modern and integrated. Shared Services Canada is also working to provide public servants with modern tools and deliver digital services to Canadians that are secure, reliable and easy to use anywhere. While not covered in the main estimates, Shared Services Canada is an important part of my portfolio, and like PSPC, it plays a vital role in supporting government operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171910">Also in my portfolio is Canada Post Corporation, and I want to note for the committee and all Canadians my appreciation of postal workers. Despite hardships brought on by the pandemic over the past two years, our dedicated postal workers have continued to provide high-quality service across the country. Indeed, all public servants have stepped up since COVID-19 hit our shores to get through to the other side of the pandemic and to keep the Government of Canada running. I am so honoured and humbled to lead such a talented team, and I know that we will be able to build on our accomplishments and achieve great things for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171911">I have touched on only a fraction of the important work happening under my portfolio of Public Services and Procurement Canada. I am happy to take the committee's questions regarding the main estimates for my department.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7171912">Madam Chair, our government has been working to address inequities by modernizing its procurement practices and encouraging suppliers from diverse backgrounds to be part of the federal supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171913">Budget 2021 proposed $87.4 million over five years, and $18.6 million ongoing, to modernize federal procurement and to create opportunities for specific communities such as indigenous people, women, LGBTQ2+ Canadians, Black and other racialized Canadians. This included a two-year study from 2018 to 2020 that aimed to leverage the government's significant purchasing power to pursue socio-economic outcomes through procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171914">As the <Affiliation DbId="278934" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> mentioned, our government also undertook a Black business procurement pilot in 2021 to expand procurement opportunities for Black entrepreneurs. We also recently released two requests for information to better understand the procurement experience of businesses owned or led by persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ2+ community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171915">As part of its efforts to diversify the federal supply chain, we have issued requests for information to gather input from Canadian Black businesses and businesses owned or operated by persons with disabilities, as well as businesses owned or led by members of the LGBTQ2+ community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171916">The feedback gathered through the RFIs will be used to expand the use of targeted approaches to increase diversity in federal procurements. PSPC's Policy on Social Procurement came into effect in May 2021.

              <ParaText id="7171918">Madam Chair, this is a very important part of the portfolio for me, to ensure that we level the playing field and give all business leaders an opportunity to enter into procurement with the federal government. I think it is really important that we listen. This is why I have had the opportunity to set up round tables and hear directly from business leaders and from those who have established a desire to work with the government, but have felt that they have faced some obstacles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171919">These discussions have been very helpful, in terms of providing us with feedback on what things have been working, and how we need to move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171920">I have met with diverse groups and really appreciate the feedback. One of the areas was the coaching pilot. We held a coaching pilot that talked to business leaders about how to be successful in their procurement bids, and offered training and assistance. Afterward, I had an opportunity to speak with those business leaders who experienced the coaching pilot. I can tell members that they were all grateful. They said it was helpful in terms of better understanding, recognizing and feeling supported and that they would like to see projects like that continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7171921">These pilots, round tables and discussions have been very helpful. We are going to continue to work toward levelling the playing field because, at the end of the day, we know that when we allow all businesses an opportunity to enter into procurement, we all benefit.

              <ParaText id="7172066">Madam Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to address the committee on a topic we know all too well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172067">More than two years ago, our lives were forever changed by the emergence of COVID-19. Since that time, all Canadians have experienced immense sacrifices and loss in one form or another. Kids missed birthday parties and graduation; seniors were isolated from their families and friends; our health care and other essential workers on the front line put themselves at great risk, working long hours so that we could get the services and the care we needed, and we cannot commend them enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172068">At its worst, the virus claimed the lives of so many loved ones in this country and around the world. During this crisis, Canadians remained resilient. They stepped up by following public health guidelines and getting their vaccine shot when it was their turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172069">Life is getting back to a new normal, but make no mistake, our government's top priority remains protecting the health and safety of all Canadians. Since the beginning, we have worked hard to do just that. Securing life-saving personal protective equipment and ensuring that everyone could get vaccinated were top priorities, and Public Services and Procurement Canada has been vital in those efforts. I can tell members that the department's aggressive procurement approach over more than two years has ensured that Canada has a secure supply of personal protective equipment and vaccine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172070">When COVID-19 reached our shores, we acted promptly to get our health care professionals the supplies they required, working around the clock to procure critical personal protective equipment and other medical equipment. The entire world was scrambling to get the same material from a finite number of suppliers, making it a highly complex and competitive global environment. Procurement experts worked day and night, aggressively buying from all available suppliers and distributors at home and abroad. Lives were on the line, and every effort had to be made. Thanks to those efforts during the most crucial months, our government acquired billions of units of masks, N95 respirators, face shields, hand sanitizer, protective gowns, gloves and a lot more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172071">The urgent global demand meant that early supplies largely came from overseas. However, as part of the pandemic response, we also invested in Canadian companies to make the needed supplies here in Canada. Companies from across Canada did their part as well, and some even completely shifted their production lines to meet the urgent need. We should all be proud that Canadian industry stepped up in such a big way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172072">Medicom out of Montreal and 3M in Brockville are prime examples. Our government has a 10-year contract with Medicom to supply N95 and surgical masks, and we have a contract with 3M for 25 million N95s annually through 2026. Our investment with these companies has helped secure a domestic supply for the production of personal and protective equipment now and well into the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172073">These are only two examples, but there are many more across this country. This has truly been a team Canada effort. Canadian companies that stepped up to join the fight have been and will continue to be key to our success. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172074">When it comes to vaccine, our work has been just as effective. Our approach on this front was deliberate, strategic and comprehensive. At the onset of the pandemic, when pharmaceutical companies took on the challenge to develop a viable vaccine, we simply had no idea if it was even possible. Scientists, regulators and manufacturers from many nations worked under intense pressure to produce safe and effective vaccines and somehow make them available around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172075">Once vaccine candidates began to show promise, we knew that once again we would be dealing with a highly complex and competitive global market. That is why we pushed a diversified vaccine procurement approach, one that allowed us to reserve doses as early as possible by signing agreements in principle while the details of the final purchase agreements were being negotiated.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172076">At the same time, we were proactive in acquiring critical goods such as needles, syringes and more in order to support provinces and territories when it came time to administer the vaccines. That work paid off. Today, if eligible Canadians want a COVID-19 vaccine shot, they can get one. Over the past year, Canadians have rolled up their sleeves and done their part during the largest vaccination campaign this country has ever seen. In fact, the Canadian vaccine rate is one of the best in the world. Securing vaccines has saved lives, and it is why Canadians can now get back to doing the things they love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172077">We are also better equipped for future waves. Our contracts with the world's leading vaccine maker gives us access to the supply of future formulations that will protect us against new variants. I am also proud to say that we are also investing in our capability to manufacture these life-saving vaccines right here at home. Most recently, our government announced the next step in ensuring Canada has a secure domestic supply of the latest vaccines through an agreement with Moderna to set up a manufacturing facility in the Montreal region. This new facility, which is set to be operational in two years, will be able to produce up to 100 million mRNA vaccine doses annually. It will also create hundreds of good-paying jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172078">Because of the actions we have taken and the groundwork we have laid, Canada will see this pandemic through to the end, but, as the <Affiliation DbId="278934" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> stated in her opening remarks, the pandemic is not over yet and there is still a lot more for her department to do. That includes working to ensure we have enough supply of rapid tests on top of the more than 600 million we have already purchased at the federal level. We also continue to pursue some therapeutics. We currently have access to some 1.7 million treatment courses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172079">Before I close, I would like to take a moment to thank the hard-working public servants who are behind these actions. They have served their communities well, and I cannot commend their efforts enough. I would also like to honour the memory of those we have lost, the friends and families who are grieving, those who have made incredible sacrifices and everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19. Of course, we pay tribute to Canadians across the country who continue to work hard in our fight against the virus on the front lines of our health care system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172080">It has been a long two years, and we know everyone is ready to move on. Public Services and Procurement Canada will continue to deliver for Canadians as we work to finish the fight against COVID. I want to thank the <Affiliation DbId="278934" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, the department and the officials for their dedication and hard work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172081">I have a question for the <Affiliation DbId="278934" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and here is the preamble. The COVID-19 pandemic is still fresh in the minds of Canadians, and it is still too soon to say it is completely over. We all remember seeing the hospitalization rate and, sadly, even the death tolls on the news. We remember the restrictions and safety measures that were implemented by all levels of government to keep people safe and stop the spread of COVID-19. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172082">We remember how difficult it was to refrain from visiting loved ones, how hard it was on businesses, on children in day cares and schools, on parents, on everyone, but we also remember how Canada made it through the pandemic before many other developed countries. We remember how Canadians stepped up to help their neighbours in a time of crisis. We are proud that when the COVID-19 vaccine became available, Canadians rolled up their sleeves and did their part to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities, giving Canada one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172083">Canada is now ahead of the curve on pandemic preparedness for any future outbreaks of COVID-19 and is well placed for any similar events in the future. The government has made it priority number one to keep Canadians safe, and we will continue to do so. While we are all eager to finish the fight against COVID-19 and return to normal, Canadians need to know that this government has done what was necessary during an extraordinary period to help Canadians pull through. All Canadians know this government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was timely, comprehensive and crucial to the millions of Canadians affected by the necessary restrictions implemented in Canada and across the globe at this time.</ParaText>

That has always been our goal, to look ahead, to plan ahead and to put in place whatever was needed so that we could deliver for Canadians. We did not want to let them down, and we wanted to be smart and prudent and forward thinking and that is exactly what we have done.</ParaText>

I want to thank them together with all Canadians across this country that helped keep safe, whether that was in health care or in grocery stores making sure we had the food, but it was a fantastic effort. I am very proud of the Canadians in this country who worked so hard to get us to the place that we are in today.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7172184">Madam Chair, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this committee to discuss the procurement activities of the Government of Canada and how these are being leveraged to meet our goals for equity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172185">I believe every member of the House would agree that the government wields considerable buying power as one of the largest public buyers of goods and services in this country. Every year, Public Services and Procurement Canada manages or facilitates approximately 23 billion dollars' worth of contracts for goods and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172186">Our procurement activities keep the government functioning so it can serve and protect all Canadians. These procurements generate economic activity and bring money into the hands of Canadian companies, sustaining many thousands of jobs in cities and towns all across this country and contributing to our prosperity as a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172187">Government procurement has always been an important catalyst for change, and the opportunities it provides have never been more evident than they are today. It is our focus as a government to bring our purchasing power to bear as we work to improve the way the government buys goods and services to support Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172188">While our economy is making a strong recovery, we know the pandemic has affected the lives and livelihoods of so many across our country and around the world. Most recently, our bulk procurements of rapid tests, vaccines and therapeutics have helped Canada respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, a top priority for our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172189">We have also seen how these economic hardships have affected some communities more than others. For members of under-represented groups in this country, the pandemic is just the latest in a long history of tragic events that have led us further and further from the image of equality that we want to see for Canada. There is still so much work to be done if Canada is to become a country with equal opportunities for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172190">As this government finishes the fight against COVID-19, we are committed to creating an environment where all Canadians can benefit from a robust economic recovery. That means ensuring that those who are facing systemic barriers to success are able to successfully participate in federal procurement and benefit from our considerable buying power. That is exactly what we have been doing in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172191">We have been consulting businesses led by indigenous people, Black Canadians, other racialized Canadians, women, LGBTQ2+ Canadians and Canadians with disabilities. These discussions have informed us, and we have developed concrete plans to increase their representation in federal procurement to better reflect our country and society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172192">I would like to now take a few minutes to explain in detail our actions to attract a wider diversity in suppliers to government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172193">This government remains committed to building progress to address the inequalities that exist between indigenous and non-indigenous people. As we continue to walk the path of reconciliation, we are working to help indigenous communities seize economic opportunities and promote self-determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172194">This past August, we announced that our government is implementing a mandatory requirement for federal departments and agencies to ensure that a minimum of 5% of the value of their contracts is held by businesses managed and led by first nations, Inuit and Métis people. The new requirement will be phased in, and we expect it to be fully implemented by 2024. It will be mandatory to report publicly on our progress against this target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172195">I would like to make it clear that when it comes to ensuring that indigenous-owned and indigenous-led businesses are full partners in government contracting, the 5% requirement is the floor, not the ceiling. We will continue to work actively with indigenous groups to increase their participation in federal procurement more broadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172196">I would like to remind members of the House that even as this government worked tirelessly to acquire supplies and equipment to support Canada's frontline health care workers and all Canadians during the pandemic, we were also creating opportunities for businesses led and managed by indigenous people. To date, 41 self-identified indigenous businesses have contributed to the government's pandemic response through contracts awarded by Public Services and Procurement Canada for goods and services collectively worth about $197 million.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172197">These contracts represent vital services that include logistics, air charter services, accommodation, cleaning services and IT professional services. They also represent much-needed goods, such as medical and laboratory supplies, masks, hand sanitizers and thermometers, contributing to more than 2.7 billion pieces of personal protective equipment acquired by the government since the beginning of the pandemic. By increasing contracting opportunities, we are able to generate economic prosperity in communities that have not traditionally shared in this country's economic wealth. As we have said many times, this government is committed to reconciliation. That includes increasing the participation of indigenous-led businesses in the federal procurement process, and helping them to succeed and grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172198">Our plan is also to continue addressing barriers faced by other groups that are under-represented in Canada's business community: Black and racialized Canadians, women, persons with disabilities and LGBTQ2+ Canadians. In January, Public Services and Procurement Canada launched the supplier diversity action plan, which includes concrete steps to increase the participation of businesses from under-represented groups in federal procurement. The foundation for this plan was the result of a number of pilot projects. One of these projects involved opening select bidding opportunities in several regions for various goods and services to Black-owned and operated businesses. The department then invited a number of these businesses to answer an online questionnaire about their experiences with federal procurement. This information has been helping PSPC improve efforts to attract more Black-owned and operated businesses to offer their goods and services to government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172199">A cornerstone of the supplier diversity action plan is the policy on social procurement. This policy demonstrates our government's commitment to using procurement toward greater economic and social opportunities for under-represented groups. The policy empowers procurement specialists to pursue this objective in their day-to-day work. By enacting this policy, our government is making it clear that including more under-represented groups among our suppliers is now a core objective of our procurement function.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172200">I would like to highlight some of the ways in which our government is working to increase the participation of women-owned and led businesses in federal procurement. Encouraging women-owned and led businesses to do business with government will help ensure that our economic recovery after the pandemic will be strong and inclusive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172201"> To help increase diversity and social procurement, Public Services and Procurement Canada is providing education and assistance on federal procurements to under-represented groups across Canada through the Procurement Assistance Canada service, formerly known as the Office of Small and Medium Enterprises. Small and medium-sized businesses can take advantage of webinars, seminars and events organized by regional offices across the country to learn more about how to do business with government. In addition, as part of the supplier diversity action plan that I mentioned earlier, these offices now offer personalized coaching to give targeted advice to enterprises that have previously bid on government contracts but have not been as successful as they could have been. The coaches provide information and tools that help guide companies through their bidding process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172202">When this government took office in 2015, one of the principles it wanted to reinforce was that Canadians should see themselves reflected in their government. Diversity and inclusion are crucial so that all Canadians feel they are participating in society. Can the minister elaborate on what actions her department has taken to help diversify the Canadian government's procurement process and to have the vendors and suppliers the government buys from better reflect the Canadian people it is serving, while advancing reconciliation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172203">Madam Chair, I would like to assure Canadians that I am fully committed to ensuring the diversity of the Government of Canada's procurement process. This is an extremely important initiative for me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172204">As part of our efforts to diversify, we have issued RFIs to gather input from Canadian Black businesses, businesses owned and operated by persons with disabilities, and businesses owned or led by members of the LGBTQ2+ community. We have held round table discussions with Black businesses and indigenous businesses to hear first-hand how we can increase their participation in the procurement process. In addition, through mandate commitments, we are going to continue to advance government-wide initiatives to increase diversity of bidders on government contracts. We are going to continue to move forward on other procurement commitments, including better tools, simpler processes and increased opportunities for diverse businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172205">We are making good progress on the indigenous procurement front. We are modelling this work with broader diversity objectives within the supply chain. We have a supplier diversity policy that came into force a year ago. That gives us more latitude in how we run procurement processes. We are now turning that into an actual program of work as to how we can use those flexibilities to increase the diversity in supply chains. There is a lot of outreach that is being done with different groups to try to make it easier, including e-procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172206">We developed a policy on social procurement to leverage purchasing power, to achieve socio-economic objectives and increase supplier diversity. The policy will contribute to reducing barriers and enhancing economic and social opportunities for under-represented groups, such as indigenous peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, women, LGBTQ2+ Canadians and other under-represented groups, including socio-economic objectives in federal procurement, which improves best value for Canadians by balancing spending with achieving important policy goals. This I spoke about before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172207">It is important for me. It is not just the right thing to do and the morally correct thing to do, but it is also the smart thing to do because once we open up opportunities, bring down barriers and have a level playing field, that creates a system where people who previously faced barriers are going to be supported. That is exactly why, at the end of the day, it is not just the right thing to do, but economically we can elevate, support and allow companies to have access and experience success, because we know the potential is there. We want to tap into and unleash that potential because we know the benefits that it is going to create.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172208">We are currently asking suppliers to voluntarily self-declare if they identify with an under-represented group. This is in line with other self-attestation approaches used in the procurement process. We will work with other departments and under-represented businesses and associations to explore and improve the certification approach, including the consideration of third-party certification. These are some of the measures that we are taking in this regard.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7172291">Madam Chair, we have heard today about the important work of Public Services and Procurement Canada. As the government's central purchaser and real property manager, the department is in a unique position to help reach important goals, and that includes our commitment to fighting climate change. Canadians deserve a clean, safe and sustainable environment now and into the future. The science on this front is clear. Human activities are driving unprecedented changes in the earth's climate, which pose significant risks to human health, security and economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172292">In Canada and around the world, the serious effects of climate change are so evident: coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, ecosystem changes, and risks to critical infrastructure, among other threats. That is why we have been hard at work implementing forward-thinking policies that will protect our environment now and leave the next generation with a cleaner planet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172293">I can say what we have is a solid plan to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions through investments and support for green industries as we transition toward a low-carbon future. Part of that means we need to get our own house in order and green our government operations, and that is precisely what we are doing with our greening government strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172294">The greening government strategy is our plan to attain net-zero emissions by 2050. The strategy supports Canada's sustainability goals already set out under the Paris Agreement on climate change and in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. We are on track to deliver the largest emissions reduction in our country's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172295">We have an opportunity here to be a global leader in government operations that are low-carbon, resilient and green. Public Services and Procurement Canada plays an important role in this regard. The department manages more than 20 billion dollars' worth of goods and services annually from thousands of suppliers. As the single largest purchaser of goods and services in this country, the impact the department can make is incredibly significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172296">Our government is committed to being a first purchaser to support the growth of new, clean and renewable power sources as they become available. Our policy on green procurement sets out exactly how we incorporate environmental considerations into our core business practices and drives our work in all of these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172297">This is about using the federal buying power to generate social and economic benefits, and key among those is protecting our environment. As one example of procurement of goods and services with a high environmental impact, we are incorporating elements that address carbon reduction, sustainability and broader environmental benefits. This means we consider things like reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy and water efficiency, and reduced waste in the procurements that we undertake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172298">It also means that we support the use of renewable resources, reduce hazardous waste and reduce toxic and hazardous substances when we make purchases. As we show environmental leadership, we can influence industry and Canadians to choose environmentally preferable and climate-resilient goods and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172299">We are doubling down on this front in our latest budget, tapping into Public Services and Procurement Canada to develop new tools, guidelines and targets. That means eventually more support for the adoption of green procurement across the federal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172300">Greening the federal fleet is another important piece of our plan. Our goal is that the government's light duty fleet will be comprised of 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2030. The federal fleet of the future will differ greatly from the existing one. It will be made up of a variety of low-carbon technologies. Its vehicles will operate efficiently and cost-effectively, and it will have much lower emissions and energy use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172301">Through the energy services acquisition program, we have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 57% from the baseline year of 2005, and we are on track to meet our goal of net-zero emissions by 2030. In addition to procurement, the department is also responsible for managing the Government of Canada's real property portfolio, and it is leading the charge to green our federal buildings, a commitment made under the greening government strategy. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172302">I would note that in Canada, building operations and construction materials account for 38% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We know we must make them more environmentally friendly, and the government must lead by example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172303">We have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our buildings by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 at the latest. I can say that we are making good progress. We are doing it through green building practices by using sustainable materials, optimizing our space usage and lowering energy consumption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172304"> We are also focused on achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as LEED, and Green Globe standards, which recognize the use of green products and materials. I am proud to say we have several LEED gold- or platinum-certified buildings across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172305">Every step counts, and some of the most basic changes we are making, such as converting all lighting in our buildings to more efficient LED lighting, will have a major impact on our efforts. More and more, we are using smart buildings technology, which means we save energy by monitoring and controlling the mechanical, heating, cooling and lighting systems in federal buildings. These systems allow us to make a real impact by using innovative technologies and identifying opportunities for energy savings. It is improving how we manage the energy performance of our buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172306">In 2017, Public Services and Procurement Canada set an important precedent by creating a carbon-neutral portfolio planned to achieve carbon neutrality across our real property portfolio by 2050, with an aspirational target of 2030, and zero carbon for its portfolio, which includes 360 buildings across the country. To that end, Public Services and Procurement Canada implemented a broad investment strategy to rehabilitate our federal buildings across the country. These are major retrofits that will contribute to low-carbon operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172307">The Arthur Meighen Building in Toronto is a great example. Here in the national capital region, work is under way on modernizing Les Terrasses de la Chaudière and the Place de Portage office complexes. Redesigned office spaces in these buildings will offer much more natural light, allowing us to cut costs and reduce dependence on artificial lighting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172308">The government continues to do more to equip buildings with green fixtures and features, such as installing solar panels and green habitats on roofs, as well rainwater capture systems to reduce the buildings' demand on the city's water infrastructure. These steps transform our buildings, and this change in how we think about the way we work will usher in a new era of sustainable green government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172309">In another major greening project, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are modernizing the network of plants that heats and cools over 80 federal buildings in Ottawa. The department manages five central plants that heat and cool more than 80 public and privately owned buildings in the national capital region, including the Parliament buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172310">Modernization will increase safety, efficiency, reliability and environmental performance, and result in a reduction of operating costs and an estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 33%. Future activities will move toward deeper greening by replacing natural gas with carbon-neutral fuels for baseload operation. This is a move that has the potential to reduce total emissions by 90% by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172311">These are just a few examples of the important work happening at Public Services and Procurement Canada to fight climate change. Our government has a solid plan in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so we can leave a healthier, cleaner planet for our kids and our grandkids. Public Services and Procurement Canada is an important part of that plan, and I am proud of the work the department continues to do for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172314">Madam Chair, to begin, I would like to confirm that we are committed to real action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our buildings, as is outlined in my mandate letter. We have opportunities here, and we want to seize these opportunities and demonstrate leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172315">This past year alone, we reported a 57.6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our buildings, as compared to the baseline laid out in 2005 and 2006. This is a result of important actions to improve buildings' energy efficiency, electricity grid improvements and the procurement of renewable energy credits. A decrease of 19% of the remaining emissions is expected by 2025 through the procurement of clean electricity. That is the national clean electricity initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172316">A decrease of 40% of the remaining emissions is expected by 2025, by modernizing the heating and cooling systems for up to 80 buildings in the national capital region. This is referred to as the energy services acquisition program. Additional greenhouse gas emissions reductions are expected as we continue to modernize buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172317">These ongoing actions, in conjunction with achievements to date, will lead us towards achieving over 82% of greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2025 and put us in a very good position to achieve net-zero carbon by 2030 in our buildings portfolio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172318">We also have the Buy Clean strategy. As outlined in my mandate letter, we are committed to reducing the carbon footprint and encouraging green procurement strategies. This includes strengthening federal procurement practices to prioritize reusable and recyclable products in support of our goal of zero plastic waste.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172319">We will also work with our colleagues to introduce a new Buy Clean strategy to support and prioritize the use of made-in-Canada low-carbon products. Protecting our planet is a top priority for our government, and we will continue to do our part in promoting ecofriendly practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172320">We also have made efforts on the electric vehicle front. We are committed to greening government at all levels of procurement. As the manager of the government fleet, we have standing offers for light-duty vehicles that include electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172321">In the past three years, we have procured 1,187 zero-emission and hybrid vehicles. We will continue working with industry to ensure we are finding new ways to support green procurement opportunities.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7172414">Madam Chair, I would like to take this opportunity to speak to one of Public Services and Procurement Canada's most important responsibilities. This department ensures the ongoing delivery of defence procurement so that those who serve us so bravely have the equipment they need to carry out their important work. We are guided by “Strong, Secure, Engaged”, our government's defence policy, which sets out clear direction on priorities over a 20-year period. I want this committee to know that we have been making progress when it comes to defence procurement in support of policies we believe in and will continue to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172415">In late February, when Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, the world rapidly changed, and countries around the world, including Canada, had to rethink defence postures. Since then, our government has supported Ukraine with concrete actions, which include implementing severe economic sanctions against Russia and providing military equipment to the Ukrainian people as they defend courageously their sovereignty, freedom and independence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172416">Russia's actions have been a wake-up call for the world's democracies, reminding us that we must stand together in defence of the values we share, and that a strong modern military capacity is needed for the protection of all sovereign nations. Budget 2022 provided more than $8 billion in defence spending over five years, which is on top of the already planned increases associated with “Strong, Secure, Engaged”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172417">I want this committee to know that PSPC stands ready as we reassess our priorities in the face of new threats, and we remain focused on moving forward on defence procurement. That includes holding open competitions whenever possible because that is the best way to get the right equipment at the right price and with the most benefits to Canadians. Above all else, we need to make sure that our Armed Forces have what they need to get the job done. Allow me outline some of our achievements on this front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172418">When it comes to air defence, we are delivering. That includes our ongoing work to purchase new fighter jets, which represents the most significant investment in the Royal Canadian Air Force in more than 30 years. This is a highly complex procurement and we have delivered on our promise to Canadians to hold an open, fair and truly competitive process. Our goal from the beginning has been to ensure that we are getting the right aircraft at the right price while maximizing economic benefits to Canada. We worked with potential suppliers and foreign governments early and often to obtain feedback on our process and Canada's needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172419">In 2019, we released a formal request for proposals to eligible suppliers. Three of those suppliers submitted proposals, which were rigorously assessed against elements of capability, cost and economic benefit to Canada by government experts. In December of 2021, the Government of Canada announced that two bidders remained eligible in the process. Earlier this year, we announced that, after careful consideration, the Government of Canada had decided to enter in a finalization phase with the top-ranked bidder. This is an important milestone in the process and means we are on track, as we aim to award a contract for 88 new fighter jets later this year, with the potential of receiving our first jets as early as 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172420">We are making progress in many other areas as well. For example, we also have an active request for proposals to acquire a remotely piloted aircraft system, and we are aiming to award a contract in two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172421">To support our troops on land, we are moving forward on the logistics vehicle modernization project, which is meant to improve the light and heavy vehicle capabilities of the Canadian Armed Forces. We anticipate awarding a contract by 2023. We are engaging with industry to move forward on a number of purchases, including our next generation of fighting vehicles and our enhanced recovery capability projects, to support our Armed Forces. These are only a few examples.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172422">I would like to highlight the important contribution of the ITB policy. The policy requires that companies invest in Canada the equivalent of 100% of their contract value. That means these defence procurements are making immense contributions to jobs, innovation and economic growth across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172423">When it comes to supporting marine-related procurements, which play an important role in defending this country, we have essentially rebuilt the shipbuilding industry in Canada through the national shipbuilding strategy. This is Canada's long-term plan to renew the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy, as well as the Canadian Coast Guard, and it is helping to create and sustain good jobs right here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172424">More than a decade following the launch of the strategy, we have seen five large ships and numerous small vessels delivered. We have also seen the completion of dozens of ship repair, refit and maintenance projects at yards across Canada. To date, more than $20 billion in new contracts has been awarded across Canada, with nearly 18,000 jobs created or maintained annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172425">Of course, we must acknowledge that strains on supply chains and the rising cost of materials have put pressure on many of our projects across the board, but I can say that Canada's marine industry is facing those challenges head on and we continue to make progress. This past year, a second Arctic and offshore patrol ship was delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy and a third was launched into the water, with work continuing on another two ships. Design work also started on the future polar icebreakers and multi-purpose vessels. These are only a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172426">Construction also continued on the navy's first joint support ship, as well as design work on the future Canadian surface combatants. That project is the biggest of all of our shipbuilding projects, a multi-billion dollar endeavour that will span the next 20 to 25 years, and the resulting ships will form the backbone of our Royal Canadian Navy. Several repair, refit and maintenance contracts were also awarded on behalf of the Coast Guard and navy, generating hundreds of jobs and significant economic benefits to communities across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172427">Hard-working Canadians at our official partnership yards, Seaspan on the west coast and Irving on the east, have been doing their part and are keeping our projects going. This past year, we have also made progress in the multistep process to select a third official shipyard under the national shipbuilding strategy and, of course, many smaller shipyards and numerous suppliers across Canada are all playing a role in our revitalized shipbuilding industry. For those who serve in the air, on the land or on the sea, we are delivering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172428">Canada must always be ready to respond to evolving global circumstances to ensure that we are meeting our international obligations and that the Canadian Armed Forces are prepared to fulfill the missions we ask of them. Our government is committed to immediately reinforcing Canada's national defence. PSPC stands ready to build upon our achievements and to further bolster the capabilities of our forces. Canadians take great pride in the men and women who serve, and nothing is more important than making sure that they have what they need to keep Canada safe and secure.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172429">Recent events have shown that we continue to live in a dangerous world where some nations are willing to flout international law by assaulting and even invading other nations without cause. It is a world where the strong will sometimes use their military advantage to take what they want by force. This is not the world that we want to live in or strive to create, but it is today's reality. Canada has been fortunate not to be the victim of such an attack in recent history, but Canada has always stood up for what is right and has defended its partners and allies across the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172430">Two things are essentially required to be able to do this: brave men and women and the proper equipment. The Canadian Armed Forces is stocked with courageous Canadians ready to defend this country and its values. It is the government's responsibility to provide the adequate military equipment to these brave men and women so that when we do make this grave request of them, they will be as safe as possible and have the right tools for the job. This means everything from boots and helmets to jets and ships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172431">Public Service and Procurement Canada, in partnership with the Department of National Defence, has been procuring a range of equipment, arms, vehicles and more for our military. These are often complex procurements with many moving parts. We have been committed to open competitions and assuring that these contracts support Canadian industries as much as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172432">The workers in the shipbuilding and other defence industries are giving their best for Canada. The men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces do the same every day. The same is expected from the Canadian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172433">Could the minister please detail some of the important investments this government has made in the Canadian Armed Forces based on the “Strong, Secure, Engaged” defence policy in order to provide our military men and women with the best equipment and keep Canadians safe?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172434">Mr. Chair, I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of our Armed Forces, a sentiment I know is shared by all sides in the House, for the incredible work that they do. I was pleased to join with almost everybody here to vote for a motion to increase our defence spending up to 2% of our gross domestic product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172435"> We have made progress since 2015. In 2015, we were at about 1%. We are now at 1.37%, and with the additions in the budget this year, we are going to move up to 1.5%. We still have more to do, but we know, based on the threats in the world today, we need to invest in our Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172436">I am so pleased that we are also creating economic benefits and good middle-class jobs here in Canada from coast to coast through substantial investments in equipping our military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172437">Let me talk about the national shipbuilding strategy. Over the last 10 years, we have invested $21.07 billion in NSS contracts to businesses across the country. Of these, approximately $1 billion went to small businesses of less than 250 employees, and this has created approximately 18,000 jobs being created or maintained in Canada, not to mention all of the spin-off jobs that are created from companies that do business with C-SPAN, Irving and Davie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172438">We have awarded thus far $6.52 billion to Irving; $5.26 billion to Vancouver Shipyards, which is C-SPAN; and $2.26 billion to Davie. Other shipyards have received $7.03 billion. We are also providing the most advanced military jets, the 88 fighter jets that are being ordered. At this point the contract is being negotiated with Lockheed Martin. They are the biggest investment we have made in the Air Force in a generation. We launched a transparent competition in order to procure those jets starting in December 2017.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="279317" Type="18">Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (Senate), Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7172508">Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to address committee on an extremely important and long-standing issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172509">Our government is committed to eradicating forced labour from our supply chains. As we all know, these horrendous practices are as prevalent today as they have ever been. We have all heard the numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172510">The International Labour Organization estimates that some 25 million people are subject to forced labour around the world every day. That is every single day that the most vulnerable citizens of the world, young and old, are subject to what amounts to modern-day slavery, and we have all heard the reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172511">Forced labour spreads in countries where institutions are corrupt, where governments do not provide oversight, where workers lack the protection of labour laws, and where journalists are persecuted for reporting on it. We should be nothing less than completely outraged by this, and I know that we all agree that there is no place in the world for these human rights abuses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172512">However, the fact is that these practices are inextricably linked to global supply chains. We cannot participate in these supply chains without doing our part to ensure their integrity. We have a duty to act with a whole-of-government approach and in collaboration with our international partners to truly make an impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172513">Of course, the pandemic has made us all too aware of hyper-competitive markets, and a stretched global supply chain can foster forced labour. At the beginning of the pandemic, we knew that we had to act quickly in a highly competitive global market to literally save lives, and we did just that, but we must acknowledge that a strained global supply chain increases the risk of goods having been produced using forced labour. We all know that this is completely unacceptable, and there is no doubt that the pandemic has had a devastating, disproportionate impact on the world's most vulnerable citizens. That very much includes those who are already victims of forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172514">If we come up with any solutions, Canada must be part of a concerted global effort, and that is why this government is strongly committed to co-operation at the international level as a means of eliminating forced labour from our supply chains. I will give a few examples of how Canada continues to work diligently with our international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172515">We have been working with the United States and Mexico to prohibit the import of goods produced with forced labour. Canada is working with the European Union as well, to combat the forced labour of workers at sea. We have been working with our allies in multilateral institutions to use all means available to protect individuals from forced labour and remove it from supply chains. We are also sharing information and best practices with other countries that are just as committed to this fight against forced labour. The government is taking a whole-of-government approach through the national strategy to combat human trafficking to eliminate this scourge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172516">Additionally, the customs tariff has banned the import of goods that are mined, manufactured or produced by forced labour into Canada since 2020. To enforce that tariff, the Canada Border Service Agency is in charge of intercepting goods suspected of being produced using forced labour. The agency, Employment and Social Development Canada and other departments are working collaboratively to advance the effective operationalization of the ban. Of course, Public Services and Procurement Canada has an important role to play at the forefront of this, as the minister has outlined in her opening remarks today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172517">We know that all of these activities may prevent the products of forced labour from coming into our country, but they cannot stop forced labour from happening in the first place. The workers have already been exploited; the bottom lines of those businesses are not permanently affected, and the cycle of abuse continues. We need to do more, and we know that our actions must be concrete. That is why the government is taking more substantive measures to ensure that we are not doing business with suppliers or subcontractors that use forced labour. To that end, Public Services and Procurement Canada has taken the lead in maintaining the highest ethical standards for government procurement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172518">As part of the national strategy to combat human trafficking, the department updated the code of conduct for procurement to clearly outline Canada's expectations for suppliers when it comes to human rights and labour rights. The department is also working with its network of suppliers to ensure that they comply with international labour and human rights laws. It is doing so by engaging with suppliers of higher-risk goods and encouraging them to take action against companies in their supply chains that break these international laws. As Canada's central purchaser, the department has made information available to government suppliers about the 2020 amendments to the customs tariffs that ban the import of goods that are mined, manufactured or produced by forced labour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7172519">In addition, as of November of last year, all goods-related contracts awarded by Public Services and Procurement Canada now contain anti-forced labour clauses. That means that the department can terminate contracts where there is credible information that goods have been produced in whole or in part by forced labour or human trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172520">I will note that, in some cases, companies may not know that there may be forced labour in their supply chains, so before terminating a contract, procurement officers will try to work with a company to correct the situation. This is intended to protect the individuals subject to forced labour, who may become even more vulnerable from these actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172521">These are concrete actions that will help in the fight against forced labour around the world, but the issue is a complex one, and the injustices and horrors of forced labour are not always immediately seen, often being well hidden by design and actively overlooked. The fact is it is still extremely difficult to prove that forced labour or child labour were used in the production of products, particularly because they tend to occur in parts of the supply chains that are not always open to scrutiny. That is why the government is implementing a number of additional measures to improve the integrity of our procurement system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172522">We want to shine the light on forced labour and its many victims so that it cannot be ignored. As part of this sustained effort, we have conducted a risk assessment of forced labour in goods procured by the government. This risk assessment is an important step to help determine where supply chains may be vulnerable to forced labour, and the results are providing us with the evidence we need to adjust our approach to tackle the problem into the future. This includes the work to explore and map human rights due diligence obligations and compliance monitoring used internationally. This will inform us as we develop policies in the future to safeguard federal procurement supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172523">We are taking action, but we know there is so much more to do. The mandate letters to the <Affiliation DbId="278925" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="278921" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278934" Type="4">Minister of Public Services and Procurement</Affiliation> demonstrate that combatting forced labour is a major priority for our government. I am certain that my colleagues agree that we cannot stand on the sidelines, nor can we tolerate forced labour in any form, anywhere in the world. We must act, and I know that Canadians expect no less from us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172524">Our government is wholeheartedly committed to upholding human rights and international labour standards. We will continue to make sure that goods produced by forced labour do not enter Canada, bring integrity to our supply chains, and maintain the highest ethical standards for government procurement. For all of the victims and survivors of forced labour around the world, Canada is working to be a leader in efforts to eradicate labour exploitation. I can assure the committee that our government will continue to work with partners across the globe to rid our supply chains of the tragedy and anguish caused by forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172525">If it is permissible, I will now move into asking questions of the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172526">Child labour, forced labour, and even slavery, as hard as it is to believe, are scourges that still exist in today's world. While Canada and the Canadian government do not condone or support the use of these in any way, products made under these conditions are sold on the international market, and it is not always clear or easy to distinguish which ones are made using ethical procurement and which ones are not. While the government does look to Canadian suppliers and manufacturers first when procuring necessary products on behalf of the Canadian people, there are some products that are available only from overseas suppliers. Canada believes in open markets and trades with countries across the globe for an assortment of goods. Although not all labour standards are equal to those in Canada, and not all workers' rights are the same as those in Canada, that will not stop the Canadian government from doing its utmost to avoid supporting in any way the overseas suppliers and manufacturers that exploit workers and children in order to produce their products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172527">I would like to emphasize again that this government realizes that in order to have ethical procurement, it needs to be proactive in determining whether the suppliers it enters into contracts with are abiding by the codes of conduct set out not only by this government, but by a number of international human rights and labour organizations. Price and quality control cannot and will not be the only determinant by which this government does business with overseas suppliers. We respect human rights and labour rights at home and will do our best to support them abroad also in our procurement practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172528"> Can the minister please detail the measures that this government has taken with regard to the issues of labour exploitation and forced labour when dealing with procurement of goods, especially from overseas suppliers and manufacturers?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172529">Mr. Chair, as I have indicated previously this evening, this is an area that is very important to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172530">As the government's procurement authority, PSPC is committed to ensuring that human rights and labour standards are protected and that ethical practices are maintained by suppliers and manufacturers from which we procure vital goods, such as personal protective equipment. Notably, PSPC requires bidders responding to tenders for PPE to certify that they and their first-tier subcontractors comply with a set of fundamental human and labour rights requirements and are free from forced labour discrimination and abuse, with access to fair wages and safe working conditions. This requirement builds on PSPC's policy on the ethical procurement of apparel, which since 2018 requires apparel suppliers to certify that they and their direct Canadian and foreign suppliers comply with a set of fundamental human and labour rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172531">In July 2020, clauses on ethical procurement and origin of work were added into the new PPE contracts and in all newly issued requests for proposals for personal protective equipment. The origin of work clause requires bidders to provide the name, address and country of the manufacturers of the item, including subcontractors. The ethical procurement clause requires bidders to certify that they and their first-tier subcontractors comply with the same human rights and labour standards as set out in the policy on ethical procurement of apparel. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172532">PSPC has made changes to strengthen its contractual framework and has also updated the code of conduct to include new expectations for suppliers and their subcontractors on human and labour rights. It also has implemented new anti-forced labour contract clauses to ensure that we can terminate contracts in the event of violations. These clauses protect the department from financial liability if imported goods are not released at the border because their importation is prohibited under the forced labour prohibition in the Customs Tariff Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172533">In addition, PSPC works closely with other government departments, such as Employment and Social Development Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency. At CBSA's request, ESDC labour provides support by conducting research and analysis on the risk of forced labour for specific complaints or allegations received pertaining to the forced labour import prohibition administered by the CBSA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172534"> Given the complexity and scope of the problem, addressing forced labour will take sustained effort over time. As the member mentioned, four ministers have in their mandate letters the commitment to eradicate forced labour through legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172535"> We look forward to doing more in this very important area.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172538">As a common service provider in the past, PSPC undertook competitive procurements on behalf of the Canada Border Services Agency, and four contracts were awarded to Nuctech, the most recent being in 2019. However, since that time there have been no new contracts awarded to the company, so there have been no contracts from 2019 to the current time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172574">I am speaking to my colleagues from my constituency office, with good reason. I have the great privilege of representing the community of Wendake, which is part of my riding. That is why my colleagues will see the Canadian flag, the provincial flag and the flag of Wendake behind me. I am very proud to represent the Wendake First Nation and to defend their interests and concerns as best I can. However, there is one concern in particular that I just could not wrap my head around when someone from Wendake brought the situation to my attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172575">Wendake is located in the middle of my riding and is therefore surrounded by several of Quebec City's suburban neighbourhoods. About 50,000 people live within a three-kilometre radius of Wendake. In short, Wendake is in an urban environment. Oddly enough, according to the postal code established by Canada Post, Wendake is not in an urban area, but rather in a remote region that is isolated and far from any major cities. That is all false, but unfortunately what I am saying is true. The postal code corresponds to a remote region, whereas Wendake is really embedded in a city. This situation has gone on for too long. We have already discussed this issue in the House and in committee. I will have the opportunity to come back to it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172578">First, I want to take the opportunity to thank Canada Post. During the pandemic, postal employees have worked tirelessly. I know that Canada Post wanted to keep its workers safe, but postal workers, in turn, wanted to keep Canadians safe, so they exercised measures and delivered life-saving medicines and important mail. I want to thank all postal workers for their excellent service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172579">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the member's question. In order to provide timely and consistent service to all Canadians, the cost of mailing items varies depending on the size of the parcel, the distance between origin and destination and the cost of transportation, processing and delivery. Of course, all these decisions are made by Canada Post.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172580">With respect to the issue he is raising, at the root of this issue is that urban cities continue to grow and include rural communities, and this creates a challenge. We are working with Canada Post on the designation of rural versus urban communities. Canada Post works hard to ensure that its prices remain competitive while providing a wide range of services. This has to do with the designation of rural. Time has passed, and communities that previously may have looked rural look different now, so we are working with Canada Post on this.</ParaText>

There are communities across the country that are in similar situations. Since the implementation of the rural moratorium in 1994, Canada's rate of urbanization has progressed every year. Many of the locations that were deemed to be rural at the time of the moratorium have since become urbanized. That is what is at the root of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172586">In order for Wendake to be classified as an urban community, the rural moratorium would need to be amended to represent current demographics. I am in discussions, as I have said, with Canada Post on this. It is not an easy fix. it is more complicated than one might first think. It has to deal with the change in the nature of the rural communities and how they are urbanized.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172588">In 2022, Canada Post is unable to recognize that Wendake is in an urban area. This penalizes the Wendat by forcing them to pay a 30% surcharge to ship goods through Canada Post. This also has an impact on the price of insurance, because insurance is based on postal codes.

              <ParaText id="7172596">SSC plays a vital role in supporting government operations. As a common service provider, SSC works to support the whole of the federal government as it delivers digital programs and services that meet the needs of Canadians. SSC continues to invest in technology and expertise that support an enterprise approach to its IT services and support by enabling federal government departments and agencies to shift toward the use of common IT systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172597">This approach is not only more efficient than individual departments working independently of one another when it comes to their IT, but also safer. An enterprise approach helps the government reduce duplicated costs, achieve faster turnarounds and enhance cross-departmental collaboration when addressing problems. It provides more secure and reliable services and reduces risk. Ultimately, it helps us serve Canadians better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172598">SSC is working on several fronts to make smart, future-looking investments in the interest of better serving Canadians. This modern, adaptable digital approach is working to fully support the needs of Canadians. Through its data centres, networks and cloud service providers, SSC operates an infrastructure that powers the thousands of applications required for government operations that enable the delivery of essential digital services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172599">Over the course of the worldwide COVID pandemic, the Government of Canada has continued to serve Canadians. Much of that work was a result of SSC being able to keep the lights on during those dark and uncertain days. Throughout the pandemic, SSC adapted to our collective new realities by launching new online collaboration tools for thousands of public servants working from home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172600">At the same time, SSC bolstered online portals vital to communicating with Canadians about programs and supports available to them and their families. This was no small achievement. To facilitate virtual work, SSC quickly performed major upgrades to the enterprise network, government-wide Internet and network security, the result being a modern, mobile workforce at the service of Canadians wherever they may be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172601">Recognizing the increased global attention that hybrid working models are now receiving, SSC is continuing to work to implement the technology and network upgrades necessary to enable the effective communication and collaborative tools for employees who will return to their workplace. This kind of digital government needs a high-performing and resilient enterprise network. Shared Services Canada is responsible for providing network infrastructure and services to almost half a million users across government departments and agencies to effectively deliver services to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7172602">In an increasingly uncertain and hostile digital world, cybersecurity has become more important than ever, providing Canadians access to more and more programs and services online while simultaneously meeting the security and privacy expectations of the public. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7172604">As the Government of Canada becomes increasingly digital with public servants working both from home and at work sites, and with more and more services being delivered online to Canadians, cybersecurity becomes more and more of a concern. With remote working having become integral to our operation, the rising dependence of citizens, businesses, industries and governments on everything digital is only going to continue. We need a system that constantly monitors activity, verifies users and limits access within a system. Cybersecurity is and needs to be a priority of our government. Our public servants need to be provided with modern tools, up-to-date government IT systems and digital services delivered to Canadians that are secure, reliable and easy to use at any time from any device.</ParaText>
