We submit this dissenting report on the tech giants' use of intimidation tactics to evade regulation in Canada and across the world. The main report failed to adequately explore the state of censorship in Canada, as well as the roles played by tech giants and the current federal government. This dissenting report is required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671564"> I should say that the committee got to hear from 18 witnesses over the course of the study. Many of those testimonies expressed the censorship of Canadians by the government and tech giants in terms of what they can see, hear and say online, with specific nods to the hindrances being caused by both Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671568">She said: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="311568" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> for seconding this important piece of legislation, called the assistance animals framework for veterans act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671569"> For over 15 years, veterans groups and experts have wanted to see service animals, especially dogs, as part of VAC's mental health rehabilitation program. I have met with many veterans who have bought dogs that were not properly trained. I have met veterans who have become unhoused because tenancy laws do not have rules around making sure that service dogs can live in the home. It is a terrible thing when a veteran chooses to live on the streets to be with their service animal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671570"> The bill would create a framework to provide certainty to the amazing animal training organizations, with clear guidelines to meet so they have a standard they can proudly showcase. It would also protect veterans, who are often taken advantage of; they pay enormous amounts of money for a service dog, but neither the dog nor the group is legitimate. It would also harmonize standards across the country, allowing veterans to have service dogs in rental homes, on trains and on planes. Finally, it would open the door to more Veterans Affairs funding to support those veterans with the service animals they desperately need. Dogs and equine therapy are perfect examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671571"> Canada asks so much of the people who serve our country. This is an important bill that would help many veterans and would make sure the standards of service and training of the dogs and other animals are on a level playing field for all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671572">I want to thank all the veterans, service providers and members of organizations who have talked to me about this issue. I also want to thank Christine Ackermann, from my office, who works so hard on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671573"> I look forward to seeing this come into practice in law.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671575">She said: Mr. Speaker, it is with the support of my very dear colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278188" Type="2">Manicouagan</Affiliation>, that I am immensely proud to introduce a bill that proposes robust measures to strengthen the Employment Insurance Act. It would reform eligibility criteria, the duration of benefits and the amounts provided. I am the Bloc Québécois employment and labour critic and I have been championing and supporting this cause to reform the EI system since my first day in 2019, along with workers and the unemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671576">The Bloc Québécois is taking action where the Liberal government has failed. Its failure is appalling, because it chose to do nothing despite its 2015 commitment to reform the system and its many promises since then. In the wake of the pandemic, the government itself recognized that it had taken too long to act. This policy choice has left thousands of unemployed workers out in the cold, victims of an outdated law that protects them poorly or not at all. The system has failed to adapt to the realities of today's workplace and the resulting injustices and inequities continue, yet the problems and solutions were identified long ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671577">Today we are introducing a Bloc Québécois bill, a solid bill that is aligned to current realities and would better protect a greater number of workers. I am thinking of the workers in the seasonal industry. I am thinking of young people and women who have non-standard jobs and do not have access to employment insurance. I am thinking of pregnant women who lose their job and do not benefit from the protections of employment insurance. I am thinking of the people who are left out in the cold by the system. Thousands of workers who contribute to employment insurance are not protected by the legislation. Employment insurance coverage needs to be expanded to more people. It is about fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671578">Our bill corrects several major flaws with employment insurance and we invite the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages</Affiliation> to also side with the workers, keep their promises and implement the proposals we are making today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671579">Madam Speaker, I move that the 13th report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, presented on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671580">It is my absolute joy to rise in the House today and speak to this important report. I will say at the outset that I am splitting my time with the amazingly talented member for <Affiliation DbId="278471" Type="2">Bay of Quinte</Affiliation>, who is single-handedly going to bring trade back to Canada. I am excited to split my time with him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671581">The order of business today is to talk about the report entitled “Lessons Learned from Canada's Record on Climate Change”, delivered by the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671582">The report was delivered pursuant to Standing Order 108(3)(g) with respect to the public accounts committee. I was pleased to be on the committee when we studied this important report. I will just read a couple of highlights into the record before we get going in earnest with my speech here. It states, “The report further clarifies that although ‘Canada’s population and economy have grown faster than emissions have,’ its GHG emissions ‘have increased since the Paris Agreement was signed, making it the worst performing of all G7 nations since the 2015 Conference.’”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671583"> An update to the report sees that the trajectory has not changed in recent months or years. In 2023, the commissioner wrote in a new report, “While some progress has been made, we are still extremely concerned about the federal government’s ability to achieve meaningful progress”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671584">What we could really entitle both the committee report and the environment commissioner's report is “all pain and no gain”. We have experienced tremendous economic challenges because of the current government's environmental policies, without any real achievements on the environment side. In fact, I had the privilege of asking the environment commissioner some questions, and I will read from the testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671585"> This was a couple of years ago, and the question was, “In the last seven years, has this government achieved any of the international carbon reduction targets?” Mr. DeMarco responded, “Not that I'm aware of”. The pain this has caused without any gain is incredible. We are sitting here among the lowest ranking when it comes to achieving reductions in GHGs, yet we are dealing with the economic pain. A large portion of that can be explained by the government's ideological, reckless, dangerous obsession with the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671586"> We recently received a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, which once again amplifies that it is all pain and no gain when it comes to the government's environment policy. Among other things, the report states that the carbon tax has actually had very little, if any, material impact on our total GHG emissions. This means that the carbon tax's impact on climate change is negligible. In reality, then, one side of the equation is that, clearly, we are not achieving anything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671587"> However, let us look at the financial impact of the carbon tax. We hear over and over again about its fiscal impact. I will just start off by saying that there is an artificial division between fiscal impact, which is the direct impact, and economic impact, which is indirect. The reality is that a Canadian does not get up in the morning and decide that they are going to go with fiscal impact today and economic impact tomorrow. We are all dealt it, so the artificial division between fiscal and economic impact should not even exist, in my opinion. When we look at just the fiscal impact, depending on where we are in the economic spectrum, there are situations where we could be ahead by getting the rebate. That is absolutely true, and I like to be an advocate for the truth. However, the reality is that we cannot live in Canada without the Canadian economy affecting us. When we look at the economic impact, which is the total impact of the carbon tax, nearly all Canadians will be behind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671588"> I just want to read this into the record because there has been a great deal of discussion and debate about the impact of the carbon tax. Let us pick Newfoundland and Labrador. What is the net negative impact in, let us say, 2026? It is $876, so once again people in Newfoundland are behind because of the carbon tax, even including the Liberals' phony rebate. Let us flip over and pick another province: Saskatchewan. Let us go to 2028-29. The average Saskatchewanian household is out $434. Let us flip over to Alberta. The average Albertan in 2027-28 will be out $436.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671589">It is beyond frustrating to sit here day after day, hour after hour and month after month and hear the government not telling the full story, if I am being kind. “Willfully changing the information” would be perhaps another way of casting it. The fact is that when we look at the global economic impact, which is really the only sensical way of looking at the carbon tax, we see that Canadians are behind when it comes to the per household figure. We see the impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671590"> Actually, that does not even fully capture the challenge of the carbon tax, because of course we live in a dynamic economy. The more money we give to the private sector, the more money grows in the private sector in the economy. It is perhaps not surprising that in 2015, when the current government was elected, there was immediately a diminution in our productivity, which has then led to a lower GDP per capita.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671591">GDP per capita is a stat we are probably going to hear about a fair bit, because in Canada it has not risen a bit since 2015. We are facing one of the worst economies in the OECD. GDP per capita really just means per individual. Our economy has not grown, which means that while Canada, because of the growth in its population, may have technically avoided a recession, the reality is that Canadians, individuals, have been in a recession for a very long time, as per capita growth has not risen since 2015.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671592"> The challenge is that, while the Governor of the Bank of Canada is saying that we are in a break-glass emergency, the government just wants to put more and more barriers in front of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671593">One of the bright lights in the Canadian economy is actually the energy sector, which, despite all of the impediments and all of the barriers the government has put in place, continues to work and to thrive. For example, petroleum and petroleum-related products account for 40% of our total exports. What do we do with the golden goose? We tax it and tax it some more, and we try to regulate it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671594">There are many members who, if they could press the switch tomorrow, would cut off Canadian energy. They are radicals and extremists. The reality is that we need clean Canadian energy to power our economy, because right now, as I said, Canadians are in an extended recession that has gone on for years. It has decreased our standard of living and made it tougher for all Canadians to do the things that they want to do, including feeding themselves. That is why two million Canadians are going to the food bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671595">That does not even tell the whole story, because there are students living in cars. There are tent encampments across our country that are the direct responsibility of the government's irresponsible and radical plans for our economy. Its economic malfeasance has led to the lowering of Canadians' standard of living, making every Canadian poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671596">In addition to that, the government has not achieved any of its goals with respect to climate change. It has not lowered GHG emissions. Canada continues to be an outlier and a poor performer when it comes to reducing carbon and other emissions. The government is a failure on every account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671598">Let me pick up on one of the biggest flip-flops in Ottawa, probably in the last generation or so, which has to do with what the member is talking about: the price on pollution, the carbon tax, versus the carbon rebate. The reality is that every member of the Conservative caucus who participated in the last federal election said, “Yes, we support a price on pollution.” Then they got a new, shiny, far-right <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> with MAGA principles, and he came out and said that they were going to do a flip-flop on the issue. As a result, the Conservatives are now all opposed to the price on pollution.</ParaText>

Another one that comes to mind is the flip-flop of the current Liberals when it came to being an open and transparent government. I remember that in 2015 the Liberal government said it would be the most open and transparent government in the history of Canada. Could we maybe walk through a few of the missteps?</ParaText>

I think the main lesson is that oil is very cost-effective and profitable for oil companies. At some point, should the government stop subsidizing these oil companies and giving them tax credits?

Clearly what has happened over the last nine years is that we have not reduced carbon emissions. At the same time, we have put Canada into an absolute economic malaise. Our economy has not grown, for the average Canadian, in the last 10 years, which is making it harder for Canadians to eat. It is making it harder for Canadians to get by every month.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671612">A Liberal walks into a bar and says, “Drinks are on me. Who's paying?” Who is paying are the Canadian people right now with higher taxes, fewer jobs and a struggling economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671613">We just have to look at the facts to see what has happened over the last nine years. With respect to the Canadian per person GDP, the average U.S. worker is now making $22,000 more than the average Canadian worker. We have a struggling economy with high unemployment; the unemployment rate for the U.S. is almost 1.5% lower than it is for Canada. The U.S. has an actual problem as it has seven million jobs it cannot fill. In Canada two years ago, there were a million high-skill jobs we could not fill. That number is now plummeting; there are fewer than 400,000 right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671614">The average personal household debt per person in Canada is at 180%, whereas in the U.S. it is just under 100%. There are Canadians who nine years ago felt that they could pay their mortgage, pay their rent and afford groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671615">Of course, Canada and Canadians have been really focused on the environment. When the government came in nine years ago, it promised that it would be able to better the middle class and better the environment for Canadians. After nine years of the government's mismanagement of the climate and the environment, as well as a bad environmental plan, Canadians have found out now that it has cost them. That is the thing we hear when we hear talk about an environmental plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671616">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that the government will reward those who do the right thing and will punish those who do not do the right thing. However, all Canadians want to do the right thing for their family. They want to be able to get a job. They want to be able to get to work. They want to be able to ensure that their family can go to school and get a good education. They want to ensure that they grow up and are able to afford a home in a safe neighbourhood free from crime and free from corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671617">What Canadians are finding now is that all those things have disappeared, and the government still cries climate and environment over everything else. What that means is that we have only a carbon tax that punishes its citizens and punishes its workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671618"> Yesterday there was an announcement to reduce emissions by 30% in the oil and gas sector, a sector which is already seeing disparity at a time when Canada is going the wrong way. If we want things to go the right way, we should not take out the environmental question but change the way we deal with it. There are good companies in Canada doing great things, but they are growing. The government's environmental policies are like saying they are going into a hot tub and will not pee in the hot tub, but everyone else is. We might think that we are doing a great thing, but we do not exactly have crystal clear water. This is what is happening across the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671619"> We have implemented punishing regulations for all of our sectors across Canada. We have a carbon tax that is punishing our citizens, but if we look to the south of us, the Americans are not doing that to their citizens. They are not punishing their workforce. The Americans have an economy that is performing five times as well as Canada's is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671620">When the U.S. implemented the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, it was supposed to entice clean competition and investment into America. We have seen what has happened: The U.S. gets the supply chains and is getting the results from that. It has clean companies that have decided to put their production in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671621">We were doing a smidgen of that from electric car battery manufacturing or assembly stations in Canada. We were not including our supply chains and we were not including vehicle production. Even when we thought that the only thing we were getting out of it was workers, what ended up happening was that the workers were not even Canadian. For 2,500 jobs at Stellantis in Windsor, 1,600 workers came from South Korea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671622"> We have not been doing the right thing to help Canada and to ensure that we are working within a worldwide phenomenon to help the world when it comes to the climate and environmental policies. That is exactly what we are seeing. <I>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty</I>, a favourite book of the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, talks about how some countries prosper and others fail.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671623">Countries that focused on ensuring that their citizens have savings and can innovate and invest, while at the same time ensuring that they are free, in a capitalist society, to develop their businesses, innovate, invest their IP and find ways to expand their businesses to provide good-paying jobs are the nations that were wealthy and well off, with good democratic systems. Nations that restricted and coerced their industries, and set targets or decided what industries those nations should be in, and I am thinking of the old Soviet empire, failed miserably, with their citizens finding it hard to pay for rent, have good-paying jobs and ensure they had good wealth that they were able to transfer not only to their own generation but also to the next generation. That is exactly what we are seeing now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671624">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> says that she admired this book, but I think she forgot to read it or needs to read it again. The carbon tax punishes our citizens and, more importantly, our workforce. Emissions targets and reductions are being placed on what Conservatives already consider the cleanest energy in the world. People are going to move away from that energy and go to the dirty energy that is not only from dictators but also from nations that do not have any environmental standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671625">We take 15 years to develop mines in Canada for the critical minerals we need for the future of batteries, no matter where they are, yet other nations are doing it in less time. China has 86% of all the mined material needed for batteries across the world. Let us not even talk about the failed trade policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671626">There is an important election today, and the news is going to be dominated by the election down south. Politico said this is the day for the government to release all the bad news because there is going to be no more room for other bad news. There is so much bad news when we look at what is happening across the world and what Canada's workers and citizens could benefit from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671627">We are at third base, and we act like we hit a triple. We have the oil and gas that the world needs. We have critical minerals that the world needs. We have great farms and food production, yet we punish our farmers. We have great IP institutions and universities that create great ideas, and if we just learned how to commercialize those ideas, we could get those ideas out and become a leader in the world in technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671628">We have some of the greatest people in the world who come up with the greatest ideas, so entrepreneurs and small businesses that need a leg up can grow and create jobs. Small businesses make up 98% of businesses in Canada, and they are creating jobs in this country. We need to do more for them. Nations fail because they do not invest in their citizens and they punish them for decisions they are unable to provide alternatives for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671629">If Canadians had the ability to create a different fuel source for their car, they would. If Canadians had the ability to go to a different place of work and get paid a higher wage, they would, but right now they are struggling to keep the jobs they have. If Canadians could figure out a way to afford their mortgages or their rents and make sure they were cheaper, they would want to do that, but because of the housing crisis in Canada, they cannot. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671630">This is all because of the government and its government-knows-best approach, which says that it knows better than the Canadian people and that it can control the environment and the economy. The result, we know, is an economy that is running away much faster from the Americans and other countries than any other nation on earth. We have trade deals that are not helping Canadians or putting Canadians first. We have workers who are struggling to find a decent wage and keep that decent wage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671631">The Liberals may be saying that the drinks are on them, but the reality is that Canadians are being left to foot the bill. It is time for a real plan, one that empowers Canadians, bring jobs home and positions Canada as a leader in both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship. We need a government that would axe the tax, fix the budget, build the homes and stop the crime. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8671658">Madam Speaker, as I was saying, only a MAGA right Conservative, a far-right person like the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, would take that sort of tactic. It is a tactic coming up from the United States and being funnelled through the leader of the opposition's office, quite frankly, or at least greatly encouraged. That is why I was very serious when I posed the question to the member opposite about the degree in which that far-right element was infiltrating and playing such a strong role in policy development in the Conservative Party today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671659">I do not say that lightly, because all we need to do is look at what will be a very important issue in the next election, the price on pollution; the carbon rebate versus the carbon tax. I would like to highlight a couple of points on that. First is the fact that Erin O'Toole, former leader of the Conservative Party, had 337 candidates and an election platform, which indicated that they were campaigning on a price on pollution, a carbon tax. It is nothing new. In fact, I believe 17 to 19 Conservatives campaigned on it a second time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671660"> A good number of them, including their former leader, the current <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader</Affiliation>, campaigned on it not once, but twice. The new shiny <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> comes in, that far-right MAGA guy, and what does he do? He takes this huge flip-flop on this, like a fish on a dry dock. He changed the direction and said that they would cut the tax, or axe the tax. I do not want to misquote the Conservative slogan on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671661">Behind that slogan is a pile of misinformation. The Conservatives are spending millions of dollars promoting misinformation. They try to give people, like the residents of Winnipeg North, the impression that they have a net loss of disposable income as a direct result of the carbon rebate versus carbon tax. That is just not true, and they know that. We would think that would stop them from saying it, but absolutely not. They continue to spread misinformation. Literally dozens of economic and university professors have said that what we have said is true, and the Parliamentary Budget Officer has reinforced that. However, the Conservatives have no qualms in spreading that misinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671662">That is not what I want to share today. I want to address many of the issues brought up by members opposite. Some of this stuff may be completely irrelevant when they start with the character assassination of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When they talk about the Prime Minister, they do not tell us about Stephen Harper, the person they glorify, and I can understand why. Their current <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> is tied so closely to him. Not only was he in his cabinet, but before being in his cabinet, he was his parliamentary secretary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671663"> I have this booklet and it is entitled “ Stephen Harper, Serial Abuser of Power.” People would not believe the number of scandals. The leader of the Conservative Party today is even referenced on a couple of occasions. They are talking about the filibuster in their comments. Stephen Harper and the current <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> were found in contempt of Parliament. They are the only prime minister and parliamentary secretary who have been found in contempt of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671664">Let us fast-forward to the comments we hear from the Conservatives today. They are talking about how we have this privilege issue, and they are right. There is a privilege issue before us today. The reason it is still with us today is because the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party has learned nothing from the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671665">He is engaged in a multi-million dollar political game on the floor of the House of Commons that is in his personal best interest and in the interest of the Conservative Party. That is what we are witnessing. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party is not putting Canadian interests ahead of his party's political interests, and that is unfortunate. This is why I call it a multi-million dollar game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671666"> They make reference to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and a few of the issues to try to generate public interest. I can talk about public interest on a number of issues, in particular, with respect to the leader of the Conservative Party, who continues to refuse to get a security clearance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671667">One of my colleagues has suggested that the rumours are true. The rumours are that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party is hiding something from Canadians. Something is going to prevent him from getting the security clearance and that is the real reason why he refuses to get it. After all, every other leader in the House of Commons has that security clearance. Every other leader is taking the issue of foreign interference seriously and getting that clearance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671668">Only the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party of Canada has chosen not to get security clearance. Why? When the Conservatives start focusing on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as they have already done this morning, I suggest that they need to start focusing on their leader, because when he is too scared to get a security clearance, something in his past is going to come back and possibly haunt them. That is the real reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671669">Then we had the Conservatives talk about the economy. They talk about ideas and how they want to contribute to the economy. Our inflation rate is below 2% today, which is good news. Interest rates are on a downward trajectory. I think they have gone down now maybe three or even four times. We are leading the G7 on the issue. Canada's economy is getting healthier and stronger, yet the Conservatives continue to downplay Canada's economy. It is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671670"> The other day the Conservatives, who have been very critical of the government's approach in regard to housing, had this big rollout of the shiny, brand-new housing policy of the Conservative Party of Canada, going into the next election. Earlier in my comments, I talked about a flip-flop. The Conservatives seriously need to do another flip-flop on this issue. Their housing announcement is a dud. It is a laughable policy. When we have affordable housing being a serious issue, the Conservative Party of Canada says that it will get rid of the programs that will address the issue. It makes no sense at all. Even within the Conservative Party members are already sending mixed messages.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671684">I was talking about how the Conservative policy they just announced would actually be to the detriment of Canadians. It is a dud of a policy.

              <ParaText id="8671686"> At the end of the day, we have mayors, other local officials and Conservative members of Parliament who all recognize the true value of the accelerator fund.

              <ParaText id="8671687">The Conservatives' idea is to get rid of it. I have a sense of who is generating their ideas. We see it in the flip-flop on the price on pollution. It goes back to that far-right element within the Conservative Party today. It is that same grouping, that MAGA right, who is ultimately saying, “We want to cut.” It does not matter which program. We can articulate the true value of the housing accelerator program, but the Conservatives do not care. They would just cut it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671688"> We can think about the dental program. One million-plus Canadians have now benefited from the first-ever nationwide Canadian dental program. The Conservative Party says, “Who cares? We are going to cut that program too.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671689"> The Conservatives talk a great deal about the economy. As a government, we are focused on Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. We want an economy that works for all Canadians. Nothing has changed on that since 2015, when we brought in tax breaks for the middle class, brought in dramatic increases for individuals receiving the guaranteed income supplement and reformed the Canada child benefit program so millionaires would not be receiving the benefits; we enhanced the overall benefit for the average Canadian.</ParaText>

Members can take a look, do a Google search, and see the billions of dollars of additional funding that has complemented the millions that the Government of Canada has invested.</ParaText>

This is a government that understands the importance of infrastructure, whether it is coming up with supportive programs for housing or building the streets and communities where we live. All of that is being supported by the type of question I posed earlier today on the issue of international trade. Contrary to the misleading information the Conservatives talk about, no government has signed off on more trade agreements than the current government in the history of Canada. Canada is a trading nation, which is something that elevates all of us and something the government continues to invest in. We see the true value in reaching out, working with Canadians and dealing with the provinces in the best way we can on how to build a healthier economy and support Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Those are the types of policy decisions, whether on budgetary or legislative measures, that the government has been taking since day one. </ParaText>

Infrastructure was not just created when we came into government.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8671723">Madam Speaker, we are gathered today to talk about a report that I found very interesting when it was tabled more than two and a half years ago, in 2022. It was studied at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671724">Unfortunately, I would have preferred that we discuss a more recent report by the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, because things have changed, and not always for the better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671725">Let us take a look at what the report said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671726">The report states, “Canada has failed to translate these commitments into real reductions in net emissions. Instead, Canada's emissions have continued to rise. Meanwhile, the global climate crisis has gotten worse.” That has not changed. Everyone agrees that that was the case in 2022 and it still is today. The report adds that the country's greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions “have increased since the Paris Agreement was signed, making it the worst performing of all G7 nations since the 2015 Conference.” That is the overall picture painted by the report tabled by the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671727">Now let us look more specifically at the various lessons contained in this report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671728">First, it talks about the need for “stronger leadership and coordination” to end polarization on environmental issues and ensure a degree of consistency. Clearly, this has not been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671729">Second, the Canadian economy remains dependent on sectors that emit a great deal of greenhouse gases, such as the oil sector. I do not want Alberta members to jump all over me—we already hear enough from their premier. Canada is an oil country, and thus a polluting country on a global scale. The commissioner stated in his report that “Canada's economy is still dependent on emission-intensive sectors”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671730">In its strategy to combat climate change, the Liberal government provided a green support during the pandemic to help oil and gas companies make their operations more environmentally friendly. However, according to Environmental Defence Canada, the federal government awarded over $20 billion in subsidies to the oil and gas industry in 2020 alone. After the pandemic, despite the assistance for the transition, the oil and gas sector continued to collect subsidies. The result is that the sector's emissions continued to rise. I will return to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671731">The third lesson we learned is that “adaptation must be prioritized”. If we eventually realize that the fight against climate change and mitigation measures are not working because of a failure to impose a carbon tax or to ensure that the highest-emitting industries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, we must resign ourselves to this fact and turn toward climate change adaptation policies. This is indeed a must.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671732">To that end, Ottawa will have to stop collecting all the money without redistributing it intelligently and will have to give the money to the municipalities, because in many respects it is they who will incur the costs of climate change in dealing with new floods, water and resource treatment or management, increasingly severe storms that will destroy municipal infrastructures, and so on. They will need help. In fact, the Union des municipalités du Québec released a report indicating that the climate change expenses municipalities incur will go up by 12%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671733">The fourth lesson is that “Canada risks falling behind other countries on investing in a climate-resilient future”. I think we can drop the word “risks” here. Perhaps that was the case in 2022, but today Canada does not risk falling behind other countries. It already has. It is perfectly clear. Canada is a G7 laggard and everyone knows it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671734">The fifth lesson is about “increasing public awareness”. The public must be made more aware of the fight, but also of the adaptations needed to deal with climate change. Not much was done. Among the few measures taken, there is one that is so absurd that I feel the need to point it out to the House. A provincial minister paid a gas-powered truck to drive 24-7 to protest the cap proposed by the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>. Members will soon find out which province I am referring to, because instead of funding her province's education system and rebuilding Jasper, the premier paid a truck to come here to Ottawa to burn gas just to say we should stop putting caps on things, that we should continue to emit GHGs, that it is important and that polluting the planet is a constitutional right. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671735">It is absolutely ridiculous, I must say. How can Albertans allow their premier to do things like that instead of looking after her people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671736">The sixth lesson is that “climate targets have not been backed by strong plans or actions”. That has not changed, either. As far back as 2009, G20 countries, including Canada, agreed to phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. However, we are still waiting for information about how this commitment will be put into practice. We got amazing commitments in 2009, and the it was radio silence until yesterday, when the minister finally made a somewhat controversial announcement. I will get back to that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671737">The seventh lesson is that “enhanced collaboration among all actors is needed”. This is nothing new, and I cannot say that there has been any improvement there either. If the federal government is to finally understand that there are provincial and municipal jurisdictions, it must begin by acknowledging that it should not collect all the money and redistribute it in the provinces' jurisdictions with strings attached. That is not how that works. The government needs to start working with the provinces and Quebec and with the municipalities to give them back the money owed them. Municipalities must be able to do what they need to do without strings attached.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671738">The eighth lesson learned from the report refers to an “intergenerational crisis”. We have heard that term a lot lately. People talk about intergenerational equity. As a young mother, I really wonder what kind of a planet we will be leaving to our children. There is a question of responsibility here. Our responsibility is to care for our seniors and think about the future. One does not preclude the other. We can help seniors by increasing OAS and stop subsidizing the oil industry at the same time. It is a win-win situation. We are helping future generations as well as seniors: a miracle solution, apparently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671739"> The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> announced that he wanted to put a cap on emissions in the oil and gas sector. I applaud the initiative. I think it was a long time coming. It was addressed by the G20 countries in 2009. However, we are basically continuing to subsidize an industry, hoping that it will change, hoping that it will adopt greener technologies. We have finally come to realize that emissions do not decrease by themselves and that we need to stop giving the oil and gas industry subsidies. They make enormous profits. Finally, they themselves need to change to ensure a green and equitable transition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671740">Equiterre was at the committee meetings where we discussed the report. We invited the organization, which was consulted by the commissioner for sustainable development. Its representative, Mr. Viau, told me at the time that we had to wean ourselves from our economic dependence on the oil and gas sector and make a fair and equitable transition. In particular, he mentioned that he was afraid that Canada would put all its eggs in one basket and invest in carbon storage. I think he can predict the future. In 2022, he knew very well that Canada would opt for this bogus solution to give the oil and gas industry a reason to keep polluting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671741">The answer we recently got from some of the provinces is frankly shameful. How can anyone look in the mirror and say that they want to continue polluting the planet? Seriously, how can a person like that sleep at night? Are they thinking at all about other people? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671742">Let us talk about the Constitution. Those who say that this type of thing is anti-constitutional are wearing blinders. We are talking about climate change. Climate change has no borders. Here is a tip for those people who do not understand how things work. A tonne emitted here will have the same impact here as in China, France and everywhere else. The same applies to a tonne emitted in China. It is everyone's business.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671743">The responsibility for climate change is an individual one. Just because a country has an oil industry and is sitting on reserves of black gold does not mean that it is relieved of that responsibility. We really need to look at what we are doing not only as citizens, but as legislators as well. We have a responsibility to future generations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671744"> Let us talk a bit about what was said. Let us talk about the reactions to the cap on emissions in the oil and gas industry and the fantastic slogan. Frankly, there is not much difference between “axe the tax” and “scrap the cap”. It is a different version of the same thing. It is really shameful. Anyone who uses facile slogans thinks people are stupid. Anyone who uses facile, three-word slogans is saying that people do not understand the subtleties of climate change. It is shameful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671745">We know that the costs associated with climate change are enormous, so this is a matter of responsibility and intergenerational fairness. The studies and the economists are unanimous. Yes, we still need oil, but that is because we still have not come up with a real plan to wean ourselves off the oil and gas industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671746">Quebec is leading the pack at this. I could go on and on about how well the cap-and-trade system has worked. We have reduced our per capita emissions. Our reductions are far and away the best in Canada. It would be a big problem if a country were to institute an entry tariff to offset its emissions. There is no risk that such a thing would happen in the United States, but the European Union is considering this option very seriously as a way to avoid importing goods from heavily polluting countries. If that type of policy is put in place, Canada will really be a problem, and Quebec will have one more reason to leave Canada once and for all, not that we need another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671747">According to a study commissioned by the Union des municipalités du Québec and carried out by WSP and Ouranos, it will cost Quebec municipalities at least $2 billion more per year. That is what I was talking about earlier. Their total spending for adapting their infrastructure to climate change will increase by 12%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671748">Let us just talk costs. Since 2010, the costs of weather-related disasters have amounted to 5% to 6% of Canada's annual GDP growth, up from an average of 1% in previous decades. A report by the Canadian Climate Institute titled “Damage Control: Reducing the Costs of Climate Impacts in Canada” estimates that by 2030, Canada could experience annual losses of $35 billion in real GDP. Speaking of GDP, the real GDP losses due to climate change are in the tens of billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671749">I myself worked on an Ouranos study commissioned by the Quebec government. The Quebec government had asked us to calculate the cost of climate change. That was just before the Paris accord. This was in a past life, about 10 years ago, but we are still in the same dynamic because not much has changed. The costs and sectors that were analyzed were things that we may not think about every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671750">Of the two major sectors, health and infrastructure, let us look at health. Heat waves are becoming increasingly common because of climate change, and they mostly affect seniors. Every year, people die as a result of heat waves. Long-term care homes still have not been adapted to address this issue. There are still major issues with air conditioning in some places. No adaptations have been offered for seniors aging at home. They are paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671751">Then there are zoonotic diseases, which are transmitted by vectors that are spreading because of climate change. One example is the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. Because of climate change, mosquitoes now arrive earlier in the year and leave later. They are also moving northward. Since they carry the West Nile virus, in some cases, the disease is spreading more widely. Another example is Lyme disease, which is increasingly occurring in Quebec. That is because of climate change.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671752">Lyme disease is spreading because temperatures are rising and carriers are moving northward more and more. We were not really prepared to recognize the symptoms of Lyme disease, because it is a new disease for people living further north in Quebec and the rest of Canada. Lastly, there are allergies, which are also costing the public more and more. When people suffer from severe allergies, they are less productive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671753">Now let us turn to infrastructure. I do not think there are many people in the House who can say that they have not seen more flooding. Extreme weather events have increased and are very costly. Look at what is happening in Valencia, Spain. It is a disaster. Officials are still searching for bodies after the city was hit by torrential rains. Closer to home, Quebec also experienced torrential rains the night of August 9 that caused a lot of costly damage. We do not know what the insurance companies are going to do about the tens of thousands of vehicles that were lost and the houses that flooded. This is costly. It costs money, and it is something we can see with our own eyes. These events are going to get even more frequent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671754">Then there is shoreline erosion due to rising water levels. We are going to see more erosion and have more roads, houses and people to relocate. That costs money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671755">Lastly, there is the permafrost. For the first nations living in places where the ground is normally frozen, climate change is causing the ground to thaw, and their houses have to be completely rebuilt because they are falling down. We know how big a problem housing already is on some reserves and in some places where first nations people live. Climate change is only making the problem worse. We still hear people saying that it is unconstitutional to think about the future of Quebeckers and Canadians. I cannot understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671756">We have come to realize that, despite its grand promises and the good intentions of some of its ministers, who I believe are sincere, the Liberal government still has not managed to do much. The carbon tax will unfortunately be an election issue, not so much in Quebec, but in the rest of Canada. It is a shame, because it should be obvious when we look at Quebec, which has a cap-and-trade system that is working. Has Quebec performed less well economically? The answer is no. On the contrary, before the pandemic, Quebec had the highest growth rate in Canada, even with a cap-and-trade system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671757">Greenhouse gas emissions can be delinked from the economy. Carbon emissions and economic growth can be decoupled. That is what is known as absolute decoupling. Quebec and France have both shown that it is possible, but Canada is very far off. The Liberals promise the sun and moon but never keep their promises, while some Conservatives do not even believe in climate change and think we should continue to pollute. They look in the mirror and tell themselves they have the right to pollute. Things are looking pretty grim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671758">All I can hope for, especially when it comes to the environment, is that Quebec gains its independence once and for all.</ParaText>

That was the case when the previous Conservative government was in power and it remains the case today with the Liberals in power. It makes no sense when we consider all the things we could be investing in to really change things up. For example, investing in green energy would create far more jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671763">I would like to know whether my colleague agrees with the NDP that it is ridiculous to keep providing oil companies with billions of dollars in subsidies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671764">Madam Speaker, as I mentioned in my remarks, I am as outraged as he is, perhaps more, about the subsidies being given to Canada's oil and gas industry. As I mentioned, these subsidies came to about $20 billion in 2022 alone. It is absolutely ludicrous that this government cannot scrape up $5 billion a year to help seniors but continues to hand over $20 billion to the oil and gas industry, which is making exorbitant profits at the expense of future generations. I think that is an utter disgrace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671765">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague on her excellent speech, which was very clear and included some very insightful points. A few times, she brought up a very important issue, namely local infrastructure. We see billions of dollars being handed to oil companies, which will use these subsidies to continue polluting. We also see what is going on in the municipalities. The member referenced the floods in August. Berthier—Maskinongé was hit very hard. The vast majority of our municipalities suffered severe damage. This calls for investments, so the government needs to free up the money and decentralize it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671767">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his excellent question, which actually gives me the opportunity to point out that, although the federal government touted its recent budget measures aimed at helping municipalities, that funding comes with strings attached. For example, it said that it wanted certain funds to be used for water treatment, but municipalities may have other needs, unfortunately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671768">The federal government's obsession with centralizing everything and thinking that, ensconced in its ivory tower, it knows better than mayors what their municipalities need is completely crazy. Basically, what the federal government needs to do is stop centralizing everything. Unfortunately, it collects way too much money, and it needs to give that money back to Quebec and the municipalities so they can really fight climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671783">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleagues for what is a very important debate on the climate crisis that everyone across the globe is facing. We share this planet. We share a future. Our children, of course, will have to share the consequences of decisions made in this place, but also decisions made in all of our lives. In this report, the environment commissioner has made it very clear that we are approaching a detrimental future. I would like to quote from the report. It states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671784">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Despite commitments from government after government to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past 3 decades, Canada has failed to translate these commitments into real reductions in net emissions. Instead, Canada’s emissions have continued to rise. Meanwhile, the global climate crisis has gotten worse.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671785">This is a serious warning from the independent commissioner of the environment for our country. Canada is one of the largest countries in the world. If the climate crisis is one that impacts land, we are to be greatly impacted. In the north Arctic regions, we see issues of melting ice that are dramatically impacting the ecosystems there, making it so that generations of Canadians may no longer ever get to see a polar bear. Right now, indigenous hunters are in the season of trying to find moose in my part of the country and they are finding it more difficult to because of the rapidly changing environment. People in urban centres have been choked by smoke at increasing rates, something that generations before had not experienced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671786">I hope this question unites all of us as colleagues: What do we do about this rising concern? What I have heard from the Liberals is that things are fine. Meanwhile, a planet is on fire. They are giving billions of dollars to oil resource companies and most of them are foreign owned. That is in addition to a Conservative Party that wants to wield power, and is using the climate crisis and the rejection of the science as a way to get there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671787">New Democrats are often found in this tough position of being brokers of a better morality in this place and I hope a better future for all of us. We pose that question in the hopes of an optimistic reality or future and I think, given the circumstances of all of us being in the same place, if we could put aside our partisan differences, this would be one of the issues we would do it for. That is my greatest hope in this debate. I think Canadians will continue to judge us on the remarks we make in this place for many generations to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671788">There will be a moment in our history when our children look back at the transcripts of when we debated these things, including today. Everything that we say will be quoted by generations in the future. That could be generations who are suffering from the reality of an impacted climate in which they cannot breathe, cannot find clean water or are having difficulty paying for food because the cost of living would increase so greatly. This is because of the mysterious but very present reality of the impacts of climate change that continue to unfold in front of our eyes. We still have not even faced the greatest consequences of this immense challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671789">On top of all this is the question of affordability. There seems to be a conflation in our country, brought on largely by partisan politics that are trying to achieve an environment and a future with low emissions, simultaneous to a healthy environment, clean water and honouring the treaties we have made with indigenous people to protect this place. There are also the very real and tough discussions around how we can create and protect good jobs, and how we make certain that Canadians continue to put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671790">People, particularly in Alberta, and particularly Conservative politicians, are attempting to put people at odds with one another on this question. They attempt to put at odds a worker's future to bring in a paycheque, with the fact that if they do agree with climate change, they are going to impact their own industry. This kind of false dichotomy hurts workers, and it hurts our children most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671791">I am a former oil and gas worker, and I know this sector very well. I grew up in the northeast part of Alberta working in the Cold Lake oil sands. I know exactly what it is like try to get a paycheque to feed a family. I know how difficult it is for thousands of northern Alberta workers, thousands of indigenous people, and, of course, our children who are asking questions of when or if we will stop, and whether or not their future is truly worth it. This is an area where workers have to take a central role. Workers' jobs and their livelihoods need to be protected. It is very clear. This is the most important priority in this work. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671792">If we are to truly address the climate crisis, we have to address a few major topics related to this crisis. My number one point today will be on the financialization of natural resources, publicly owned resources, of megacorporations that are depriving Canadians the opportunity for a better future and, of course, better jobs. The question I want answered is: Who is benefiting from the extreme fossil fuel development in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671793"> In Alberta, at one point, we had a very noble premier, I think one of the most popular ever, and his name was Peter Lougheed. Peter Lougheed created Crown corporations. When Texaco came to Alberta and threatened Albertans by saying it would pull out all of its assets if Albertans did not let it absolutely destroy everything it wanted without having to clean it up, he said no, Albertans would do it themselves. He created some of the lasting Crown corporations we still have today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671794">Unfortunately, consecutive Conservative governments would sell off those oil companies. Even worse, at the federal level, we saw Stephen Harper green-light the largest purchasing of a foreign state-owned entity of a Canadian asset, which is the Canadian natural resources takeover by Chinese-owned Nexen, green-lit by Stephen Harper's Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671795">The question is: Who is actually benefiting from our oil production? It is certainly not the rural communities that have much of the development in their backyard. I know that from experience. My dad, a worker in the oil sector, died. He got killed on a lease site because of the lack of safety or concern by some of these oil companies. We see municipalities in Alberta still today being deprived of basic taxation. I am a Canadian taxpayer and, as my colleagues in the chamber would know, if I do not pay my taxes, I get a phone call from the CRA and it makes sure I pay. Those penalties are swift, brutal and severe. However, an oil company in Canada, not even owned by Canadians, gets a pass in Alberta. It gets a pass on surface taxes that are owed and the dues paid to rural municipalities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671796">If I had the opportunity to canvass my colleagues, I would ask whether anyone knows the amount of unpaid taxes and tax liability owed to Canadian municipalities. Whether it is the Fishing Lake Métis Settlement; St. Paul, Alberta; Two Hills; High River; Paddle Prairie; or even larger municipal centres like Grande Prairie, we are seeing huge debts building up because the oil companies do not want to pay their fair share. They owe a quarter of a billion dollars in unpaid municipal property taxes to date. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671797">Guess what a quarter of a billion dollars could have gotten those rural municipalities? It probably could have gotten them better roads and better municipal services. They could have maybe held a festival or a fair. They could have even tried to challenge the very real reality that is facing municipalities when it comes to homelessness. However, instead of those resources being paid by oil companies going to municipalities that desperately need them in our small rural communities in Canada, that money is being pocketed by oil barons and CEOs who have made record profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671798">I want to back up a second. In Canada, we often talk about the oil sector as if it is in great need of Canadian support and more financialized public dollars when they are making the largest profits they have ever made in their entire history, in an oil boom that is unseen and unmatched. The fact that these companies, in addition to making record profits, are unwilling to invest that money back into communities is a shame. Worse yet, they are taking first nations to court and, on top of that, not even helping workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671799">l will give an example. In Alberta, the Labour Relations Board held a hearing alleging unfair labour practices by a company enjoying the fruits of massively profitable oil and gas products. The president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 401 said, “They’re asking for concessions when [the oil and gas sector] is making record profits—we’re not going to take a $7 rollback when inflation is at six per cent.” That is a shocking reality. If people talked to workers, they would find that some of these companies are attempting to reduce wages. People who make less than $20 an hour were asked to take a $7 rollback. When those workers said no, that they deserved a fair share from the labour that they were doing on behalf of this country, the company fired them. Can colleagues imagine? It is shameful that the company would fire every single person at that camp because they would not accept a $7 cut in their wages on top of the fact that inflation is at 6%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671800">Are first nations being served by these massively foreign-owned oil companies that were sold off by Stephen Harper? No, they are not either. We are seeing some of the worst environmental catastrophes in Canada's history taking place right now. For example, in Fort McMurray, the 2016 wildfire cost us $9 billion in direct and indirect financial, physical health and environmental impacts, including being a regional hub for first nations. Many families are still reeling from this. The first nations then lacked the important goods and services that they relied on. Moreover, 80% of majority indigenous communities in Canada are located in fire-prone regions. This is something we have to consider as we plan our future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671801">We know that, between 1980 and 2021, 16 communities in Canada were evacuated five or more times. All but two of those were first nation reserves. This is a serious situation that is being faced annually, predictably, by community members, whether we are in a rural municipality or a first nation, including workers. They are just not working for regular working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671802">We have the largest profits in this sector that we have ever seen, but we are seeing the worst outcomes on our streets. In the last three years, we have had the highest price of oil that we have seen in many decades. We would think that if we saw high oil prices, we would see huge investments in new jobs, hospitals, roads and social services. However, we are not seeing that. What we are seeing is that the companies, rather than investing in production in Canada, are at a time when they must pay out their shareholders. They have admitted this; the six major oil companies have all said that. All of their profits are being paid out to the shareholders, many of whom are foreign shareholders, no longer Canadian. It is a shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671803">The Liberals have made this even worse. On top of the fact that we have this major profitable oil sector that is not giving good jobs, increasing wages for our workers, cleaning up the mess it is making in first nations communities or paying its taxes, the Liberals are giving it billions of public dollars. The billions of dollars given to a profitable sector could otherwise go to health care, housing or an enhanced employment insurance program. It could otherwise be invested in helping support a diversified economy. We need jobs in our country, but we also need jobs with companies that pay well; that are not going to give us a $7 rollback when they do not need us anymore; that are not going to say “too bad, so sad”, but they will not pay municipal taxes to our little community so that we can have a seniors bus; and that will not say no to cleaning up the mess when they pollute huge water reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671804">What do we say to companies that say this to Canadians, that are bullying Canadians out of $7 an hour or out of taxation amounts that would be used for supports in their municipality, in their little village or hamlet? What do we say when they tell first nations they will go to court rather than discuss their rights? These are all facts related to this very problematic industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671805">It is true that workers have to be put first in this process, which is why the Alberta Federation of Labour, for example, has proposed an industrial strategy. As a country, during the post-World War II era, Canada had to learn how to retool our economy following war. When we had to fight fascism overseas in Europe, we retooled our economy. By the way, we still have to fight fascism today; its evils persist across our country and across the globe, and we must continue to fight. However, we planned our economy. How did we do it? We raised the largest merchant navy on the globe. Canadians did that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671806"> Remembrance Day will be here soon. It is time for us to remember that. As Canadians, a small little country, we raised the largest merchant navy on the globe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671807">Right here at home, the governments of our country worked together. They built hundreds of Crown corporations and put every single man and woman to work in our country. We produced stuff. We built factories. We invented stuff the world had never seen before. Canadians did this because we had planned properly for the kinds of needs that our economy had to meet. Right now, our economy does not need to make more profits for billionaires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671808"> Our economy needs to return value to every working person in this country. In doing so, we must fight the climate crisis and unfair labour practices. We must protect the rights of first nations communities to see their lands and their resources developed in a way they see fit, which includes the right to say no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671809">It is important that, as we think about the climate crisis, we speak to young people right across this country who are demanding justice. They are right behind us. If we do not speak to young people today, right now, we will suffer their anger. We will rightly suffer their accusation of inaction. We will greatly betray a generation that is yet to come because we did not act sooner and, as honourable members of the House, could not put aside our partisan differences to see what is a national challenge ahead of us. This challenge will take every single one of our children's breath if we do not act. It will take their future from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671810">I would argue and suggest that we must endeavour to look at all solutions at this time. Solutions proposed by all hon. members in the face of this crisis are needed; they are worth debate in this place and, even better, implementation. We have to have hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671811"> I have hope that we, as colleagues, can come to a position where we bring together labour, management and those most affected by the climate crisis. I hope that we bring them together in a great coalition towards ending this unjust future and that, together, we build a process that protects jobs and brings in the workers most affected. I was laid off when I was in the oil sector and things got tough. Rather than letting the many workers we have in the resource sector get laid off, we ought to work with them to make certain that workers' skills, which are the best skills on earth, are put to good use. They should not just be getting and fighting for a good paycheque but also fighting for our future, for their kids and for all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671812"> That is what workers want. Workers want to be part of the solution. They do not want to be part of the problem. Right now, we have companies that are controlling, exclusively, the labour that is greatly needed to transition to a diversified economy that would create future jobs for everyone. What I mean by this is that we need these companies to see the workers they employ just as I see them, as the key and solution to having better paycheques, to having a better economy and to combatting the climate crisis.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671818"> Mr. Speaker, I want to consider that fact very seriously. The reality Canadians are facing right now is that our House of Commons is deadlocked, meaning that solutions such as those for the climate crisis cannot come to the floor. That is a shame, but what is a greater shame is the fact that we have a very serious motion relating to the breach of the privilege of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671819">The majority of the House of Commons has come together and said that we must release documents pertaining to the very severe and extreme instance reported by the Auditor General of the breach of trust by SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada. When a breach of trust takes place by one of our colleagues, particularly in the House, we must seriously consider what will relieve that breach of trust. The Conservatives brought forward a motion seeking to remedy that serious breach of privilege, with which I agree. I was the member who studied SDTC on behalf of New Democrats, and both the issue and the condemnation of it have been severe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671820"> I agree with my fellow party members and the House of Commons, including the Bloc Québécois, that we should unite towards the release of these documents, which will give light and transparency to the reality of what happened.

              <ParaText id="8671824"> Mr. Speaker, my unequivocal answer is that, yes, of course we support a consumer price on pollution. How the Liberals have done it, though, has been to divide the country. For example, we just recently saw a carbon exemption for the eastern provinces. What does that mean for the western provinces and other provinces? It means that they have citizens who are concerned about the unfair application of what was supposed to be a unifying process for the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671825">I agree that we need to have a different process for carbon pricing. I believe that is a serious solution to a serious problem. However, we have to make more certain that those who pay should be those who pollute. The Liberals got that wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671826"> Let us assume the better nature of the Liberals here and that they wanted to do the right thing in this case. What they did was to flip-flop on their own policy, which is something they accuse everybody else of. The Liberals have broken the consumer pricing mechanism in Canada on carbon prices. </ParaText>

Even in Fort McMurray, there is a women's centre that has proposals to support women in that community to recover from what are higher rates of domestic violence and sexual assault than found in almost any other region.

They have an inability to understand the difference between correlation and causality. This is from a first-year statistics course that perhaps they missed. They continue to say that because something happened during the same period of time as something else, it was caused by that. We know that is not the case.

The misinformation they continue to spread has turned many Canadians against fighting the great fight against climate change, an existential threat. </ParaText>

At most, it accounts for 1%, and much less by most studies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671852">Economists know and I believe the Conservative Party knows that the COVID pandemic, the post-COVID economy, supply chain issues and the conflicts around the world have caused global inflation.

              <ParaText id="8671890"> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. I just want to reiterate that I was not making a personal attack; I was stating a fact that should be of concern to Canadians, which is that the member, the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, has failed to get security clearance. This means that they are not apprised of what is happening within their own party. If it sounded like a personal attack, perhaps the member should be talking to their leader about what he is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671891">I will go on to what I was talking about, which is that the Conservative Party does understand and I hope they believe, otherwise ignorance is bliss, that global inflation was not caused by the price on pollution program. It was caused by the COVID pandemic, supply chain problems, conflicts and the post-COVID economy. It was global.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671892">As I said earlier, before I was interrupted, although I would hope all countries around the world would have some kind of price on pollution program to join us, only 40 countries around the world do. Therefore the global inflation experienced in other countries, which was many times greater than the inflation we experienced, could not have been caused by a price on pollution program. Nevertheless, the Conservatives sit here and use as proof that it was caused by us the fact that Canada had high inflation at the same time as it had a price on pollution program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671893">I would really appreciate some more attention being paid to facts. I know that slogans are easy and catchy, but they are not reality. We have to look at something even worse that is happening. The Conservatives have put forward the misinformation that not only was inflation caused by a price on pollution but also that all of the issues will be automatically solved, including inflation and high interest rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671894">Inflation and interest rates are coming down only because of the concerted efforts our government has made. It has nothing to do with the price on pollution, which continues. In fact the price on pollution increased at the same time as interest rates and inflation fell. If high interest rates and inflation are caused by the price on pollution, I would like the Conservatives to explain how it works in the inverse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671895">There is no science, math, or proof behind what the Conservatives are saying. When they say that everything will be solved by their simple slogan of axing the tax, they are misleading and deceiving Canadians. In fact, we know that eight out of 10 households in Canada on a current basis, cash in, cash out per month, get more back than they pay. The only households that do not are those of the wealthier, who can pay more and are actually consuming more fossil fuels because they have bigger homes, more cars and perhaps a cottage or a boat. Those people can pay more and should be paying more because they are doing more damage to our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671896">The other argument is that the price on pollution has done no good. That is not true. Emissions are down 8% from the 2015 level. When our government took over in 2015, the projection for what the emissions would be in 2030 was twice as high as they are now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671897">What if there had been a government like the current Conservative Party in office, continuing inaction on climate change, muzzling scientists, not letting people talk to the press about what was happening and clearly preferring to let the oil and gas industry run rampant? That is just what the Conservative Party is doing, with its <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> meeting with oil and gas executives behind closed doors to take maximum contributions for its fundraising efforts. This kind of behaviour shows that Conservatives are not really concerned with what concerns most Canadians, which is pollution and the future of our planet. Our young people need us to stand up for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671898"> The oil and gas industry contributes more than 30% of emissions in this country, pollution, and less than 6% to our GDP. It is also mostly foreign-owned. Why is the Conservative Party continuing to support it and put it ahead of Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671899">The other thing going on right now is the filibuster. I understand to some extent why the Conservatives are doing it: They want to have an election right now. They know that the further they go and the longer they speak, the less popular their <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> becomes. People see what he is really about, what he is saying and doing and what the party is doing; therefore they want to have an election and do not want it to go any longer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671901"> We agree that there is an important piece of legislation, Bill <Document DbId="13188699" Type="3">C-73</Document>, the nature accountability act, which needs to move forward. It is the proposed sister act to our Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act. We need it to move forward as well, yet NDP members are persisting in supporting the opposition in the filibuster, which is keeping us from doing the real work that Canadians need us to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671902">I would just say that we need to move on. The filibuster needs to stop.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8671917"> Mr. Speaker, it is great to talk about this important issue, a concurrence motion tabled by the Conservatives. I suspect that the only reason they have tabled another concurrence motion is because they are starting to run out of speakers to filibuster the other item they have in the House, which was talked about just moments ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671918"> When it comes to the environment and our climate policy, it is working. The evidence and the data is now coming out to show exactly how it is working. This is the first time since the Industrial Revolution that Canada has seen a decline in carbon emissions while at the same time experiencing economic growth, an increase in economic output. That is because of a number of policies that we brought forward. The one that has been talked about a lot today is the price on pollution, and I will touch on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671919"> It is not surprising to me that the Conservatives maintain their same position, at least the position they have had since the last election. During the last election, they ran on pricing pollution, in a very similar but very complicated way of earning aero points, so to speak, to get purchases from a catalogue, but they have flip-flopped completely since then. Therefore, I am not surprised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671920">However, I am most surprised about my NDP colleagues. The NDP members of Parliament, who we have been able to work with over the last number of years, have always been in favour of pricing pollution. They voted in favour of it 24 times, as the Conservatives point out. I have endless quotes on my laptop of NDP members in the House getting up and supporting pricing pollution time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671921"> I was absolutely floored today when I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> say that the New Democrats thought that the way it was done was not the best way, that it should have been done a different way and that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> failed Canadians because he did not do it differently. Meanwhile, the member offered no solutions of what that other way might be. He never once mentioned this before today, or at least since the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> made this big reveal toward the end of August.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671922"> The New Democrats were always squarely in focus, knowing that eight out of 10 Canadians got back more than they paid, in particular 94% of the households that earn less than $50,000 a year definitely got back more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671923">Therefore, let us be absolutely clear. When the NDP abandoned its position on pricing pollution, it did not just abandon the idea of collecting money and understanding and agreeing with 300 Canadian economists, and countless professionals and economists throughout the entire world. It did not just abandon that principle as the right way to decrease emissions. It also abandoned the principle of knowing that more of the money collected through pricing pollution would be going back to those who needed it the most. That is the choice the New Democrats made, and they made it for a very good reason. They understood the politics of this to be worse than the potential benefit from a policy perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671924"> I will be the first one to admit that we did not have a good communication plan. We did not inform Canadians, and we let the Conservatives take the narrative on the carbon tax. However, when I am older and look back on my time in Parliament, I would much rather be on the side of good policy than great slogans. I will be very proud to have stood up for good policy, even when Conservatives know that it is good policy because they have run on it several times in the past.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8671925">I also know that unlike the NDP, I did not cave to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. I did not look for my own political opportunity over the slogans and the way that the Leader of the Opposition took great policy and weaponized it, regardless of what comes from that program in the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671926"> This whole idea of hypocrisy and flip-flopping is completely in line with what we see from Conservatives lately. The <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the House leader</Affiliation> brought this up and I will do it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671927">We have Conservatives who, on a daily basis, have been jumping up in the House time and again demanding that more be done for their constituencies with respect to housing. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has been putting forward proposals and slashing the programs that we have put in place. We then end up with Conservatives getting up and reciting his talking points. They talk about how the Liberals have done nothing good, that we cannot bring about any change for housing and that we need to help communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671928">Then we find out what has happened behind the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>'s back, most likely without him knowing. I read what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">Minister of Housing</Affiliation>. Rest assured that there is no way the Leader of the Opposition would have allowed the member to send this letter to the Minister of Housing had he known what he wrote in it. However, the member for St. Albert—Edmonton did, because, at the end of the day, he knew his community was more important than his party. He may go along with all the slogans and the three-word phrases the Conservatives come up with, but when push comes to shove and he really needs to get things done, he will ensure the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> knows how he really feels about the Liberal programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671929"> This is what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> said in his letter, “The requested federal funding is critical to making this needed development a reality — a development that will help address the significant shortage of affordable housing options in the community.” That is exactly what the member for St. Albert—Edmonton had to say about the housing accelerator fund, after many times getting up in the House and lambasting the government for doing nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671930">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278115" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation> said that the housing accelerator fund “will provide much needed housing in this area.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671931"> However, they are not the only two members. A number of other Conservative MPs have sent letters to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> as well, encouraging the same thing: the member for <Affiliation DbId="278214" Type="2">Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278396" Type="2">Simcoe North</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278254" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671932">Today we just learned of another member, who always likes to get up in the House. He is very good at this and I applaud him for it. At the beginning of him speaking, he always says, “It is an honour to rise on behalf of the constituents of Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo.” I want his constituents to know that not only does he takes that pride when he gets up in the House, but he also takes that pride on their behalf when he sends a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="300008" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> asking for housing accelerator funding for his community. He extends that outside of the House, but we would never, ever know that he was actually supportive of it by the way the member for <Affiliation DbId="278564" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</Affiliation> engages in the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8671945">In municipalities like Kingston, a 300-year-old municipality, we have done extensive work to ensure that we can separate the sewer from the storm water.

What is abundantly clear in this report is that the government has not accomplished its objectives or its stated goals, and it has not met its targets in any way, means or fashion. It is not even close. In fact, Canada is ranked last of the G7 nations in accomplishing these targets. It is an indictment on the current government for having wonderful rhetoric as it relates to the environment but absolutely atrocious results. </ParaText>

It has been a tax with no results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671965">The Liberals promised big plantations of trees, and there are very few trees to show for it. They promised that our environment and our ranking in dealing with the challenges in the environment would improve as a result of their approach, but, I am sad to say, we rank last of the G7 countries. Canadians are tired of soaring rhetoric. They are tired of lofty promises. They want tangible, achievable, real results. </ParaText>

We want to hand off to future generations a better and cleaner planet than the way we found it. That is a great goal. We on this side of the House fully agree with that, but the question is how we approach attaining that goal. How does the House best implement policies that would make a real difference without punishing our own citizens and taxing our own people into absolute dependence upon an ever-growing, ever-expanding government? How do we do that? It is going to take practical and common-sense approaches. It is all of the above. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671967">There is an ancient writing that put it this way: We should cast our bread upon many waters to see what comes back and what will prosper because we do not know exactly which way or which approach may work best. Conservatives believe in all the above when it comes to resource development and energy. We believe in being responsible, good stewards, but we also believe that we need to have the backs of Canadian energy producers and natural resource workers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671968">We need to take a back seat to no one when it comes to our environmental practices as it relates to resource development.

              <ParaText id="8671969"> Why would we take a back seat, shut down those industries, put our boots on the backs of those producers and then outsource our energy needs to nations that do not have near the environmental regulations nor the ethical approaches to paying people good wages for producing those resources? I would say that we should stick up for Canadian producers, stand on the side of Canadian natural resources, tell the good story of natural resource development and say that it will do the planet a whole lot of good to have Canadian energy on the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671970">People are tired of us talking down what we do here in Canada. We do a great job, and we do not need to take a back seat to anyone. Our environmental record is stellar, and it has not been done through taxation. It has been done through innovation and expansion of better technologies. We believe in that on this side of the House. We need more of that approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671971">We need practical approaches that make a real, tangible difference. Yes, let us plant those trees, but let us do it comprehensively and let us do it with a real plan and a focus. One of the biggest gaping holes in the Liberals' approach to the environment, which, again, goes back to their rhetoric over results approach, is that there is a massive gaping hole. It is the lack of meaningful consultation with those whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted and affected by their policies and decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671972">For example, I sit on the fisheries and oceans committee, and do members know what we hear there? Some of these policies are going to have devastating consequences for the industry and for livelihoods. I ask the House, and I ask the government, who would want a better, healthier future for the fisheries in Canada than those whose livelihoods depend upon the fisheries and the health of our waters? It is our harvesters and those living in coastal communities, but they have been overlooked in the policy development of the government. They are frustrated because they are saying that they want clean oceans, that this is their livelihood, that this is their future. They want healthy fish stocks because that is where they derive their livelihoods from, but we ignore them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671973">I go to the farmers. Who wants better, healthier and cleaner lands than our farmers, who produce the best food in the world and work from morning until night to make sure goods and food are delivered to Canadians? Who does that more than our farmers? We have a gaping hole in the government's approach. Liberals do not consult properly with our farmers when coming up with their policies around the ways and means of agriculture. They pass these rules and bring in these taxes, and they devastate those industries. As a result, they are frustrated and left out of the circle. It is the gaping hole that leads to the vast expanse between their rhetoric and their results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671974">There is one other sector I want to talk to members about and that is in regard to forest management. We all know that the greatest cleaner of the Earth's atmosphere is our trees. Canada is blessed with an abundance of trees with some of the best forest coverage in the world. We do not get nearly the adequate credit for that, yet what do they do? They made a grandiose announcement that two billion trees were going to be planted. They then deliver 0.4% of that target in five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671975"> I ask the Liberals if they have consulted with those who are experts in the field of forest management. Have they consulted with some of the largest tree producers as well as tree planters in the world? I know for a fact that they have not talked with many of them. As a result, they wonder why we cannot get trees in the ground. Perhaps it is because of the gaping hole between the rhetoric and their results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8671976">They have not consulted with those who are most connected to the very industries they are talking about. It is time we changed approach. It is time we got back to meaningful consultation with those who are most affected by the policies. I believe that, if we get on the right side of this, we could win this debate, but more than win the debate, we could get the results that Canadians are demanding in being responsible stewards for our country's environment. We can improve our results and our outcomes by having a common-sense approach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672011">We have seen the record after nine years. Costs are up to such a point that food bank use has never been what it is after nine years of these economic vandals. Millions of Canadians are using food banks in a single month. That is the Liberal government's legacy: doubling food bank usage in communities right across this country, including in the member's riding. His legacy is doubling food bank use in Winnipeg. It is shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672012">What do Canadians get? A third of those food bank users are children. For the first time in my lifetime, 25% of Canadians do not know how they are going to feed their families. Unemployment is not at 25%.

It put Liberal insiders first. What did Canadians get in return? Were they safer? No, but their rent doubled, their mortgages doubled. People used to be able to pay off a mortgage in 25 years.

Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population, and we must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control in their working conditions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672045">Mr. Speaker, after nine years under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canadians face a buffet of corruption scandals, with each new revelation showing just how entrenched corruption has become under the Liberal government. The latest is the green slush fund, a $400-million scandal that the Liberals are scrambling to keep hidden from Canadians. Unfortunately, that is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672046">The Auditor General uncovered that Liberal appointees funnelled hundreds of millions of hard-earned taxpayer money to companies that the appointees themselves owned, setting off no fewer than 186 glaring conflict of interest violations. What did Canadians get from the government? Instead of transparency, Canadians got a government openly refusing a House order to turn over key documents for an investigation. This refusal to co-operate led the Speaker of the House to rule that the Liberals have violated a direct order of Parliament. Canadians want to know why the government is refusing to turn over these documents. They have a right to know. What is so damning in those documents that the government is refusing a House order to hand them over?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672047"> At a time when Canadians continue to shoulder soaring costs for food, housing and basic necessities, the government's cover-up has not only wasted hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money, but also paralyzed Parliament, not allowing members of the House to continue crucial work on urgent issues, such as the rising cost of food, the cost of housing and the cost of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Perhaps stopping these discussions at a crucial time when Canadians want a carbon tax election is exactly what the Prime Minister and his elitist friends had in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672048">As Canadians continue to live through this unprecedented crisis of government waste and Canadian suffering, today, instead of addressing critical issues that Canadians are struggling with, we find ourselves talking about the government's ongoing negligence, incompetence and continued corruption. Imagine being a taxpayer who is struggling to pay for food, lining up at the food bank with children and then hearing that billions of hard-earned tax dollars are not only being wasted by the government, but being given to Liberal friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672049">I have heard from many of my constituents in Edmonton who are struggling to afford to heat their homes, to fill up their car with gas and to feed their families. People in Canada are dumpster diving to feed themselves. We never thought that could happen here in this great country. This is what life in Canada looks like for many who work and are still unable to pay their bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672050">These hard-working Canadians are shocked that the taxes they pay simply disappear in a web of Liberal corruption scandals, bogus apps, useless infrastructure banks and endless corruption, supported by the NDP. Despite all of this, the NDP's support continues to prop up the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, allowing the disgusting misuse of taxpayer funds to persist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672051">The 2024 HungerCount report shows that food banks saw a record of over two million visits in March 2024 alone. That is up 6% from last year and a staggering 90% since 2019. Many of these people used to donate to the food bank and now are lining up at the food bank to help support their families. Over a quarter of these visits were by children. Because of this high demand, nearly 30% of food banks have reported running out of food over the past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672052">Unemployment and economic misery continue to rise while paycheques are shrinking. It is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inflationary spending that has driven up the price of groceries, gas and heating. To make matters worse, his endless tax hikes drive businesses, jobs and investments out of our country. Billions of dollars of investment have left Canada and, along with it, all of the jobs that it would have created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672053">Those in the middle class, once secure, are now struggling to keep a roof over their heads, and life has become an uphill battle for Canadian families. This is not just a temporary hardship. It is a fundamental shift in what it means to live and work in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672054">Today, life costs more under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and hard work no longer provides the security it once did. Canadian families with two working parents cannot afford to buy a home anymore in Canada. Nine years ago, this would have been shocking to hear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672055">Since 2015, the cost of housing has skyrocketed. Rent has doubled, mortgage payments have doubled and the down payment needed to buy a home has doubled. In fact, housing costs have risen more in these nine years than all of the previous decades combined. Canada, a country with vast, open land, now has the highest housing costs and one of the fewest homes per capita among all G7 countries. At the same time, life has never been better for Liberal insiders and elites, who are filling their pockets with hard-earned Canadian taxpayer dollars. One government project and one government scandal at a time, they are lining their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672056">Despite a House order to provide documents for the green slush fund, the government has chosen self-interest over the best interests of Canadians. Rather than doing what is right, the Liberals have failed to show leadership, transparency and accountability, showing the House and all Canadians that they will do anything to cover up their multitude of scandals, including this $400-million corruption scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672057">How did we get here? Let us review what the green slush fund is and why the Liberal government is hiding key documents that would aid the RCMP in this investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672058">Sustainable Development Technology Canada was created as a billion-dollar fund with support across party lines to help green technology start-ups tackle climate and environmental issues. This program ran smoothly until about 2017, under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s newly appointed Liberal board chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672059">After a Conservative motion led to an audit by the Auditor General, it was revealed that $400 million of taxpayer funds were misused, with 80% of reviewed cases showing conflicts of interest. The Auditor General's findings only scratched the surface. She reviewed a sample of cases, finding that 80% contained legal violations. Those central to the scandal, who were Liberal-appointed board members, had even managed to secure other government positions. One SDTC board member, Andrée-Lise Méthot, acknowledged multiple conflicts of interest involving funds directed to companies that she was financially invested in. The current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, before his cabinet role, was an adviser at Cycle Capital, the venture firm Méthot founded, which received SDTC funding during her board tenure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672060">As these revelations surfaced, Méthot was appointed to the board of the $35-billion Canada Infrastructure Bank, where McKinsey consultants with Liberal ties were heavily involved. Despite the conflicts of interest in funding companies tied to her financial interests, she transitioned to this new role. Ms. Méthot has been directly implicated in mismanaging $42 million of taxpayer money to benefit companies she was financially linked to. Despite clear violations to benefit her own company, the government saw fit to appoint her to the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which is another example of its waste and negligence. This is what the blatant misuse of Canadians' trust looks like: when individuals who repeatedly violate conflict of interest rules are rewarded with prime government positions due to their Liberal connections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672061">Speaking of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, this is another glaring misuse of taxpayer dollars and another project riddled with similar issues of mismanagement and conflicts of interest. Just as with the green slush fund, the Canada Infrastructure Bank has become a haven for Liberal insiders and politically connected firms that are more interested in securing lucrative contracts than delivering real value to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672062">The Canada Infrastructure Bank, presented as the Liberal government's flagship initiative, has proven to be a costly disappointment. Instead of delivering the infrastructure that Canadians desperately needed, the Canada Infrastructure Bank has squandered taxpayer monies on excessive overhead, high-priced consultants and generous CEO payouts, spending far more on salaries and bonuses than actual projects. Nearly $1 million was wasted on consulting and legal fees for an electricity project that never even came to fruition. With a budget of $35 billion allocated seven years ago, Canadians were promised a return on investment of up to four times from private sector company contributions, as well as an ambitious multiplier effect of 11:1. Yet, seven years later, those promises remain unfulfilled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672063"> The Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities has concluded that the CIB is beyond repair and recommended its abolition, citing expert testimony from stakeholders who highlighted its inefficiency, lack of transparency and inability to attract private sector investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672064">At a time when Canadians are grappling with record high inflation and rising costs of living, they cannot afford these expensive government initiatives that fail to deliver anything that they promised to Canadians. Once again, the Liberal government's mismanagement of the CIB exemplifies a broader pattern of waste under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672065">Since June, the government has demonstrated complete disregard for Parliament's authority and its duty to uphold Canadian democratic principles. Conservatives had introduced a motion demanding transparency. We called on the government to release all the files, communications and financial records on their green slush fund to Parliament, which would then turn the documents over to the RCMP for a much-needed investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672066"> However, after the motion passed, the 30-day deadline for compliance was ignored by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The government has openly disrespected Canadians and this House's authority when some of their departments provided heavily redacted documents and others outright refused to provide any documents at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672067">The Speaker of this place ruled that this refusal showed contempt, quoting that only partial disclosures were made, owing either to redactions or the withholding of documents. Some met the order with complete refusal. The Department of Justice alone withheld 10,000 pages, violating Parliament's demand for evidence so that the RCMP could proceed with its investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672068"> This is not a political debate. The RCMP is not investigating this matter at the direction of the Conservatives. The RCMP found credible grounds for a Criminal Code investigation. It will review the documents, and it will determine if charges are warranted. The RCMP will proceed as it sees fit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672069"> The House of Commons represents the people of Canada with absolute powers under our Constitution to oversee the actions of the government and the actions of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672070"> In Canada, no one is above the law and everyone must abide by our Constitution, even the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his wealthy buddies. By consistently dismissing Parliament's authority, the Liberal government demonstrates open contempt for this balance of power, undermining the very institution that checks executive actions. Our democratic strength rests on the House's authority to hold the government accountable, investigate breaches and protect Canadians' interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672071"> We cannot let the actions of the Liberal government dilute the power of Parliament and the integrity of our democracy.

              <ParaText id="8672072"> The government's embarrassment over the mismanagement of the green slush fund has driven it to shut Parliament down, yet this does nothing to excuse the actions of those involved in the slush fund to relieve the government of its duty to Canadians.

              <ParaText id="8672073">This House could get back to business today if the Liberals showed the integrity to hand over those documents, yet we know that they will not.

              <ParaText id="8672080">Mr. Speaker, the current situation is so serious that listening to the cacophony of the debate makes it almost impossible to do anything but laugh. Ha, ha! Done. It is absurd, ludicrous, Kafkaesque even. Public interest in this debate is being completely snuffed out. There are documents that must be produced. There is sufficient evidence to support the seriousness of the matter. The documents must be handed over, but the party opposite has set a condition that it knows cannot be met, namely, that the documents be turned over to the RCMP. In fact, the RCMP freely admits that, to avoid compromising its investigation, it does not want the documents. This leaves us with a paradox, namely a debate based on the weakness of the human spirit. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672111">Mr. Speaker, who is Randy? That is the central question before the House as a result of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling that found a prima facie question of privilege after the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>'s business partner Stephen Anderson refused to disclose to the ethics committee who Randy is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672112">The ethics committee's probe into Randy began when Global News reported that the Minister of Employment was involved in a shady PPE company called Global Health Imports with Stephen Anderson. According to Global News, the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> had been a partner at Global Health Imports along with Stephen Anderson up until the time he had been elected in 2021, and that he continued to maintain a 50% ownership stake with Anderson.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672113">Global News reported that the company was mired in allegations of fraud and ripping off clients. Indeed, multiple judgments have been issued against the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s company by Alberta courts, which have ordered the minister's company to pay back clients $7.8 million for ripping them off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672114"> Global Health Imports faces a litany of other lawsuits, including a lawsuit commenced by California-based company the Ghaoui Group. The Ghaoui Group, like other clients of the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s company, purchased PPE. The PPE was never delivered, but the Ghaoui Group was on the hook for half a million dollars, having transferred a half-a-million-dollar deposit to the minister's company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672115">One of the excuses provided by Stephen Anderson for the failure to deliver PPE was that the Global Health Imports warehouse burned down; amazingly, it was two weeks after Global Health Imports received the half a million dollars. Anderson was then reported to have told the Ghaoui Group that once it collected the insurance money, maybe then he would be in a position to repay the half-a-million-dollar deposit. The Edmonton police, in their investigation of the fire, concluded that in all likelihood it was arson, just by coincidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672116">A minister is involved in a shady company mired in allegations of fraud and ordered by Alberta courts to pay back clients $7.8 million. There are allegations or evidence of potential arson and insurance fraud. I would submit that this alone ought to have been enough for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to tell the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> that he is fired, that he is out of cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672117">However, there is more. Global News reported that someone named Randy connected with Global Health Imports was involved in shaking down the Ghaoui Group for the half-a-million-dollar deposit. That was evidenced in text messages. Among the text messages that Global News uncovered was a message from Stephen Anderson to the Ghaoui Group, leading up to the shakedown, in which he says, “What is going on? I just received this from Randy!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672118">He then copied and pasted the message he had received from Randy, which states, “Anderson, it's 13:14 MST and 15:14 EST it literally takes 10 seconds to complete a transfer, I am telling you we are not allocating like this...it's midday and nothing is completed, I am calling Felix to discuss. Be available in 15 for a partner call.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672119">Why are the text messages so significant? Very simply, if the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is the Randy in those text messages, then the minister broke the law. The Conflict of Interest Act is clear: A minister of the Crown shall not be involved in the operations of a business. If the minister is the Randy in question, then the minister was involved in the operations of the business working to secure a half-a-million-dollar deposit for Global Health Imports, not to mention participating in a partners meeting.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672120"> That is why the ethics committee launched its investigation. We brought the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to committee at the beginning of June, and the minister was adamant he was not the Randy in question. How convenient that is, except for a few inconvenient facts for the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672121">First of all, the Ghaoui Group believed at all times that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> was the Randy in the text messages. When Global News reached out to Anderson to inquire who the Randy in the text messages was, he said that it was not the minister but the VP of logistics. When Global News inquired as to who the VP of logistics was, it found out it was not a Randy but one Edward Anderson, the father of Stephen Anderson. Stephen Anderson later admitted before the ethics committee that he had lied to Global News.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672122">Global News undertook a further investigation. It could not find a trace of another Randy at Global Health Imports. I would further add that the Randy referenced in the text messages was a partner. The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> had been a partner, along with Anderson, up until his election. He had a 50% stake in the company at the time of the text messages. According to his own evidence at committee, the minister admitted that it was a small operation and that there were a handful of people in the company: him, Anderson and a few others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672123">In the face of that, without a trace of another Randy and without any explanation for who the other Randy could be, there is only one reasonable inference that can be drawn, which is that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> is the Randy in the text messages. He is the Randy who was involved in the shakedown of the Ghaoui Group and who is involved in allegations of wire fraud, and he is the Randy who, as minister, contravened the Conflict of Interest Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672124">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s story does not add up. Everyone knows that he is the Randy in question, and that is why Conservatives have been consistent in calling for the disgraced minister to resign from cabinet. For months he has refused to do so, so we have called on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to fire the disgraced minister. However, of course the scandal-plagued, conflict-ridden Prime Minister, who has been found guilty not once but twice of violating the Conflict of Interest Act, is standing behind his corrupt minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672125">It is an absolute disgrace. It underscores why the government cannot be replaced soon enough and why this country needs a carbon tax election now.</ParaText>

Over two million Canadians were forced to use food banks in March, a number that has almost doubled in the past five years. In my home province of Saskatchewan, food banks have seen a 42% increase in visits. Throughout my constituency, there are daily calls for donations to the many food banks and the Salvation Army.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672154">While children make up 30% of people using food banks across the country, in Saskatchewan, that number is almost 40%, a sad and alarming figure. Parents are going without meals so that their children have food, and those who once donated to the food bank are now the ones needing its help. Instead of fixing the situation, the NDP-Liberals have continued to increase the cost of groceries by increasing the carbon tax by 23%; they are on their way to quadrupling the tax in the future. It is time for Canadians to see a government that works to make their lives better, not worse. It is time for a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672172">On behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I want to congratulate Elisapie on the outstanding success of her album <I>Inuktitut</I>. She won the Felix award for indigenous artist of the year, as well as four other awards at the first two galas with her collaborators Joe Grass and the Bonsound team. In a way that only an artist like her can, Elisapie uses art to build bridges between different worlds: the North, which she refuses to call the Far North; English, the language towards which history has driven her people; and the Quebec nation, whose people showed her how much they love her on Sunday.</ParaText>

Of course, they do not because Conservatives never say what they are actually going to do. It is why they speak in slogans. They hope no one would notice that they shut down veterans' offices in Corner Brook, Sydney, Charlottetown, Thunder Bay, Windsor, Saskatoon, Brandon, Kelowna and Prince George. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672373">Mr. Speaker, Windsor is being abused and taken for granted by the Liberals yet again. It is a sad state that the city must sue the federal government to recoup the cost of the Ambassador Bridge blockade. While the Conservatives supported this illegal activity, which hurt the economy and public safety, the Liberals are making Windsor taxpayers foot the bill. This means less money for roads, parks, housing and emergency services. There are fewer services in Windsor because of Liberal failures.</ParaText>

At a time when the Conservatives were supporting the illegal acts of the convoy, the City of Windsor and the Province of Ontario were partners with the Government of Canada in trying to bring this horrible crisis to a peaceful conclusion. I was happy some months ago to have an opportunity to talk to the mayor of Windsor. My colleagues on this side of the House have also been talking to me about what we can do to support the City of Windsor, and we are always open to working with the City of Windsor. It has been a valuable partner to our government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8672413">Madam Speaker, as I was saying, this green slush fund is about slush, which is effectively a term that describes insiders within government taking taxpayers' dollars and funnelling them to insiders, corporate interests and friends of the government. It is a Liberal green slush fund. It is a program that was put forward by the Liberal government that effectively allowed taxpayers' money, millions and millions of dollars, to be funnelled to private interests without any significant oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672414">Just to refresh everyone's memory, this fund was supposed to promote green energy technology by incentivizing the private sector to step into the environmental arena and come up with innovative solutions to environmental challenges facing not only Canada but the world. On its surface, this program seemed to be suited to our times, and there was a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, let us call it a billion-dollar fund intended to promote green energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672415">What happened? Instead of this money going to worthy organizations, it went to Liberal insiders and corporations connected to the government in one way or another. Let me explain how that happened. When we establish a fund like this, typically the government will establish a board of directors and draw from the private sector individuals who have expertise in a particular space, in this case the green, environmental space. These directors have a responsibility to review every application for funding on its merits and make sure that no private interests and no conflicts of interest arise that would allow corruption to sent in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672416">Instead of doing this, what did the board do? The directors of the board made decisions that caused much of this money, huge swaths, to be funnelled to their own companies. That, by definition, is corruption, especially if directors have not declared conflicts of interest, which they did not on 186 occasions. Directors did not recuse themselves or remove themselves from the process to ensure that the integrity of the funding mechanism was maintained, and now we have this slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672417">When we as MPs in the House became aware of this, we asked the government to deliver to Parliament all relevant documents relating to this scandal and corruption. That is the least Canadians should expect of their members of Parliament. Instead, the government said no and that these documents are confidential, sensitive and really not in the purview of Parliament. It said, “We are the government. We know best and we are not going to let you see those documents.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672418">Of course, those of us in the opposition benches in the House got very upset. We said the government had no right to withhold documents that are relevant to a police investigation into corruption at the highest levels of government, so we went to the Speaker. We said we believed there was a breach of privilege here, and we asked him to order that these documents be turned over to Parliament for delivery to our police authorities, in this case the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672419">The Speaker of the House, the highest authority in Parliament, said yes, and he ordered the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to turn over these documents to Parliament. That was the order of the Speaker of the House of Commons, the highest authority in Parliament. There is no appeal from that order or decision. The Speaker, who is a Liberal, made the decision to make that order, and what did the Prime Minister do? He defied the order. He said he was above Parliament and above the law and would not turn over those documents, except in redacted form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672420">For Canadians who do not understand what redaction is, it is simply censorship. What happens is that government bureaucrats, at the instruction of their political masters, will black out huge sections of these documents, then say they turned over some documents. Of course, there is nothing of value to be read because all the relevant information has been blacked out. That is what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did. He refused to divulge and disclose information to the House, the people's House, the House that should be accountable to Canadians. He said he was defying the Speaker, defying Parliament and defying MPs. He placed himself above the law and Parliament and did not give us those documents in unredacted form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672421">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672422">
                <B>Hon. Ed Fast:</B> Madam Speaker, that is right. Shame on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672423">This is what happens in tinpot dictatorships. We have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has established himself as the ultimate supreme authority in this country, above the law and above Parliament. I hope Canadians understand that. I know his government is imploding, but that is the kind of Prime Minister we have in Canada right now. He is willing to defy the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672424">This issue will be referred to a parliamentary committee, as it should be. Of course, the government wants this matter to go to committee without having any of the relevant documents available for investigation and review. It wants a parliamentary committee to undertake its work without having the information it would require and that our police authorities would require to get to the bottom of this very ugly and incredibly expensive scandal, the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672425">We are talking about a billion-dollar slush fund from which $330 million has been diverted to insiders and where 186 conflicts of interest by board members were never declared. A decision was made 186 times to act unethically on that board. It is unbelievable that this could happen in Canada today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672426">This matter is supposed to be referred to a committee, but we as a House, acting collectively, have decided that until the Speaker's ruling is complied with, we will not allow it to go to committee. It is that important. I believe Canadians who are watching today would agree with me and most of the members of the House that this scandal is of such proportion and significance that it goes to the very heart of the government. Canadians want this properly investigated and want the investigative authorities to have the information required to truly get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672427">It has been said that a fish rots from its head. That is truly an apt description of the government and what is happening with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in his office and within his cabinet. Certain ministers are doing their darndest to try to hide from Canadians the gravity of this scandal. It is disgraceful. They should not be surprised that this scandal has now bubbled to the surface and that Parliament is investigating this. It has been described as being of the same nature as the sponsorship scandal, which brought down the Chrétien government. Do members remember, “I am entitled to my entitlements”? This is akin to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672428">I expect when all of this information comes out, as the government cannot hide this forever, that people are going to go to jail. I believe that hundreds of millions of dollars will have to be recovered from people who scammed taxpayers. I believe that the government is going to be held accountable in the next carbon tax election, which I hope takes place very soon, when Canadians can cast judgment on the corrupt, unethical and incompetent Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672429"> We talked about accountability and transparency. The least I would expect of the government, when it gets caught red-handed with its hand in the cookie jar, is that it issues a <I>mea culpa</I>, says that it screwed up, there is a real problem here, it is going to get to the bottom of it, it wants to start afresh, it believes Canadians deserve to know how corrupt their government is and it moves forward accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672430"> Does the House remember, back in 2015, when the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was first elected, “sunny ways”? He sent a letter to each one of his cabinet ministers. It was headed, “Open and Accountable Government”. I am going to read to members a portion of that letter that will demonstrate to them not only the lengths to which our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to pretend he was an ethical Prime Minister, but how badly he has failed Canadians in delivering accountable government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672431">It reads, under, “A Message to Ministers”, “At its heart is a simple idea: open government is good government.” I think we can all agree on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672432">It continues: “For Canadians to trust our government we must trust Canadians, and we will only be successful in implementing our agenda to the extent that we earn and keep this trust.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672433">Have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government earned the trust of Canadians? I ask the Canadians who are watching this today to ask themselves this question. After 10 long years of the failed Liberal government, has it earned their trust?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672434">It continues, “To be worthy of Canadians’ trust, we must always act with integrity.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672435"> It also states, “The trust of Canadians will also rest on the accountability of our government.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672436">Members should listen to this. It continues, “In our system, the highest manifestation of democratic accountability is the forum of Parliament.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672437"> Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in his letter to his cabinet ministers claiming to be the bastion of integrity, wrote that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672438">Now the very same <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has not only contradicted his letter from 2015 but defied this Parliament. He has defied the Speaker of the House of Commons, our highest authority within Parliament, from whom there is no appeal. That is the Prime Minister today, an unworthy Prime Minister, unworthy of Canadians' trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672439">I am very upset by what I have experienced in this House in the last 10 years. I have been a member of this chamber for almost 20 years. I have seen the cut and thrust of debate and the ups and downs of governments. None of us is perfect. I am not expecting perfection from anyone in this House. I do not expect perfection from our government, but I do expect excellence, integrity, honesty and transparency. Sadly, that is lacking from the government. That is why Canadians should no longer have any trust or confidence in the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672440">I know my Liberal colleagues listening to me speak today know I am telling the truth. They are still propping up the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, even though many of them privately are saying he has to go, they do not trust him anymore and he is not their guy. However, publicly, they are chugging along and clapping like trained seals. The reality is he has even lost the confidence of his own MPs. They just do not have the courage to stand up and be counted today. We deserve better than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672441">It gets worse. If I were only speaking about the green slush fund, that would be enough, but the government has a long history of corruption, graft, incompetence and recklessness. We will remember the SNC-Lavalin affair back in 2019 when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who stepped in to pervert the rule of law in Canada by interfering in a criminal prosecution of one of Canada's flagship companies, SNC-Lavalin. In the process, what did the Prime Minister do? He fired his justice minister, Canada's first indigenous female justice minister, a thoroughly capable woman. He fired another minister, Jane Philpott. It goes on. There was the WE Charity scandal and the vacation at the Aga Khan's island, whom he claimed was his friend. He was investigated for ethics violations. Time and time again, the government violates the trust of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672477"> Madam Speaker, I am glad I caught your eye so I could rise again to speak on this amendment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672478">We are in a situation now where Parliament has been paralyzed for multiple weeks because of the Liberal government's unwillingness to release all of the unredacted documents to the public. I spoke to the original main motion and the subamendment on this matter. I then told my constituents about the depth of the issue before the House, that the government was refusing to disclose documents that my constituents as taxpayers had already paid for, documents that by all rights they should obtain, because as taxpayers they have a right to know what their government is doing with both funds and documentation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672479">We are talking about almost $400 million that was misappropriated, misspent and, as the Auditor General has indicated, corruptly sent to the crony friends who ministers of the Crown had appointed to the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, which we have labelled as the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672480">I heard a lot from my constituents who replied. They were very happy to see that all opposition parties, way back in June, voted as a group against the Liberal government, demanding that the documents be given to the House of Commons law clerk, who would then give them to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672481">My constituents were pleased to see that, because they are just as worried as I am that close to $400 million had been corruptly spent, corruptly sent to companies. In some cases, as the Auditor General discovered, about one in five or one in six companies that made applications and were given money had nothing to do with financing and supporting green technology, innovation and commercialization in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672482">I tell my constituents about examples like that. How do we get to billions of dollars of deficits and new debt that is accumulated on the national Treasury that all citizens, all taxpayers, are responsible for? Well, it starts with millions and then it becomes billions. This is a perfect example: almost $400 million that could have been spent on anything else, or it could have been saved. We could have had a lower deficit in a particular year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672483"> Many Conservative members have asked what we could have done with the close to $400 million that was corruptly spent by SDTC's board, by board members who were appointed by a now former industry minister. Again, as I recounted in a prior debate, this fund had a clean bill of health right up until the Liberals decided to muck around in the board, the individuals who were involved in decisions on which projects would be funded and which ones would not be funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672484"> First, the Liberals replaced the board chair. Jim Balsillie, a well-known entrepreneur in Canada who has had a lot of success in business, was really inconvenient for them, because he was criticizing government policy-making and government decisions. The government replaced him with a different board chair, Annette Verschuren, and then other board members started getting replaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672485"> This is where the issues began to accumulate, and this is why we find ourselves now considering the issue before the House of the government still refusing to hand over the documents. The House order that was passed back in June, which the government has refused to comply with in the time span that was given to it, was very direct and clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672486"> Any documents to do with SDTC or the green slush fund were to be given to the law clerk's office. The law clerk, who we all trust as parliamentarians, often works with different parliamentary committees when there are issues of documentation and redaction of documents. The House has an absolute and complete right to get unredacted documents of whatever type. We trust the law clerk to look at them carefully and decide which documents should be made available to parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672487"> In this situation, the House basically passed the motion, by majority vote, that the documents are to be given to the law clerk and then to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672488">I have listened to the debate over the past few weeks from different Liberal caucus members, members of the government caucus, and an excuse they are giving is that some of these documents may infringe the charter rights of some Canadians. I would say that argument is specious. It is a ridiculous argument to make. The Liberals have never actually said which charter rights would be infringed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672489">The charter cannot be used as a shield for Liberal government corruption. That was never the intention when the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was ratified in the Constitution, for it to be used later by a government to say it cannot release documents because what may be seen in them could infringe on some types of rights. That was never the intention. It is a bad argument to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672490">In the case of my constituents, based on the replies I have received to the newsletter I sent out, which contained more information on exactly what is going on and which types of documents we are requesting to see, they responded by saying they agree. It cannot be the case that a government could argue that the charter protects it and, therefore, it cannot release any documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672491">Many of the documents the government has released were redacted, had portions blacked out, which is a frustration I have had for many years here. I see it being done at parliamentary committees and see it done literally in the House of Commons. We have made it very clear that if we had wanted redacted documents or to give that option to the Government of Canada, to the Liberal government, we would have said that in the motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672492">The motion said we give some latitude to give redacted documents when it is, say, provincial-federal relations or private information, which are sections of the Access to Information Act that allow for redactions. We would have said, for machinery of government, government operations or cabinet confidences, the government did not need to give us those unredacted. We would have referenced parts of the ATIP act, but we did not. The motion just said to give all of the documents over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672493">The documents must be really bad. There must be something truly terrifying there for Liberal cabinet members and especially for the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, because it was partially under his watch that decisions had to be made. The Liberals have run away from this fund. That is how bad it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672494">The fund has basically been rolled into the National Research Council, and the Liberals have washed their hands of it and pretend as if they were not actively participating in what was going on. There were government officials in those meeting rooms with the board members. Again, these documents must be really awful to paralyze all of Parliament, where we have been debating this for weeks on end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672495">Back to my original point, I always tell my constituents why we want these documents. We want these documents because we need to get to the truth of what happened to the close to $400 million that was corruptly allocated to companies. The Auditor General found 186 cases out of 400 cases where the conflict of interest rules were not followed, for a fund that, pre-2017, had a clean bill of health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672496">The only thing that really changed between when the fund was originally created, in the 2000s, and 2017 is that this particular cabinet took over, and then the Liberals decided it would be okay to start finagling and making decisions that were wrong. The people they appointed made these corrupt decisions. The Liberals are responsible to the taxpayers, to the citizens of Canada, for releasing those documents to show us exactly where the money went.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672497">After the rebate, the carbon tax is still costing the average Alberta family $911. How many Alberta families could have their carbon tax covered for close to $400 million? It is a huge number of people. I think the entire population of Alberta could have had their carbon tax paid for almost an entire year. It is real money. It would have a real impact on people in my riding. The carbon tax has had a real impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672498">Canadians know they do not get all of the carbon tax back. They feel it in their pocketbook. They feel it at the end of the month when they are paying their bills. They feel it when they see how much income tax is deducted on their T4. They feel it when they are told the government is missing its budget forecast by $7 billion to $8 billion, because that is what the government has done here. That is about a 20% miss.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672499"> The deficit was closer to $47 billion or $48 billion for the last fiscal year. Then the Parliamentary Budget Officer added $400 million to that, saying it was mismanaged. Then we add in this $400 million, which was not just mismanaged, but corruptly directed to, sometimes, the board members of SDTC, the green slush fund, who would be a board member or a corporate officer of the company that received the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672500">I remember my time at the Chamber of Commerce. This is corporate ethics 101 of the stuff we just cannot do under any circumstances. We are supposed to recuse ourselves from the decision-making process when we have situations where there is either a real conflict of interest or, even worse, a perception of a conflict of interest. This is a situation where those people appointed by the Liberal cabinet made those corrupt decisions. That is why taxpayers and citizens have a right to know how deep the rot goes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672501">This is from a newsletter that I sent to my constituents. In a prior speaking opportunity on the main motion, I related it back to my founding experiences as to what made me a Conservative. Why did I choose the Conservative Party of Canada as the vehicle for my ideas? I always describe it that way. There are lots of different political parties. They organize our passions. What are we passionate about? What are our priorities? I became a Conservative partially because of the 1995 referendum in the province of Quebec. Then the second major founding event in my life was the sponsorship scandal. The sponsorship scandal was another fund, not quite the same size with about a tenth of the money being corruptly spent, that was given to the advertising buddies of the Liberal Party of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672502">Every single time there is a major corruption scandal in Canada, we somehow have a Liberal government in charge. It has been almost every single time. That to me was a very foundational event in my life. That is what led me become a Conservative, more philosophically, because corruptly assigning money that is taxpayers' cash to the Liberals' friends and buddies is just wrong. It is plain wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672503">That should have been known by the people making these decisions. The Auditor General has basically indicated that. As she went through her audit, she explained, line by line, every single issue that existed with the green slush fund, but this has not been the only scandal. We also had SNC-Lavalin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672504">Every single time a scandal comes up, there is a sort of arc, where at first the Liberals deny that anything has gone on. That was the case with SNC-Lavalin and the deferred prosecution, which caused the firing of the first indigenous justice minister and attorney general in the history of Canada. She was fired, undeservedly fired. Then the former president of the treasury board was summarily fired. Both of them were expelled from the government caucus. That was the SNC-Lavalin scandal. At first, the Liberals denied it. They denied that the Globe and Mail story was true. Then they said the story is true, but not what we are pretending that it is. Eventually they said this is exactly how it happened. There was a recording that was released as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672505">To me, the whole story, or arc, is happening again. The government, at first, insisted there was nothing to see here. It said there was nothing going on. Liberals got up in question period, answered questions and denied that anything went on as ardently as they possibly could. Eventually, the Auditor General's report said that the situation was untenable. There was not just corruption, but very deep corruption that went back to 2017, when decisions on who could make those decisions about how the money would be allocated by these board members were made by the cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672506">In the case of Annette Verschuren, she even had $200,000 given to one of her companies. These again are public documents. When she emailed some of the staff, they promised to find other funds in government from which her company could gain access to additional monies. The Government of Canada is not a piggy bank for Liberal crony friends. It is not a piggy bank for any of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672507">Citizens in my riding, taxpayers, are young and old. They are not just 18-plus-year-olds who pay personal income tax. Teenagers are paying GST every single time. They are just as much taxpayers as anybody else. Now we have a situation where their money was corruptly spent. Their money was corruptly directed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672508">We find ourselves here again looking at another Liberal scandal. This one is not so new. It is several weeks old now because the government is in contempt. That is what the Speaker basically ruled. The government is in contempt because of its refusal to give over documents. That is, to me, the textbook definition of contempt.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672509"> The Liberals are refusing to abide by an order that a majority of MPs in the House voted for. Many of the arguments they are now using when they get up at different times are that, well, it would be unwise to release them, it would be unfair to release them, or that it might violate some type of charter protections to release them. However, those are all arguments they should have made back in June to try to persuade parliamentarians that the original wording of the motion should not have passed, but that failed. The decision was made to have all of the documents released and to give all the documents over to the law clerk and to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672510">Now, I have also heard the argument made by members on the opposite side that the RCMP does not want the documents. However, I would insist that they reread the letter because that is not what the RCMP said. It was very clear that, if the RCMP got the documents, it would look at them and then decide what to do with them, which is exactly what we have been saying all along. The RCMP will decide what to do with them. Nobody is directing the police forces here to do something in particular. It is not what the motion originally called for with the production of documents. The motion simply said that they should go from the law clerk to the RCMP. The Liberals need to just hand over the documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672511">As well, it is difficult to subpoena or ask for the production of documents if we do not know that the documents exist. As an avid and enthusiastic user of the access to information laws in this country, I invite any member to look at my office expenses and see how often I expense ATIPs, which are five dollars each. It is some of the best money an opposition parliamentarian can spend, and I do a lot of them. However, I often get frustrated because I sometimes do not know the title of a document, and sometimes I have people tell me that the documentation does not exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672512"> As always, I have a Yiddish proverb. I was saving this one for last, and I know that members are waiting for it. A favourite one that I often use is, “Words should be weighed, not counted.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672513"> My contribution today, which again reiterates the points we have made over the last several weeks, is that the arguments being advanced by the Liberals that they cannot simply give the documents because of the charter and freedoms are specious. They do not apply here and cannot be used to shield the Liberal government from corruption charges. It just does not make any sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672514">It must be truly horrifying. How could the Liberals explain to Canadians how they misspent, corruptly misspent, almost $400 million, and that almost $60 million of the funds that went out had nothing to do with green technology spending? It is not me saying this, but the Auditor General of Canada saying it. She could not find in the eligibility criteria where that matched up with anything, but somehow that money still went out, corruptly. Also, the AG's report, which went up to $400 million, is just a sample size. She did not look at every single project, which is why we want these documents from all the projects and all departments so that we know everything on this particular issue. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672520"> Madam Speaker, the member is correct. My dad was a member of the Solidarity movement. His father, being one of those who was arrested, probably ranks quite a bit higher in the esteem of many in the Polish-Canadian community because, especially if they were not a shipyard worker, but one of the mine workers, they were especially oppressed by the communist regime, the People's Republic of Poland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672521">However, I actually disagree with him. A perfect example of why I would say no is that it does not blur the lines. It blurs the lines when the government uses the Emergencies Act, invokes it with barely any notice and then rams it through and orders its backbenchers, who are wavering, that this is a matter of confidence. The Emergencies Act was used purely to direct the police on what to do over several days. That is when we really fog it over and confuse people because politicians do not direct police forces. They simply lay out the rules that are supposed to apply, but they do not select the people who are supposed to be arrested. The Emergencies Act being used by the government the member belongs to is the problem here.</ParaText>

In the sample size that the Auditor General used to verify the process of spending and how decisions were made, she identified 186 particular situations where there was a conflict of interest or an apparent conflict of interest. These are situations where board members of the green slush fund should have recused themselves from the decision-making process.</ParaText>

In fact, one of the previous law clerks, I will remind the House, was actually appointed to become the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

              <ParaText id="8672548">Madam Speaker, my colleagues across the way are clearly very frustrated that we are still in this situation, but they know full well the reason we are still here is that a majority of members of the House, the people's House, have demanded documents. It is the unassailable right of this place to demand documents from the executive. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> even ruled in favour of the demand that was brought forward, and the government still continues to ignore the order. It is continuing to hide, and we keep demanding the documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672549">It has been four weeks, and the Liberals have had to come up with different lines every week about why they simply cannot do what the House has demanded, despite the fact that they know full well the House has the complete authority to demand the documents and they should hand them over. However, they continue to be more interested in hiding documents and protecting their own backsides instead than in doing what the duly elected members of this place have demanded. It has been four weeks of this, when we could be debating the issues of the day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672550">There are real problems we face in this country that Canadians are struggling with. Let us talk about affordability for a moment. Why are we not talking about that? Food bank usage in Canada is higher than it has ever been in the history of tracking these things. We should be discussing ways to solve the problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672551">The carbon tax, we know, makes everything more expensive. When we tax the farmer who grows the food and the trucker who delivers the food, when we tax food at every stage of the process, we make food more expensive. That includes taxing the food banks that buy food to serve people who need help. We could be debating how to eliminate the carbon tax and make food more affordable for Canadians; instead, we are still dealing with the cover-up of documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672552">The carbon tax also makes heating our home more expensive. We are getting close to winter and it is starting to get a little chilly out there. I finally brought my winter coat from home because Ottawa is getting chillier. It is expensive to heat our homes, and winter is coming. Many Canadians are forced to choose between paying their heating bill this month or buying groceries. Constituents in my riding have visited me in tears because they do not know what they are going to do. The food bank in their community they used to donate to they are now using. They are worried. Many of them are ashamed. They cannot believe they are in this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672553">Why are we not debating proposals to make Canadians' lives easier, to make it easier for them to heat their home and buy food? We could be debating the Conservative proposal to axe the tax, eliminate the carbon tax that makes everything more expensive, yet here we are. We are still talking about getting the documents that the majority of members of the House, as is their right as elected representatives of the common people, have demanded, and the government still refuses. We could be solving problems. We could be focused on the problems if only we had a government that was open and transparent by default.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672554">We will all recall the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s talking about being open and transparent by default. I agree that government should be, but it is pretty clear, after the demonstration of four weeks of completely disrespecting the order of the House, that the government is anything but open and transparent by default. It is more interested in protecting itself and hiding the corruption, the rot at the centre of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672555">I was talking about homes and people who are struggling to pay to heat their home. That refers to people who actually have homes. There is no shortage of people in this country, young people particularly, who have given up on the dream of ever owning a home, never mind heating it. Eighty per cent of young people who do not own a home now believe that owning a home is only for the very rich. That is something we should be addressing in the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672556">We should be fixing the problems and changing things in the House. Instead we are here trying to get documents and uncover the Liberals' corruption, but they continue to try to protect themselves and keep things hidden because they are not remotely close to open and transparent by default. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, not only is it not open and transparent by default, but home prices have doubled, rents have doubled and mortgage payments have doubled. It is no wonder that young people have simply given up on the dream of home ownership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672557">It is no wonder that young people have given up on this place's doing anything to solve the problems they face, because here we are, struggling to get documents that a majority of members of the House have demanded, as is their right, and the government continues to refuse to deliver them. It is as if it thinks it is all-powerful and does not have to listen to what the House says.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672558">However, the House is supreme; that is parliamentary supremacy. I did a little lecture on that not too long ago. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278394" Type="2">Saint John—Rothesay</Affiliation> remembers it. I see the giggle on his face because he knows it was a good speech. He understands the importance of parliamentary supremacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672559">We should be debating things in the House right now that are not about the Liberals' cover-up but about solving problems for Canadians. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> just proposed a brilliant idea that I know some of the members over there on the Liberal benches really like, which is to eliminate the federal sales tax on new homes sold for under a million dollars in this country. It has the potential of saving people up to $50,000 on the purchase of a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672560">Here is the thing: We are not debating the idea. We have not got a motion on the floor proposing that the government adopt the change and eliminate the federal sales tax on new homes, because it is trying to cover up its corruption. It is trying to cover its tracks in all the conflicts of interest, so here we are. We could be talking about how we could be saving Canadians $50,000 on the purchase of a home, or $2,200 a year in mortgage payments, which is about the same amount. Imagine what that could do. Imagine how many more people could afford to buy a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672561">Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has written to the premiers to suggest they follow suit and eliminate the provincial sales tax on the purchase of a new home. In Ontario, that has the potential of reducing the cost of a new home by another 8%. It is a brilliant idea. It could save thousands of dollars on the cost of a new home. More Canadians could have a home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672562">For the 80% of young people who believe that owning a home is only for the very rich and who have given up on the dream of home ownership, we would actually be doing something to solve that. We would be delivering hope and solutions to young people, yet here we are still debating, still pushing, still pressuring the government to hand over the documents and to be open and transparent by default.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672563">It is funny that we talk about transparency, because I am sure members will remember that on November 4, 2015, the then newly elected Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> released an open letter. I am going to read from it:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672564">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...Canadians need to have faith in their government’s honesty and willingness to listen. That is why we committed to set a higher bar for openness and transparency in Ottawa. Government and its information must be open by default. Simply put, it is time to shine more light on government to make sure it remains focused on the people it was created to serve—you.</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672565">That sure sounds refreshing. What a great idea that is: a government that is open by default. It promised to be. How has that gone since 2015?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672566">Before I arrived here, I grew up in and spent a lifetime in municipal politics. I see a couple of colleagues who have been in municipal politics in Ontario. They know how local government works; it is absolutely open by default. Every council meeting and every committee meeting is open to the public. Closed sessions are a very rare thing; they are only for legal advice, purchasing property or dealing with staffing issues, such as if somebody has to be fired, for example. Everything else is open.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672567">In fact, a majority of council members cannot just get together and have a chat. That is against the rules because it is like a council meeting in secret. It is open by default. I look at some colleagues who have lived in that world; they know, and I know they absolutely know, that they would not last very long if they ever operated at local council the way the government operates. They would be kicked out of office. It is a far cry here from what goes on at the local level, for sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672568">We are asking why we need to be transparent in this case, what the need for transparency is here. The Liberal insiders on the Sustainable Development Technology Canada board broke the public trust. They did not care about the honour and integrity of the office they held.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672569">That was until November 2022, when literally heroic whistle-blowers raised the alarm. They raised their concerns about what was going on in this agency. They called the Auditor General; at that point, the Auditor General saw enough of an issue that she launched an investigation. From this investigation, she found widespread conflicts of interest, corruption and abuse of Canadians' hard-earned dollars at Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672570">In fact, as has been said in here many times, the Auditor General found that 82% of the transactions involving payments from Sustainable Development Technology Canada to companies approved by the board of directors were conflicted. That is almost all of them. Over the five-year period the Auditor General examined, 82% of the transactions she reviewed were conflicted. Honestly, at the local level, in municipal government, they would go to jail for this kind of stuff. It is insane, yet here we are demanding documents for what amounts to corruption worth $400 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672571">This makes the sponsorship scandal back in the Chrétien era seem quite tiny by comparison. It is $400 million, but they say no, we cannot show that information. It does not matter what Parliament, in its supremacy, has said. We have to protect this person; we have to protect that person. In truth, they are protecting themselves. This is a level of corruption and conflict of interest that is almost unimaginable. I cannot think of another example this bad in the history of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672572"> Never mind the $300 million of conflicted transactions, the Auditor General also found that the Liberal-appointed board funded $58 million of projects that were not even eligible by the criteria of the agency. They did not meet the criteria. We talk to all kinds of agencies, such as charities and municipalities all across this country, that apply for federal programs all the time; they get turned down. They have amazing applications, and they do all the things they have to do. They dot all the i's and cross all the t's; they have amazing projects, amazing ideas, but they get turned down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672573">However, if people are Liberal insiders, it does not matter whether they meet the criteria, because someone has their back. They will take care of them. Can we imagine how many homes could be built with $58 million? How many more people who cannot afford to buy food could be supported in this country? It was $58 million; they were not even eligible, but they got their money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672574">How does this happen? We will go back. The House ordered the production of documents. A majority of members of the House voted back in June. A majority voted to hand over the documents. It is an extraordinary power. I know I have talked about this before. The government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the departments his cabinet controls have all just refused. They have redacted and removed portions of the documents the House has requested. They have just done their own thing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672575">We cannot think this is just a one-off. We might think, yes, it is a bit embarrassing that this arm's-length group did something that was not great, but we collapsed that; we have now done this other thing, and it is all good. The Liberals would like us to believe that they have it fixed, that everything is fine. They say, “Do not look here. We can be trusted. Do not worry.” However, the government has gone to great lengths to hide this, and it is not the first time. If this were the first time something like this had happened over the last nine years, we would think that maybe we could cut them some slack, they would fix things and maybe they were being honest. However, it is not the first time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672576"> Canadians will remember the Winnipeg lab documents case. The government worked to hide documents related to the firing of two scientists at the national microbiology laboratory in Winnipeg. This is another example of the power of the House and its members. It is not because we are a power-hungry group but because, as we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> back when he talked about openness and transparency by default, sunlight is the best disinfectant. This $400-million green slush fund is in desperate need of some sunlight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672577">The president of the Public Health Agency of Canada was called to the bar to be admonished by the former Speaker. We will all remember this. I remember it quite vividly because I am still a fairly new member of this place. That has not happened in something like 100 years, and there he was, standing there, being admonished. The Speaker said, “The [powers] in question, like all those enjoyed by the House collectively and by members individually, are essential to the performance of their duties. The House has the power, and indeed the duty, to reaffirm them when obstruction or interference impedes its deliberations.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672578"> That is why we are here today. The House has been seized of a matter. We have demanded documents related to multi-million dollar corruption, conflict of interest and giving of money to organizations that did not even comply with the rules. The green slush fund is corruption on a massive scale. The government is desperate to cover its tracks. It has ignored the order and the supremacy of the House for four weeks. Meanwhile, Canadians suffer, and we are not debating the solutions and solving problems that Canadians deserve answers and solutions for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672579"> Here we are. We continue to debate, and these guys could solve it right now. They could hand over the documents. Let us be open and transparent by default. Let us shed some sunlight on this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672584">Mr. Speaker, when the member was talking about other people who ran for municipal office or sat on city councils, I could not help but think that he was referring to me. I will tell him something that I did not do when I was on city council, because I did spend a lot of time on city council in Ontario, as he did. I never once told the chief of police what to do. I never once collected evidence for the chief of police in Kingston. I actually went to the chief of police quite often to seek advice as to how to do things. I listened to the chief of police when they spoke to me, especially in the area of their expertise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672585">In this case, we have the chief of the RCMP, the RCMP commissioner, who says, “Any information obtained through the Motion or other compulsory authorities would need to be segregated from an RCMP investigation.

              <ParaText id="8672606"> Mr. Speaker, it is truly a privilege to stand here on behalf of the wonderful people of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672607">When we talk about privilege, we must remember that our work here representing our constituents is an honour, not an entitlement. Privilege is something that we as parliamentarians have inherited through the centuries to ensure that we can speak and exercise our roles as grantors of supply and legislators. It is something entrusted to us, and we must ensure that when it comes time for a new generation of parliamentarians, it is in the same condition or better than when we received it. Canadians sent us here with the expectation that we will carry out these duties with respect and integrity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672608">Throughout my public service as a city councillor and now as a member of Parliament, I have consistently strived to maintain what I call the public trust. That is to say, in our conduct within our public institutions, we act as trustees of sorts. We may have legitimate disagreements about how best to pursue the public interest through reason, reflection, discussion and debates, but the heart of any decision must be centred on protecting the collective trust of the people we serve. People in positions of leadership make a point of carrying out duties that will maintain or enhance the trust in our system as much as possible. Unfortunately, what we have seen with Sustainable Development Technology Canada and its green slush fund falls far short of that standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672609"> Ultimately, it comes down to what kind of country we wish to see and believe in. It could be a country where hard work and sacrifice earn a powerful paycheque, where a citizen can afford nutritious food, gas and a home in a safe neighbourhood, and where they can raise a family, perhaps build a business or retire with dignity. However, it could be a country where hard work and sacrifice are viewed as something for lesser mortals, where family and high-corporate or political connections assure success rather than a better idea, a mousetrap or a hustle, where an economy of gatekeepers is made for and managed by the gatekeeping class and those seeking to join it, and where merit and hard work are undervalued in light of who someone knows and what they can do with their position of authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672610"> The latter description of country is corrosive, and it harms the previous version. It is not the kind of Canada I want to see for my children. However, here is where these two conflicting visions have collided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672611"> Today, we have a Canada where over two million hard-working working-class people and those with lower incomes are lining up at food banks to feed themselves, while a rogue Crown corporation, appointed by the NDP-Liberal government, puts itself first in line for its own interests, not for the Canadians who are suffering the worst of our own made-in-Canada, GDP-per-head recession. In the past eight out of nine quarters, Canadians have seen their purchasing power eroded. We are seeing the NDP-Liberal government, which brags that it is the most activist government ever, leave people to watch their dollar erode and our country's productivity erode. Those so-called progressives should be mindful of what U.S. economist Paul Krugman warned: “productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything.” That remark, after eight back-to-back quarters of a declining GDP per head, should act as a cold shower for all members of this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672612">We have young people who are working multiple jobs only to find themselves locked out of the dream of home ownership, seniors who would prefer to volunteer at food banks, not line up at them, and families that use metal detectors to look for disposable needles and drug paraphernalia on their children's soccer field. They scratch their heads asking, “What has happened in this country?” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672615">Let us review what we know. Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, was founded in 2001 to provide taxpayer-funded support to green technology companies that were looking to be commercialized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672616">The foundation has received $1 billion of taxpayer money since this Liberal government was elected. Investigations by parliamentary committees found that, over a five-year period reviewed by the Auditor General, 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board of directors involved conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672617">Let me say that again: 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board of directors involved conflicts of interest. According to the Auditor General, that is $330 million of taxpayer money that was given to companies whose board members were in a conflict of interest when they voted to allocate the funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672618">These figures can be alarming. Many Canadians get mad when they learn how much money was involved here. It gets worse. The Auditor General also found that the board of directors approved $59 million in additional projects that were outside the foundation's mandate, breaking the SDTC contribution agreements and Canada's conflict of interest laws.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>

              <ParaText id="8672621">Let us stop for a moment. In my riding, I have had constituents who, through no fault of their own, were overpaid CERB. In those situations, CRA clawed back every single dollar of overpayment. I have also had citizens who were deemed ineligible for CERB funding after the fact, and they found every single dollar clawed back. What will happen to these ineligible projects at SDTC? Will these people have that money clawed back as well, or is it different when it comes to Liberal insiders pocketing tax dollars they are not eligible for? Do members of the Liberal government think that is right? It would be one set of rules for someone who received CERB payments they were not eligible for and a different set of rules for ineligible insiders cashing in on SDTC funding they were not eligible for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672622">How do these things happen? How is it that no one raised a red flag? Why is no one in the Liberal government saying we need to claw funds back? Why is it that fairness for everyone does not apply to Liberal insiders?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672623">Let us be clear. The law clearly states that a Governor in Council appointee chosen by the government to oversee taxpayer funds should not personally benefit from their committee role, nor should their family, yet somehow, over five years, the board approved 405 transactions, and the Auditor General, after examining 226, discovered that 186 of them were conflicted, an astonishing 82% totalling $330 million. This begs the question: If the Auditor General were to analyze all 400 transactions, how many more would show similar conflicts? Those 400 transactions represent $832 million in taxpayer money. It appears that appointees selected by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet position themselves to profit from this privilege. That is a staggering figure. Some might even call it outrageous.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672624">The Auditor General identified nine directors as the people responsible for these conflicts of interest. That is why the CFO of the industry department told the whistle-blower that this issue was far bigger than the Chrétien government's $42‑million sponsorship scandal. What we are uncovering is just the tip of the iceberg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672625">I congratulate my colleagues on the committee for their diligent work in shedding light on these matters. Each layer they remove leads to requests for more documents that reveal more disturbing details. The government has consistently obstructed our efforts to obtain these documents, and we know why. Even a preliminary investigation by the Auditor General shows that $390 million was paid out to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672626">The Liberals and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are resisting the production order for documents to be submitted to the RCMP. The Prime Minister's office defied the House's order and instructed departments to redact sensitive information, resulting in documents being heavily blacked out or not given at all. What are they hiding? We all know what the Liberals are hiding. I suspect they are hiding further misconduct and misuse of taxpayer funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672627"> The limited information we have seen, 226 out of 400 transactions, indicates this is just the beginning, amounting to $390 million. Strangely, this does not seem to faze the NDP-Liberal government. It is almost as if the program was deliberately designed to work this way, Liberals benefiting Liberal appointees. This is reminiscent of past scandals, like SNC-Lavalin, where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> attempted to exert pressure on then-member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville Jody Wilson-Raybould to protect his wealthy associates. When she refused to comply, our great feminist Prime Minister dismissed her. Similarly, when Dr. Jane Philpott spoke out against this pathetic and shameful treatment, she was also ousted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672628">This is the track record of our so-called feminist <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is the same Prime Minister who accepted a lavish vacation from the Aga Khan and has repeatedly violated ethical standards. It should come as no surprise that we find ourselves in yet another Liberal scandal involving the protection and enrichment of Liberal insiders, entitled to their entitlements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672629">Let us also not forget that millions of taxpayer dollars were funnelled to a charity that employed members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own family. Did he take responsibility? No, but his friend, Mr. Morneau did. It is funny how that works. It is always someone else who takes his hits. I guess that was a learning experience for the rest of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672630">I must express my disappointment at the backbenchers on that side of the House. Sure, the infamous 24 who oppose the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s continued premiership, and note I did not refer to it as leadership, have been making the news. Surely, there must be more than 24 who feel their government's stonewalling of this House's production order is out of order. They must be receiving the same calls and emails from constituents that I am.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672631"> They should remember that while they sit on the government side, unless they are in cabinet, and it might be stretched to a parliamentary secretary, technically anyone who is not in cabinet is not part of the government. Those MPs work for the Canadians who elected them. Those seats do not belong to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or his prime ministerial office. They belong to the people that those MPs represent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672632">I encourage them to reflect on why they ran for public office. I doubt any of them imagined that they would spend their time covering for entitled Liberal insiders who have profited from ill-gotten gains.

              <ParaText id="8672634">With the help of a whistle-blower, my colleagues discovered even more corruption. The House ordered documents to be produced so that the RCMP could determine whether a criminal investigation is justified. The Liberal government refused to produce the documents, which, according to the Speaker's ruling, constitutes a breach of our privilege. For nearly three months now, instead of working for Canadians, we have been obstructed by a government that is trying to protect a Prime Minister who has clearly been here too long.</ParaText>

We can discuss and debate the ideas about how best to serve the public interest. However, that public trust means that we have to view this place as being worthy so that when we discuss our work in Parliament, we can say a majority of the House decided to force the government to bring forward documents and the government followed that order, the same as a court order would be in any other circumstance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672637">This is Parliament. These are the rules that we have inherited. This is the chamber that we have all sought and given so much to be here so that so we can represent our constituents. Let us ensure that when we give the torch to the next generation of parliamentarians, they can look us in the eye and say this is as good as or better than when we found it. We cannot allow this privilege to be something we can fritter away. This is something that we need to press the government on. Government members themselves, who are not part of the cabinet, should be impressing upon their own <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet just to open it up. Let these things come forward and then we can move to other discussions.

I do not believe the trust that was given to those members of Parliament at that time was honoured because, essentially, the supremacy of Parliament when it comes to certain elements of law-making is no longer supreme. I accept that the Supreme Court exists and can rule on the constitutionality of said laws under the charter. I respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672642">What I will also say is that it means more so than ever that over matters under our own jurisdiction, specifically a production order on the government, that the government should not believe that it exists upon itself. In our system it is brought from us, the legislative branch, to the executive branch. They are tied at the hip for a reason.

              <ParaText id="8672643">I think that we have to show that when we do a production order, we mean business.

We are working to try to re-establish that by what we are asking. My colleague has been here a long and understands what trust is. How important is trust in this particular issue?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672651">Mr. Speaker, in a free and open society, people only make decisions if they know there is certainty. How do we know that when we get out of bed in the morning we are not going to get run over? We trust that the system is going to operate as it should. This is one of the reasons we have representative democracy, where we are not all voting on an app, like perhaps some jurisdictions do. In places like Switzerland, its law allows for direct democracy. That involves too much time and consideration, and many Canadians just want to know that when they elect a member of Parliament, that person is going to come to Ottawa and be powerful, speak up for their interests and make sure they have a government that respects the rule of law, the Constitution and Parliament and those people who are working in it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672652">We have to respect ourselves, and a big part of that is trust that when someone votes for someone, they are going to be good actors. I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has spoken lots about that, especially in his victory speech in 2015. “Sunny ways”, my friend, sunny ways. Lord Acton said that all politics end in failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672653">It does not mean people are failures, it just means the grand visions we have sometimes hit reality. The one thing we should never lose is trust, so let us show trust in the process. Let us get the government to give us the documents so we can properly show the Canadian public we are trustworthy and that our democracy delivers for them. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8672657">Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent point, because the Auditor General has publicly said that their office has asked for more funding because under the Liberal government, spending has gone up by unbelievable amounts and has effectively doubled our debt. Canadians may not feel that they are getting better results for it, but more money has sloshed through the system through Parliament, and the Auditor General has felt they could not do as good a job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672658"> The member is 100% right; I think about 40% or fewer of the projects were sampled, and the Auditor General found 282 different cases of conflict of interest or instances where the rules were not followed. I raised the case of ineligible companies receiving funding and getting different treatment than ineligible Canadians when they applied for CERB and had to pay it all back. At the end of the day, there are so many other priorities that could have happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672659">The one point I want to home in on is that the whole idea of the Auditor General is that we have a trustworthy source that is non-partisan and that we can all agree on. I really do not understand where backbench members of the Liberal caucus are on this. They should be knocking down the door, saying, “The Auditor General has said something is wrong. What are we doing to fix it?”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8672661"> Mr. Speaker, I like to refer to “Edmonton West Edmonton Mall” as the official name of my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672662">I am very pleased to rise to discuss the privilege motion we have before us, specifically on the green slush fund but on one of the government's many environmental, green scandals. Yes, I did say “scandals”. I am sure a lot of us are wondering, “Scandals, plural?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672663">Yes, I have scanned through some, and there are five we are looking at right now. There is, of course, the green slush fund. We have the Environment Canada contribution audit scandal. We have the net-zero accelerator scandal. I will get to those later. We also have the government misleading Canadians and the House, repeatedly, on the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672664">Many members, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, have stood in the House and said the carbon tax was revenue-neutral. In fact, we went back through Hansard and counted 37 times that the Liberals claimed the carbon tax was revenue-neutral. The problem is that the public accounts very clearly stated that $100 million was being diverted to other uses. It is not revenue-neutral, as proven by the public accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672665">We have also heard the government repeatedly say that more money would go back in the pockets of Canadians, yet the Parliamentary Budget Officer has come out and stated very clearly that, because of the effects on the economy and the knock-on costs as the tax goes through the system, Canadians are worse off. Albertans will be worse off by over $750 per family because of the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672666">We have the Parks Canada scandal, under Environment Canada, with the unfortunate issue of Jasper burning. I used to work for a company that had a hotel in Jasper. Unfortunately, a lot of employees are now out of work and also homeless. The government, of course, quickly blamed everything on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672667">In fact, we have seen in documents that have come out that the government, for years, ignored warnings of a buildup of dead trees, bushes, leaves and other items due to the mountain pine beetle. They ignored it all for political optics. I am going to read from an access to information email from Environment Canada: “At what point do we make the organizational decision to cancel planned prescribed burns in Western Canada? As more and more media articles raise public concern over drought conditions, public and political perception may become more important than actual prescription windows.” Here we have the government stating that perhaps optics are more important than the actual fix we know about, which is clearing the trees and prescribed burns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672668">Despite so many things to talk about, I only have so much time, so I am going to focus on three. The first is, of course, the green slush fund, which is Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672669">Parliament has ordered documents to be handed over and the Liberals are refusing to hand over those documents, which makes us wonder what they are hiding. What are they hiding that is so bad that the government is allowing weeks and weeks of its legislative agenda to be pushed aside for this debate? Is it that 400 million taxpayer dollars were being funnelled by Liberal insiders to other Liberal insiders? Is it that the Liberal appointees ignored conflict rules 88 times when funnelling this money to Liberal insiders, or is it perhaps the millions given to ineligible recipients?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672670">The Industry Canada contribution agreement, which was the contract, basically, that outlined eligibility and the rules to follow, clearly stated that all conflicts on the board of SDTC had to be reported to the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672671"> In committee, we asked former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains about this and there was no answer. It got so bad that we are approaching a privilege motion in the public accounts committee over his refusal to answer. Again, this was right in the contribution contract with Industry Canada. Navdeep Bains or the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> would have to have been advised of these 88 conflicts of interest, which led to millions, hundreds of millions, of taxpayer dollars going to Liberal insiders or ineligible recipients. Did the ministers know and do nothing, or were the ministers not informed? These documents would tell us, but the Liberals will not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672672">I have to wonder if these documents further implicate the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. This same minister was financially involved in Cycle Capital, which was a recipient of tens of millions of dollars of the green slush fund. Of course, the founding member of Cycle Capital was on the board of SDTC. The founding member, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s partner, Andrée-Lise Méthot, was at the public accounts committee and we asked her about these conflicts. However, she noted that she and the minister barely made any money off of some of these grants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672673">Think about that. At what point does it become okay to have corruption? Is it if we barely make any money? Are we setting the new bar that it is okay to be corrupt as long as we barely make any money? That question could be answered by the documents and by the government, but it is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672674">We further heard from a senior bureaucrat of the Privy Council. The Privy Council, of course, is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, in informal terms; it is the department that serves the Prime Minister. This senior bureaucrat from the Privy Council, when we asked about why she had not turned over documents as ordered by Parliament, said that she was refusing to release the documents until she received permission from the former head of the board of SDTC, Annette Verschuren. This is the same Annette Verschuren who was found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner for violating conflict of interest agreements with SDTC grants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672675">Here we have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department stating that it needs permission from someone found guilty of violating the ethics code before it will hand over the unredacted documents that Parliament has ordered. We also have the Liberal-appointed chair sending taxpayers' dollars to her own company. Again, the government will not turn over the documents until it receives permission from her, for privacy reasons. Keep in mind that this was the hand-picked chair of Liberal minister Navdeep Bains, who, working outside of the application process, reached out and chose her after the application process for the role had closed. Again, here we have the Liberal government blocking access.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672676"> I want to move on to the next green scandal, the net-zero accelerator. Like the expensive Liberal housing accelerator that does not actually build houses, the net-zero accelerator does not actually reduce emissions. The environment commissioner reported that $8 billion for programs was paid out to ineligible companies, most with no plan to reduce emissions. The actual cost to Canadian taxpayers per tonne of reduced emissions was $523. If we think about that, the current carbon tax is working its way up to about $170, and the government paid $523 per tonne of reduced emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672677">The commissioner commented in his report that the money given out was “not part of any coherent...policy on decarbonization”. Of course, it is only $8 billion between friends. He also commented that the vast majority of projects have no written commitment “to reduce a precise amount of emissions”. If only life were so easy that we could give out $8 billion without telling the government what we were going to do with it or what we were going to achieve. Companies awarded billions had not even completed feasibility studies on how they were going to reduce emissions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672678"> The department raided other funding programs to top up funding to the net-zero accelerator because so much money had been committed to these companies that were not eligible and had not provided information on how they were going to reduce emissions. Funding was approved before the Liberals even did due diligence on the applications. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672679">One may ask what some of these companies are that were so deserving of the corporate welfare from taxpayers. One of them is a company called Geely. This is a China-owned car company that builds electric vehicles with forced Uyghur labour. Yes, Canadian taxpayers, through our friends in the Liberal government, are giving it corporate welfare for electric vehicles made in China by forced labour to be brought into the Canadian market. This is the same car company that will be paying 100% higher tariffs on the cars built, subsidized by Canadians, using forced labour and brought into Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672680">However, it gets worse. One would ask how it could get worse. The Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention states that Geely is a sponsor of war. It continues to help fund the Russian economy by continuing to do business in Russia and paying taxes in Russia. There is an independent Ukrainian agency noting that this company is a sponsor of war, but, what the heck, let us give them taxpayers' money anyway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672681">There is Stellantis, which is worth a market cap of $55 billion. It has half a billion dollars more on top of all the money it receives for the battery plants. General Motors, worth $70 billion, got $100 million of taxpayers' corporate welfare. Pratt &amp; Whitney, worth $222 billion, almost a quarter of a trillion dollars, got $60 million. All in all, $8 billion was given to companies worth over $900 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672682">I go back to what the environment commissioner said, that the money was given out without due diligence or proof that emissions would be reduced. The environment commissioner stated that the program did not even help the largest emitters in the country, the low-hanging fruit, where we could get the most bang from the buck. We heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> state today that the government was going to go after the oil and gas industry because it was the largest emitter and it would have the easiest path to reduce emissions. We have the environment commissioner noting the same government gave out $8 billion of corporate welfare, but did not even target the largest emitters, where we would get the most bang for the buck. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672683">The funny part of the report, on page 8 for those following at home, is where the environment commissioner notes that the government stated that any project above “$50 million also requires Treasury Board approval, concurrence letters from ministers of other concerned departments, and Cabinet approval, which can be fast-tracked with a letter to the Prime Minister”. Again, billions of dollars were given to companies that were not eligible, but it would have gone through Treasury Board and the minister. The Treasury Board and the minister did not do their jobs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672684">We would think that somewhere along the line, with $100 million going to General Motors, which is worth $70 billion, someone would have asked if the due diligence had been done and whether it was the right thing to do, but no. In fact, they even had a way to skirt the rules by fast-tracking this money by going right to the Prime Minister. I read in the report that the environment commissioner stated due diligence was not done. Companies received funding even before the project was properly vetted. How much money was given out from taxpayers that was fast-tracked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so the government could have optics instead of actual action on the environment? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672685">Now I come to the last scandal I want to talk about tonight, which is the Environment Canada contribution audit scandal. This is right from Environment Canada. Its internal auditors put out a report noting problems with the governance and conflict of interest rules, which we have heard about before, as well as weak guidelines on cash management for the grants and contributions given out by Environment Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672686">We would think that Environment Canada would be about helping the environment, but when we look through the report, we would find that were wrong if we thought that. Where did taxpayers' money go from Environment Canada? I will give some great examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672687">The Iron Ore Company, which owns Rio Tinto, got $18 million. Today, visitors from the juvenile diabetes research foundation came to our offices. They were looking for $15 million of funding over four years. They believe that they would have a medical breakthrough to cure type 1 diabetes. They are that close; they just need $15 million for four years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672688">However, where are we spending the money? Eighteen million dollars went to Rio Tinto. Oh, and by the way, it is the same Rio Tinto that got fined half a million dollars by the Quebec government for dumping harmful substances into the Saguenay River. Environment Canada is rewarding companies that have been fined for polluting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672689">Glencore, worth $53 billion, got $10 million of corporate welfare. This is after pleading guilty to corruption charges. It had to pay a settlement of a billion and a half dollars to the U.S. government, but it had $10 million towards the fine from Canada. Lafarge got $14 million. Guess what Lafarge got in trouble for and what it did with some of the money? It got fined for paying ISIS. Think about that, some of the worst atrocities done by the terrorists in ISIS, which was funded by Lafarge. The company was ordered by the U.S. government to pay a $780-million penalty. It is still operating in Syria right now, by the way. The taxpayers are helping the company through Environment Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672690">Copper Mountain Mine got $3 million, even though its head of security pleaded guilty to murdering indigenous activists. We are rewarding that through Environment Canada. Indigenous activists fighting for the environment were murdered by the company, but the Liberal government, Environment Canada, with its radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, is sending it corporate welfare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672691">Oh, there is Stellantis again. It was given $2.5 million. By the way, Stellantis was also fined for emissions cheating in Europe. Again, Environment Canada is giving corporate welfare to a company that was fined for cheating on the environment rules in Europe. Taxpayers are paying their fine, basically. Another one, QuadReal Property Group, was given $2.5 million. The company has been blacklisted in the U.S. for investments in companies in China using forced labour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672692">Owens Corning was given $2.5 million in taxpayers' money through Environment Canada. It was fined for hazardous waste violations, so there is another big company helping destroy the environment, but the government is giving it taxpayers' money. One of my favourites is that Cornell University has a $15-billion endowment fund, but Environment Canada is funding students in a foreign university instead of funding here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672693">I want to get back to the issue at hand, which is that the government will not hand over the documents. Michel Bédard, who is the law clerk and appeared at both the public accounts committee and at OGGO, made this statement: “There is no limit to the right of the House of Commons and of its committees to order the production of documents, providing that the documents are available in paper or electronic form and are in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672694">This is the crux of the issue. It is very clear that Parliament has the right to order the documents. Committee has demanded them. Parliament has demanded them. The government has given up four or five weeks of its legislative agenda to prevent the documents from coming out. We have to ask what it is hiding.</ParaText>

It is very clear from the documentation we have seen with the contribution agreements that he had to have been told that there were conflicts, and he purposely ignored that because it was benefiting Liberal insiders, or he refused to ask if there were issues. We had a whistle-blower who made it very clear that the current minister was aware that these issues were brought forward. We have also seen the previous minister, Navdeep Bains, go around the application process to hand-pick the CEO, who was later convicted of violating conflict of interest rules, the same person who the Privy Council is now protecting by refusing to turn over the documents. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672723">Mr. Speaker, the scandal continues. Parliament continues to uncover more evidence of the shameful record of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government after nine long years. Canadians are once again seeing that the Liberal government is not worth the corruption. It is deeply concerning to witness the government covering up another scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672724"> Every day, Conservatives expose more of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s corruption. We bring forward important testimony and new evidence that the Liberal government has tried to hide from Canadians. It is because of this corrupt and potentially criminal behaviour that Conservatives must rise in the House to bring home the facts, directly to Canadians. With so much going on, it is important to bring all Canadians up to speed on the deeply troubling situation that has paralyzed Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672725">For weeks, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has defied the will of Parliament by refusing to produce documents ordered by the House of Commons. For weeks, Conservatives have demanded that he surrender this evidence so parliamentarians can uncover the corruption that has seeped into another Liberal green slush fund: Sustainable Development Technology Canada, also known as SDTC. This is my second time rising in the House, and I will continue to rise as long as the Liberals refuse to hand over evidence to the RCMP. Conservatives will not allow the Prime Minister or his caucus to hide the truth that Canadians deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672726">How did we get here? For those just tuning into this scandal, I would like to explain how SDTC started to rot. According to the program's website, SDTC was a government-funded program that claimed to help “Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies by delivering critical funding support at every stage of their journey — from seed to success.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672727">What the program's website does not tell Canadians is that the SDTC program became corrupt when the Liberals made changes to its board of directors. In 2019, under the direction of the Liberal industry minister, new appointments were made to the SDTC board. The website does not tell us that many of these appointees' own companies would soon be caught in conflicts of interest with the same funds they were responsible for handing out. The SDTC website does not tell us that Liberal insiders began to siphon funds into their own pockets and were getting rich for years while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet turned a blind eye. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672728">How do we know this happened? In a tremendously brave manner, whistle-blowers came forward to call out the corruption they saw while working at SDTC. Without their honesty, the scandal may have never been uncovered. Thanks to these whistle-blowers, the alarms started to sound on the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672729">The ensuing investigations would suggest SDTC's negligence was much more than just mismanagement of funds. I refer to investigations, plural, because both the Ethics Commissioner and the Auditor General have reported findings of greed and corruption that were allowed to thrive under the Liberal government's watch. Over the course of multiple investigations, including investigations by Conservatives at committees, it seems Parliament has only scratched the surface of the Liberal corruption. What started as tens of thousands of Canadian tax dollars being quietly directed to Liberal insiders turned into hundreds of thousands, which turned into millions, then tens of millions and finally hundreds of millions of dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672730">Multiple investigations have revealed that through the green slush fund, $390 million in funding was approved for projects that had extremely concerning conflicts. What the Auditor General found, which was truly disturbing, was evidence that the Liberals' green slush fund had handed out $58 million to projects without a promise that the contribution agreement terms were met. Another $58 million went to 10 projects deemed ineligible as they, at times, could not prove an environmental benefit or were not developing green technology. Finally, there was $334 million in over 186 cases where SDTC board members held a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672731">This shocking misdirection of funds by Liberal-appointed board members has opened the eyes of Canadians to a corruption that demands Parliament's full attention. I am sure Canadians from my riding in Manitoba can think of many ways these hundreds of millions of dollars could have been used, whether it is improving internet and cellular connectivity in rural and remote regions or investing in law enforcement to crack down on crime. Instead, Liberal insiders got rich in the name of fighting climate change, all under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672732">I am proud to say that upon discovering this gross negligence and potentially criminal acts, the Conservatives stood firm and demanded that a proper investigation take place. The Conservatives voted to pass an order in the House of Commons to force the Liberals to hand over documents involved in their green slush fund. We demanded that these documents be handed over to the RCMP so a proper investigation could take place. However, surprise, surprise, the Liberals, who voted against the document production order, refused to release the documents to the House of Commons. This is undoubtedly a breach of parliamentary privilege, as the Speaker of the House of Commons has ruled. It is on this breach of privilege that my Conservative colleagues continue to rise today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672733">Not only were the Liberals caught giving funds to their Liberal friends, the minister responsible was also exposed for handing out tax dollars to projects without guaranteeing the projects would do good for the environment. This proves once again that the Liberals are nothing more than fake environmentalists. The Liberals failed to manage this program, leading to $390 million going into the bank accounts of Liberal insiders. Some SDTC recipients had no requirement to meet the environmental goals set out in the fund, and others were not even eligible for the funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672734">This is not the first time we have seen the Liberals mislead Canadians about the environmental record. After nine years, the Liberals have proven to be fake environmentalists. In the environment committee, Conservatives have uncovered extreme negligence and a cover-up attempt by the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672735">Evidence revealed at the Jasper wildfire investigation proves the Liberals do not care about the environment and will not accept responsibility for the damage their action caused. During the national tragedy this last July, a third of Jasper burned, resulting in nearly a billion dollars in damage and leaving over 2,000 people homeless. The environment committee launched an investigation into the Jasper wildfire. What it revealed was shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672736">For years, the Liberals were warned by experts that the deadfall caused by an infestation of mountain pine beetle meant the forest was a tinderbox waiting to ignite. Instead of taking action, the Liberals ignored experts and played politics. An email obtained by the Jasper wildfire investigation revealed that senior officials in the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>'s department discussed cancelling prescribed burns months before the Jasper wildfires: “At what point do we make the organizational decision to cancel...prescribed burns in Western Canada?” They went on: “political perception may become more important than actual prescription windows.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672737">In fact, alarm bells rang for years under the Liberal government, as local forestry experts raised concerns with forest mismanagement. In a situation similar to the one we are discussing today, whistle-blowers came to the committee to speak the truth. The Jasper wildfire investigation heard from professional foresters who warned the Liberal government in 2017 that a devastating fire in Jasper was not a matter of if but when. The same professional forester revealed, “Nothing was done to address the landscape of the beetle-killed timber to prevent the megafire of July 22, 2024.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672738">While the Liberal's radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> falsely claimed that his department did everything it could to prevent the fires, Conservatives exposed that Liberals ignored warnings about Jasper for years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672739">In fact, just like the green slush fund, the Liberals are failing to co-operate with another investigation, the Jasper wildfire investigation. On October 9, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for Jasper's recovery. On that same day, Conservatives passed a motion calling for the minister to testify at the Jasper wildfire investigation. That was 27 days ago. Despite this, the minister has gone into hiding. He does not want to come to committee, where he will be held accountable. Canadians want to know what the minister is hiding from this committee, and why he will not show up to answer the people of Jasper, who have lost their homes because of the Liberal government's inaction. This is just another example of Liberal cover-ups and corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672740">While the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for Jasper will not testify, Conservatives have continued this investigation on behalf of Canadians. The Jasper wildfire investigation also revealed that a Parks Canada employee, who spoke out about the mismanagement in Jasper, was fired under the Liberal government. The Jasper wildfire investigation also heard from professional forester Ken Hodges, who asked whether the inaction by the Liberal government could be considered criminal. Why does the question of criminality keep coming up under the government? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672741">The forestry expert submitted a written submission to the Jasper wildfire investigation that stated, “Was the inaction by Parks, knowing the issue and concerns, that created this catastrophe a criminal act?” Canadians should be concerned by this question, which shows once again how often the Liberal government's actions blur the lines between negligence and criminal behaviour. The Jasper wildfire investigation is ongoing, as Conservatives continue to uncover powerful evidence that shows Liberal negligence allowed Jasper to burn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672742">We have to hold the government accountable. This is precisely why the SDTC documents must be handed over to the RCMP, so Canadians can understand just how corrupt this deal was and whether it was criminal. Canadians are rightfully wondering about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672743">To the millions of Canadians who are outraged to learn about this corrupt and potentially criminal use of Canadian tax dollars, I would direct them to yet another Liberal handout that has just been exposed. I refer to yet another flashy Liberal announcement earlier this September, this time for a project the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed would bring high-speed Internet to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672744">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> claimed his government had signed a $2-billion deal with Telesat, which would lead to “better and faster Internet service, even in rural, remote, and Northern communities.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672745">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went on to claim, “Telesat Lightspeed will expand Internet and 5G networks in communities across Canada, with affordable, high-speed broadband connectivity.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672746">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> also said, “The network will accelerate the federal government’s work to connect all Canadians to high-speed Internet by 2030.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672747">The Liberal government handed out tax dollars in another deal they claim will connect rural and remote Canadians, but guess what we just learned? There is zero commitment to connect any household with Internet with this $2 billion. There is zero, nothing, nada and none. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672748">I asked the government, in a written question, “What are the complete details of financial penalties, if any, for not connecting the number of households agreed to in the funding agreement”? This was the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s response, who, by the way, was the same minister overseeing the green slush fund: “The funding agreement does not include any commitment in regards to number of households to be connected to high-speed Internet”, then went on to say, “and so there are no associated financial penalties in this regard.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8672749"> Can members actually believe this? It is a $2-billion joke. Canadians are being forced to pay $2 billion for a connectivity program that may not connect a single household. How can we expect to connect Canadians to high-speed Internet when our contract does not even set a minimum number of households that must be connected? Was it laziness, neglect or corruption? It was probably all of the above. At the end of the day, this means Canadians will not receive the connectivity services they paid for, even though these services can mean the difference between life and death, especially in rural and remote regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672750"> The news comes after last year's findings in the Auditor General's damning report of the Liberal government's discovery that over a million households in rural Canada and over half of first nations still do not have access to high-speed Internet. It is becoming very clear that the Liberals measure success by how many tax dollars they spend instead of by the results they achieve. It seems that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has no problem sending money to his friends in big corporations; he does not expect to receive anything in return for Canadians. It is no wonder that, despite multi-billion dollar deals, Canadians are still not connected, especially in rural and remote areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672751"> This is why Conservatives are fighting for taxpayers. Allowing the Liberals' phony deals to go unchecked means more out-of-control spending and corruption, which only harms Canadians. Canadians know they cannot trust the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to get results. The only people better off after nine years under the current Prime Minister are Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672752"> Despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s claim, in 2015, that his government would be “open and transparent”, Canadians only see corruption and cover-ups. The Prime Minister's corruption and scandals are becoming so damning that even members of his own caucus have lost faith in him. The Prime Minister is hoping that the green slush fund scandal disappears, but Canadians will not let him get away with this. All the outraged Canadians watching from home can see a clear but unmistakable pattern. While Conservatives continue to expose the truth by asking questions, there seems to be no end to the Liberal scandals. Whether we look at past scandals, such as SNC-Lavalin, the WE Charity or the arrive scam, or the ongoing investigations, such as those into the Jasper wildfire or the $8-billion net-zero accelerator fund, new scandals are coming to light every day. There are new scandals like their $2-billion Telesat deal, mentioned today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672753"> All these blunders have a few things in common. They all have the fingerprints of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on them. They all involve Liberal negligence and the misuse of taxpayer dollars. Canadians are worse off for each and every scandal the Liberals have created. The Prime Minister has inflicted incredible damage on Canadians' well-being. Billions of Canadian tax dollars are being mismanaged by the Liberal government and, in some cases, going directly to the funds, with no real commitment to get results for Canadians, who foot the bill. Then, coincidentally, the same funds find their way into the pockets of Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672754"> It has become clear that, instead of working to ensure Canadians have affordable food to eat, Liberals are focused on ensuring that Liberals can fill their bank accounts. Instead of building enough affordable homes for Canadians to live in, Liberals choose to build a bureaucracy of red tape. Canadians deserve a government that can benefit them, not just the Liberal elite. I hope the Liberals can end the cover-up and hand over the documents, so we can expose to Canadians just how deep the Liberals' corruption runs. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672762">Mr. Speaker, in October, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="300000" Type="4">Minister of Small Business</Affiliation> why it was okay for Liberals to enrich their friends through Sustainable Development Technology Canada while small businesses are struggling. SDTC was established in 2001 and it operated with few issues under both previous Liberal and Conservative governments until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672763"> Earlier this year, the Auditor General released a damning report that outlined serious governance failures including 186 conflicts and over $400 million in misspent funds. The Auditor General made it clear that this scandal falls squarely on the shoulder of the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. The Liberals' refusal to table documents regarding the green slush fund has effectively paralyzed our Parliament, hindering our ability to do work for which we were elected. This obstruction makes it impossible for us to address pressing issues like Canada's poor economic environment with high business insolvencies, a lack of productivity and high tax burdens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672764">Indeed, small businesses are struggling more than ever. Business insolvencies were reported at 6,331 for the 12-month period ending August 2024, an increase of 51.6% year over year. More businesses closed than opened in four of the past five months. For example, in July 2024, we had 42,346 closing businesses and only 41,738 opening businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672765"> Canada's productivity has been stagnant since 2019, going from bad to worse since the pandemic, while other countries in the OECD have seen economic indicators improving. In key sectors, the combined activity of our agriculture, utilities, manufacturing and construction have fallen from one-third to one-quarter of the Canadian economy from 20 years ago. The construction sector has experienced some of the worst productivity in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672766"> The Bank of Canada's “Monetary Policy Report” in July 2024 reduced its forecast for overall Canadian productivity over the next two years, citing constraints on housing construction coming from structural factors such as the availability of land, zoning restrictions and a lack of skilled labour as the key concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672767">According to the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, in the third quarter of 2024, half of all businesses reported rising inflation as an expected obstacle over the next three months. The rising cost of inputs was the second-most frequently reported, followed by rising interest rates and debt costs. As well, Canadians are now being taxed higher on their capital gains. Business groups are saying that these changes are unwise at a time of weak productivity. More than half of small business owners believe it will affect the eventual sale of their business and that high capital gains are among the most economically damaging form of taxation because they reduce the incentive to innovate and invest. This will penalize a lifetime of hard work. I might add that Environment and Climate Change Canada's estimates of the cost of the carbon tax in 2030 is that it will cost the inflation-adjusted GDP $25 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672770">Our government understands the important role that small businesses play in the economy. This is why we will deliver $2.5 billion to close to 600,000 small and medium-sized enterprises by the end of the year through the Canada carbon rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672771">We have negotiated agreements with both Visa and Mastercard to reduce their interchange fees by up to 27%, or by $1 billion over the next five years. This means that more small businesses will be able to invest in their operations, create good jobs and strengthen our economy. To help Canadian businesses thrive, we have also invested in them through the Canada summer jobs programs and My Main Street programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672772">We lowered the small business tax rate from 11% to 9%. This is in recognition of the vital role that small businesses play in our economy and to enable business owners to have more cash flow. In 2024, small businesses and medium-sized enterprises will save an estimated $6.2 billion because of the preferred small business tax rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672773">To encourage Canadian innovators to turn their ideas into growing businesses, our government announced the creation of the Canadian entrepreneurs' incentive, which would reduce the inclusion rate to one-third of a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains. Combined with the increased $1.25-million lifetime capital gains exemption, the Canadian entrepreneurs' incentive would make eligible business owners better off when selling business shares worth up to $6.25 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672774">The government's latest budget devotes $200 million to renewing the venture capital catalyst initiative, with a goal of supporting venture capital for entrepreneurs who are part of equity-deserving groups, and investing in underserved communities and those outside key metropolitan areas. This will ensure that more small businesses owned by women and members of the Black, 2SLGBTQI+ and indigenous communities have access to the capital they need to start up and scale up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672775">Giving young people the option to choose entrepreneurship as a valuable career path for the future is important to our government. That is why in budget 2024 we invested $60 million in Futurpreneur Canada to help the organization increase its capacity to support young Canadian entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672776">These measures combined make a real, tangible difference that supports small businesses, including those led by women and members of equity-deserving groups.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672781">Mr. Speaker, I am back tonight to continue calling on the government to fix the Canada disability benefit. It is particularly timely because we are now nearing the time when we would expect to see its fall economic statement. It is an opportunity for the government to right a wrong. The stakes are pretty high: 1.5 million folks with disabilities are living in poverty across the country, which is 40% of all of those living in poverty in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672782">It was the Liberal Party's own platform in 2021 that said that a re-elected Liberal government would implement the Canada disability benefit, saying, “this new benefit will reduce poverty among persons with disabilities in the same manner as the Guaranteed Income Supplement and the Canada Child Benefit”. Both programs are in the order of tens of millions of dollars. I think it is around $15 billion for the Canada child benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672783">The <Affiliation DbId="253403" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, at the time, said that this would be a generational program, a sleeper legacy piece, if we do this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672784">We are now nearing the end of the government's mandate. The fall economic statement is likely the last opportunity to fix the benefit before we head into an election. If nothing is done, here is the reality: The proposed benefit amount is currently capped at a maximum of $200 a month and would not even start until July 2025. It is going to be limited to those who can access the incredibly burdensome disability tax credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672785">Recent modelling from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives shows that only 10,000 people will be lifted above the poverty line by the benefit, as is currently laid out. Here is Inclusion Canada commenting on it: “Our disappointment cannot be overstated”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672786">The government has got to fix the benefit, and the disability community has been calling for specifically seven things to address to fix the Canada disability benefit: first, remove the barriers to application by automatically enrolling recipients in provincial and territorial disability programs as well as those who currently receive CPPD in the Canada disability benefit and remove the requirement for a DTC; second, remove the additional barrier of another application that it has proposed in the regulations with a simple opt-out option for those who do not wish to receive the Canada disability benefit; third, support the dignity and the independence of each person with a disability by means testing the benefit against an individual's income; fourth, increase the maximum amount to lift folks with disabilities above the poverty line, taking into account the added cost for those who live with a disability; fifth, raise the income threshold so that it takes into account the added cost of living with a disability; sixth, fast-track the implementation and delivery of the benefit; seventh, issue retroactive payments dating back to when the legislation was passed in June 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672787">The government could pay for this easily if it redirected the subsidies it currently gives to the oil and gas industry every single year. That was about $18.5 billion in 2023 alone. This is about honouring the government's own promise. It is about addressing poverty. It is about listening to the disability community.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672808">We all know the carbon tax costs a majority of Canadians much more than they get back in rebates. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has confirmed that time and time again and recently confirmed it in his most recent PBO report. We all know the Canadian Trucking Alliance has said the carbon tax, from 2019 to 2030, will cost the trucking industry $26 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672809"> How do the NDP-Liberals not think that that cost will get passed on to consumers, for example, at the grocery store? We have seen grocery costs skyrocket under the NDP-Liberal government over the last few years. I am sure whoever gets up on that side will say we have heard the PBO say eight out of 10 Canadians are better off with the carbon tax rebate, but it is not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672810"> When we take in the total cost, the indirect cost, of the carbon tax, I would say a vast majority of Canadians are worse off. The rebate is minuscule, and the carbon tax is put on, in most parts of the country, home heating and air conditioning; every time people fill up their gas tank and every time they go to the grocery store, they get hit again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672811"> Canadians now realize the NDP-Liberal government is not worth the cost. Over the nine long years it has been in government, everything has gone up in price. We have heard it time and again: costs are up, taxes are up and time is up. It is time to have a carbon tax election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672812">We even see the Liberals' junior partner, the NDP, waffling a bit on the carbon tax. We saw the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, right in the middle of the <Affiliation DbId="311568" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> by-election, say that maybe the New Democrats are not in favour of a carbon tax. Only days later, he flip-flopped back to come on board. We saw the NDP Premier in B.C., Mr. Eby, say the carbon tax is hurting people in B.C., and maybe the government would revisit that. He made that promise during an election campaign, but once again, the NDP will go back to their old ways of foisting the carbon tax on the Canadian people in B.C., and making them pay more each and every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672813"> I would like a clear answer from whichever Liberal is going to give an answer this evening about why the Liberals continue to break the promise they gave in the 2019 campaign that they would never raise the carbon tax past $50 a tonne. It was in the campaign platform. That was the Liberal commitment, that they would never raise the carbon tax past $50 a tonne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672814">What we are going to see by 2030 is a quadrupling of the carbon tax. It is going to cost each and every Canadian an extra 61¢ a litre. That is an undeniable fact. I am hoping to have an answer to why the Liberals are breaking their promise to Canadians and quadrupling the carbon tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672815">Mr. Speaker, without an ounce of irony, the hon. member gets up and talks about breaking promises. That member ran on pricing pollution; he and every member of his party ran on a carbon tax. It is in his platform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672816">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672817">
                <B>Mr. Chris Bittle:</B> Mr. Speaker, he is heckling; he says, “Show me where it is.” There was an announcement. It was on the cover of the Conservatives' platform. The guy with the muscles, whom they got rid of a little bit after, ran on a carbon price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672818"> It is shocking. I looked it up before the speech, and more than half of the member's province is currently in drought conditions. However, in his entire speech, he did not talk about any action on climate change. Climate change is affecting the farmers, whom he purports to stand up for, in dramatic ways. It is affecting yields and their livelihood, and he says, “I don't care.” Maybe in Regina, the impact on farmers of climate change beyond the borders of his riding does not matter. However, as the hon. member and I have discussed, we both like to eat. Is it not important that we stand up for farmers, that we stand up for our economy and that we fight climate change? If not for them, should we not do it for our kids, who are facing this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672819"> Looking at my phone right now, it is 18°C on November 5 in Ottawa. We can see the impacts of climate change with our own eyes, and the hon. member just wants to stick his head in the sand. He quotes the Parliamentary Budget Officer. I do not know that he has even read the report, but the report specifically says that eight out of 10 Canadians do better under the carbon pricing system. However, he is the person who would speak to 100 doctors who say that smoking is bad for a person, speak to one doctor who says it is okay, and then say it is great to smoke. He would say that we should really do that, regardless of what the other 99 doctors said. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672820">Three hundred of the top economists in this country have said that carbon pricing works and that it puts more money in the pockets of Canadians; however, this member does not care. He went through his speech without even mentioning the rebate. Yes, costs get passed down, but there is a rebate back, and because more money is put in their pocket, Canadians are better off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672821">It is shocking that the members from the other side do not care about the environment, do not care about climate change, when it is an existential threat to Canada and Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672822">Mr. Speaker, there was so much wrong in that answer. I want to unpack it, but I do not have the time. However, one thing I will say, as a father of three, is that smoking is very bad. Please be assured that I do not think smoking is a good thing for anyone. I would just like to get that on the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672823"> I was not sure that my hon. colleague was going to answer, but I am glad he answered because I enjoy his clever banter every now and then. However, I will invite him out to Saskatchewan. I was born and raised on a farm, and so I know quite a few people who still ranch and farm. We will tour southwestern Saskatchewan. I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="278230" Type="2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</Affiliation> would help us out. We will tour northern Saskatchewan and go to every farmyard we can. The member can talk about the efficacy of the carbon tax and if it is helping or not. I will put our position on the table, and we can see what the people of Saskatchewan think is better. We can do that or have a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8672824">Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member thinks I come from, but there is a lot of agricultural land. I speak to farmers in Niagara, especially grape growers, and they are incredibly worried about climate change. Looking at British Columbia, farmers have lost 95% of their crops because of the impacts of climate change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8672825">The hon. member does not care. He buries his head in the sand and still does not acknowledge that eight out of 10 Canadians are better off with the rebate system in place. Not only has the Parliamentary Budget Officer said so, but 300 of the top economists in this country have as well. Again, he would pick that one doctor who says smoking is okay, regardless. <ForceColumnBreak /></ParaText>
