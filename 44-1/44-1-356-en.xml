              <ParaText id="8638498">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a petition on behalf of residents of Seabird Island First Nation. On June 23, 2022, Bill <Document DbId="11878436" Type="3">C-28</Document> received royal assent; it allowed for extreme intoxication to be used as a defence for violent crimes, such as sexual assault, where a reasonable person would not have foreseen the risk of a violent loss of control. Residents are concerned about the impact this will have on first nations communities such as theirs, which are often in rural areas that are underserved by law enforcement. The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to repeal the amendments made to the Criminal Code in Bill C-28 and uphold its commitment to protect first nations' safety, as well as the right to a justice system that honours victims by holding offenders responsible for violent crime.</ParaText>

The U.S. State Department's 20th “Trafficking in Persons Report” indicates that Canada meets the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. The report also highlights that the range, quality and timely delivery of trafficking-specific services varies across Canada, including persistent funding shortages.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638502">The petition relates to the construction by the Department of National Defence of a training facility at Hartlen Point, Nova Scotia. Petitioners are concerned that there will be significant damage to important habitat for migratory birds, a number of which are protected species. The area is described in the petition as one of the most important areas for bird observation, among Canada's top 10 bird observation sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638503">The petitioners are calling on the government to pause all construction and further development of the land-based testing facility at Hartlen Point, Nova Scotia, unless and until an independent impact assessment can take place that specifically focuses on the impacts on wildlife, migratory bird populations and their traffic, and full and transparent community consultation and outreach. Public access to all documents related to developing Hartlen Point is also requested by the petitioners.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638505">This petition addresses an urgent issue that has an impact on the health and safety of firefighters across Canada. Sponsored by the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>, it calls for immediate action to ban per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or forever chemicals, in firefighter gear and firefighting foam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638506"> PFAS are man-made chemicals that are resistant to heat, water and oil, but their durability comes at a significant cost. Scientific evidence links these substances to severe health issues, including cancer, putting firefighters who already face hazardous conditions at risk. Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population. We must mitigate these risks by regulating what we can control in their working conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638507"> Several countries have restricted PFAS use. Canada must follow suit. Our firefighters deserve gear that is free from toxic chemicals. Let us protect those who risk their lives for us. It is an honour to present this petition.</ParaText>

Therefore, the petitioners request all information permitted under subsections 37(1) and 34.3(1) necessary to determine if construction of this highway should be permitted, and if so, that it be under conditions set out in formal Fisheries Act authorisation. They call on the ministers to designate the Bradford Bypass for an impact assessment pursuant to the recently amended Impact Assessment Act, as well as to require a comprehensive, transparent species-at-risk permitting process to be followed.</ParaText>

I had a first-hand opportunity to tour one of these buildings. It is just not inhabitable. The government has said that it is going to fix the situation, but we have not seen any money in the budget, and that is why we wrote the dissenting report. It is so that we can dig deeper and make sure that we have not only livable conditions but also good conditions. In that way, we can attract more recruits and build our armed forces to what they should be in this day and age.</ParaText>

Five of the seven hand-picked Liberal directors voted to award their own companies more than $20 million of taxpayer funds. Liberal officials were present at every meeting of the SDTC, but here is the surprising part: They did nothing to stop this corruption. Whistle-blowers have alleged gross mismanagement, conflicts of interest and a toxic work environment. The Auditor General released a report detailing the gross mismanagement of public funds. </ParaText>

The Liberals have not done that. On October 1, Mr. Speaker, you ruled that the Liberals violated the House's order and that they must hand over all documents for a criminal investigation into the latest scandal, yet they still refuse. What are they hiding?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638529">The lack of transparency surrounding the allocation of these funds is mind-boggling. Why will the Liberals not hand over the documents?

              <ParaText id="8638530">As shadow minister for seniors, I stand here today deeply appalled by the wasteful spending that continues to plague our nation. This is not just about numbers on a balance sheet; it is about real people, particularly our most vulnerable citizens: our seniors. They rely heavily on government support programs funded by taxpayers. Seniors should not be left to wonder whether the government is prioritizing its friends' fake projects over seniors' support systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638531">In Canada, seniors face a variety of challenges that are often overlooked. Access to health care and long-term care remains a significant issue. Chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory illnesses, affect seniors the most and have a severe impact on their quality of life. The rising costs of essentials, such as groceries and electricity, are particularly harsh for those living on fixed incomes. We can imagine having to choose between heating our home and buying food. However, perhaps the most heartbreaking issue is loneliness and social isolation. Many seniors spend their days in solitude, with the tick-tock of the clock on the wall their only company. Studies have shown that approximately 41% of Canadians aged 50 and older are at risk of social isolation; up to 58% have experienced loneliness. This is not just a statistic. Rather, it is a silent epidemic that has severe mental and physical impacts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638532">Given these pressing issues, it is nothing short of appalling that $400 million has been siphoned off into projects that had no oversight or accountability.

              <ParaText id="8638533">Since the NDP-Liberal government came into power nine years ago, it has been involved in controversies and scandals: bad governance, a complete lack of transparency and accountability, and absolutely no moral compass. This is the legacy the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will leave behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638534">We all remember the Aga Khan vacation, when the<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> accepted a family vacation to a private island of the Aga Khan, a wealthy religious leader who happened to have lobbied the government on several occasions. The Prime Minister was found guilty of ethics violations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638535">There was the cash-for-access fundraiser where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> held private fundraisers for wealthy donors who could pay for access to the Prime Minister and his senior ministers. These events led to allegations that the donors were effectively buying access to decision-makers, which undermines transparency and fairness in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638536">There was also former governor general Julie Payette's resignation. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> changed the vetting process for the Governor General appointment, which resulted in the Julie Payette scandal. An independent review uncovered a toxic work environment in her office, including allegations of harassment and bullying, and now Canadian taxpayers are on the hook for her lifelong pension of $150,000 per year and up to $206,000 to cover her expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638537">We all remember the embarrassment the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> caused while attending Queen Elizabeth's funeral. Not only did he feel the need to charge the taxpayers $6,000 a night for his hotel room, but he also embarrassed Canadians when he was caught belting out <I>Bohemian Rhapsody</I> in the hotel lobby when the entire United Kingdom was in mourning. Although the Prime Minister has not been successful in many things, his singing included, he continues to successfully embarrass Canada on the world stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638538">However, probably the most famous scandal was the SNC-Lavalin affair, in which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and senior officials pressured then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin. When she refused, she was kicked out of caucus. The Prime Minister was found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638539">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is so arrogant that he still denies he did anything wrong, which is probably why he felt he could get away with siphoning $912 million to his friends at the WE Charity. The Prime Minister's family members have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from the WE Charity. This once again raised questions about a conflict of interest. The then finance minister Bill Morneau faced scrutiny for failing to recuse himself from the decision while his daughter worked for the charity. He ultimately resigned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638540">These are just a few of the scandals we have uncovered so far. I cannot list them all during this speech because I have only a limited amount of time. Under the government, we have witnessed the opposite of transparency and accountability. It is nothing short of arrogance for the Liberals to think that Canadians do not deserve to know where their hard-earned dollars are going. When members within the Liberal Party recommend transparency, they are silenced and expelled. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to subscribe to the theory of “Do as I say, not as I do.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638541">The SNC-Lavalin scandal is proof of the lengths to which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his caucus will go in order to be anything but transparent and accountable. Former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott chose to speak out against the government they once served. They warned us about the dangers of government that lacks transparency and accountability. They highlighted that more secrecy in the decision-making process can lead to the misuse of funds and can ultimately undermine public trust.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638542">Here we are yet again, discussing yet another scandal involving a lack of transparency and accountability. The fate of former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and Bill Morneau serve as a powerful reminder that integrity, transparency and accountability have no place within the Liberal government. In 2015, the government promised Canadians a new era of transparency and accountability. In fact, that is the platform on which the Liberals ran. After nine years, there is yet more proof that the NDP-Liberals are not worth the cost or the corruption. The green slush fund scandal stands as a stark reminder of how far they have strayed from their commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638543"> The Speaker has ruled that the NDP-Liberals have violated a House order to turn over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation. The blatant disregard for ethical standards and the rule of law has paralyzed Parliament, making it impossible for anyone to address issues like the doubling of house costs, Liberal food inflation, and crime and chaos. The NDP-Liberals must end the cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police. This is about $400 million of wasted or stolen tax money while Canadians cannot afford to eat, to heat their home and to house themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638544">Imagine a bank where fraud and theft by an employee ran rampant. An employer would not only feel compelled to report the theft and fraud; they would also voluntarily turn over all of the evidence to the police. Money that could have been invested in vital programs, especially for our seniors, has been given to line the pockets of Liberal insiders while Canadians are struggling. This is not just a political issue; this is also a personal issue. The funds that should have provided relief and support have been diverted, leaving many to face the harsh realities of poverty and hunger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638545">The Liberals should take a walk down Rideau Street, next door to Parliament, where the faces of people with mental health struggles and homelessness are all too common. This is the Canada we live in today after nine years of Liberal corruption. The importance of transparency and accountability is about the trust and well-being of every Canadian. We must demand better for ourselves and future generations. Only common-sense Conservatives will end the corruption and get answers for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638546">I was elected by the people of King—Vaughan. It is my responsibility to represent them and all Canadians in the House and bring their voice to Ottawa. As MPs, we have a duty to do what is best for our citizens. If we are given the honour to stand in this place, we should be held to a higher ethical standard. Words like “transparency” and “accountability” should not be thrown around as slogans or catchphrases designed to simply win votes. They should be the mantra all MPs must uphold.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638581">Mr. Speaker, when members of Parliament go back to their ridings on the weekend or during their constituency weeks and when they go to community events, or to their local arena, or to the local community centre or legion, wherever they go, I am sure they get the same comments that I get, no matter what political party. Sometimes we are a little amazed at what people want to talk about. If we are at an arena, seldom do they want to talk about hockey. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about corruption. They ask me who is going to jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638582"> I was at an arena on Saturday and an elderly couple asked me who would go to jail for all of this. They wanted to know what was happening. I think this is at the core of what really upsets the Canadian public, certainly it is in my area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638583"> I think back to years ago, when I worked for a foundry, and how hard the workers worked, grinding castings, pressing castings, working hours in the hot summer days inside the furnace room, slagging furnaces. Workers were working in eight-hour shifts and then working four hours overtime afterward. I can remember sitting at the lunch table in the cafeteria. As they were looking at their paycheques, they were talking about their overtime and how much they had left. Sometime these individuals would go into work at 3 a.m. to work a four-hour overtime shift from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. Then they would work their regular shifts from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The same thing happened for afternoon shifts. When they looked at their paycheques, they had about 52% left over of what they should have made in overtime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638584">These people are working hard every day. They then read in the newspaper or on the Internet, or they see it on the TV at night, while watching the news with their family, about this waste, the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars that, after nine years, have accumulated well into the billions. When they see this, they want to know what is going on. This is not what they want. Nor is it the Canada they were hoping to have. This is when the frustration boils over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638585">I think back to the 2015 election. In a few debates in which I participated, I said that the same people who ran the government in Ontario, Gerald Butts, Katie Telford, and we all know the names, who picked the pockets of the Ontario taxpayers for years, scandal-ridden abuses, were coming to Ottawa to pick the pockets of the Canadian taxpayer now. That is right out of a debate. I am not taking credit for my foresight, but those are the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638586">Why is the culture of that party, the Liberal Party, like this? I know that not all the members are like that, but why is there a culture behind the scenes and in senior leadership? Some of the big hitters cancelled gas plants. That was a billion-dollar debacle. People went to jail for that and ended up being the contributing factor as to why we are so tight on electricity in the province of Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638587"> A lot of people have forgotten the 600 school closures in Ontario during the Wynne-McGuinty years. In my area, I remember going to the reviews, and people were very upset. As it turns out, if they did not close the schools, those schools would be almost full today because of the population growth. I would consider that a big waste. Kids who used to walk to school are now taking buses. There is nothing wrong with a bus, but if they could walk or ride their bikes to school, they would be a lot better off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638588">Let us talk about the doubling of the debt. In those years, the world's economy was pretty good, and the Liberals ran a deficit the entire time. There are higher taxes and fees, like the hiking of the aviation fuel tax, the beer and wine taxes, sin taxes. It sounds familiar. They did that first in Ontario and then they brought it to Ottawa. There are new taxes on small businesses—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638593">The taxes are hiking up the cost of a driver's licence, fishing licence, hunting licence, camping licence, liquor licence, event permit, court application, and the list goes on. The government is not able to manage its own internal interactions, affairs and cost overruns, including red tape. This all happened in Ontario. Now, in Ottawa, after nine years, it is fully embedded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638594"> The government spent $8 billion on e-health. If we ask anybody in Ontario where they would go to locate their e-health record, I do not think there are many citizens who would know where their e-health record is located. The government also spent $2 billion on smart metres. A lot of people in our ridings would remember that. It was then $304 million over budget on the Pan Am Games and there were $400 million in Presto card cost overruns. It goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638595">I will move on to another topic and go back years ago to when an employee who worked in finance where I worked maybe had her hand in the cookie jar. That is pretty much what happened. After an internal investigation, the company discovered that she had misappropriated over $400,000. That was 15 years ago, so it would probably be $3 million in today's dollars, with inflation. The staff of the company did the investigation, I am sure with the assistance of auditors, and turned the documents over to the OPP. The OPP then used those documents to do its investigation. The individual was charged with fraud over $5,000 and was sentenced to an 18-month conditional sentence. Restitution was made, and all the money was recovered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638596">If we look at that small example and ask ourselves what the difference here is, there really is no difference. The government across the way has the ability to produce these documents unredacted and turn them over to the RCMP to let it make a determination. However, it is awfully difficult to do it a page at a time and while having to wait because of delays to receive the documents. It would be much easier and more appropriate to turn all of the documents over and have the RCMP make its evaluation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638597">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278749" Type="2">King—Vaughan</Affiliation> made points in her speech about some of the scandals that have plagued the government for nine plus years now. The members of Parliament who ran in the 2015 election will remember that time. I am sure my Liberal colleagues across the way remember that time. They were very excited about the promises that were made and the hope that was offered in that 2015 election, after which a significant majority government was formed. I am sure those members of Parliament would never have believed in their wildest dreams that this is where we would be today. We have pages of scandals, issues and problems, and there is money that will never be found or repaid. It can all be laid at the hands of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his chief of staff, the cabinet ministers who are here, and those who have left, and who are likely collecting seven-figure salaries now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638598">I think SNC-Lavalin would have to be one of the most egregious cases in the history of Canada with respect to abuse of power. What is most remarkable is this: There was a significant number of key players in that scandal who are still employed, still holding an elected office. It is hard to believe that there has been no housecleaning.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638640">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638641">The last point I want to make is about some of the hypocrisy we see with the Liberal government. It just goes on and on. In this House of Commons, I have listened many times to the Liberals saying we have to do something about fossil fuels, oil, gas, etc. I read an article this morning in The Globe and Mail. It was an update on the results of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which was an overspending debacle of $30 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638642">The point was, who is the king of oil in the House of Commons? It is the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. Canada is now producing five million barrels a day and it is increasing every year under the Liberals. Why is that? Basically, the Liberals need the money to pay for everything else, so they are quite pleased to let the oil come out of the ground. I agree, it should come out of the ground and it should be shipped by pipeline. However, I find it ironic that the Liberals go on at length about fossil fuels, oil, etc., and the environment minister is the king of oil, for now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638643">The broader issue at play here is the government's integrity. The allegations of conflicts of interest within SDTC are particularly troubling because they suggest public funds may have been misused to benefit individuals with close ties to the government. This kind of behaviour undermines public trust in government institutions and erodes confidence in the government's ability to manage public resources in a fair and transparent way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638644">The audit found board members were voting on projects that directly benefited companies with which they had personal affiliations, which is a clear violation of conflict of interest laws. These laws are in place to ensure that public officials do not use their position for personal gain and that government decisions are made in the best interest of the public, not private individuals. When these laws are violated, it casts doubt on the integrity of the entire decision-making process. I am sure many people have heard of some of the carryings-on that went on, through the minutes of those meetings. It is pretty startling, really.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638645">It is important to note for Canadians that this kind of self-enriching goes directly against the Governor in Council appointment process, which states that a person appointed by the government, entrusted to oversee taxpayer money, will not personally profit from their work on a committee as a Governor in Council appointee, and neither will any of their family members. However, this is exactly what happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638646">In a five-year period where 405 transactions were approved by the board, the Auditor General sampled 226, only half of them, and found 186 of those 226 transactions had some sort of a conflict. It is too much. It is egregious. If the Auditor General looked at all 400 transactions, statistically, they would probably find the rest of them were conflicted as well. It is a lot of money and Canadians have a right to know. Parliamentarians have a right to make sure justice is carried out on behalf of all those hard-working people I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638647">Canadians pay their taxes on each and every paycheque. They pay their CPP. They pay their OAS. They trust that the people they mark down on their ballots will do the right thing when they are in Ottawa and that these dollars will be respected. Far too many people in our country have worked so hard, paid so much in taxes and created so much economic activity only to have been disappointed time and time again over the nine years the Liberals have been in office.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638648">To be honest, in the last few years, the NDP has been in on it, too, because it has been propping up the government. There needs to be something done. I am sure some of the members of Parliament on the other side feel the same way. Nobody comes to Ottawa to see what is happening with this scandal: people enriching themselves with millions and millions of dollars. A lot of the projects likely never went anywhere. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638649">Then the people back in our ridings who have contracting, construction and landscaping firms, who are carpenters, electricians, plumbers and health care professionals, go to work each and every day and see this on the news. Hope and excitement in the country are not there as they used to be. People want to be hopeful, but when they see this time and time again, and the list is unbelievable now after nine and a half years, they are truly disappointed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638650">One director was particularly aggressive at this. Andrée-Lise Méthot was appointed in 2016 by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. She runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital. Her companies, before and during her time on the board, apparently received $250 million in grants, and $114 million went to green companies she had invested in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638651">I think it is safe to say, when we look at these programs, whether it is Cycle Capital or others, no company needs that much money from the federal government. Really, no company needs that much money. From a government standpoint, the dollars are there to deliver government services, not to enrich insiders who create little value. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638687">To brief members, as soon as allegations were brought forward, an investigation was done immediately. Plans were made to fold Sustainable Development Technology Canada into the NRC, and it will abide by very stringent regulations going forward. The former board was dismissed, and we now have a new interim board of three members, only in place for one year to facilitate the transition to the NRC. That work is going very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638688">There were 12 recommendations made to address the concerns that have been identified. I am happy to say that already 11 of them have been addressed. The 12th one is under way and should be completed by the end of December this year. That recommendation has to do with reviewing all the various awards of funds that were made to make sure those awards were valid, that nothing untoward was done and that the businesses that applied were entitled to those funds. That is a very important feature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638689"> I want to emphasize that none of the businesses were found to be at fault. It was the director who had a conflict of interest, which is not a reflection on the businesses that applied in good faith. We want to return to funding these very important green, sustainable businesses because they are start-ups that depend on this money. They would not be able to function and carry on without it. That is a very important thing to bear in mind as we are discussing this. We must not lose sight of the key factor that this was a very important funding program that did a lot of exceptionally good work. I worry that sometimes we lose sight of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638690"> Just to get this on the record, since its creation in 2001, SDTC has invested more than $1.71 billion in over 500 companies that have generated $3.1 billion in annual revenue, created 24,500 jobs, commercialized 224 new technologies and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 megatonnes of CO2 annually. SDTC's impact is equivalent to taking almost seven million cars off the road every year, and SDTC-funded companies have received global recognition and are consistently listed on the annual global clean-tech 100 list, where Canada punches well above its weight. Despite all the clouds that have been generated by the AG's report, which was very complete and very well done, we must not lose sight of why the fund was created and all the good work that it has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638691">Turning to the privilege motion, which has held up the work of several committees and the House, it is about releasing documents and the problems that are occurring. I want to let the House know that many of the documents requested, a great number, have already been provided. The problem is not about the government making the documents available. It is that we do not want to make them available to third parties like the police because that is an abuse of people's charter rights. We must protect people's charter rights at all costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638692"> On the record, the AG has stated that if the documents collected in the course of her investigation were released, made public or given to the police, going forward, people may be very reticent to speak to the AG and co-operate with her investigations because of what could happen down the line. They may not have confidence that the information would not be abused and inappropriately shared.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638693">I want to share some concerns. Our committee received from the RCMP commissioner a letter saying that the RCMP does not want to receive the documents from the government because it would not be able to use them. The police are investigating. If the police, in their investigations, feel they need access to documents and information, they have the legal means to get them through the court process. The police can use warrants. If they obtain the documents through legal justice provisions, they can use them in court. Anything they obtain from us would not be usable because they are under the governance of the justice system, which is separate from the parliamentary system. It needs to be that way, and that is what we are fighting to protect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638694">I want to read some information into the record. Former law clerk Rob Walsh commented on the June 10 House order ordering the production of papers related to SDTC to be sent to the Speaker and then given to the RCMP. He stated, “[in my humble opinion], it is an abuse of its powers for the House to use it's power to demand and get documents from the Government in order to transfer them to a third party (RCMP) that wouldn't otherwise receive them or to compel the Government to give documents to the third party.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638695">Mr. Walsh further stated that the government must give Parliament the documents it demands, but “not for the purposes of making them available to a third party such as the RCMP.” Mr. Walsh also stated that the House's privileged power to demand the production of documents from anyone is for the purposes of its own proceedings where the legal rights of the affected individuals would be protected by parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638696">Another former senior parliamentary counsel to the House of Commons, Mr. Steven Chaplin, was interviewed over the summer and stated that the June 10 order was both “completely unprecedented” and a likely abuse of parliamentary powers. He said that the House of Commons was simply acting as a “mailbox” for the police force, which is not one of its duties. He also stated, “It is not a parliamentary or constitutional function of Parliament to help the police.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638697">In the same vein, former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas commented, “we all know that the rule of law is predicated upon a separation between what [Parliament is] doing and the law enforcement agencies, in this case the RCMP.” Separation between Parliament and the police force is critical. He also stated that he believed the House had overstepped, and that this raises a number of constitutional issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638698">Mr. Bourduas also said, “there needs to be this separation, this segregation, between Parliament and the gathering of documents and what the RCMP can do because it could jeopardize any future prosecution if the perception, not the reality, the perception, that the RCMP tried to circumvent proper procedures, criminal procedures, could jeopardize any future cases before the court.” He reiterated later, “it's crucial for the RCMP...not only to maintain the separation, but also to maintain the perception of the separation for the general public and for the greater good of our justice system.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638699">Mr. Bourduas went on to say, “the RCMP would try to avoid [creating charter concerns] at all costs, and this happened before where the RCMP was accused of trying to circumvent legal process, obtaining search warrants by gathering documents that were not legally obtained”. This would severely impact its ability to conduct an investigation that could produce legal consequences if it got to that stage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638700">A Conservative member, who I believe represents <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation>, knows that the RCMP does not need help with getting documents. Just recently, he said that what happens if we cannot get a document is we go to court and ask for search warrants or production orders. That is how it is done. The RCMP has its own means to do it, and if it obtains the documents in that fashion, it can use them to prosecute the case. Using its processes for purposes that were never intended and that are not connected to a parliamentary proceeding is the concern.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638701">The RCMP commissioner himself has stated his consternation about the documents sent his way and there is significant risk that the motion could be interpreted as a circumvention of normal investigative processes and charter protections. Canadians value their charter rights; they are enshrined in our Constitution. We need to assure Canadians that parliamentarians will not use parliamentary privilege to ever abuse those charter rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638702">We need to support the AG so that she can conduct her work in an objective fashion, and people who co-operate with her know that they are protected as well, and that any information they divulge will not be used against them and forwarded to the police in a future investigation. That is very critical. We have the documents; we did produce them and more are still coming in from the various agencies requested, but we cannot pass them on to third parties, particularly our national police force. That would be an abuse of the rights of Canadians, and that is not how the information was given originally. It was divulged with the knowledge that people's charter rights would be protected and the information would not be used against them down the line.</ParaText>

In fact, I made my name on Liberal scandals, because there are so many of them, going all the way back to the rum bottle politics on the Rideau. We could count Liberal scandals. This, to me, is something different. There is a finding of the government refusing to turn over documents. This is now to be sent to committee, which is the process that should take place. There may be a very important finding but what we are dealing with here is the complete obstruction of Parliament by Conservatives who do not want the work of the nation to take place. This is, I find, concerning.</ParaText>

That was much more serious, because it spoke to the very heart of our nation. There were allegations of horrific torture that brought down the reputation of Canadian soldiers who were on the front lines in Kandahar. When Harper refused to turn over documents and listen to the will of Parliament, he was actually found in contempt of Parliament; he was the only prime minister found in contempt of Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638739"> Madam Speaker, in reviewing the history, Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a one billion dollar fund that was supported by multiple governments and ran smoothly, in fact, without incident until 2017. It was designed with the noble cause of helping green technology start-ups get off the ground, with some government support in order to accelerate action on climate and the environment. Then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed a new Liberal board chair to the SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638740"> However, after the Conservatives put forward a motion asking for the Auditor General to conduct audits into the SDTC, she found that the fund had approved projects for funding that were ineligible for taxpayer funds. She further found that SDTC executives violated at least $400 million of taxpayer funds. Eighty per cent of the cases the Auditor General looked at had conflicts of interest. She also found that the green slush fund had frequently overstated the environmental benefit of the projects they funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638741">We know that the Auditor General's findings were just the tip of the iceberg. She did not conduct an exhaustive audit. She just looked at a sample of cases and investigated them. This sample revealed such conflicts of interest that are a part of this privilege motion today, yet 80% of those cases were found in violation of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638742"> We also know that some of those at the centre of the scandal, the Liberal-appointed board members who benefited from these contracts, managed to jump ship and secure other government-appointed positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638743"> One of the green slush fund directors, Andrée-Lise Méthot, actually admitted to several conflicts of interest with funds that went to companies in which she had a financial interest. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, prior to joining cabinet, served as a strategic adviser for a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital from 2009 to 2018. This is the same firm that Ms. Méthot founded and was the managing partner of, the same firm that received a significant amount of SDTC funding while she sat on the board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638744"> As this scandal was coming out, she was then coincidentally appointed to the board of the $35 billion Canada Infrastructure Bank. This is the same bank where Liberal-friendly McKinsey consultants have been deeply involved. She went from one plum board appointment to another, even after finding that she had engaged in conflicts of interest by enriching companies in which she had an interest while she sat on the board. She has since resigned, but yet Ms. Méthot is implicated in mishandling $42 million of taxpayer funds by awarding contracts to companies in which she had financial interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638745">At the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, the Conservatives are, right now, trying to get to the bottom of this scandal. We have put forward a motion to investigate this issue. It is completely unacceptable that those who repeatedly violate conflict of interest policies should be promoted to plum government positions because they have connections with Liberal insiders. How is it that the government thought it was perfectly fine to appoint her to the Canada Infrastructure Bank after she was found to have violated conflict of interest laws to enrich her own company?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638746">In light of all these egregious refusals to honour the authority of Parliament and to act in a way that is befitting of the Canadian democracy, the Conservatives have been forced to put forward a motion in the House to demand that the government get to the bottom of the green slush fund scandal by handing over all the files, communications and financial records to Parliament. Parliament would then hand over all documents to the RCMP for further investigation. However, after that motion passed, the 30-day deadline came and went without action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638747">What did we find? Some departments partially complied and some blatantly disobeyed the order. The government failed to hand over the documents and fell into contempt of this Parliament. The Speaker of the House ruled on this matter and stated, “In some instances, only partial disclosures were made, owing either to redactions or the withholding of documents. In other instances, the House order was met with a complete refusal.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638748"> The Department of Justice alone withheld 10,000 pages from Parliament. The Speaker of the House decided the matter of privilege, ruling that the Liberals violated the will of Parliament to turn over the evidence so that the RCMP could conduct the criminal investigation. Since then, the RCMP has confirmed that it is indeed investigating this scandal and that it is ongoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638749">This is not a trivial political matter. This is not a trivial matter that has seized the House. The RCMP is not investigating because the Conservative opposition has directed it to do so. It is, in fact, an independent agency. It is investigating because there are reasonable grounds upon which to base an investigation into offences committed under the Criminal Code. Once it investigates, it will decide what to do with the documents in question and whether to prosecute. That is in its sole discretion. It has full power to conduct its investigation within the bounds of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638750">Parliament has supremacy in our constitutional democracy. It has supremacy above the government. It has supremacy above the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The House of Commons is the representation of the people of Canada and, as such, has powers that are absolute and within the authority as afforded by our Constitution, yet what we see here is an open contempt of authority. The government has demonstrated a complete lack of respect for the powers of Parliament to order the production of documents, which is key to the role of the House to act as a check and balance on the executive branch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638751">For months the government has flouted the authority of Parliament by refusing to comply with the will of Parliament in this matter. If we allow this to continue, when will this attack on Parliament's authority end?

              <ParaText id="8638753"> The question is, what does the Liberal government have to hide? Why is it so desperate to keep these documents hidden from Canadians? How deep does this corruption go? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638754">We know that the Liberal government has been so embarrassed by the revelations of mismanagement of the green slush fund that it decided to outright abolish it, or at least transfer it to another government agency. However, none of this absolves the SDTC. Nor does it absolve the government from its responsibility to Canadians. It must provide Parliament and the RCMP with answers as to what it knew, when it knew it, how this happened and how deep this corruption goes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638755">This paralysis of Parliament could be over today if the Liberals displayed the moral courage to comply with the order of the House by turning over the documents for the RCMP to investigate. However, they do not want to and we all know why. These files would certainly reveal the depth of corruption with respect to the green slush fund over the past nine years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638756"> We have seen this movie before. In 2019, when it was revealed that scientists working in Canada's highest security lab were collaborating clandestinely with the People's Republic of China, it took 10 months for those scientists to be fired. When the House first asked for the documents to be released, the Liberals refused. They even took the former Speaker to court in order to cover up their failure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638757">Are we going to allow the tired government to continue to flout the authority of Parliament as it betrays the trust of Canadians with its endless scandals and reckless management of our economy? Let us not forget that the NDP has been complicit in these scandals by propping up the government with its coalition deal. It is clear that both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the NDP have been desperately clinging to power. Only the Conservatives are committed to getting to the bottom of these scandals.</ParaText>

The truth is that our democracy and our shared Canadian dream is at risk. We have seen a sharp decline in the state of our nation over the last nine years. For one, Canadians are poorer than they were nine years ago. Since 2016, the cost of an average home in my constituency of Haldimand—Norfolk has increased by over 150%. Families now need a household income of $208,000 to own a home. Between 2023 and 2024, the average cost of a one-bedroom rental unit increased by 35%, from $892 to $1,190 per month. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638760">The motion before us is about the $400-million siphon to Liberal friends; perhaps the money was even stolen.

We do not want another committee established. It is House business, and this is where the matter must be debated. It always seems to be the same thing with the current NDP-Liberal government: Who can get away with what at this time?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638784">Upon researching SDTC, I found it interesting to see its initial purpose. It was a vital initiative launched by the Canadian government to foster the development of clean technologies. Its primary goal was to help innovators address some of the most pressing environmental challenges, while driving economic growth. At its core, SDTC provided funding and other resources to projects that focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and water quality and promoting sustainable resource use. The support was critical for early-stage projects, particularly those that might struggle to secure private investment due to inherent risks of pioneering new technologies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638785"> One of the most defining features of the SDTC was the broad scope of sectors it covered. From energy to the agriculture and transportation sectors, the organization played a key role in helping innovators across industries. In the energy sector, for instance, it supported clean-energy solutions such as renewable power, energy storage and advancements in energy efficiency. In the agriculture sector, SDTC backed projects that focused on sustainable farming practices, reducing emissions from food production and conserving water resources. In the transportation sector, SDTC helped drive innovations aimed at reducing the carbon footprint on public transportation and at promoting electric mobility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638786"> Beyond just financial support, SDTC fostered a collaborative ecosystem. It connected industry players with academia, researchers and government agencies, and it encouraged partnerships that accelerate the development of these technologies. By bringing together diverse stakeholders, SDTC not only helped ideas become a reality but also ensured that clean technologies reached the market faster and more effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638787"> Sustainable Development Technology Canada was essentially turned into a slush fund by Liberal insiders. The Auditor General of Canada uncovered that $400 million in taxpayer funds was misused. Nine board members are linked to 186 conflicts of interest. The situation has escalated due to the refusal of the Liberal government to comply with a parliamentary order demanding the release of documents related to the scandal. This has resulted in a halt to parliamentary business for two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638788">SDTC was originally established in 2001 to fund green-technology initiatives. Instead it became an open channel for insiders' dealings by the Liberal government. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed numerous board members implicated in the scandal. The Auditor General's findings uncovered numerous serious issues of misappropriation of funds and conflicts of interest. Despite the Auditor General's findings, the government has refused to release documentation requested in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638789">The reluctance of the Liberal government to share the documents raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability. This has created a very clear picture of a deep web of political insiders. The refusal to release the documents is a scathing misuse of public funds. The House must respect the seriousness of the situation. The House and the taxpayers of Canada need to know what is in the documents, and a refusal to release the documents does not respond to the seriousness of the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638790"> The concerns we have raised highlighted a deep dissatisfaction within the current NDP-Liberal government, particularly regarding the recent scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada and the alleged misappropriation of the $400 million in taxpayer funds. That is taxpayers' money. Taxpayers are the people who are providing money for Canada, and the government is spending it without any accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638791"> The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling indicating that the government violated a House order by refusing to turn over evidence to the police only adds to the perception of a cover-up, especially when the Auditor General's findings revealed 186 conflicts of interest involving Liberal appointees directing funds to their own companies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638792"> The situation is exacerbated by the real economic struggles Canadians are facing. There are rising housing costs, food inflation and increasing crime rates, which many feel the government is failing to adequately address. The argument that the NDP-Liberal coalition has paralyzed Parliament by focusing on damage control instead of solving these pressing issues resonates with those who believe that government corruption is not just a political issue but one that directly affects the ability of Canadians to meet basic needs, such as the need for food, housing and energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638793">Government is being called to stop the cover-up and provide the necessary documents for a criminal investigation. This would be a step toward restoring integrity and allowing Parliament to refocus on the real problems the country is facing. For critics, the solution lies in a change of leadership, with the common-sense Conservatives being presented as a party that will end corruption, deliver answers and focus on reducing costs for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638794">In terms of the misallocation of funds, $58 million was allocated to 10 projects that did not meet the eligibility criteria; this goes against the fund's intended purpose. These funds were disbursed without contribution agreements, indicating a lack of oversight and due diligence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638795">The Auditor General found that $334 million was given to projects in which board members had conflicts of interest. Specifically, 186 conflicts of interest were identified among nine board members, including cases where the individuals approved projects that financially benefited them. In other words, they were approving money that was going to their own companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638796">In the board transactions audit, the Auditor General reviewed 226 out of 405 transactions approved by the board over a five-year period and found that 82% of them involved conflicts of interest. We can imagine what would be found if they reviewed all 405.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638797">This indicates a systematic ethical lapse within the governance of the fund. One striking example of conflict of interest involves a board member who runs a venture capital firm, Cycle Capital. Her firm reportedly received significant government grants, up to $250 million, while she was on the board. Even while serving on the board, there was $114 million of funding approved for companies she previously invested in, which directly benefited her firm. This apparent self-enrichment highlights the gravity of the governance failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638798">In terms of the failure of oversight by government, the Auditor General attributes a large part of this scandal to the Liberal government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> for insufficiently monitoring the contracts and ensuring that proper checks and balances were in place. Despite managing nearly a billion dollars in public funds, the Liberal government seemed lax in its oversight, contributing to the lack of accountability and fiscal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638799">The above is clearly a serious lapse in both ethical standards and financial oversight. How can we possibly be confident of the management of taxpayers' dollars when we have a lapse in judgment? If there is no accountability, where is the money going? If it is not our money, and it is taxpayers' money, where is the confidence from the people who elected us to be here? Every person in the House, I am sure, is elected to represent not only their constituents but also people in Canada or abroad who are Canadians. If we do not have any accountability in terms of the money they provide us, then where is confidence within our government? Canadians' tax dollars are missing here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638800">Political connections and insider connections cannot be seen as a pathway to financial gain. Parliament's role is to hold government to account, and the Liberal government is protecting those involved at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer. How can we possibly allow this critical matter to go unresolved? Taxpayer dollars have been wasted. Without exception, Conservatives will hold the Liberals to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638801">The hardships described are painting a stark picture of the economic challenges many Canadians are facing today, with food insecurity being one of the most pressing concerns. According to recent reports, food prices have indeed soared, with families expected to pay $700 more for groceries this year compared with 2023.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638802"> The increased reliance on food banks, with a 50% spike in visits since 2021, just underscores the scale of the struggle for many Canadians to meet their basic needs, yet here we are today with $400 million that is unaccounted for. The government has been ordered by the Speaker to produce documents as to where the money went, and we are still arguing about that. There are people going to the food bank wondering why we are doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638803">StatsCan reported on food insecurity, showing a jump from 11.6% in 2018 to 15.6% in 2022. This just illustrates a growing financial strain under the current NDP-Liberal government. The surge in food insecurity, exacerbated by inflation and policies such as carbon tax, is leading to further economic stress. Food Banks Canada’s 2024 poverty report card indicates that nearly half of Canadians feel worse off financially compared with last year, with one in four experiencing food insecurity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638804"> Critics of the government point to its inflationary policies, such as increased spending and the carbon tax, as contributing factors. The carbon tax in particular has been criticized for raising costs throughout the supply chain, going from farmers, ranchers and truckers to consumers. This has made food and other essentials more expensive for families. This burden is compounded by inflation. It is seen by many as a direct result of the government's approach. Economists have highlighted the significant cost burden the carbon tax imposes on the food industry, further validating concerns that these policies are driving up costs for ordinary Canadians. The Conservative position focuses on reversing these policies, specifically by axing the carbon tax, fixing the budget and implementing measures to bring down costs for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638805"> In a letter tabled in Parliament on October 21, the House of Commons law clerk told MPs that he recently received new documents from three government departments relating to Sustainable Development Technology Canada. In all three cases, information was withheld. Testifying to MPs at the public accounts committee on Monday, the law clerk said that three departments are still failing to comply with an order by the House of Commons. According to one article, the law clerk “wrote to [the Speaker] about Finance Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development and the Treasury Board Secretariat” that “[a]ll three government institutions provided documents containing redactions and/or withheld some pages purportedly relying on the Access to Information Act”. He also testified that “only eight government organizations had forked over all their unredacted records on SDTC. The vast majority of others (22) had either withheld documents or redacted them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638806">He went on to say, “We're talking about documents, sometimes hundreds of pages, that have been withheld, and redactions that are not only about personal information, but also solicitor-client privilege or other motives under the Access to Information Act”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638807">The scrutiny and accusations surrounding SDTC, particularly when it comes to allegations of conflicts of interest, are significant. The claims that Liberal appointees funnelled $400 million to start-ups with ties to senior SDTC management and that 82% of the reviewed projects had conflicts of interest raise serious concerns about governance and transparency. Conservatives' concerns about the mismanagement of $400 million in taxpayer money through Sustainable Development Technology Canada resonate with many Canadians, especially in light of their current economic struggles. With inflation rising, rising costs and many people living from paycheque to paycheque, the perception that public funds are being misused or awarded to connected insiders can be deeply frustrating for citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638808">Many Canadians see the government's handling of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada issue as emblematic of larger problems. The refusal to turn over documents related to the green slush fund has fuelled accusations of a government trying to hide potential corruption and conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638809"> The lack of transparency shows contempt for Parliament and, by extension, for the public, the taxpayers supporting the government. The claim that Parliament has been paralyzed because of the government's refusal to co-operate adds to the urgency. At a time when Canadians are facing crises in housing, food security and public safety, the perception that government is prioritizing a cover-up over helping citizens exacerbates frustration. With the cost of living skyrocketing, crime rising and affordable housing in short supply, many Canadians are looking for leadership that is focused on addressing these immediate concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638810">The demand for the government to finally turn over the documents is about more than just the scandal: It is about restoring trust and allowing Parliament to get back to addressing the critical challenges that everyday Canadians are facing. The lack of action is seen as preventing the government from making meaningful progress on issues that directly affect the quality of life for millions. It is deeply concerning when public trust in government institutions is undermined by allegations of mismanagement and self-dealing, as appears to be the case with the green slush fund. The fact that we are discussing this issue speaks to a broader problem with accountability and transparency, things that should be fundamental in any democratic government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638811">The Auditor General's findings that the Liberal government allegedly turned SDTC into a slush fund for insiders and that nearly $400 million in contracts were inappropriately awarded only fuel the frustration felt by many Canadians. When a government initiative designed to foster sustainability and clean technology becomes embroiled in allegations of corruption, it raises serious questions about the governance and integrity of those responsible for overseeing public funds. The troubling part is that such a situation should not require the lengthy debates of a prolonged effort to bring the truth to light. Ensuring that public funds are managed transparently and ethically is a basic expectation, and the need to debate such a clear-cut issue reflects how far things have gone astray.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638812">Citizens rely on the government to act in the public's interest, particularly when it comes to something as critical as environmental and economic sustainability. For the government to restore any sense of trust, not only does it need to release the documents that detail these conflicts of interest, but it also needs to take decisive actions to rectify the situation and prevent it from happening again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638813">Earlier this year, through her report on the SDTC, the Auditor General revealed the shocking truth of the extent of Liberal corruption. This showed that the Liberal government had turned the organization into a slush fund. for organizations connected to Liberal insiders. In total, contracts worth $123 million were found to have been given inappropriately, and $76 million was given to projects where there was a connection with Liberal friends appointed to the roles within SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638814">At this point, keeping the current government accountable seems to be an unattainable task or a bad joke. We have Canadians living in their cars because of unaffordability, food bank attendance at record highs and kids living at home because they cannot buy a house. Nevertheless, the Liberal government is playing games with how much money it can distribute without getting caught. Continued delays will only further erode public confidence. Pressing issues such as affordability, crime and housing need to be addressed. In the end, all we are asking for is transparency and accountability. The government should present the requested documents to this chamber immediately and answer to the taxpayers of Canada. With $400 million spent and 186 ethical violations, it is time to present the documents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638824"> However, I am very concerned by the recent revelations we are learning from CSIS and other investigations into foreign interference in his party, with key people who supported as leader the man who is now in Stornoway, and by the unwillingness of the Conservatives to name names.

The Brown campaign, which was taken out by the guy who lives in Stornoway, said, “we knew that local pro-Modi organizations alongside Indian government actors were mobilizing against the Brown campaign as they were concerned with the strong support we had from both the Sikh and Muslim communities.” We know that in the 48 hours before the member for Stornoway won, 70,000 online memberships were sold, which raises questions about how that happened so quickly.

              <ParaText id="8638866">As I was saying, Mr. Speaker, Saturday marked my ninth year as a member of Parliament, which is bittersweet because the Conservatives lost the government that year. What is interesting is that Sustainable Development Technology Canada was a pretty good organization. It was started in 2001. It did a lot of good work in energy, agriculture, transportation and cutting greenhouse emissions. Jim Balsillie was once the chair of SDTC. It was run pretty well until the Liberals took over and filled the board with their cronies. In 2017, all of a sudden, Sustainable Development Technology Canada changed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638867">As I mark my ninth anniversary, I look at the scandals of the government. Almost immediately, that Christmas, we had the Aga Khan, with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> taking that paid vacation. Later, there was SNC-Lavalin, one of the biggest controversies we have had in the last nine years in the House. There was the Winnipeg lab; the WE Charity, which cost the former finance minister his job; and the arrive scam, when $60 million was paid for an app that should have cost maybe $80,000 to produce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638868">Now we have another one, the green slush fund. In nine years, we cannot count how many scandals the Liberal government has been involved in. We are on day 12 of this debate. The Liberals, of course, are refusing to obey an order of the House, which would permit the distribution of the documents regarding a $400-million scandal. Canadians have seen countless scandals in the last nine years, and I have mentioned a number of them already. However, this one reaches new heights that we have never seen in the House of Commons. The Liberals have gone to tremendous lengths to make sure the public, the RCMP and even the House do not obtain access to these documents that would expose the injustice done at SDTC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638869">Sustainable Development Technology Canada turned into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. The program was made to give away taxpayer dollars to green technology initiatives, some even in my province of Saskatchewan. It is important to note that the government was directly in charge of appointing the board members of this fund. This means the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have personally appointed some of those board members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638870">What happened to those Liberal insiders who directed funds meant for green technology toward, unfortunately, their own companies, totalling $400 million and 186 conflicts of interest? Those were 186 incidents where money from taxpayers, like us, could have gone to help many families in this country, a good portion of whom, in fact, are dealing with the cost of living. We could have helped small businesses in this country stay afloat. Instead, the money was funnelled to companies with ties to senior Liberal officials. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638871">Furthermore, the Auditor General found that, on top of those staggering numbers, $58 million was given to companies that were not eligible for the fund. There were 10 ineligible projects, and I have them right here, totalling $58,784,613. That means not only that taxpayer money was given to people who should not have received a single nickel, but that $58 million plus was given to those who should never have been considered for the fund. It is ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638872">The current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Canada is where so many are now forced to line up at food banks, including in my city, with over 20,000 a month in a city and a province that feeds the world. What has happened in this country in the last nine years is disgusting. Let us think about that. I met with SARM, the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, this morning. My province feeds the world, yet when we look at Saskatchewan these nine years out, from 2015 to 2024, there are lineups in every community for food because of the cost of living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638873">We wonder about the contracts that were given out to Liberal insiders. It is important to note some of those 186 conflicts of interest just to give Canadians an idea of the Liberal corruption we are seeing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638874">There was a board member appointed to the green slush fund way back in 2016. Interestingly, that was a year after the election. The board member runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital. Her company received a total of $250 million from the green slush fund. Some of that came before she was even a member, but $118 million came to companies that she had invested in while she was on the board. The value of her company, amazingly, tripled when she was there. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> was a strategic adviser for Cycle Capital from 2009 right up to 2018 before joining the cabinet. In fact, he also owned shares in that company, which is interesting since the company got so much money from the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638875">The green slush fund director Stephen Kukucha previously worked for a Liberal environment minister and as an organizer for the Liberal Party on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in B.C. That is how someone gets a job on the board of the green slush fund. Unsurprisingly, companies in which he had financial interests received $5 million from the fund. Even worse, when questioned in a committee hearing, he downplayed the issue by stating that it was just a small amount of money, no big deal at all. It was $5 million, but it was no big deal to the Liberal insiders. That is the attitude of the government and of the board of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638876">A lot of us have been on boards. We have taken governance training. I was part of Johnson Shoyama, a group out of Regina. I cannot believe they were not scolded long before this. These are board members who, when they were put onto a board, went through governance training. They should not be in the room at all when there are votes on certain issues dealing with companies they are associated with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638877">Why are we surprised? The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> stood in the House and said the budget would not exceed $40 billion this year. We are into mid-October and we are at $47 billion. Nothing surprises us. We are already 17% over budget in the middle of October. Liberals know how to spend. They know how to spend to keep their friends happy. This is ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638878">I think Sustainable Development Technology Canada, 20 years ago, was put in place when we needed it. It was for innovation. I look at my province of Saskatchewan with regard to agriculture. Saskatchewan companies are the most innovative in the world when it comes to agriculture, and the SDTC fund certainly helped them. They continue to be among the best in the world. They do not need government money to be innovative. Our companies are doing it on their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638879">Insider favouritism, at the expense of taxpayers, has become all too common with the Liberal government. One thing is for sure: It really pays to be a Liberal insider. We have seen it with all the violations: the WE Charity, the arrive scam and SNC-Lavalin, along with SDTC. However, this is $400 million. This is not a chunk of change. This is $400 million of taxpayers' money. What could we do with that? We could do a lot in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638880">It is only fair to assume the Liberals do not want to comply with the will of the House in order to cover up this scandal. The Speaker has ruled that this failure to adhere to the will of Parliament constitutes a breach of privilege, which is why all business in the House has been stalled now for 12 days. Canadians from coast to coast to coast have a right to know what is inside the documents and what the Liberals are trying to hide.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638881">Conservatives want to see the documents released not only to give Canadians answers, but also because the RCMP has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe an offence under the Criminal Code may have been committed. The people of Saskatoon—Grasswood who send their hard-earned tax dollars here want to know where that money went. They want to know where the $400 million is. We have 10 ineligible projects, totalling $58 million. There were 90 cases where conflict of interest policies were not followed; that was $75 million. All totalled here, it is $390 million.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638898">I know my colleagues on the other side of the House like to think this is just incompetence on the government's part and has nothing to do with them. Let me remind them that the government is supposed to be accountable, and every one of the ministers is supposed to be accountable for their departments. Let me make them aware that taxpayers in this country are watching the people involved and making sure taxpayer money is spent correctly without corruption.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638899">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation</Affiliation>, who the Auditor General said was at fault, is clearly not being accountable for his actions in this case. If these actions are criminal, like the RCMP has indicated they could be, would this not be a cover-up of criminality? The whole scandal could end if the Liberals simply hand over the unredacted documents today. If the RCMP finds nothing of value in the documents, then so be it. Then we move on to Randy versus Randy. That is another one that we are going to be talking about in the House very shortly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638900"> Over a span of five years, the board approved 405 transactions. Out of those, the auditor found 186 conflicts of interest, which equals about 82%. That means that in 82% of the examined transactions, individuals gained from their own decisions to sign over the money. This lack of oversight, as highlighted by the Auditor General, has allowed for more conflicts of interest to persist without even being addressed, ultimately contributing to a very serious ethical lapse within the government's handling of these transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638901">Canadians have a right to know where $390 million has gone. They pay their hard-earned taxes, each and every one of them, and it is deplorable how the government has wasted that $390 million. Not one of the Liberals has stood up in the House in the last 12 days to talk about government waste, and this is a form of a violation. We need to have those documents sent to the RCMP, unredacted. It needs to see them, and we can move on to another corruption that I think the House will deal with, and that is Randy versus Randy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8638928">What made me think about it was the response in debate last night made by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278222" Type="2">Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner</Affiliation>. He was asked about delivering documents to the RCMP. He is a retired police officer, and what he said was that the government is not acting like the victim of a crime.

He said that the Liberals were behaving the way the perpetrator of a crime would behave: not co-operating, deflecting, stonewalling and trying to avoid at all costs providing important evidence to the police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638929">Conservatives say, “Stop the crime”, and it is sad that people now need to be wary of their own government's participation in the crime. It is time to call the cops. Where is ministerial responsibility in all of this? Why is the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> not insisting on documents being delivered to the RCMP? I know my colleagues will say that the RCMP has said it does not want the documents, that it is a breach of charter rights and a violation of people's privacy, and that it is not the place of the official elected body, the House of Commons, to provide evidence to the police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638930">However, I have a letter to the chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, dated October 9. It is from the commissioner of the RCMP, Mike Duheme. He writes, “I wish to inform you that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into SDTC is ongoing.” He goes on to say that the RCMP has received documents from the law clerk and parliamentary counsel that were produced pursuant to a June 10 order of the House of Commons. The RCMP is obviously okay with receiving documents from the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638931">The argument the Liberals are making, the fallacious argument they are standing behind, which is that this is somehow a breach of charter rights and that the RCMP does not want any documents from us, is just not true. It begs the question of why they are not delivering these documents. I am going to get to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638932">For people watching, I want to go back a bit and explain what happened. The House voted for the evidence to be produced, and various departments and agencies of government have refused to comply. The Speaker correctly ruled that the House order had not been complied with and that this was a matter of privilege. Liberals are how saying that the Auditor General's report is not sufficient. They want to turn this over to committee to study it even more. Most people who are the victim of a crime, and who are asked whether to call a committee or the police, do not say to call a committee. They say to call the police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638933">Most people would say that the Auditor General's report alone is reason enough to call the police. Another committee report would not do anything but further delay the process, again stonewalling the ability of the House to hold the government accountable. To those watching the proceedings today, if someone steals from them, do they call a committee or do they call the police? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638934">There are so many problems with SDTC that need to be highlighted. I am going to go through some of the horrible details that have fanned the flame of this scandal. From March 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, Sustainable Development Technology Canada's board approved 226 start-up, scale-up and ecosystem projects to receive $836 million. Eight start-up and scale-up projects totalling $51 million did not meet eligibility criteria. For example, some projects did not support the demonstration of a new technology or the projected environmental benefits were unreasonable. Two ecosystem projects totalling $8 million were ineligible because they did not fund or support the development or demonstration of a new technology.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8638935">The board of SDTC approved $20 million for seed projects without completing the screening and assessments required by the contribution agreements with the government. There were 123 million dollars' worth of contracts that were found to have been given inappropriately. This is from the Auditor General. There was $59 million that was given to projects that never should have been awarded any money at all, and 82% of these contracts were found to have been part of a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638936">On top of this, the Auditor General found that over $330 million in taxpayers' money was paid out in over 180 cases where there was a potential conflict of interest with Liberal-appointed directors. This is the important part and what this is all about: Liberal appointed directors were funnelling money to companies that they owned. Let me say that again. Liberal appointed directors were funnelling money, taxpayers' money, to companies that they owned. In other words, they were funnelling money to themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638937">What do we do when somebody illegally funnels taxpayer dollars to themselves? What do we do? We call the police, but again, we do not have ministerial accountability. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is nowhere. He will stand up to say that they shut it down, but of course they shut it down. They had no choice but to because the Auditor General had caught them red-handed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638938">What is next? Why are they not co-operating with the police? That is really the big question, and the answer has to be that there has got to be some really bad stuff in these documents that the Liberals do not want to come out. I can understand why the Liberals do not want it to come out. They are hanging on by a thread. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638939">There are several members I am looking at across the aisle here who have signed a letter saying that they want the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to step down.

              <ParaText id="8638940">However, for some reason, these members have come into the House today to say that the they are trying to circumvent charter rights and the privacy of Canadians and that, when money is stolen, we do not call the police, we call a committee. That is what these members are trying to have us believe, and it is just total nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638941">It is obfuscation, and I feel sometimes that some of these members are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. They do not know what to do.

They are protecting the Prime Minister one day, and then they are criticizing the him the next. They do not know what to do. They are completely lost. They are completely falling apart, and Canadians see it for what it is. The Liberal government is a tired, out of steam, corrupt government that really needs to call it a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638942">There are other things that happened at SDTC. It was not even in compliance with the basic requirement to have 15 members who were separate from its board of directors to represent Canadians and appoint most of its board. Instead, they only had two. As a direct result of this, Canada's Ethics Commissioner ruled in July that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked chair of the Liberals' $51-billion green slush fund broke the law. The Liberal government was aware of the chair's conflicts but decided to appoint her to the position anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638943">Of all this, the Auditor General said, “Like all organizations funded by Canadian taxpayers, [SDTC] has a responsibility to conduct its business in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and compliant with legislation.” This sordid affair leaves serious concerns about the government's ability to account for public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638944"> I ask the question of how we can account for public funds. We are the official opposition. It is our job to hold the government to account, but its members do not want to be held to account. All they have to do is release these documents to the RCMP. As I said earlier, the commissioner said, “We have received documents from the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel”.</ParaText>

I am still trying to get my head around this. As stunning as these revelations are by the Auditor General, we should not be surprised because the government has no problem with ethical lapses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8638946">My short time today does not allow me to go through every scandal of the Liberal government.

That company had been charged under the Criminal Code and was actively lobbying the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for something called a deferred prosecution agreement. The problem was that our Criminal Code did not allow for a deferred prosecution agreement. What did the Liberals do? They slipped the provision into a massive budget, what we call an omnibus budget bill, hoping nobody would ask why it was there. Sure enough, nobody did. All of a sudden, the Criminal Code contained a clause that allowed for a deferred prosecution agreement.</ParaText>

What I find interesting about this story is that I read Jody Wilson-Raybould's book after she left office. She said a bunch of really interesting things. I wish I had enough time to read out the whole book, but I am just going to read this one passage:</ParaText>

Especially when his government had been digging a deeper and deeper hole by the hour by not coming clean on how I was pushed to take over the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to enable them to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA.

We have spoken a lot about foreign interference in the House of Commons lately, and this is a prime example of it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew about the shady dealings that were taking place and still refused to come clean. In fact, the Liberals were so worried about these Winnipeg lab documents that they sued the former Speaker.

I actually read all the documents months before I knew about the Communist Party spies in the Winnipeg lab. I knew about all that, but for six months, I could not say a word. I was muzzled. When the member opposite from Winnipeg North gets up and asks me the question, “Why won't the Leader of the Opposition get a security clearance?”, that is going to be my answer. So, I am going to preempt the question right away. He does not need to ask me, because he knows very well that we can have all this information, but if we cannot talk about it, we cannot hold the government accountable, and that is the reason, not the tinfoil hat conspiracy reasons that member holds for why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> does not want to get security clearance.

I look across the aisle to the government benches and I see several Liberal members who may have believed in the Prime Minister at one time. I wonder what they believe now. If the WE Charity scandal, the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the Winnipeg lab scandal, the ArriveCAN scandal and all the other scandals, all of which cost Canadians hundreds of millions of dollars, were not enough for them to stand up to the Prime Minister and say, “enough is enough”, what will cause them to finally do the right thing?

              <ParaText id="8639030">Mr. Speaker, after nine long years of hardship from the NDP-Liberal government, Canadians are tired of being confronted again and again with undeniable evidence of corruption, mismanagement and a complete lack of regard for accountability. The negligent Liberal government, propped up by its NDP accomplices, has consistently failed Canadians, leading us down a path of rising costs, crime and scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639031">The time has come for us to question the integrity of the elected people who choose to benefit themselves instead of doing their duty to serve the public. We must face the truth: The NDP-Liberal government is not only unreliable but also fundamentally untrustworthy. We as Canadians deserve leadership that serves the people, not leadership that serves itself. We deserve transparency and accountability, not a government that uses its power to cover up its misdeeds. We deserve a country where the priorities are affordable living, public safety and honest governance, not one plagued by scandal after scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639032">Let us take a moment to reflect on how damaging the past nine years have been. One of the most blatant examples of the government's betrayal of public trust is why we are holding today's debate: the $390-million corruption scandal tied to Liberal appointees in Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC. The Auditor General's report uncovered 186 conflicts of interest in which Liberal insiders used taxpayer dollars to enrich themselves through various companies. Members should let that sink in. Through the green slush fund, there were 186 separate instances in which people in positions of trust exploited public funds to line their own pockets. That is not mere incompetence; that is corruption at its absolute worst.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639033">In response, what has there been from the Liberal government? There has been deflection, obstruction and a refusal to accept responsibility. It has paralyzed Parliament by refusing to hand over unredacted documents to the police for a criminal investigation. The <Affiliation DbId="305019" Type="96">Speaker of the House</Affiliation> has ruled that this refusal is a violation of parliamentary privilege. It has even been revealed that, despite the Speaker's ruling, the Liberal government is still withholding and censoring information. I am not going to sugar-coat this. The Liberals even lack the integrity to follow the rules made by one of their own members, yet the NDP-Liberal coalition continues to obstruct justice, protecting its friends while Canadians suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639034"> The government is more focused on safeguarding its own interests than on addressing the real issues that are crippling Canadian families right now. This pattern of scandal and corruption runs deep. The government has continuously attempted to bury its wrongdoings, not only in this case but also on over 15 other occasions in the past nine years. The integrity of our democracy is at stake when those who are in power believe that they are above the law. Canadians deserve better, and they will get that when they elect a Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639035">The current $390-million corruption case is just one scandal in a long line of Liberal misconduct since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office in 2015, from the SNC-Lavalin affair to the WE Charity scandal and to invoking the Emergencies Act without cause and freezing citizens' bank accounts. The NDP-Liberal government has demonstrated time and again that it is willing to break the rules to serve its own interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639036">Let us start with the SNC-Lavalin affair of 2019, one of the most high-profile scandals in recent memory. The case involved allegations of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his staff when they attempted to pressure the then attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to intervene in a criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, which was accused of bribery in Libya. When Wilson-Raybould refused to comply, she was removed from her position.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639037">That scandal sparked outrage, leading to Wilson-Raybould's resignation from the cabinet. The Ethics Commissioner ultimately ruled that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had violated ethics laws by exerting undue pressure, showing a blatant disregard for the rule of law in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639038">Then there was the WE Charity scandal in 2020. The Liberal government awarded $912 million in student grant contracts to WE Charity, an organization with very close ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family. It was later revealed that both the Prime Minister and the then finance minister, Bill Morneau, had family members who received payments from WE Charity for speaking engagements. In the face of conflict of interest, the contract was cancelled and Morneau resigned. While the Prime Minister was cleared by the Ethics Commissioner of any wrongdoing in this case, Morneau was found guilty of breeching ethics rules. Once again we saw a Liberal government mired in scandal and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639039">Then there was the Aga Khan vacation scandal of 2017, yet another example of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal disregard for ethical governance. The Prime Minister and his family accepted a vacation on the private island of the Aga Khan, whose foundation receives millions of dollars in taxpayer money through federal funding. The trip was paid for by the Aga Khan, and this led to the Ethics Commissioner's ruling that the Prime Minister had violated four sections of the Conflict of Interest Act, making him the first sitting Prime Minister in Canadian history to be found in violation of the act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639040">Who can forget the blackface scandal of 2019? During the federal election campaign, multiple photos and videos surfaced of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wearing blackface and brownface makeup at various events. Although the Prime Minister issued a half-hearted public apology, Canadians were left questioning his judgment and values.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639041">The list of scandals does not stop there. In the trip to India controversy in 2018, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s official trip to India turn into an international embarrassment when it was revealed that Jaspal Atwal, a convicted Sikh extremist, had been invited to official events with the Canadian delegation. The trip was widely regarded as a diplomatic failure, and questions were raised about the Prime Minister's judgment and the government's vetting processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639042">Then there was the cash-for-access fundraising scandal of 2016, in which wealthy individuals paid large sums of money to attend exclusive fundraising events where they were gaining personal access to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and senior Liberal ministers. This scandal was so blatantly corrupt that it prompted changes to Canada's political financing laws and raised concerns about the integrity of the Liberal government's dealings with donors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639043">There was also the issue of former governor general Julie Payette. She was a Liberal appointee who created an environment of toxicity and harassment and needed to be fired for her gross misconduct. What else would we expect from a friend of the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? Of course we cannot forget the reckless spending; despite racking up expenses while in her role, she went on to cause over $277,000 in additional legal expenditures. Ultimately, the lack of scrutiny in making government appointments, and the problems this causes, is a very common theme for the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639044">In the Winnipeg virology lab scandal in 2021, the Liberal government came under fire for refusing to provide Parliament with unredacted documents about the firing of two scientists from a high-security virology lab. The case remained shrouded in secrecy, with concerns about potential security breeches and the shipment of dangerous viruses to a Communist Chinese military research facility. The government's refusal to comply with House orders has raised serious questions about transparency and national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639045">More recently, in 2023 we learned about the McKinsey contract scandal, in which the federal government awarded $209 million in contracts to McKinsey &amp; Company without proper and adequate oversight. Many of these contracts were awarded on a non-competitive basis, raising concerns about the government's procurement practices and the potential conflicts of interest. Once again the Liberals were giving away Canadian taxpayer dollars to their friends. It was remorseless corruption to the core.</ParaText>

Together, let us break the silence and advocate for the needs of children and adults with dyslexia across Canada.</ParaText>

Nestled in the heart of Lanaudière region, Saint-Jacques is a lively community known for both its culinary delights and its rich history. It has an impressive built heritage and is also home to gems like Parc des Cultures, where one can admire an Acadian commemorative monument; various sculptures, each more beautiful than the last; and a bust of one of my mentors, a great Jacobin and former premier of Quebec, Bernard Landry.</ParaText>

One study reports that, month by month, 40% of Quebeckers are just $200 away from bankruptcy. The situation has reached such a crisis point that the expression “tightening one's belt” is literally coming true. Twenty per cent of people are eating less just to save a little money. That is just plain wrong. It shows the Liberals' lacklustre results in forcing the CEOs of big companies to control their prices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639336">Mr. Speaker, ten years ago, we witnessed an attack on our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639337">The attack began on October 20, 2014, in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, with the murder of a courageous soldier, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent. Mr. Vincent served his country. He wore the Canadian uniform. He had a family and friends who loved him but lost him. Two days later, there was another attack here on Parliament Hill, and, perhaps worse, at our great memorial to Canadian soldiers.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8639338"> The terrorist attack of October 22, 2014, took the life of a courageous Canadian, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, who was standing on guard for those who had fallen standing on guard for our country. There he was at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, ambushed and shot, lying bleeding in the arms of a half a dozen courageous Ottawa residents who held him and told him “You are so loved”. Moments later, the life would drain out of his body. Some might have looked at him and said that he was an ordinary Canadian. Certainly, when I saw the picture of him a few days later in the newspaper with his muscles bulging after a trip to the gym, I thought that he could have been like any young Canadian, but he was not. He was not ordinary at all, he was extraordinary, as are every single one of the men and women who put on the uniform of our forces. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639339">The terrorist, who then made his way to Parliament Hill in a carjacked vehicle, burst in through the front door. I remember being in the caucus meeting of the then Conservative government and hearing large crunching sounds, which I learned later to be the repetitive echo of a single gunshot bouncing off the oval-shaped ceiling of the rotunda back down onto the marble floors. That was the first shot inside Parliament, and it was a shot that bore wound, but it could have been so much worse. When this terrorist entered, he planned to cause maximum carnage, but there was someone waiting for him. One of our courageous guards, Samearn Son, saw the gun, grabbed the assailant, pushed the gun downward and took a bullet in the ankle, giving his compatriots enough warning time to draw their own weapons and take cover behind the large limestone pillars that hold Parliament up. Had he not done that, it is almost certain that the gunman would have taken more lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639340">We did not know about the story of Samearn Son, because he did not tell anyone. Instead, he quietly hobbled out of the building towards the abandoned hijacked vehicle to see if there were any other terrorists. There may well have been other gunmen at that point taking aim at him, but he fearlessly continued his work. He did not tell anyone what he did, he did no interviews, and the only quote I can find of him from that day was “I'll survive.” He got into an ambulance and made his way to the hospital and quietly went back home to recover with his family. That is the calm, humble, courageous character that embodies the best of Canada. Samearn Son is Canada's son.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639341"> The terrorist would proceed through the Hall of Honour. I remember those firecracker sounds going off. We did not know at the time that those were gunshots fired by our security forces, thank God, bringing the terrorist to the ground and ultimately to his deserved fate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639342">I want to thank each and every one of our security members who fought so hard to protect us while putting their lives at risk on that day: The first responders who arrived quickly on the scene to minimize the damage done and the lives lost, the military members, the RCMP and countless others who protected us all and stood with us on that day. I want to thank all parliamentarians who showed courage and camaraderie in coming together, responding to defend this institution of Parliament and to grieve the loss of those who had defended us. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639343">What we learned on that day is that if we can see over the horizon, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants, like Corporal Cirillo, like Patrice Vincent, like Samearn Son and like the countless other heroes who defended us on that day. May we remember today, every day, the precious gift that is our parliamentary democracy and the even more precious gift that are those who defend it.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278151" Type="2">Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8639344"> Mr. Speaker, ten years ago today, on Wednesday, October 22, 2014, Parliament experienced one of the darkest days in its long history, a day that would forever change life in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639345">Ten years ago, a terrorist killed a man just steps from Parliament before bursting into Centre Block targeting elected representatives with deadly intentions. Ten years ago, Corporal Nathan Cirillo lost his life in a completely senseless attack, when he was shot by a deranged jihadist sympathizer. The Bloc's thoughts go out to Corporal Cirillo's loved ones. His life should never have ended that day, at the age of 24, because of a senseless act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639346">As Quebeckers, we cannot help but remember that the Ottawa attack came barely two days after another traumatic incident in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Just two days earlier, another individual inspired by radical Islamism mowed down two soldiers in a parking lot. One survived but the other, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, lost his life. We remember him today, too. Our thoughts are still with his loved ones, ten years later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639347">All parliamentarians, all staff and even people who were working in the area around the Hill will remember October 22, 2014, for the rest of their lives. That was the day all of downtown Ottawa wondered whether we were safe, as we were all locked down in our offices until the end of the day. It was the day a madman killed a soldier and then stole a minister's limo to get to Centre Block.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639348">It was a Wednesday, a caucus day, when Parliament is more crowded than any other day of the week. That was the day this man started a shootout with parliamentary security in the Hall of Honour, right by the library. It was the day Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and the police heroically opened fire and brought down the shooter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639349">History will always remember the heroism demonstrated that day by Mr. Vickers and by members of Parliament's law enforcement service, particularly Corporal Curtis Barrett and Constable Son. It was a very heroic moment, but it did not mark the end of the crisis because nobody knew at that time that the shooter was acting alone. It was the end of the threat to Parliament, but the beginning of a long day for all MPs, staffers and House personnel, who feared for their safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639350">No one knew what was really going on. We were told to keep our offices locked, to stay away from the windows and to close the curtains. We called our loved ones, our spouses, our children. We wanted to reassure them. It is very difficult to reassure loved ones when we have no idea what is actually going on. Finally, though, we were told that it was safe to leave and go home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639351">Life in the House of Commons changed that day. It changed for the many people who suffered post-traumatic stress following that horrible event, which continues to leave a mark 10 years on. It also changed with the creation, the following year, of the Parliamentary Protective Service in its current form and with the heavily tightened security measures around the Hill, which are still in place this fall. Most of all, Parliament lost a lot of its innocence that day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639352">Gone are the days when we believed such things would not happen here on Parliament Hill, which used to be more like a tourist attraction with a laid-back atmosphere. The change is probably for the best, considering the current climate of hostility and threats against elected members. It will forever be deplorable and tragic that, in order to get to this point, Nathan Cirillo, a young man in the prime of his life, had to lose his life to a terrorist. We will never forget him or what happened on Wednesday, October 22, 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639353">In closing, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, I want to thank all the Parliamentary Protective Service officers who are here with us every day and who put themselves at risk to keep us, our employees and all the dedicated House of Commons staff safe, as this commemoration clearly reminds us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639354">We thank them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639355">Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the New Democratic Party and the Parliament of Canada, I pay tribute to Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent and Corporal Nathan Cirillo, the soldiers who gave their lives 10 years ago, and I extend our deepest love and sympathy for their families and comrades who still grieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639356">Today, we pause to remember a day of deep trauma and violence, but it was also a day of heroism and human decency. When our Parliament was attacked, all of us were there sharing the same load and the same determination, from the cooks in the cafeteria, the cleaners and our security to the most important cabinet ministers on the front bench. All of us were there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639357">I remember every minute of that day; at least I think I do. It began when the gunshot rang out in the Hall of Honour. That shot injured our parliamentary security hero Samearn Son, who, in taking that shot, bought valuable time. He represents the best of who we are as a nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639358">I remember when the shot rang out, and in our caucus room, there was no way to lock the doors. We were not prepared for something like this. We feared, hearing the shots, that we were facing multiple shooters and a hostage situation. We were all trying to figure out what to do next. Alain Gervais put his body against the doors to protect us. There was a bullet lodged in that door. He represents the best of who we are as a nation and I thank him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639359">I think of Joël Lepage, the guard on the other side of the hall, and Jean-Benoit Guindon, who was at the library. They represent the best of our country and I thank them because they continue to serve Parliament. I also thank all those who were there that day who are no longer here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639360">I thank Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, who has always been larger than life. He put his life on the line and took the shooter out and never spoke about it. He just did what had to be done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639361">It was a day of chaos and uncertainty. There were so many rumours that day. We thought there were multiple shooters. In the chaos, we did not know what we were dealing with, but one thing was really clear, and this is what I want to stress today: the incredible heroism of ordinary people, including the frontline responders, the staff here and the people of Ottawa. People stood along the barricaded streets and shouted out encouragement as we were trying to get out of lockdown. People came down to be with us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639362">I did not sleep much that night. Early the next morning, I felt the need to go to the cenotaph in the darkness to be where Nathan Cirillo had been killed, and there were hundreds of people already there. They were there from all walks of life. I have never forgotten that moment because I thought, this is who we are as a nation. This is what we do in the face of violence. We do not return hate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639363">We came together as a city, as a nation. That is what we have to remember from this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639364"> I mention this because there are heroes who have not been given their due. I think of Barbara Winters, who, when the shots rang out, did not run away. She ran into the danger. She held Nathan Cirillo and told him over and over again, “You are loved.” What a beautiful moment. That is who we are. This is the best of our nation. I praise Martin Magnan, who came forward to comfort Nathan Cirillo, and Margaret Lerhe, the nurse who was there in the midst of the chaos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639365">These people represent the best of us and there is unfinished business in the Parliament of Canada because they have never been properly given their due. Sending people a certificate might be a nice idea, but we do not send a certificate to people who comfort and keep our warriors alive as long as possible. We recognize what they did and we recognize the trauma they carry to this day. I ask my colleagues across all party lines to come together to find a way to recognize not just our parliamentary heroes but the civilians who were there on the front line that day, because they represent the best of who we are as a nation, and we need to remember them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639366">I would like to conclude by saying there is another reason we need to remember this day. We are watching, around the world, growing radicalization, disinformation and hate. Words matter. They have an impact. When I see the rising threats against everyone from municipal councillors to people going to work in Parliament, words matter. It is incumbent upon all of us in this Parliament to call that out, because on that day, two brave people died.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639367"> That day, people were traumatized by violence and disinformation and hate. Words matter. We cannot let that happen again, and we will only let that happen if we forget the lessons of October 22, 2014. The real lesson we have to remember is that that day, despite the chaos and uncertainty, brought out the best of who we are as a nation. It showed the world what Canada is. Canada stands up at times of hatred. Canada reaches out. Canadians were there for each other. That is the lesson we need to remember every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639369">That was 10 years ago, but, as my colleagues have already said, the tragedy had begun on October 20 with the murder of Patrice Vincent.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8639370"> A lot of us were here that day. I really resonated with the words of our colleagues who remember that day. I remember, as the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was saying, what it was like inside the Conservative caucus room. For those who never served in Centre Block, it is almost incredible to believe that through the unlocked doors of the reading room were the prime minister, the cabinet and the Conservative caucus. All of those doors on three walls opened outward. We could not lock them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639371">Across the hall, in the railway committee room, which, fortunately, had double doors, was the NDP caucus. As was just remembered by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278641" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, Alain Gervais of the protective service stood to guard those doors. Thank God it was a double door, because the bullet went through one door and lodged in the second one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639372">So many individuals showed so much courage. The unbearable murder of young Corporal Nathan Cirillo will stay with us always, as will the courage of Samearn Son, who, as I understand it from talking to people in those days, actually had the barrel of a gun against his chest and pushed it downward to where it fired into his leg and his foot. He protected all of us, unarmed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639373">Also, I remember friends in the Conservative caucus who had histories in law enforcement. David Wilks and Shelly Glover organized themselves within that room to protect their colleagues. There was heroism on all sides, bravery, courage and many tears, but there was never an inquiry. I will add now that it is never too late to actually look with fresh eyes at what happened and learn those lessons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639374">With that, I want to again thank our former Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and resonate with what he has recently said in the media: Yes, there are still lessons to be learned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639375">God bless Canada. God bless everyone who, on that day, showed such courage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639387">Mr. Speaker, it is not far-fetched at all to expect that, once results are returned, we will once again uncover more Liberal corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639388">Let us not forget to return to the green slush fund scandal, because there is still more to unpack here. In 2019, former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains began appointing executives with severe conflicts of interest to the board of SDTC. Conflicts of interest were rampant from the beginning, but they got worse with time, with members of the SDTC board voting on projects that they stood to gain from. Again, this was $390 million of taxpayer money wasted on a slush fund that doled out money for projects to enrich Liberal insiders who should have been ineligible to receive funding. This scandal highlights the reckless mismanagement of taxpayer dollars and the government's failure to uphold even the most basic standards of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639389"> While the Liberal government has been busy covering up scandals and protecting its insiders, Canadian families have been left to bear the brunt of its policies. Life under the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his NDP-Liberal government has never been more expensive. Housing costs have doubled; grocery costs have soared, and inflation is eroding the value of every dollar that Canadians earn. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639390">Apart from scandal and corruption, we also have a government that is completely incompetent. A prime example of this is the NDP-Liberal carbon tax, which has made life more expensive for every Canadian. The Parliamentary Budget Officer's report confirms what many have suspected all along: Canadians are worse off under this tax. In Newfoundland and Labrador, households are paying an additional $652 a year because of the carbon tax. In Ontario, it is $903. Families in Saskatchewan are paying $894 more; in Alberta, it is an extra $697 a year. These are real taxpayer dollars being taken out of the pockets of hard-working Canadians, all for a policy that has failed to achieve any of its environmental goals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639391">The carbon tax has driven up the cost of everything, from gas to groceries to home heating. This year alone, families will be paying $700 more for food while millions of Canadians are lining up at food banks. All the while, the government continues to waste and squander public money on failed policies and scandalous dealings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639392">The Liberals have even gone so far as to hide internal government numbers showing that the carbon tax will cost Canadians $30.5 billion by 2030. That is an extra $1,824 per family per year. In addition to taxing Canadians to the point that they cannot even afford to drive, the government is wasting billions of dollars chasing an electric vehicle mandate that Canadian consumers are just not interested in. I have driven an EV, and even on a reasonable commute across the most developed area of Ontario, the infrastructure to support vehicles is just not available. Fast chargers are few and far between; a lot of times, they are mysteriously broken. In some cases, the price to charge the car from empty is actually more than it would cost to fill a tank full of gasoline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639393"> Let us consider the cost to even get one of these vehicles. It is absolutely prohibitive to the vast majority of Canadians. Even further, the government has slapped a luxury tax on a few of the EVs that have any form of functionality. It is a scam, and it gets worse when we consider the massive investments in factories that the government is making when they are not even going to fully employ Canadian labour. That is right: We have learned that, after committing billions of dollars to build electric vehicles, the factories intend to employ foreign labour. While Canadians struggle to make ends meet, the government is either punishing or ignoring them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639394"> Meanwhile, we see that the streets of our cities have become more dangerous. Violent crime has increased 39% since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. The justice system, once a source of pride in this country, has become a revolving door for repeat offenders. Instead of addressing these issues, the NDP-Liberal government has weakened laws, making it easier for dangerous criminals to go free. Our communities are no longer safe, and families no longer feel secure in their own neighbourhoods.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639395">The government has failed to protect Canadians. Instead of taking action to stop the rising tide of violence, they have chosen to focus on ideological crusades that have done nothing to make our streets safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639396">In fact, just yesterday, the Toronto Police Association posted the following message on X in response to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s boasting about banning handguns two years ago: “Criminals did not get your message. Our communities are experiencing a 45% increase in shootings and a 62% increase in gun-related homicides compared to this time last year. What difference does your handgun ban make when 85% of guns seized by our members can be sourced to the United States?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639397">The NDP-Liberal coalition is simply not worth the cost, the crime or the corruption that they bring. After nine years, it is clear that they have failed to deliver on their promises. Instead, they have delivered higher taxes, higher costs, higher crime rates and a government plagued by scandal after scandal. The only solution is a government that will put Canadians first and that will end the waste, the corruption and the inflationary policies that are strangling families across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639398"> Only a common-sense Conservative government can restore accountability and trust in government. We will end the corruption, clean up the mess and give Canadians the answers they deserve. We will ensure that taxpayer dollars are used for the benefit of Canadians, not for lining the pockets of Liberal insiders. We will axe the carbon tax that is making life more expensive, and we will get back to work on building homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime that is destroying our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639399"> The NDP-Liberal government has had nine years to show Canadians what they can do, and they have shown that they absolutely cannot be trusted. They have put their own interests ahead of Canada, hidden the truth rather than face accountability and wasted taxpayer dollars on pipe dreams and vanity projects while Canadians struggle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639400">It is time to bring an end to this corruption and restore integrity, transparency and common sense to our government. Canadians deserve a government that will put them first, and it is time to bring home a common-sense Conservative government. We will axe the tax, restore trust and rebuild our great country. Canada and Canadians deserve nothing less.</ParaText>

The government has taken hard-earned taxpayer money, wasted it and given it to Liberal insider friends for projects that do not benefit Canadians. That money would have been better spent on seniors or on helping lift people out of poverty.

              <ParaText id="8639424">Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Speaker's decision concerning the production of documents related to the scandal surrounding Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, as ordered by the House. The House ordered the production of documents concerning this scandal so that they could be turned over to the law clerk and, potentially, to authorities for investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639425">The process is not complicated. The House has powers that override any other entity, but the Privy Council Office, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, decided to circumvent this order by asking the departments to redact the documents before sending them along. This was a breach of members' privilege, because the order issued by the House did not call for redactions. This scandal raises serious concerns about the management of taxpayers' money and the governance of public funds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639426">We have just returned from a constituency week. For three days, my team and I set up a passport booth to help people who had not had the privilege of travelling and who could not understand the forms or fill them out properly. We wanted to make it easier for them to get a passport and, in some cases, to avoid extra steps, like taking photos and photocopying their ID. My main goal was to meet with my constituents. Over those three days, we interacted with more than 500 people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639427">One thing was clear. Canadians are tired of the Liberal government. This government is at the end of its life. It is out of touch with the reality facing people in Quebec's regions. When a 10-year passport costs $160 and a five-year passport costs $120, some people will not apply for a 10-year passport because they cannot afford the extra $40. Then they turn on the news and see the CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada billing taxpayers $6,000 for a personal vacation. This arrogant attitude is not surprising. As elected members, we must set an example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639428">It is a symptom of Liberal governance, under which no one is accountable and someone can be called out by the Ethics Commissioner without any consequences. It is also typical of this laissez-faire attitude, this lack of ethics and judgment on the part of certain individuals who managed the green fund. People approached me during those three days to ask what I was doing. They said that the Liberals' management of the green fund was worse than the sponsorship scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639429">Let us review the facts to put them in perspective. Twenty years ago, in May 2002, the then auditor general of Canada, Sheila Fraser, began her investigation into what became known as the sponsorship scandal. Ms. Fraser submitted a damning report to the Liberal government of the day in November 2003. The government prorogued the parliamentary session to delay the tabling of the report, which was not made public until February 2004. Ms. Fraser estimated that roughly $100 million of the $250 million allocated to the sponsorship program between 1997 and 2002 had been misappropriated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639430">Let us now look at a few facts about the SDTC scandal that have Canadians saying that history is repeating itself. In November 2022, whistle-blowers reported their internal concerns about unethical practices at SDTC to the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639431"> In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> agreed to suspend SDTC funding. In November 2023, the Auditor General announced an audit, and in June 2024 the Auditor General's report was released, finding severe governance failures at SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639432">The Auditor General found that Sustainable Development Technology Canada gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that, on several occasions, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. There was $334 million, over 186 cases, that was given to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest, while $58 million was given to projects without ensuring contribution terms were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639433">On June 10, the House adopted a motion calling for the production of various documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada to be turned over to the RCMP for review. On September 26, the Speaker issued a ruling on the question of privilege and found that the privileges of the House had, in fact, been breached. Now the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is working on keeping his job instead of working for Canadians. Prorogation is looming over Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639434">This is not just about numbers or about wasting taxpayers' money. It is about trust, fairness and accountability. Canadians deserve a government that respects them and that does not hide behind bureaucratic excuses. Rather than answering for its actions, the government has redacted documents, as it is wont to do. The government wants to block investigations to protect those who are at fault. According to the Auditor General, the government made no attempt to uncover criminal intent. How can we trust a government that covers up its own failures?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639435">This week, we are celebrating small business owners during Small Business Week. The SDTC scandal once again shows that this Liberal government is picking who the winners are and who the losers are.

He also told me that he could not help but feel that he does not know the right people or is not in the right riding when he thinks about the SDTC scandal or the huge sums invested in Taiga Motors in Shawinigan. Winning conditions need to be restored for everyone. People need justice and fairness, as well as confidence in the future. The green fund and the financial failure at Taiga Motors are not the only concerning federal investments for the people of my riding of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639439">The government also invested large sums of money in Elysis technology. Some people are telling me that the government would have done better in terms of governance and monitoring if the funds had been used to serve the best interests of Canadians. For example, I was told that the Department of Innovation, Science and Industry could have required the National Research Council of Canada to assess the project and play a role in leading it and setting policy directions, as well as executing certain aspects of the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639440">Naturally, such large investments demand a great deal of prudence. The Liberals, of course, are completely unfamiliar with economic prudence.

              <ParaText id="8639441">This government is living on borrowed time, with the complicity of the Bloc Québécois. It is trying its best to fight its last battles, but they are purely ideological, like their decision to issue the woodland caribou order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639442">This government, which claims to be environmentalist, gives out money allocated for sustainable development without any obligation to achieve results, while it withholds hundreds of millions of dollars promised to Quebec for biodiversity protection. Workers, business owners and forestry communities are paying the price for this fight. Under the Liberals, it is not the workers or the business owners or forestry communities that will benefit from these funds. We can be sure of that. It is safe to say that there are not a lot of Liberal supporters in the regions in Quebec. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639443">The government is allowing the forestry sector to wither away. It is allowing the European Union to eat into our market share, although it had plenty of money, given the astronomical sums that were squandered in the green fund. That money was needed to harvest more of the wood that was burned by the forest fires. That money could have been used to make our forests more fire resilient and to better adapt to climate change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639445">Canadian families are struggling every day to keep a roof over their heads, to put food on the table and to heat their homes. Meanwhile, the government is misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars to line its friends' pockets. This is unacceptable and intolerable. We have a right to see the hidden documents. We have a right to understand why this money, our money, is being used to fund companies that are close to power, while we, the people, are struggling to maintain a decent life in a country where everything is becoming out of reach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639446">This country is not a Liberal family business. Canada belongs to Canadians. Every dollar we pay in taxes must be spent on making life better for everyone, not on lining the pockets of a select few. We need to demand that these documents be handed over, so we can get to the bottom of this and the RCMP can investigate without obstruction. It is a matter of justice for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639447">The Auditor General revealed that 82% of Sustainable Development Technology Canada's financial transactions over a five-year period were tainted by conflicts of interest. That means $330 million worth of taxpayers' money went to companies in which board members had a direct or indirect interest. Publicly funded initiatives such as Sustainable Development Technology Canada must have the confidence of the public and investors to ensure sustainable and transparent economic development across the country. If Sustainable Development Technology Canada's practices continue to be unworthy of this trust, projects critical to our collective future may be stalled. We need to take a moment to reflect on what that really means. If Canadians lose faith in their government and its institutions, that puts our democracy at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639448">How can we build a strong and sustainable future if we are surrounded by an atmosphere of mistrust and cynicism? It is crucial that everything about these practices comes to light to ensure that investments in strategic sectors such as clean technology are made in a fair and transparent manner. This scandal tarnishes the credibility of the management of public funds at the national level, but it also has a direct impact on the future of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639449">We cannot let this government continue to rob us of our future. We have to say enough is enough. That is why we are demanding full transparency. Canadians deserve the truth. They have a right to know where their money is going and to demand a government that respects them, a government that will put an end to corruption. Only common-sense Conservatives will do that. We have seen too many scandals, too much waste and too much secrecy. We will put an end to this corruption and put power back in the hands of Canadians.

During the last two years, when global inflation affected Canadians and resulted in cost of living increases, we continued to invest in Canadians. We continued to take measures and introduce programs to help Canadians who had been deeply affected. The investments we made are yielding fruit. Inflation is down to 1.6%. Interest rates are coming down. In fact, tomorrow the interest rate is probably going to come down for the fourth time. The consumer confidence index has been the highest in the last 30 months. </ParaText>

My parents immigrated to Canada from bonnie Scotland when Diefenbaker was Prime Minister of our great nation. My mother believed in strong principles. She passed those principles down to me, and I am doing my best to preserve and carry those out for a strong foundation and cornerstones in my life.

              <ParaText id="8639512">A senior civil servant was screaming from the rooftops about Liberal incompetence and corruption. The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on occasions could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology, $334 million to over 186 projects in which board members held conflicts of interest and $58 million to projects without ensuring contribution agreement terms were met. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639513">Here is what really makes my blood boil when I hear of something like this. Communities across Canada are struggling with aging infrastructure and are begging for a fair and predictable funding model that will help them tackle the backlog of issues they are dealing with. When they hear of this green slush fund and have challenges getting funding and financing for aging infrastructure projects, municipalities get upset, mayors and councillors get upset and taxpayers get upset. I am upset too. The Liberal government is doling out much-needed funds that could be used in communities for important projects essential to a community's operation and survival, such as new water treatment plants, replacing aging waterlines, replacing aging bridges or roads that need upgrading, and building recreational facilities where kids, families and the elderly can get together. Instead, Liberal insiders get the payouts for projects that cannot demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639514">The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s industry minister, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. Why would he? SDTC's mandate was supposed to be a federally funded non-profit that approves and disburses over $100 million in funds annually to clean technology companies. However, from the Auditor General's report, this mandate obviously changed and not for the best interests of the Canadian taxpayer. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639517">The problems with the government are rampant, and they have been going on for far too long. SDTC executives were awarded projects in which they held conflicts to the tune of over 330 million dollars' worth of taxpayer funds. Why did the executives not do their due diligence? Well, it started from the top.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639518">In 2019, the former Liberal industry minister began appointing conflicted executives to the board of SDTC. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s newly appointed board then began voting to give SDTC funding to companies in which executives held active conflicts of interest. Then the governance standards at the fund deteriorated rapidly under the leadership of the new chair. It all started from the top.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639519"> How did this come to light? The Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner initiated separate investigations after whistle-blowers came forward with allegations of financial mismanagement at the fund. The Achilles heel of the Liberal government is financial management. What did the Auditor General say? The Auditor General investigation found severe lapses in the governance standards and uncovered that $390 million in SDTC funding was either awarded to projects that should have been ineligible to receive funding or awarded to projects in which board members were conflicted during the five-year audit report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639520">There is a clear timeline that tells the story, a horror story, of what has transpired and why we are here today. In late 2018, the former Liberal industry minister expressed concern regarding the Harper-era chair of SDTC, Mr. Jim Balsillie, given his public criticism of government privacy legislation. The minister's office expressed its discomfort with Mr. Balsillie's comments to the CEO of SDTC and requested that the chair stop criticizing government legislation. There was no censorship happening here; just look away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639521"> The minister then proposed two alternative chairs to the CEO of SDTC as replacements in a phone call. One of the candidates proposed was Ms. Verschuren, an entrepreneur who was receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639522"> What happened next? The minister, the PMO and the PCO were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair and were told that up until that point, the fund had never had a chair with interests in companies receiving funding from SDTC. That was a very clear warning and was, I might add, very good advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639523"> In June 2019, the minister decided to proceed with the appointment despite repeated warnings expressed by his office not to do so. He did not need advice. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by board members. Why not? It was allowed from the top level, so they could do it too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639524">Board members went on to award SDTC funding to companies in which board members held stock or positions within the company. Their investments were funded by the taxpayers of Canada. How tragic. However, wait, we are not done yet. The minister went on to appoint two other controversial board members, who engaged in unethical behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funding for companies in which they held ownership stakes. The cycle continued, to pad the pockets of their friends even more.</ParaText>

On January 21, the new <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister of industry</Affiliation> was appointed. Did he clean up the mess? No. In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices as SDTC. The Privy Council was briefed by the whistle-blowers about the allegations shortly after and commissioned two independent reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639526">Not far behind, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, and the new <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was forced to agree and then suspend funding to SDTC. Just last year, in November 2023, the Auditor General announced an audit of SDTC, which revealed and confirmed the horror story that I have just shared. In June 2024, the Auditor General's report was released, and it found severe governance failures at SDTC.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639529">It is worth pointing out that this is not just one instance of corruption and spending practices. It is an ongoing cycle.

It was as if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not exist for the last 32 days in New Brunswick.

I can say without a doubt that New Brunswick today has never been in a stronger position in my lifetime, both in terms of quality of life as well as opportunity compared to the rest of Canada. It is a great place to call home. Our economy is growing, work is available without going west and, today, other Canadians recognize our advantages by moving down east in record numbers.

These chosen elites then gave the money to companies they either owned or had a financial interest in. When these acts of blatant conflict and corruption were reported to cabinet, the Liberals tried to cover it up. Mandarins and ministers were aware of taxpayer funds being misappropriated through SDTC, but instead of stopping this scam, the program administrators somehow funnelled even more taxpayer funds for ineligible projects from other federal departments. It was all approved by different ministers appointed by the Prime Minister. </ParaText>

My colleague, the hon member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, initiated a parliamentary investigation into the corruption, which resulted in an order from the House of Commons that the government hand over all documents, unredacted.

We will remember the lofty rhetoric that dissolved almost overnight. I want to remind everyone here, especially those in the benches opposite, that in 2015 the Liberals presented Canadians with a platform of change. They campaigned on the promise to be the most transparent and accountable government in Canadian history.

We have seen a government that has been mired in scandal after scandal, a government that has betrayed the trust of all Canadians. The green slush fund, otherwise known as the SDTC scandal, is the most egregious example of this betrayal. According to the Auditor General's report, SDTC was responsible for awarding nearly $390 million in taxpayers' money to projects where board members had direct financial interest. These nine board members, approved by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the cabinet, were involved in 186 conflicts of interest. This was not accidental mismanagement. It was systematic corruption orchestrated by those in positions of power to benefit themselves and their associates. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639598">One egregious example is that of Andrée-Lise Méthot, who was appointed to the SDTC board in 2016. Méthot runs a venture capital firm, Cycle Capital, which received $114 million in grants from SDTC during her tenure on the board, funds that directly benefited her personal investments. The value of Cycle Capital tripled during this period, thanks in no small part to the tax dollars funded through the SDTC program. How convenient it must be to sit on government-appointed boards and approve millions of dollars to one's own company. This blatant self-dealing is emblematic of a broader culture of cronyism that has infected this tired Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639599">Instead of focusing on innovation, the green slush fund became a piggy bank for well-connected Liberal insiders who used their influence to enrich themselves at the expense of hard-working Canadian taxpayers. The corruption did not stop with Méthot. Another board member, Stephen Kukucha, was also involved in conflicts of interest. A former political staffer to a Liberal environment minister, Kukucha used his position on the SDTC board to funnel $5 million to companies in which he had financial interests. Like Méthot, Kukucha saw nothing wrong with enriching himself through his government connections. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639600">When questioned, he actually dismissed the $5-million payout as “a small amount of money”, but that small amount of money is a staggering sum for Canadian families who have seen their federal taxes rise to pay for government largesse. It represents the taxes paid by countless families struggling to make ends meet. For these Liberal insiders, it is just another example of how the system has been rigged in their favour and against everyday Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639601">This scandal demonstrates a government that has completely lost its way, a government that has become more interested in serving the interests of a select few than in serving the people of Canada. However, this scandal is about more than just the misuse of tax dollars. It is about the erosion of trust. It is about the erosion of the very principles of good governance that we are all elected to uphold and to hold accountable. The scandals that have plagued the government, from the SNC-Lavalin affair to the WE Charity scandal, from the misuse of public funds in green energy projects to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own ethical violations, have revealed that Canadians have a Prime Minister who is no longer capable of acting honestly for our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639602"> The green slush fund scandal is one of the most troubling examples of the government's failure to live up to its promise. Not only is it about the hundreds of millions of dollars in misspent and misallocated money, but it is also now about a government that is not prepared to follow an order of the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639603">SDTC was established with the goal of fostering innovation in the Canadian economy. For many years before the Liberal government, it was well managed. It was a program in which projects would be funded on merit. What was a lifeline for innovators became a Liberal vehicle for corruption and cronyism. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639604">According to the Auditor General's report, a staggering 390 million tax dollars was allocated to projects in which board members were in a direct conflict of interest. That hard-earned taxpayer money went to projects where decision-makers stood to benefit personally. This is not just a failure of oversight but also a violation of trust. It is a betrayal of the very principles of transparency and accountability to taxpayers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639605">This scandal, sadly, is not an isolated incident for the government. Earlier, I alluded to a broader pattern of corruption and ethical lapses that have plagued the government since it took office. We all remember the SNC-Lavalin affair, in which the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself was found to have violated ethics laws by attempting to interfere in a criminal case to benefit a corporation that was connected to the Liberals. We all remember the WE Charity scandal, in which millions in tax dollars was funnelled to an organization with close ties to the Prime Minister's family. Who could forget the numerous ethical breaches involved in the firing of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639606">These scandals are not just the result of poor decision-making or bad management; they are the result of a culture of corruption that has taken root within the government. It is a culture in which well-connected insiders are rewarded while ordinary, everyday Canadians are left behind to pick up the bill. Rules apply to everyone else but not to those in positions of power and authority. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639607">What is even more troubling is the government's response to these scandals. Instead of taking responsibility, instead of acknowledging its mistakes and working to fix them, which would be the honourable route, it has chosen to obfuscate, deny and hide the truth. When Parliament ordered the production of documents related to this green slush fund scandal, the government responded by heavily redacting those documents, making it impossible for Parliament to fulfill its duty of holding it accountable. There is no other reason for us to be here than to approve funds it requests and then to hold it accountable for the spending of those dollars. What we are seeing from the Liberals is not the behaviour of a government that values transparency but that of a government with something to hide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639608">The cost of this corruption is not just financial; the true cost of this scandal goes far beyond tax dollars. Canadians have lost faith in the government. Who can blame them? They see their hard-earned tax dollars being misused and mismanaged and a government that refuses to admit wrongdoing. It sets a precedent that breeds further corruption and incompetence throughout the bureaucracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639609">It is a time when millions of Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. Food bank usage has reached a point where we see that families can no longer afford to eat without donations or assistance. Seniors are being forced to make difficult choices just to keep food on the table. Meanwhile, the government has been handing out hundreds of millions of dollars to its well-connected friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639610">It is an insult to every Canadian who works hard, pays their taxes, plays by the rules and expects in return that those in power, those in government, will be honest. Instead of this, tax money went to projects that were tainted by conflicts of interest and projects that did not qualify for funding without underhanded tactics to give well-connected Liberals an edge over others. This is the true cost of their corruption. It is the cost borne by the Canadian taxpayers, who are being asked to shoulder the burden of higher federal taxes each and every day because the government has lost its way, lost its ability to manage and lost its ability to be straight with Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639611"> As a member of His Majesty's loyal opposition, I have a solemn duty, as do all members on this side of the House, to hold the government to account. Our system of government is based on the principle of responsible government, where the executive is answerable to the legislature, that is, Parliament, and by extension, through members of Parliament, to the people of Canada. This is not just a theoretical concept; it is a fundamental principle of our democracy that we must defend at all costs. However, time and time again, the government has shown contempt for Parliament and the democratic process that we are supposed to keep in check.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639612">The refusal to provide unredacted documents to the House and the Liberals' repeated attempts to cover up the truth by protecting former officials and staff members are part of a pattern of behaviour that is deeply concerning. When the Speaker of the House rules that documents must be provided, it is not a suggestion; it is an order. It is the will of the House and it must be respected. The government's decision to redact the documents is a clear violation of our collective parliamentary privileges, and it is an affront to the democratic principles that underpin our system of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639613">The question we must ask ourselves is this: What is the government trying to hide? Why is it so determined to keep these documents out of the hands of Parliament and parliamentarians? If there is nothing to hide, why not provide the documents in full and allow the truth to come to light? Sunshine, of course, is the best disinfectant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639614">In the years since this scandal was first exposed, I suspect two things have happened. First, an army of bureaucrats and government staff members have combed through the thousands of documents we are looking to get our hands on. Second, the Liberals have collectively agreed among themselves that the true cost of this scandal is not $390 million, but a much larger figure that they want to keep to themselves at all costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639615">This is also a political nightmare for the Liberals because it could well mean the annihilation of members of Parliament in the government at election time. A government deputy minister said that this scandal is worse than the Chrétien-Martin sponsorship scandal, and we all know that that scandal, the ad scam scandal, ended the Martin and Chrétien governments. SDTC is so devastating that it would do great harm to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, cabinet and the Liberal Party if the books were opened and revealed to the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639616">The green slush fund scandal is not just about the misuse of tax dollars. As I said before, it is about the principle that no one, not even the Prime Minister, is above the law. It is about the principle that those who are entrusted with the stewardship of public funds must be held to the highest standards of accountability and transparency. The refusal of the government to provide the documents requested by Parliament is a clear violation. It is an attempt to subvert Parliament to shield those responsible for this corruption from accountability. Let me be clear: Parliament must not allow this to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639617">When all three main opposition parties are in agreement, it is a signal that trust has been broken across the country. In the upcoming election, Canadians will have the opportunity to choose a different path. I stand today to say that Conservatives will bring forward a government that Canadians can trust, a government that will be responsible stewards of their tax dollars and will always act in the best interests of the people who elected us to serve them. If we are given that opportunity, we will ensure that those in positions of power are held accountable for their actions. This means real consequences for ethical violation and conflicts of interest. We will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and responsibly. This means ending the culture of cronyism that has taken hold in the Liberal bench, means ensuring that public contracts and grants are awarded based on merit and means a better day and turning the page on the corrupt government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8639650"> Madam Speaker, today I am happy, on behalf of the people of Lakeland, to join the debate started by common-sense Conservatives because of the Liberals' repeated pattern of entitled and immoral abuse of Canadian tax dollars under the guise of programs ostensibly about issues that all Canadians care about. After nine years, the Liberals' corruption is just not worth the cost. The entire House of Commons asked for the Liberals to release documents about their major scandal but like always, the Liberals cover it up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639651">The Liberals presented the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, known accurately now as their personal green slush fund, as vital for investments to address climate change but it lacks transparency, fails to produce any results and, as always with these guys, serves the interests of Liberal insiders instead of Canadians. That is the Liberals' clear pattern: funnel other people's money into their friends' companies and pockets; sometimes get caught; evade, delay and obfuscate; and then finally, use every tool they have and all of their power to cover it all up and blame everyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639652">People might be inclined to dismiss this topic as just the way things are. They may say it is politics, that they are all the same, or that this is some political process or navel-gazing exercise where politicians talk to hear themselves speak about some obscure, out-of-touch process or parliamentary issue that does not really matter to everyday Canadians. However, that just is not true. It is, in fact, the uniquely Liberal pattern of mismanagement, wasteful spending and obvious ethical breaches apparently endorsed by the Liberals' coalition partners in the NDP and Bloc, since they do keep voting to prop them up and keep them in power, even though those so-called opposition parties do have the ability to stop it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639653">The government must release the $400-million slush fund scheme records that show Liberal appointees funnelled Canadian tax dollars into their companies and their cronies' companies. The scale is simultaneously shocking and, horrifyingly, not surprising. We have nearly half of the billion-dollar slush fund of misused tax money with 186 conflicts of interest. What is wild here is that despite warnings about the conflicts of interest the head of the slush fund had, the Liberals put her in that key role anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639654">Another board member was the founder and CEO of a company called Cycle Capital. It so happens that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> has personal shares in Cycle Capital and worked as a strategic adviser for it for over a decade. During that CEO's time on the slush fund, companies in which Cycle Capital invests received more than $100 million of tax dollars from the scheme. The Liberals took the head of Cycle Capital from the slush fund to the Liberals' Canada Infrastructure Bank, where she voted to give $170 million to her own company. We can talk about a conflict of interest. This is just one of many examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639655">In my neck of the woods, and in my colleague's riding of <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, we all know what they say of something that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck. I am confident Canadians can see what is happening here for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639656"> Conservatives say if the Liberals have nothing to hide, then there is no reason to not release the documents. Since the Liberals are willing to stop all the work of the House of Commons, the people's place, to refuse to disclose the slush fund records, then they should just call a carbon tax election and let Canadians decide. Canadians deserve transparency and accountability. None of the government's money belongs to politicians, bureaucracies or government appointees. It belongs to Canadians. These are the kinds of things that people get fired for in the private sector. In governments that actually care about ethics and fiscal responsibility, elected people would resign or be fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639657">However, it would be hard for the ethical offender-in-chief, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to have the credibility to mete out consequences with his own cabinet caucus and officials because this behaviour always has a role model at the top, but complicit participation is just as wrong. Canadians deserve to know how billions of their dollars have been misused over nine years, who benefits from the cover-ups and how it will be made right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639658">This pattern is also clear in the Liberals' claims about $120 billion for environmental programs. The intended outcomes often never materialize. For example, Lion Electric received millions from government, later declared bankruptcy and left nothing to show for the government's expenditure of Canadians' money, except failure, loss and broken promises. More than $40 billion of Canadians' money was allocated for EV subsidies, for example, yet infrastructure to make them actually affordable and suitable for Canadians' real lives, in every region of this country, lag far behind.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639659"> Everything the Liberals claimed about the Stellantis subsidy has been proven false. It is billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, and this is before shovels are even in the ground. The Liberals said that it was supposed to create jobs for Canadians, but at least 1,500 jobs, the majority, will be filled by temporary foreign workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639660">While the Liberals claim over and over again that these programs serve Canadians, the funds instead benefit companies or cronies with Liberal connections. The Liberals' fast-and-loose approach to tax dollars, feathering the nests of their fellow elites in either full complicity or through a lack of action on ethical violations, is the Liberal jam. The Liberals used to wax eloquent about the disinfecting nature of sunshine and sunny ways, but, after nine years, what they deliver is costly collusion and cover-up after cover-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639661"> The Auditor General repeatedly points out that there is a lack of clear goals and oversight. Programs are launched without plans or, for many of their so-called environmental initiatives, without any way to measure impacts or even emissions reductions. By omission or by design, the Liberals make it nearly impossible to assess progress or ensure responsible use and oversight of tax dollars. The Liberals obstruct efforts to hold the government accountable with vague responses, if a response is provided at all, and they withhold documents so Canadians cannot know whether their own public money is being wasted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639662"> Just last year, I submitted an access to information request on the costs the federal government cites related to Canada's environmental targets. Documents show that the government held back information and deliberately strategized to deny the answers to me, and therefore all Canadians, with vague language and redirection to publicly available government and external non-government sources. In both instances, the replies did not include a single specific figure that was explicitly requested. Unfortunately, it is a fact that this reflects a pattern overall, which is the opposite, of course, of openness, transparency and accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639663">While the government claims to spend tax dollars on green projects, there is often actually no way to know if these projects even exist, never mind assessing the outcomes or results that all Canadians would care about. One of the most striking scandals involves government contracts to McKinsey &amp; Company. After nine years, the Liberals gave them $200 million of Canadian money. The Auditor General uncovered “frequent disregard for procurement” rules, including the failure to justify sole-sourced contracts for 18 of the 19 awards to the firm. The Liberals bypassed their own government's required procurement policy to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639664"> It is a long, flagrant disregard for ethical and fiscal decision-making and a pattern of noncompliance. No wonder Canadians lose faith in governments, politicians and bureaucracy when the government refuses to show the value for the Canadian money that it spends. Government departments frequently failed to estimate the cost of McKinsey's services beforehand. Out of 33 contracts reviewed, cost estimates were only provided in three cases that had been given to McKinsey that actually included cost estimates to protect Canadians' money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639665">The truth is that, after nine years, these Liberals are not just the masters of a flawed procurement process. They also actively ignore and choose not to fix it, to the benefit of themselves and their buddies. Of course, the firm's former global director enjoys a close relationship with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and advised senior officials on economic policy, so it is obvious that McKinsey's influence on public policy was part of a broader network of favouritism. The Auditor General noted the rapid growth in McKinsey's contracts with the Liberals after nine years. Canadians can be forgiven for seeing this exactly as it is: elite, political insider favouritism with Canadians' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639666"> One $33-million government contract to McKinsey for the government-caused, beleaguered and delayed Trans Mountain expansion was issued non-competitively and without a justification being clearly linked to one of the competitive procurement policy exceptions. Another example, of course, is the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which oversees more than $30 billion in public-private infrastructure spending. More than half its board members have ties to the Liberal Party, including former Liberal candidates, donors, staff and board members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639667">Common-sense Conservatives warned repeatedly about this boondoggle of mismanagement and no accountability, but the Liberals initially gave it 35 billion tax dollars, and after nine years, it has produced very little to show for all that money spent. Despite grand promises of transformational infrastructure projects, it must remain in early planning stages, stalled or not exist at all. It is not just about missed deadlines. It really shows systemic inefficiencies and abysmal project management, with Liberal insiders appointed to high-level positions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639668"> These are choices made over and over. These are staggering numbers for most of us to even begin to comprehend. It is no wonder that Canadians question the impartiality and governance of the Liberals, their banks, their boards and their panels. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639669"> The government claims that billions are earmarked for infrastructure, but so much is all tied up with insiders. The Liberal government sent half a billion dollars to the Asian Infrastructure Bank. Its former head of global communications told the parliamentary committee that Canada has not received “a single thing of tangible value” from a quarter of a billion tax dollars. He said that he is unaware of the Liberal's demand for a return of that money. Unfortunately, this is also reflective of most of the government's apparent environmental initiatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639670">However, all of this is really about a larger problem. The Liberal government's spending decisions are driven more by ideology and political optics than by the best interests of Canadians or, for many of these examples, the actual environmental impact. By focusing on headline grabbing and ribbon cutting rather than practical solutions and outcomes, the government has wasted billions of dollars of other people's money. The Liberals' own endless tax-and-spend, rat-trap cycle has made all the essentials too expensive for everyone, hollowed out the middle class and particularly harmed low-income and working poor Canadians. Really, it is disgusting. It is a gross Liberal pattern. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639671">The Liberals' WE Charity scandal is one of the most infamous, with a $900-million contract ostensibly for a student grant program. Of course, Liberal family members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had long been paid to appear at events, and both the relatives of the then finance minister and senior government officials had close connections with WE. All of that benefited the Liberals and the charity. The Ethics Commissioner ruled that the then finance minister acted unethically and breached the Conflict of Interest Act when he failed to recuse himself from the decision. After Conservatives pushed the government relentlessly to release those documents, it ultimately cancelled the contract. However, this was not done before the Liberals hid the details; ultimately, they shut down Parliament to avoid accountability and left Canadians in the dark. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639672">The Liberals tried yet another cover-up on the Winnipeg lab leak in 2021. There were reports that the RCMP had to intervene at that one-of-a-kind, top medical and virus lab. This was because of a security breach and speculation of espionage by China's Communist dictatorship at that Canadian lab. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fought tooth and nail to prevent any of the documents from coming up. As he is doing now, he defied a motion passed by elected MPs. All parties that had seen the documents, including a Liberal MP, said that this was to cover up embarrassment, not to protect national security. Time and time again, the Liberals repeatedly prioritize political interests over genuine public benefit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639673">Withholding information from MPs, who are here because of and to serve the people, shows without a doubt the Liberals' total disregard for ethical governance. All these scandals do, and there are many more. This undermines public trust. These are ongoing issues of favouritism, lack of transparency and poor governance. Canadians clearly cannot afford or trust the Liberal government and its coalition partners, which is the serious consequence that happens when public money is funnelled by the Liberals to politically connected corporations and insiders. When any accountability and transparency is lacking, this leaves Canadians wondering where all their money has gone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639674">We can consider the scale and what this actually means. The nearly $400 million blown by the Liberal slush fund alone would require the equivalent of 22,000 Canadian families to work an entire year just to cover the amount through their federal taxes. After nine years of the Liberals, costs are up and taxes are up; therefore, in reality, all those Canadian families are already working their butts off and cannot get ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639675">This conduct is not acceptable at any time. However, the same government's spending and carbon taxes have caused inflation and a historic cost of living crisis by driving up the prices of groceries, fuel, housing and heating. These are essentials, not luxuries, in Canada, especially with winter coming. When such things happen, better accountability and oversight of tax money is the very least that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639676"> A recurring theme is the government's absolute failure to deliver on promises of job creation and economic growth. It frequently promotes its green programs and infrastructure projects as job creators, but many of the jobs that are created are temporary or disappear once construction phases end. This has been especially problematic in growing sectors such as renewable energy, where employment opportunities are promised during government announcements at project launches but never materialize. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8639677"> In addition, who can forget the Liberals' tree planting failure? In 2019, the Liberals promised to plant two billion trees, but as of last year there were deals to plant only 374 million trees by 2031, which is less than 19% of their stated goal. NRCan reports that only 56 million trees have been planted to date; that is not even 3% of the Liberals' promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639678">Meanwhile, traditional sectors like oil and gas, where hundreds of thousands of Canadians work and that remain vital to Canada's economy, have been subjected to uncertainty, extra-heavy regulation, prohibitions, unfair treatment and carbon taxes. Canada has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs because the costly coalition wages an ideological war on energy workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639679">The Liberals' scandals and mismanagement are not isolated incidents. It is their long-established grift. From the mishandling of programs to insider deals, it is clear that public resources are being misused and Canadians are being shortchanged. After nine years of the NDP-Liberals' anti-energy, anti-private-sector policies, more than $5.6 trillion of investments in jobs, businesses, projects, talent and technology have gone from Canada to the U.S., a unique reversal since the Liberals were elected in 2015. It has gotten worse every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639680">There is no doubt that the Liberal government, backed by the coalition, are the most ethically compromised government in Canadian history. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">PM</Affiliation> has been convicted of two ethics violations, and so have four senior Liberal MPs, the most of any government in Canadian history. At the same time, the Liberals have made it so that two-thirds of lower-income families struggle to eat, to heat their home and to house themselves, due to the government-caused cost of living crisis. It is just unacceptable that tax dollars are wasted, period. Especially now, Canadians deserve a government that puts their interests first, manages their tax dollars responsibly and delivers real results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639681">The Liberals' actions, their being their willingness to stop everything to cover up, are obviously a deliberate attempt to shield their own corruption from public scrutiny. The Auditor General already uncovered instances where slush fund officials directed tax money to their own companies. The Ethics Commissioner ruled that the fund's chair, personally appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, broke the law. It is not just common-sense Conservatives saying that; it is common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639682">Elected leadership must prioritize ethics, transparency, accountability and effective governance. Environmental policy should be about stewardship, conservation, mitigation and adaptation, and it should benefit all Canadians, not just the well-connected few in certain regions. Enough is enough. Parliament must do its job, since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals will not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639683">The Liberals must comply with Parliament's demand and release the green slush fund documents because the demand comes from the representatives of the majority of Canadians. That is whom we are here to represent, whom we work for and whom we are to serve. When the majority of members of Parliament in the House of Commons make a demand, those are the people for whom they are making that request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639684">However, after nine years of the NDP-Liberals, taxes are up, costs are up and crime is up, and I think Canadians think that time is up for the Liberal government. If the Liberals have nothing to hide, they should call a carbon tax election to let Canadians decide to end wasteful spending, restore accountability and bring home transparency so common-sense Conservatives can axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. It is time.</ParaText>

She also said that, in the meantime, the government has neglected the oil industry or subjected it to uncertainty.</ParaText>

It might be an interesting point of fact that of all the private sectors in the Canadian economy, the sector that plants the most trees without government funding or initiatives is the oil and gas sector, right across Canada. People who live and work around this development would be aware of many of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639695">This goes to the government's whole problem on these environmental issues.

As we know, in the WE Charity scandal and the SNC-Lavalin scandal, NDP MPs played a key role in getting to the bottom of those. We condemn those scandals but we also condemn the incredible corruption of the Harper years. The Conservatives, when they were in power, when we look at the size and scope of their scandals, were even worse than the Liberals.</ParaText>

These were massive amounts, unacceptable uses of taxpayers' money and never condemned by Conservatives, ever.

              <ParaText id="8639702">The last time I spoke to the motion, I shared how much money we are spending by having one speaker talk after another. I have an update on those numbers if anyone is curious. As of yesterday, we have had 66 Conservative members speak to the motion. If we only account for the cost of operating the House of Commons for just those 66 members, which is 33 hours of speeches, it is over $2.3 million. As of yesterday, there is the opportunity for 53 more Conservatives to continue wasting money to speak to the motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639713"> Madam Speaker, I am rising to provide my response to the question of privilege that was raised by the <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">Conservative deputy leader</Affiliation> the week before last, which was before the constituency break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639714"> As the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation> said, while members of Parliament have a fundamental right to access the parliamentary precinct free of obstruction, that freedom does not extend to members of the public who are looking to confront, be aggressive to or bully other people on Parliament Hill. It is for that reason that peaceful gatherings on the Hill need prior approval to take place. When those gatherings are political protests, approval is needed in the event that there is a counterprotest. We have seen this multiple times. It makes good sense if the goal is to balance peaceful expression of views, prevention of incidents and a de-escalation of conflict. Of course, if one's goal is not de-escalation, it makes sense that they would not like this, which brings me to the specific incident in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639715">I have reviewed the member's intervention. At no point in time does she even try to show how her privilege or access to the Hill was compromised. It simply was not. That alone would be grounds to dismiss her case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639716">I have also reviewed the clip that she posted to social media of the incident. It seems to me that the video shows an individual approaching an authorized gathering on Parliament Hill with the express purpose of disrupting it, all while being filmed, in an attempt to provoke a reaction from the hard-working, dedicated PPS agent on the scene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639717">The video in question is watermarked with the extremist tag “Dacey Media”, the exact same watermark that appears on videos of attempts to provoke the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">NDP leader</Affiliation> on Parliament Hill a few weeks ago. The individual who was retweeted by the <Affiliation DbId="278731" Type="2">deputy leader of the Conservatives</Affiliation> in that same thread, which was of course promoted and retweeted by her, also states extremist rhetoric of hate, such as, “We’re like 2 centimetres away from an Islamic regime here”. That was from the same extremist who has Americans messaging her about coming to liberate Canada. It is unfortunate, but not a surprise, to see Conservatives promoting racist, far-right accounts. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639723">I will say that a far more legitimate question of privilege could have been raised with regard to the actions of Conservative Party members in Parliament in support of extremists a few years ago during the far-right trucker convoy. Members will recall that this convoy shut down downtown Ottawa for weeks, which of course had the direct impact of restricting access to Parliament Hill. Downtown residents were continually harassed. Seniors were denied medication. People with disabilities were denied groceries. Businesses were forced to shut down. Members of Parliament had to walk a gauntlet of far-right extremist hate in order to represent their constituents by coming to this chamber. Far from raising concerns about privilege then, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative Party leader</Affiliation> served the truckers coffee and doughnuts, calling it a “freedom convoy”, though tens of thousands of Ottawa residents had their freedoms denied as a result of this takeover of downtown Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639724">I would mention as well that, since this time, we have seen a number of incidents that are disturbing in their flirtation with the far right. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has used the male supremacist “men going their own way” hashtag to attract far-right misogynistic viewers. He accepted an endorsement from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones; has visited protesters affiliated with Diagolon, a militia-like extremist organization; and refused to punish backbenchers who met with members of the extremist AfD party, a party known for Islamophobic and anti-immigrant views. </ParaText>

Not only have we stopped building the affordable housing we need, but governments have also allowed for the erosion of the existing supply of affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639752"> Research from the Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative shows that, in my community, for every one new unit of affordable housing getting built, we are losing 39. Worse still, we are seeing the financialization of housing as housing is being commodified. We are seeing more and more large corporate landlords buying up and profiteering from homes that used to be affordable, raising rents and evicting folks. Of course, we also have governments that are not investing enough to prevent and reduce homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639753">This is something that the Parliamentary Budget Officer has looked at very specifically, giving numbers for parliamentarians to consider. To get just a 50% reduction in chronic homelessness across the country, we need to see the federal government increase its funding to seven times what it currently is. The PBO estimates that this would require an additional $3.5 billion a year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639754">The good news is that we can afford this. We can look to other programs the government currently funds. We can look at subsidies to the oil and gas industry, for example. There is $18 billion there. We can look at the Trans Mountain pipeline; there is $34 billion more there. We can look at the military, which is $26 billion and going up to $50 billion. All we need here is just $3.5 billion for unsheltered folks. We can look to move dollars to those who need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639755">My question tonight is this: Will the government do better by those living unsheltered and commit the funds we need to close this gap?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639756">Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my friend, whom I have known for a number of years now. I know his points come from a sincere place. He cares about his community; specifically, he cares about the issue of housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639757">He began by talking about the 1990s and cuts that were made. He is right. Previous governments, Liberal and Conservative, let the country down when it comes to the issue of housing. The current government has sought to do something quite different by, really, being the first government really in a generation to understand that there is a federal role with respect to affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639758">The member also mentions the Parliamentary Budget Officer. Specifically, he mentions the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report. That is a very good thing because that report talks about the Reaching Home initiative, among other things. This is the signature program when it comes to the federal government's response to helping communities on the issue of homelessness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639759">What do we know about Reaching Home? As a result of it, 87,000 people who were on the street are no longer on the street now. That includes people in the member's community of Kitchener Centre. These are people who are housed now with supportive housing. What does that mean? It means having mental health support on site and support for physical health care, such as nurses, on site. Quite often, job training programs are provided on site or very close to the facility that is being funded. That is how we get things done. That is how we build homes to ensure people have a roof over their head. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639760">The member talks about encampments. The current federal government put forward $250 million in budget 2024 to support communities. Having encampments is a scourge. It is not acceptable. We have to respond. We have been clear that provinces need to match the funding in order to maximize the number of communities that can be supported. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639761">I care about this. The government cares about this. I think all members of Parliament do. However, the record is clear that we are responding in a way that the Conservatives would never do. They talk about cuts. In fact, the Conservatives presented what they call a housing plan, which is a little more than something written on the back of a napkin that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> put forward in a private member's bill and that does not talk about homelessness at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639762">There is more to do. We are committed to that kind of a vision of social justice, and we will get it done. </ParaText>

In fact it has increased funding to reduce homelessness across the country. The reality right now is this: The result is that over the last number of years, the number of folks living unsheltered has tripled. Therefore the results in my community mean that more folks are hurting and are living on the streets, and we have not seen the results of the funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639764">My question to the member remains this: Does he recognize the reality that in Waterloo region, the number of folks living unsheltered has tripled, and will he advocate to step up the funds that have been put on the table to ensure that we get to a point where we achieve the goal we both want, which is to at least cut homelessness in half over the coming years?</ParaText>

I will point to specific examples, though, because he unfortunately failed to cite any. I think there is honesty on his side when he says he recognizes what the federal government is doing, but at 82 Wilson Avenue in Kitchener, $2.4 million of support housed 48 people. Kitchener Housing received $1 million for 500 units that were either built anew or repaired. Finally, the member is quite an advocate for co-op housing, and 50 people are living at the Beaver Creek Housing Co-operative in Waterloo as a result of a $750,000—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639767">Madam Speaker, carbon tax Carney and the heat pump hustle have come to town. We have learned about the lobbying efforts that carbon tax Carney has been undertaking to enrich himself, using his access as a special adviser to the government in the U.K. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639768">What is interesting are the similarities to what happened after carbon tax Carney was named the de facto finance minister by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When the Prime Minister lost confidence in his <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and brought in Carney, we saw the exact same kind of behaviour that we have seen from carbon tax Carney in the U.K. within hours of his being appointed to the role. The Prime Minister is shielding him from Canada's conflict of interest laws, notably, the same laws the Prime Minister was found guilty of breaking twice. The Prime Minister broke the law, twice, just like the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> broke the law, just like the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation> broke the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639769">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is shielding Mark Carney from that law because, within hours of having been named to that position, what did he do? He thought he would start by doing what Liberals do, which is to help out their buddies, and gave a $2.14-billion loan to his friend who runs Telesat. The Liberals got really upset when I talked about how there are market-based solutions that could be done much more cheaply than what they were proposing to do, but it was not about solving high-speed Internet; it was about enriching their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639770">What else did Mark Carney do in his first week on the job? He tried to get his hands on $10 billion of pension money in a scheme for Brookfield, the company that he is chair of. In that same first week, what did carbon tax Carney also do? He decided he would let the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> know he needs to change mortgage rules so we can have longer and larger insured mortgages. Why would carbon tax Carney want to do that? Of course, it is because Brookfield is the second-largest private mortgage insurer in the country. This is what it does. It helps out Liberal insiders, all while Canadians struggle just to get by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639771">What is the upside for Canadians with the appointment of a de facto finance minister outside the bounds of the obligations that public office holders have, the ethical rules that the Liberals cannot seem to stay on the right side of? We know Carney is looking to succeed the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and obviously, the Liberal Prime Minister wants to displace the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> as a contender for that job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639772">When we boil it all away, we have another Liberal elite who wants to help his friends and Liberal insiders while Canadians are lined up at food banks in record numbers. Two million Canadians are using food banks every month and a third of those food bank users are children. According to Statistics Canada, 25% of Canadians do not know where their next meal is going to come from. That is the legacy of the Liberals who are so determined to help out their friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639773">I am sure I will get a non sequitur answer from the parliamentary secretary, who will talk about anything other than the Liberals' failure to represent what Canadians need, which is an accountable government and an institution they can trust. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639775"> I find interesting how many times the member tried to get the message out about carbon tax so-and-so, listing off another individual. I know what it is, because I have also seen the email on it. The Conservative Party actually has a fundraising email that is virtually the same as what the member opposite is saying. That is just it; this is all about games, the Conservative Party and character assassination, consistently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639776">The Conservatives always talk about “Liberal-friendly”. Take a look at the issue we have been debating for the last 12 days in the House of Commons. Instead of dealing with issues that Canadians are really concerned about, the Conservatives are more concerned about games. They are concerned about the Conservative Party, and that is it, but not about Canadians and the issues that Canadians have to face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639777">A good example of that is when the Conservatives talk about Liberal appointments, saying that Liberal people benefit, and they criticize Annette Verschuren. Annette was appointed as chair of SDTC, and the Conservatives constantly say she is a Liberal. However, this individual was an adviser to Stephen Harper, Brian Mulroney and Jim Flaherty, all Conservatives. She is also an individual who contributed thousands of dollars to the Conservative Party, yet the Conservatives will say that she is a Liberal insider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639778">It does not matter to them; the facts and reality are completely irrelevant. All they want to do is make people look as bad as possible, even if this spreads misinformation, and then try to generate cash through misleading emails to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639779"> I would love to see the Conservatives' email bank. It has got to be a million plus in terms of the number of individuals. How do they get that data mine? Well, they learned stuff from the United States. This is the far right moving into the Conservative Party. It is the MAGA right, and they understand how they can milk the system. That is exactly what the Conservative Party, or the Conservative Reform Party, is all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639780">However, when it comes to being responsible, forget that. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> refuses to get a security clearance so he could actually find out information about foreign interference. Instead, there are members across the way crying out, “tell us the names”, even though they know that it is illegal for us to do so. They still say it. All they have to do is tell the leader of the Conservative Party to join with the leaders of the NDP, the Bloc and the Green Party, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and get the security clearance. If he does that, then he gets to see the 11 names.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639781">However, I bet that if he saw the 11 names, he would not share them, because it would be illegal for him to do so and he might have to go to jail. Therefore of course he is not going to do what his minions are telling him to do when they say, “share the names”. To me, that is irresponsible, and I have witnessed it first-hand for years.</ParaText>

However, what he has also said is that people who reveal secret intelligence should go to jail. Well, they should come out with their hands up. It was reported in The Globe and Mail today that “federal officials provided intelligence about India to Washington Post”. That is the Liberal government breaking the Canadian Criminal Code.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639785">I am fascinated that the member is interested in getting on the Conservative Party mailing list, but maybe he should open up a book and learn a little something about what goes on in this place. Our job is to represent Canadians, not to represent Liberal elites like they have with carbon tax Carney, who has lined his pockets with the heat pump hustle and who is doing the same thing as a board member at Stripe. It claimed it was cutting credit card fees; well, that is what the fake finance minister said. Meanwhile, Carney is pocketing the cash at Stripe because it is not passing on the savings to consumers.

              <ParaText id="8639789">Madam Speaker, I got up in the House of Commons to speak about the capital gains increase and what it meant for Canadian farmers during question period. I thought I would take a few moments today just to explain to Liberals how farming actually works. I do not think they fully understand how it works over on that side, particularly when it comes to generational farm transfers throughout families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639790">We just finished harvest in Saskatchewan. Farmers plant the crop in the spring. There is a little work that goes on in the summer. Then in the fall, they take in the harvest. This happens year over year. That is the very simplified explanation of how farming works. The price of farmland in Saskatchewan in 1996 was about $360 to $390 an acre. In 2024, it is $3,190 an acre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639791">We can look at how expensive it has gotten to buy farmland in this country, particularly in my home province of Saskatchewan. We also have the capital gains tax increase from 50% to 67%. The Grain Growers of Canada calculated, when factoring in all the variables, that this amounts to about a 30% tax increase on the sale of farmland.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639792">Farmers do not have a defined benefit plan. They do not have a pension plan. Their retirement savings is the sale of their farm when they get to retirement age. The Liberal member who is going to reply to this is going to get up and say the Liberals increased the lifetime exemption to $1.25 million. Yes, it is true they did that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639793">However, on top of that, when somebody sells their farm, once they clear that number, that is where that new tax rate kicks in. That is why the Grain Growers of Canada said it is about a 30% tax increase when it was 50%, and now it is at 67%. That is where that number comes from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639794">We can look at the valuation of farms and the way it has gone. I know people will say good for farmers that they can sell their land for that much money, and they can have a wonderful retirement. The reality is the cost to buy farmland, seed inputs, machinery, semi-trucks and everything that someone needs on their farm or on their ranch in order to make their business run has skyrocketed exorbitantly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639795">However, the value that farmers get for the crops they sell has been roughly the same over the years. There are fluctuations in the market because it is a global market. Prices go up and prices go down for what farmers can sell their crops for and what they can contract it for. However, the costs are always going up and up when it comes to the machinery they are purchasing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639796">Farmers have to pay off banks for the debts on their land. They have to pay off the debts on their machinery. They have to pay off the debts on their house. They have to pay all this stuff off with the money that they get from the sale of their farm. The government is now going to be taking 30% more off the top of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639797">How is a farmer expected to have a fulsome retirement when the government is taking 30% off the top with the new capital gains tax increase?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639798">Madam Speaker, I will begin by explaining the “why”: Why have we introduced these changes to capital gains in Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639799">The revenue generated from our changes to capital gains will help pay for many of the programs we have put in place. I am thinking, among others, of our national school food program, which aims to help vulnerable children who do not have enough to eat. This helps them learn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639800">To point out another reason, our government believes that hard-working Canadians who make a salary and get their revenue from labour should not have to pay a higher rate of taxation than Canadians who make money off of capital. I do not believe in having wide disparities in the way labour and capital are taxed. I believe, as our government believes, that income inequality needs to be addressed. This policy, as well as others, such as our luxury tax on boats and private jets, aims to do just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639801"> This morning, I had the opportunity to attend a round table hosted by Oxfam on the issue of tax fairness and how to address the growing gap between the wealthiest and poorest in our society. While I could spend much time explaining today's discussion or listing figures, I will note that under the current tax system, a nurse or schoolteacher could pay a higher tax rate than somebody cashing in their stock portfolio. I could talk about the Canadians affected by this change, who have an average income of $1.4 million in any given year. I could detail how middle-class families, small businesses and farmers would be better off under our proposed changes. I have done all that before and I will do it again, but today I would like to talk about something a bit more personal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639802"> I represent the riding of Outremont, which includes the neighbourhood of Outremont, but also Côte-des-Neiges, Mile End and the Plateau. These neighbourhoods represent the microcosm of Canada. We have strong linguistic duality, many ethnic and religious communities, and wide disparities in income and wealth. For average income, my riding is slightly above average, rounding out the top 100, but for median income, my community is ranked the 25th-poorest in the entire country out of 338 ridings and the fourth-poorest in all of Quebec. This is very visible on the ground for me. From the beautiful homes that line gorgeous Mount Royal, with amazing views and beautiful parks, to the old and sometimes dangerously unmaintained apartment buildings in Côte-des-Neiges, which is next to the rumbling of our urban highways, the distinction could not be more stark or more visible to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639803">I would like to be very clear: I do not begrudge for a second those living in beautiful houses in Outremont, as I live in a beautiful house in Outremont. I also do not pity those living in the apartment blocks in Côte-des-Neiges. I was born in a one-bedroom apartment in Côte-des-Neiges and had such a beautiful childhood in that neighbourhood. However, I believe that everybody deserves a fair chance and deserves an opportunity, one that might be just a bit easier than the one I had to fight and claw for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639804">That is where the federal government can and should play a role. That is what fighting for tax fairness is all about. All boats rise with the tide, so all Canadians, including Canadians who pay capital gains, benefit when we create opportunities for other Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639806">Given what the Liberals are doing with the capital gains tax increase, let us look at what they have done for farmers in nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639807">The Liberals are raising taxes by 30% on farmers. That will not make farmers better off. They are hammering them with the carbon tax, which will be quadrupling very soon. Farmers will be paying tens of thousands of dollars every single year and will not get it back from the government's phony rebate program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639808"> The Liberals have looked at trying to label beef as unhealthy. They were warned in advance and did not even bother to put in an application to get the BSE designation for Canada removed when they had the opportunity to do so a couple of years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639809">The fuel regulations the Liberals will be implementing will be detrimental to farmers. Farmers will be paying a higher tax rate because of the fuel regulations. We can also look at the way the Liberals have been posturing around fertilizer reductions and what they are trying to do with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8639810">The Liberals have done nothing but assault Canadian farmers and Canadian producers, when they are the ones who are tasked with feeding the world. The track record—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8639813">This is an important step in our government's plan to build a Canada that works better for everyone, where young people can get ahead, be fairly rewarded for their hard work and be able to buy or rent a home. It is a Canada where everyone has a fair chance to live a good life, right across in our beautiful country. That is exactly what our government is doing with this proposal.</ParaText>
