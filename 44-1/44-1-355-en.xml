            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8635450"> Mr. Speaker, on the Friday before Thanksgiving, I talked about the culture of secrecy and the corruption in the form of conflicts of interest that was obvious right from the very beginning of the Liberal government. In the time I have left, I will talk about the situation we are in right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635451"> Parliament is paralyzed because the government has refused an order for the production of documents, which was passed by the House some time ago. That is why we are here. The Conservatives are not interested in simply letting debate on this motion collapse so the House can fob this off to a parliamentary committee, where the government and its NDP partners can buy more time, maybe delay a final report or maybe avoid a further vote finding the government once again in contempt of Parliament. The Conservatives want the government to comply with the order. The Conservatives want the government to produce the documents that the House voted for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635452"> The Liberals are stuck in the old debate, which the House has already settled. That debate was whether the House should order that documents be turned over to the RCMP, but that ship has sailed. That question is academic. The House has already voted on that question. The House voted to produce documents, so the government's refusal to do so now is a contempt of Parliament. You, Mr. Speaker, have ruled that this refusal is prima facie evidence of contempt of Parliament, which is why this question is being debated to the exclusion of all business of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635453">I would like to address the two main points the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House Leader</Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> keep making over and over again during debate in the House, to the media outside the House and during question period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635454"> First, government members have repeatedly claimed that the government's contempt for Parliament is somehow justified because the order for the production of documents threatens the charter rights of accused persons and prosecutorial independence, while of course ignoring that it is violating section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is the guarantor of democracy. This argument is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard in the House of Commons, and in nine years in the House, I have heard some pretty dumb things come from the government. Before addressing that argument, it has to be pointed out that Vice-Admiral Mark Norman and Jody Wilson-Raybould might have something to say about the government's track record on prosecutorial independence, but I do not have time to go into the old scandals. I will deal with the argument that government members have made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635455">Ordering the production of documents that belong to the Crown in order to give them to another agency of the Crown, the RCMP, has nothing to do with directing prosecutions. Saying so is just plain dumb. Does the order the House has voted for say that the House instructs the RCMP to arrest a particular Liberal insider who took the public's money and gave it to themselves? No, the order does not say that. Does the order direct Crown prosecution services to prosecute somebody in particular, one of the Liberal insiders who, again, took the public's money and voted to give it to themselves? No, it does not direct anybody to do any such thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635456">There is nothing in this production order that compels anyone to do anything besides release the documents and provide them to members of the RCMP so they can have evidence that may be potentially relevant to a case that they acknowledge they are already investigating. That is all this order does. It does not say anything about directing law enforcement or Crown prosecutors to do anything, so this bizarre charter argument is complete and total nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635457">The vigour and enthusiasm with which the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House Leader</Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> advance this argument can only be explained by blind faith in insipid talking points or by functional civic illiteracy. The House of Commons is the embodiment of Canadian democracy, Canada's grand inquisitive body that, on behalf of the people of Canada, who elect members, holds the executive branch, the most powerful people in Canada, to account. It is the will of elected members of Parliament, the will of Canadians, that must be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635458">The second main argument that I have heard from the government, and I am now starting to hear it creep into the other opposition parties propping up the government, is that continuing debate on this motion when all parties have said they will support it is paralyzing the House and preventing it from moving on to other business. However, this argument is a bit too clever. It is victim blaming and it is gaslighting. The Liberals are trying to say of elected members of Parliament that it is their fault for debating the government's corruption, and not the government's fault for refusing an order of the House. When they say this, they are missing the point altogether. Instead of studying contempt of Parliament at a parliamentary committee, the government could end its contempt of Parliament by releasing the documents. It could solve the problem rather than study the problem, and that is why we will continue to debate this motion until the documents are released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635459">As for the other business of the House, I have no interest in moving on from dealing with this corruption just so the government can introduce more bills and laws that are going to harm Canadians. I am not interested in allowing the government to get over the debate so it can introduce the long-anticipated ways and means motions on a capital gains tax increase that will punish thousands of small business owners in my riding, with few companies receiving the exemption being carved out for other Canadians. I am not interested in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635460"> I do not want to give the Liberals a chance to increase taxes on Canadians, to further sap the productivity of Canada and to further decrease per capita GDP, as we have observed under the Liberals. I am not interested in the rest of their agenda either. For example, a bill they may want to debate, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, would create a new, big bureaucracy without doing anything to address online harms, and would give them a new group of insiders they could appoint to that board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635461">The only reservation I have about the time that has gone into this debate is that there is another urgent matter. We need to address the other contempt problem we have with the government, wherein the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton was engaging in private business while a minister of the Crown. The evidence could not be more clear on that. His business associate, who was involved in, among other things, shady pandemic profiteering, claimed that there was some other guy named “Randy”, who we are supposed to believe is not the Minister of Employment. We need to get to the bottom of that as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635462">There is another solution available: The government, if it thinks that Parliament is paralyzed, that we have other business we need to get to and that Parliament has become dysfunctional, has a remedy. The Liberals could call an election immediately. That is the solution. When Parliament is paralyzed, if they think Parliament is not functioning, they can call an election. That is the beauty of the parliamentary system. The government always has recourse directly to the voters of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635463">If the Liberals really think the opposition is irresponsible, that other things are more important, that critical parliamentary business is being stymied and that Canadians are on their side with the refusal to comply with an order of elected members of Parliament, they can call an election and let the people of Canada decide.</ParaText>

This is the leader who refuses to get a security clearance so he can be made aware of foreign interference.

I find it rather odd that the member told my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278678" Type="2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</Affiliation> that his question was not relevant. We are talking about corruption and about influence on governments. My colleague brought up public funding of political parties. Public funding of political parties is another example of how Quebec is a good 10 to 15 years ahead of everyone else. The Government of Quebec reformed party financing in 2012. Now, contributions are limited. Rationally speaking, who really thinks that ordinary citizens are giving $1,700 to a political party, even if they do get a tax refund? The system needs to be reformed. A per-vote subsidy is a reasonable way to ensure respect for democracy and to limit outside influence.</ParaText>

This is well documented. It is under investigation by the RCMP. That is why this is so serious and that is the reason for the extraordinary step of a production order that was made by the House.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8635493"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to the conversation we are having around the government's breach of privilege and scandal, which is just the latest in a long line of scandals under the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635494">I have a number of points to make in this debate, but I will first say it is unfortunate that we are having to have this debate. It is an important one because the government needs to be held accountable, but it is unfortunate that it is necessary when there are many things the House could and should be dealing with. We have a government that refuses to be accountable, and without accountability, accountability first to this House but, more importantly, as an extension, to Canadians, we do not have a democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635495">Right now, the government refuses to be held accountable. There are a number of examples, and I will raise a few of them in the course of my speech today. This is just the latest in a long line of them and it is incredibly unfortunate that we are having to be here today to try to hold a government accountable on something so basic, without the need for a debate like this one to highlight such a situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635496">What we are talking about today relates to what has become known as the green slush fund. The Auditor General of Canada has found that the Liberal government turned what was known as Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. The board that was set up to hand out these grants gave itself almost 400 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately. That was $400 million of Canadian taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635497">I will pause for just a second. That is a lot of money, $400 million from Canadians who have worked hard. They have packed their lunch, put on their work boots, gone to work and worked hard. Some people back home in my province of Alberta work really long hours. It is back-breaking work, in some cases. These people go to work, in many cases, away from their families because they have to travel up north or to other places to work. They do that because they need to feed and put a roof over the heads of their families. They need to ensure their children have opportunities to be involved in sports or to succeed as they grow, mature and become adults themselves. This $400 million has not gone to feed Canadians' families, to put a roof over their heads, to make sure their kids go to summer camp, play a sport, take dance lessons or art lessons or any of that. The $400 million has gone, in this one case, to make Liberal insiders rich.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635498">I do not think anyone who gets out of bed early in the morning and leaves their family to go to work would say they would not mind a bit of that, or in fact, a whole lot of it in this case, going to Liberal insiders because the Liberal Party wants to buy favour with people and hopefully keep itself in power. I do not think anybody in this country would say they get out of bed in the morning to send their tax dollars to Ottawa so this kind of thing can go on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635499">That is the kind of accountability we are talking about right now. We are talking about holding a government accountable for the $400 million of hard-earned Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to Ottawa so that those guys over there, the Liberal government, can send them out to their friends and make them rich. That is what we are talking about today, and that is pretty sad. We would never even be needing to have a conversation like this if that government had just a bit of basic accountability, but this is not something people have come to expect from the Liberal government. It is why it is time for the government to go. It is why it is time for it to be replaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635500">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Time's up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635501">
                <B>Mr. Blake Richards:</B> Exactly, the time is up for those guys, and Canadians know it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635502">Mr. Speaker, the only thing that is standing in the way of that is an election. As soon as that happens, the Liberal government will be gone, because the Liberals have failed to show any basic accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635503">This is almost $400 million of hard-earned Canadian taxpayer dollars. The Auditor General had a look at all of this and found that $58 million went to 10 different projects that were completely ineligible. There was no ability on any of those occasions to demonstrate any environmental benefit or any development of green technology, and it was supposed about that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635504">Let us think about that for a second: 10 different projects received $58 million but did not meet the criteria for which the money was intended. They did not provide any environmental benefit. They did not develop any green technology. One would say that it almost looks like that money was stolen. There was no benefit based on the criteria of the program; for all intents and purposes, $58 million of Canadian taxpayer money stolen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635505">Then there were 186 projects, worth about $334 million, where at least one of the board members had a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635506">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> What, 186? Shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635507">
                <B>Mr. Blake Richards:</B> There were 186 projects where there was a conflict of interest by one of the board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635508">Mr. Speaker, another $58 million went to projects where the board did not ensure the contribution agreement terms were met. Let me put it this way. This is either the most egregious case of incompetence we have ever seen or it is the complete theft of taxpayer money. It might be both, in fact. However, it is staggering to imagine the magnitude of this and the number of instances where there are conflicts of interest or outright complete ignorance of the rules. It is staggering. The amount of money is also staggering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635509">The Auditor General has made it very clear that the blame lies with the Liberal government, particularly with the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, because they did not monitor this. Either they did not monitor it, or maybe they were okay with what was happening. I do not know. I suppose that is part of what we need to determine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635510">At the end of the day, this money, this nearly $400 million of Canadian taxpayer money, was given to Liberal insiders. In order to try to get to the bottom of all of this, there is a need for the information being requested to be provided to the RCMP. For some reason, and I think we can all imagine what that reason might be, the Liberal government does not want to provide that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635511">I can imagine the Liberal government does not like being held accountable, and we have many examples of that. I will get into a few of those examples, because this is a pattern, and I want to show and establish that pattern. This is a government that tends to do these kinds of things. It interferes or allows things like this to occur, and its friends get rich. This is a pattern. Then when there is any effort at trying to hold it accountable for what has gone on, it does everything it can to prevent being held accountable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635512">Let me speak to a couple of examples where we can see this pattern, and this is the latest example in that pattern. The most well-known of those examples was the SNC-Lavalin affair. Everyone in Canada is aware of that one. They are all aware of what happened with Jody Wilson-Raybould, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to pressure her to be inappropriately involved in her role as the attorney general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635513">She stood on her principle and refused to do that, despite immense pressure from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister </Affiliation>. What did he do? He fired her because she refused to interfere inappropriately in an investigation. She knew it was wrong and the Prime Minister did not care. He wanted her to do it anyway. Essentially that is what happened. She refused, despite all the pressure she received from the Prime Minister of our country. For that, she lost her job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635514">To give a little more context, a Liberal-connected firm faced charges of fraud and corruption related to payments made to Libyan officials. In this situation, again, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister </Affiliation> interfered to help out his friends. It was found, in this case, that he violated the Conflict of Interest Act, which is not the only time this happened. Where this becomes really germane, is that we discovered later on, I believe it was last year, that the reason the RCMP was unable to pursue a criminal investigation was because the Prime Minister refused to provide the information that was necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635515"> We see this pattern of a government that refuses, when it is caught red-handed, to provide the accountability, the documents, in this case, that are needed to properly investigate it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635516"> I can give another example of that type of scenario, and there are many of them. In fact, almost every week there seems to be a new one. There is the scandal around the Winnipeg national microbiology lab. The situation was so bad that the government was ordered to provide documents and a former Speaker was sued by his own government because it was trying to find a way to not provide that information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635517">It sounds so ridiculous that it is almost hard to believe it is true, but that is the kind of thing we are seeing. That is one of those examples. The government wanted so badly to hide this information that it sued the Speaker of the House of Commons, one of its own members of Parliament. It is astounding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635518"> I want to focus a little more on one, with respect to these examples, because it is one of the files I am tasked with shadowing the government on, and that is Veterans Affairs. There are many examples like this one, but it is one I am very intimately familiar with because of how much effort I and other Conservative members of the Veterans Affairs committee have put into trying to see addressed. It is the controversy and scandal around the national monument to the mission in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635519">Let me give a bit of context on this. This was obviously a monument to a mission that ended more than a decade ago. The previous Conservative government announced that it would be built. In the nine years since the Liberal government has been in power, it has somehow found a way to ensure that this has not been built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635520"> In my opinion, and, I think, in the opinion of many Canadians, it is an incredible slap in the face to those who served in that mission, those who gave their lives serving our country in that mission and the families of those fallen. It is another extreme example of the government: first, showing complete incompetence; and, second, trying to avoid accountability. Essentially, what happened was it set up a jury to determine what the monument design should be. This was after taking years to get to that point. I do not know how something so important could not be a priority for a government, for any government, frankly, but it was not, for whatever reason, and the government will have to answer to veterans for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635521">The government did set up this jury process. This is an internationally recognized process. The jury selected the monument that it believed best fit the criteria. In about a year-and-a-half period after that, we had enough information that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his office interfered in the process to try to change the result. Eventually, it culminated in an announcement of a different design than what was agreed to by the jury. This is the first time that anyone can recall in the history of these types of processes across the world, that the selection has been disregarded by a government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635522">No real explanation was given. To this day, we still do not know why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> interfered in this. The reason why this is so relevant is because it is another example where, over the course of months, the veterans affairs committee has been trying to get the release of documentation that would indicate what exactly occurred in that year and a half when the Prime Minister was interfering. Why did he interfere? The fact that the government will not tell us that there was a good reason probably indicates that it is not something good and that it is trying its best to cover that up. That is the only thing we can conclude from all of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635523">It is another example of a government that is doing everything it possibly can to avoid releasing some documents that would allow it to be held accountable for its actions; in this case, actions that dishonour the memory of Canadians who gave their lives in service to our country. It is bad enough that $400 million of hard-earned taxpayer money was given away to Liberal insiders, but it is far worse that the Liberal government has dishonoured the memory of Canadians who gave their lives in service to our country. Imagine how their families must feel, knowing that it has done that. That is just insult to injury. To then try to be not held accountable for that kind of action is really disgraceful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635524">This is a pattern, and I could go on and on because there are so many other examples of a government that just does not want to be held accountable. When we have a government that refuses to be accountable, we know the situation. We know that this is a government that has reached a point where it is almost corruption, and I think that all Canadians would agree. It is not “almost”; it is corruption, frankly. Canadians want to see it held accountable and they want to see an election so they can do just that.</ParaText>

It refuses to provide basic information that would allow it to be accountable for its actions, in this case, for giving out $400 million in Canadian taxpayer money to the government members' friends. I suspect the only reason the members do not want to release the names and the information is that they know it would be damning to the government. It would be held to account, and its members would be fired in the next election.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635569">Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of my constituents in Calgary Confederation, and I would like to speak to the matter before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635570">As many are already aware, we find ourselves debating an issue of great concern as you, Mr. Speaker, have found this Liberal government in contempt of the House for its failure to produce documents, specifically unredacted documents related to the Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, fund, which is a program widely known as the green slush fund. The Liberals' failure to produce unredacted documents is because of this Liberal government's mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635571">The green slush fund has been accused of giving grants to start-up businesses and developing accelerators with strong ties to senior management in this Liberal government, in violation of ethical behaviour. This is very concerning to us on the Conservative side of the House and obviously needs to be investigated to determine the facts and the appropriate course of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635572">Of course, we are deeply concerned to hear about the damning facts from the Auditor General that would lead us all to believe that there may be some Liberal insiders who are lining their pockets with taxpayer dollars, while Canadians across this country are struggling to make ends meet. As I mentioned, the green slush fund management has been accused of giving questionable business grants to those with ties to senior management in the Liberal government. I stress, once again, that this needs to be properly investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635573">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> hand-picked chair of the green tech slush fund, Annette Verschuren, a long-time friend of the PM, siphoned $217,000 of taxpayer dollars from this green slush fund into her own company. The Ethics Commissioner also found that Ms. Verschuren broke the law by her actions of improperly furthering her private interests, and the interests of other companies she is associated with, by failing to recuse herself from the board's funding decisions. Ultimately, she ended up resigning. As members know, she resigned last year after she became the subject of this ethics investigation. On top of this, another Prime Minister-appointed green slush fund board member also broke ethics laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635574">Now, Canadians deserve to have these green slush fund documents properly and thoroughly examined to determine who committed the wrongdoings and at whose direction. We know from the Auditor General that the wrongdoing discovered has not been appropriately addressed by this Liberal government; we know, because officials confirmed that there has been no action taken after proven gross mismanagement and conflicts of interest were found at the hands of this Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635575">I have listened to the Liberals over the past weeks on this issue trying to whitewash what is going on here. Instead of transparency and clarity, we have been met with silence, deflection and refusal to release all of the findings. What are they hiding?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635576">It is important to remind Canadians of what we know, and what we know comes directly from the Auditor General. Canadians have deep respect for the independent Office of the Auditor General and the work it does daily to uncover mismanagement in this Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635577"> I used to serve on the Standing Committee of Public Accounts, and the Auditor General, Karen Hogan, would regularly come to the meetings to report on the many files that her office forensically investigated. Each and every time, she provided valuable, objective, fact-based information and she gave expert advice on the findings. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635578">The office is incredibly thorough in the audit work that it does to uncover any irregularities in the accounting and procedural practices of government programs. I was always highly impressed with the quality of work that she and her staff did while I served on the public accounts committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635579">The Auditor General did look into the green slush fund and her findings were shocking. She and her office found the fund violated its conflict of interest policies 90 times. The fund awarded $59 million to 10 projects that were ineligible and the managers of these projects frequently overstated the required environmental benefits of their projects. The report from the Auditor General says things like, “Overall, we found significant lapses in Sustainable Development Technology Canada’s governance and stewardship of public funds.” The report also said that “ Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada did not sufficiently monitor the compliance with the contribution agreements between the foundation and the Government of Canada.” There is more from the Auditor General. The report also said, “We found that the foundation awarded funding to projects that were ineligible, that conflicts of interest existed in some instances, and that certain requirements in the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act were not met.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635580">It does not stop there. The report also says, “We found that the foundation awarded funding to 10 ineligible projects of 58 we examined. These 10 projects were awarded $59 million even though they did not meet key requirements set out in the contribution agreements between the government and the foundation.” There were 10 projects of the 58 that the Auditor General examined. We can imagine what would have been uncovered if all 58 projects had been examined by the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635581">The Auditor General dropped another bombshell when she said in the report, “In addition, we estimated that 1 in 10 of the remaining Start‑up and Scale‑up projects approved during our audit period were also ineligible.” It is unbelievable that 10% of the projects were estimated to be ineligible. Who is lining whose pockets with this type of behaviour? We have good reason to be suspicious of those involved at the highest level because of what the Auditor General has discovered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635582">Let me go on with the report. It also said in the report, “...we found 90 cases that were connected to approval decisions, representing nearly $76 million in funding awarded to projects, where the foundation’s conflict-of-interest policies were not followed.” Therefore, it is no wonder that the Liberals are not keen to have anyone review these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635583">We also know from the Auditor General that attempts were made to keep the dirty circle of secrets as small as possible. The AG revealed that “The act requires that the foundation have a member council of 15 members.” That is 15 members to play an important role in representing Canadian taxpayers to oversee the ethical functioning of the foundation, while the green slush fund board of directors supported reducing that number from 15 down to two members. Why would directors of a $1-billion slush fund want to keep their circle so small, down to two members? Inquiring minds want to know. It is likely because they know it would be easier to get away with their dirty secrets if fewer people knew. We will only know if the proper investigation takes place and that is why the RCMP needs to have access to all the documents in an unredacted form.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635584"> I want to also mention a few other key findings from the Auditor General. The report states the fund's board approved 226 start-up, scale-up and ecosystem projects to receive $836 million. Of those projects, eight, totalling $51 million, did not meet eligibility criteria. For example, some projects “did not support the development or demonstration of a new technology, or their projected environmental benefits were unreasonable.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635585">It also says in the AG report that the AG estimated that one in 10 of the remaining 168 start-up and scale-up projects approved during the audit period, or 16 projects in total, were ineligible. Totalling $8 million, two ecosystem projects were ineligible, because “they did not fund or support the development or demonstration of a new technology”, and the board approved $20 million for seed projects without completing screening and assessments required by the contribution agreements with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635586">This is unbelievable, yet it is true. How can these Liberal members opposite find the gall to stand up here daily and suggest that this matter is not worthy of a full investigation? How can they look at themselves in the mirror and say that? This is troubling. The lack of transparency, accountability and integrity from the Liberal government is an issue that strikes at the very core of how we as Canadians expect our government to operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635587">What was the incentive to break so many rules and who benefited? Who provided the direction to allow for so much of this mismanagement? We know that when people break rules, it is always for their personal gain at the expense of the greater good. Why would we expect this case to be any different and where has the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> been all along? I can say he has likely been sleeping on the job here, and he must follow his green slush fund chairperson, Ms. Verschuren, in her steps and resign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635588">Canadians will remember the corruption of this Liberal government come the next election. I guarantee it. This Liberal government members are in full damage control right now in a desperate attempt to save their parliamentary jobs. It is no wonder the Liberals do not want to let Canadians anywhere near ballot box, because they know Canadians are itching to get rid of them. This is why we need an election now to let Canadians decide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635589">Canadians are paying attention to this. While they are struggling, this Liberal government ignores their plight. The real income of Canadians has plummeted to a level not seen in almost a decade. Paycheques are just not as powerful as they used to be. Canadians are falling behind as the cost of living increases faster than the ability of their paycheques to keep up. The dependency of Canadians on food banks is growing exponentially and shows no sign of slowing down. It is frankly shocking and deeply unsettling that people who have decent jobs are unable to put enough food on the table in a country like Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635590">We know housing in Canada is out of reach for basically anyone who does not already have a home. The price of housing, including rent, continues to outpace wages. Folks work harder and fall further behind. How is that right in a country like Canada? Canada's fastest-growing housing type is a tent. Tent cities, a phenomenon not really ever seen in Canada, are now a part of every city and even many towns. People just cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves in Canada today. How desperate must life be, when one lives in a tent in the winter here in Canada? That is why Canadians are so concerned and why they are so angered when they hear of Liberals lining their pockets.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635591">Canadians know that the government is beyond repair and that it is time for an election. However, any election should not and will not eliminate our calls for accountability when it comes to the slush fund. We will get to the truth of the matter. We owe it to Canadians to pursue the facts and to hold the people responsible for the mismanagement accountable. If there is criminality, we owe it to Canadians to pursue charges against the people involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635592">Millions of Canadians are struggling to pay rent, pay their mortgage, put food on their table and put gas in their car. Nonetheless, they go to work every day and they pay their taxes. We need to make sure we treat those hard-working Canadians with utmost respect. Every tax dollar is a missed meal, a missed night out, a new pair of jeans or a visit to a sick relative. Taxes are essential for our society, but they come with a cost to the individual. We need to ensure that if we are going to deprive Canadians of a home of their own, a haircut or a new book, we do it with the utmost necessity and spend the money as if it were our own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635593">I can assure the House that not a single member opposite mismanages their personal finances at a level that the Liberals do when it comes to our money, the money of Canadian taxpayers. I am just astounded that the Liberal MPs opposite continue to defend and support their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">party leader</Affiliation> and the disgusting behaviour of their governance. What will their children and grandchildren think of them when the truth finally gets out? It will get out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635594">The Speaker, of all people, knows how important it is that Canadians have faith in and respect for our institutions. That faith and respect come when people see that our institutions are functioning as intended, rules are being followed and individuals are not personally enriching themselves with tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635595">To restore faith in Parliament, faith in government, we need to ensure that a proper investigation is done, which is possible only when the RCMP has everything it needs to do a proper review. Therefore the Liberal government must release the documents now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635596">Moving forward, there are steps to rebuilding trust and accountability. The Auditor General's report is not just criticism but also a call to action. We need to take the following steps to address the issue. First of all, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> needs to resign. Second, the new minister needs to implement four things. They need to strengthen the oversight mechanism; this is essential. We need clear, robust guidelines for the allocation of funds, with a transparent review process to ensure that projects that meet strict environmental criteria receive support. We also need regular audits by the Auditor General to monitor how funds are being used. We need a commitment to true sustainability; we must focus on the original purpose of the fund's investing in projects that generally contribute to a cleaner, greener future. We need public engagement; the public deserves to know how its money is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635597">In conclusion, the green slush fund was intended to be a catalyst for positive environmental change; instead, it has been a disappointing fiasco. It is imperative that we address the issues head-on and reaffirm our commitment to transparency, accountability and sustainability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635630">Like I said, today is not a good day, and it is because, instead of being able to speak to the great things Conservatives would do for Canadians, we are once again stuck here in the quagmire of an NDP-Liberal scandal. With another NDP-Liberal scandal, I can imagine people flipping the switch and tuning out right now. Canadians have heard this record on repeat for 10 years. Actually, it has been much longer than that. It goes back even further. At this point, Canadians are quite jaded to the graft corruption and outright illegality of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cronies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635631">Before us today is a simple issue: The House asked the government to provide documents related to the green slush fund to the RCMP because we are suspicious that the Liberals have been taking taxpayers' money and giving it to their friends and supporters. The government provided some documents but decided to black out much of the relevant data. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635632">The Speaker's office ruled that the Liberals were wrong and had violated the rules of the House, so now the Liberals would rather gridlock Parliament than provide the blacked out information. There must be some nasty surprises lurking in those documents. I also want to remind everyone in the House that the Liberals could end their filibuster of Parliament by simply releasing the documents, but they seem to want to fight this one to the end. Again, I am curious to know what they are hiding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635633">This is history on repeat to many folks. It certainly is to me. I stand here in the House of Commons as a Conservative member of Parliament, but I must say that I have not always been partisan. Most of my adult life, I did my civic duty, just like most Canadians. I would look at the candidates running for election and then mark my ballot. I would pick my MP based on the leader who I thought would make the best prime minister, the party that had the best policy items and the local candidate who would best represent me in the House. Then I would go home and repeat that process four years later. That was it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635634">Then, the 1990s occurred, and the Liberal government members at that time did what they always did, which was to become arrogant and out of touch. It is so important to understand that Liberals behave a certain way. Just like the prior Liberal government collapsed in a pile of corruption, it appears that the current Liberal government is moving the same way, this time helped by the NDP. Twenty-five years ago, the Liberal corruption was a billion dollars wasted on a long-gun registry that was useless and ineffective; Jean Chrétien using his influence as the then prime minister to ensure that money flowed to a hotel owner in his riding, in a scandal known as Shawinigate; the billion-dollar boondoggle; and the even more staggering sponsorship scandal. These are the Liberal corruption scandals that convinced me that it was time to stop just marking my ballot and to take a keen interest in the workings of our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635635">It appears that here again we have a story of Liberal corruption, but it is important to put it in context. One of the most egregious examples of Liberal mismanagement in our nation's history, the billion-dollar boondoggle, occurred in the 1990s under the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien. It was not a small oversight or an isolated mistake. It was systemic incompetence that cost Canadians over a billion dollars, money that was supposed to be used to create jobs and help hard-working families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635636"> At the heart of that scandal was Human Resources Development Canada. An internal audit revealed that over a billion dollars in grants had been handed out without proper paperwork, oversight or accountability. Grant applications were incomplete or non-existent, and approvals were given based on politics, not on the quality of the application. Essentially, public money was being given out to Liberal insiders and supporters as a reward, the kind of corruption we expect to see in a third-world dictatorship, not in Canada. That was my introduction to the Liberal Party, the first time I really paid attention to politics. Billions of dollars had been funnelled into pet projects, wasted with no oversight and with no one held responsible. Canadians were promised better job opportunities and stronger communities. What did they get? A scandal that reeked of corruption and incompetence, with taxpayers left holding the bag.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635637">Soon after came another dark chapter in our country's history of Liberal corruption, which was the infamous sponsorship scandal, also known as ad scam. This scandal represents one of the clearest examples of why Canadians can never trust the Liberal Party to responsibly handle their hard-earned taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635638">In the early 2000s, an investigation revealed that, under the Chrétien Liberal government, millions of dollars were funnelled into a corrupt scheme under the guise of a national unity program. This sponsorship program, supposedly designed to promote Canadian unity in Quebec, became nothing more than a cash machine for Liberal-friendly ad firms and well-connected insiders. Public money was funnelled through advertising agencies that had close ties to the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635639">These companies received millions for doing next to nothing, and then conveniently donated a portion of that money back to the Liberal Party. This was a government caught red-handed using taxpayers' money to grease the palms of its political friends while Canadians were left paying the bills. Fortunately, Canadians saw through this and elected a Conservative government to clean up the mess. Does this sound familiar?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635640">We know the importance of fiscal responsibility and transparency. That is why we are committed to fixing the damage caused by these corrupt and wasteful practices. Billion-dollar boondoggles and sponsorship scandals are what happens when the Liberals are in charge. There is waste, fraud and scandal. Let me remind the House that this is the same Liberal Party that continues to throw around billions in unchecked spending, all while raising taxes on the very people we are supposed to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635641">Conservative governments believe in fiscal responsibility, transparency and in being careful stewards of the hard-earned tax dollars of Canadians. We will not tolerate waste and mismanagement. It is time to axe the tax, fix the budget and put an end to the reckless spending habits of the Liberal government once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635642">Sometimes we forget the impact the decisions made in the House have on Canadian people. The waste and graft that occurs through the Liberal mismanagement of public dollars impacts people in a very real way. Last week when I was home, I was reminded of this when I met somebody that has been impacted by this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635643">Stan Holcomb, born near Viscount, Saskatchewan, overcame the loss of his left leg to become an exceptional athlete and prosthetist. Raised on a family farm, he thrived in sports, learning to skate and swim with a prosthetic leg. In 1971, Stan joined the Saskatchewan Abilities Council, launching a 43-year career in prosthetics, and began competing in wheelchair sports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635644">He represented Canada in the 1976 Paralympics and was integral in founding the Canadian Amputee Sports Association and Canadian Association for Disabled Skiing. A passionate volunteer, he remains an avid golfer and dedicated sports supporter. A fixture in the Saskatoon community, Stan's dedication to hard work, personal responsibility and traditional values align closely with his Conservative principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635645">Over the years, he has been an advocate for local causes and has remained committed to strengthening his community through volunteer work, youth sports and his unwavering belief in the values that have helped shape his life and career. Stan will be inducted into the Saskatoon Sports Hall of Fame on November 2, and it is no wonder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635646"> Stan's beliefs and values are shared by all Conservatives and many Canadians. It is people like Stan who feel the pain of Liberal corruption. People like Stan end up paying the price of this corruption. When people get frustrated with the corruption, it leads to a change in government, like what happened in 2006 with the election of Stephen Harper's Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635647">The last time Canadians called in the Conservatives to clean up the Liberal mess, a great many things were accomplished. One of the ways Stephen Harper's government cleaned up the last Liberal mess was the Federal Accountability Act, which brought in new anti-corruption laws. We also created the independent office of the Ethics Commissioner and established the lobbyist registry. One of our proudest accomplishments was the creation of the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635648">Unfortunately, the Liberals have managed to find ways around all of these safeguards. It is almost like they have a special department in the Prime Minister's office dedicated to finding ways to skirt the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635649">What is the latest scandal that is paralyzing the House right now? It is the green slush fund scandal. It follows a typical Liberal pattern. The government decides that it needs a way to reward its friends and supporters by funnelling money to them. Then it finds a legitimate program tasked with dispersing vast amounts of money. In this case, it was a program to fund environmental projects. The government then encourages all of its friends to apply on the promise that they will be approved, regardless of the actual value of what is being done, and most do not do much of anything. Then the money flows and, boy, does it flow. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635650">After that, the Liberals get caught. In this case, it was the Auditor General who investigated and ultimately found 400 million dollars of spending that was at risk and hundreds of conflicts of interest. Now we are trying to get Canadians the accountability that they deserve, but the government refuses to provide the documents to the RCMP. Here we are, and I will the remind the House that the government and the NDP-Liberals could end this right now by providing these documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635651">What is the legacy of the NDP-Liberal costly coalition? It takes what is good and wonderful and blows it up. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, when he was simply the leader of the Liberal Party in 2015, ran an election campaign on the promise of blowing up Stephen Harper's legacy of achievement. To his credit, that promise made was a promise kept. It is perhaps the only promise the Prime Minister has ever kept, and it was the one to destroy everything good about Canada. He sure made good on that one, did he not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635652">Is there accountability in government? Not anymore. Are there people going to prison for committing violent crimes? Not anymore. Is the government treating taxpayer dollars with respect? Not anymore. Is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pitting one group of Canadians against another while they fight for table scraps? Yes. Indeed, he does that every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635653">Whatever the NDP-Liberals can do to hurt Canadians and make them lash out at their neighbour, I assure members they will do that. Every single wedge issue they can find, they will use. Integrity, honesty, trust and truthfulness are all foreign concepts to that lot. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635654">How do they fill the void when they have no values? They fill the void with deficits, deceit and drugs. These are the disastrous ideals driving the NDP-Liberal coalition. After nearly a decade of its reckless policies, we are seeing the devastating consequences of the deficits, the deceit and the failure to address the drug crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635655">First, the NDP-Liberals have run up record deficits, driving our national debt to unprecedented levels. Their out-of-control spending has fuelled inflation and made life unaffordable for countless Canadians. From rising grocery bills to soaring mortgage rates, Canadian families are struggling to make ends meet, all while the government continues to pour billions into misguided programs. These deficits are not just numbers on a balance sheet. They represent higher taxes, increased borrowing costs and a future burden on our children and our grandchildren. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635656">The government's deceit has been just as harmful. The NDP-Liberals continue to claim that they are helping Canadians, but the truth is that they are making life harder. Time and again, they have promised transparency and accountability, yet they have consistently misled Canadians. Whether it is their failure to balance a budget or their mishandling of public funds, Canadians have every right to be outraged by the government's dishonesty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635657">We must also talk about the drug crisis. The NDP-Liberal government's approach to drug addiction has failed to keep our communities safe. Its so-called harm reduction polices have done nothing to curb addictions or support recovery. Instead, they have enabled dangerous drug use, leading to more deaths and an increase in crime across our communities. Canadians deserve better. A Conservative government would restore fiscal responsibility, put an end to deceitful policies and tackle the drug crisis, with a focus on recovery, treatment and community safety. It is time for real leadership that puts Canadians first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635658">Before Canadians are able to bring it home with real Conservative leadership, perhaps we need a reminder of why we are here today. Rampant corruption is the defining feature of the NDP-Liberal costly coalition. Let us dive right into these scandals: the so-called green slush fund, the arrive scam, the WE Charity scandal, the SNC-Lavalin affair and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s secretive trip to the Aga Khan's private island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635659">Let us start with the so-called green slush fund. As I said, it was under the guise of tackling climate change that the NDP-Liberal government used a fund that had little to do with real environmental action and more to do with lining the pockets of its well-connected friends. The Liberals funnelled billions of dollars into this fund without proper oversight or accountability. The real purpose was to have a way to funnel taxpayer dollars to their friends and allies. This misuse of taxpayer money is a betrayal of trust, particularly when Canadians are facing high inflation, rising energy costs and unaffordable housing. This is not in dispute. The Liberals themselves closed the whole thing down once the Auditor General shone a light on their corruption and deceit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635660">Canadians deserve better. They deserve a government that is honest, transparent and focused on real solutions, not on political gains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635661">Next, we have the ArriveCAN debacle, better known as the arrive scam. The government spent $54 million on an app that should have cost a fraction of that amount. When questioned, the Liberals could not even explain where the money went. ArriveCAN was supposed to make border entry smoother during the pandemic but instead it turned into a costly, unnecessary fiasco. Not only was the app riddled with glitches, causing confusion and chaos for travellers, but it also became clear that most of the money spent went to well-connected contractors rather than to the development of the app itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635662">How did an app like ArriveCAN, which was later deemed unnecessary, cost $54 million? While Canadians struggled during the pandemic, the NDP-Liberal government was busy wasting millions on a failed app. Instead of owning up to its mistakes, it tried to shift the blame and avoid accountability. This is not leadership. This is corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635663">We then have the infamous WE Charity scandal. In 2020, the Liberal government handed nearly a billion-dollar contract to the WE Charity, an organization with close ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. This was supposed to be a program to help students during the pandemic, but it quickly unravelled when it became clear that this was yet another example of the Prime Minister using his office to benefit those close to him.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635664">Multiple members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family, including his wife and brother, received payments from WE Charity, which raised serious questions about conflicts of interest. This is a clear violation of ethical standards, but instead of coming clear, the Prime Minister and his cabinet doubled down, refusing to take responsibility for their actions. The WE Charity scandal not only wasted taxpayer money, but also showed the extent to which the government is willing to go to enrich its friends and allies. The Ethics Commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke conflict of interest rules again, and once again there were no real consequences. Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635665">Next up is the SNC-Lavalin affair, a scandal that shook the foundations of our democracy. In 2019, it came to light that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his inner circle attempted to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm accused of bribery and corruption. When then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould refused to bend to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s will, he retaliated by removing her from her role, demonstrating that the government prioritizes political favours over principles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635666">This is a direct attack on the rule of law in Canada. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government were willing to bend the rules, pressure the former attorney general and undermine the justice system, all to protect a corporation with deep political connections. This scandal was not just about SNC-Lavalin. It was about the lengths to which the Liberals would go to protect their own interests. It showed a complete disregard for the rule of law and an alarming willingness to interfere in the justice system for political gain. This is corruption at the highest levels, and Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635667">Finally, let us talk about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s secretive trip. In 2017, it was revealed that the Prime Minister accepted a lavish vacation on the private island of the Aga Khan, a billionaire whose foundation receives millions in funding from the Canadian government. This was a blatant conflict of interest, and the Ethics Commissioner ruled that the Prime Minister had violated the Conflict of Interest Act. Despite this, there were no real consequences, and the Prime Minister brushed off the scandal as a misunderstanding. However, make no mistake: This was no simple misunderstanding. It was yet another example of the Prime Minister using his position of power for personal gain while ignoring the ethical standards that should guide all public officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635668">Canadians expect their leaders to lead by example, to be transparent and to put the interests of the country ahead of their own. However, time and again, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has shown that he is more interested in helping his friends, bending the rules and avoiding accountability. Canadians are tired of the corruption, the scandals and the excuses. All of these scandals show a pattern of deceit, mismanagement and ethical violations from the NDP-Liberal government. It has betrayed the trust of Canadians and has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted to govern with integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635669">A Conservative government will put an end to this corruption. It will restore accountability, transparency and ethical leadership to Ottawa. Canadians deserve a government that works for them, not one that is mired in scandal and focused on enriching its friends. It is time to clean up the mess, restore integrity and bring real leadership back to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635670">The time for excuses and corruption is over. Canadians are tired of a government that puts political insiders ahead of hard-working families. We need real leadership, not more scandals, waste and deceit. That is why we must hold a carbon tax election. We need an election to axe the carbon tax, which drives up the cost of living, making gas, groceries and heating unaffordable for millions of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635671">We need to build homes, not bureaucracy. Families are struggling to find affordable housing, and the NDP-Liberal government's policies have only made it worse. A Conservative government will fix this by empowering builders, cutting red tape and ensuring more homes are built faster to meet the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635672">We must also fix the budget. Nine years of reckless Liberal spending, like the green slush fund, have driven up inflation, and Canadians are paying the price, with higher interest rates, less purchasing power and ballooning national debt. A Conservative government will restore fiscal responsibility, balance the budget and bring down inflation to help all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635673">We need to stop the crime that is plaguing our communities. Under the NDP-Liberal government, crime rates are rising, and its soft-on-crime approach has failed. A Conservative government will restore safety and order and bring order to our streets by enforcing tougher penalties and supporting law enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635674">The next election will be about restoring common sense in government. It will be about bringing home lower taxes, affordable homes, fiscal responsibility and safe streets. It is time to end the corruption and bring home a government that works for the people. Let us bring it home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635678">I will play along a bit. Last week, we heard there were names of parliamentarians from different parties, from the Liberal Party and from wherever else supposedly, but we did not hear the names.

              <ParaText id="8635680"> Mr. Speaker, we are talking today about a privilege motion on the government's refusal to release documents as ordered by Parliament. I want to thank my colleague for mentioning some of the scandals that the government is mired in right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635681">Let us not overlook ArriveCAN. I note that the government operations committee, the mighty OGGO, unanimously demanded documents from the government on the ArriveCAN scandal. In the production order, the committee sent for, in an unredacted format, the list of contractors and subcontractors and so on. Internal results released on the ATIP request to the government said to apply the spirit of the ATIP Act and provide any redactions that should be made. The government said that this was not an ATIP request, but there was some information that it did not want made public. It also said that if documents are redacted too much, it is recommended that those documents not be released at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635682">This is another example of the government refusing an order to produce documents, this time to a committee, covering up the ArriveCAN scandal.

              <ParaText id="8635684">I thought it was interesting that the internal email thread basically said that if the Liberals released this information, it could be really bad for them, so they tried hard not to do it. I am sure that email thread has happened on many occasions, including this one. There are many examples. I have seen others in other parts of my work, in immigration and elsewhere, where tremendously important pieces of information that have been asked for have not been responded to, or documents have been very liberally blacked out to hide information that would implicate the government or members of the government in bad things, including potentially criminal things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635685">We see this over and over again. It is a practice of the government.

              <Affiliation DbId="278361" Type="2">Mrs. Cathay Wagantall (Yorkton—Melville, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8635701"> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the SDTC scandal. The organization had a key mandate. It was federally funded, non-profit and approved to disburse over $100 million in funds annually to clean-technology companies. Sustainable Development Technology Canada was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies that promote sustainable development. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635702">It was to be an arm's-length, not-for-profit organization, created to support projects that developed and demonstrated new technologies addressing issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil. Clearly, it must have functioned quite well until around 2017-18, when the government changed hands and it fell under the responsibility of our Liberal government; actually, the Liberal government. I have trouble saying “our” because I do not feel it is representing me or my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635703">In 2018, former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains expressed concerns regarding the Harper-era chair of SDTC, Jim Balsillie, given his public criticism of government privacy legislation. The minister's office expressed its discomfort about Mr. Balsillie's comments to the CEO of SDTC, and Mr. Bains requested that the chair stop criticizing government legislation. At that point, the minister proposed two alternative chairs to the CEO of SDTC as replacements, in a phone call.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635704"> One of the candidates proposed was Annette Verschuren, an entrepreneur who was receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies. The minister, the PMO and the PCO were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair and were told that, up until that point, the fund had never had a chair with interests in companies receiving funding from SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635705"> It sounds like it was run well with proper oversight. However, in June 2019, former minister Bains decided to proceed with the appointment of Ms. Verschuren despite repeated warnings expressed at his office. The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by board members. Board members went on to award SDTC funding to companies they held stock or positions in. Former minister Bains went on to appoint two other controversial board members who engaged in unethical behaviour, in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act, by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635706">This is beyond the pale for Canadians. They are at the point where they wonder if there is anything the current government does that does not serve itself or those who are part of its larger group. ISED officials witnessed 186 conflicts at the board, but they did not intervene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635707">In January 2021, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278162" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation> became the new Minister of Industry, replacing Navdeep Bains after his decision not to run for re-election. Mr. Bains, I guess, felt that would be a wise decision on his part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635708"> In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices that were taking place. The Privy Council was briefed by the whistle-blowers about the allegations shortly after, and it commissioned two independent reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635709"> In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> agreed, finally, to suspend SDTC funding. Things were a mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635710">In November 2023, the Auditor General announced an audit, and in June 2024, the Auditor General's report was released, finding severe government failures. The Auditor General and Ethics Commissioner initiated these separate investigations after whistle-blowers came forward with allegations of financial mismanagement at the fund. I have to say, it is an amazing thing when people are willing to put their reputations, their lives and their futures on the line because they see something like this taking place within the government. I applaud them for making that decision and for moving forward with that.</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It should never have taken two years for the issues to reach this point. What should have been a straightforward process turned into a bureaucratic nightmare that allowed SDTC to continue wasting millions of [taxpayer] dollars and abusing countless employees over the last year.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635724">That really hit me, of course, the wasting of Canadian taxpayer dollars, especially when it is related to supposedly doing things that would improve our environment. The government cannot get off its need to tax Canadians with the carbon tax because of the work that needs to be done to make sure our country and our world are sustainable for the next generations. In the meantime, it is taking those exact dollars set aside for green technologies and improvements and giving them quietly to companies that have ulterior motives for that money and no intention of using it for supposed environmental processes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635725">When Canadians who are paying that carbon tax are not getting back what they have put into it, and are facing higher costs for fuel, food, housing and everything because of the added down-the-line costs of that carbon tax, we know where it is leading Canadians. We know how desperate they are in wanting a new future for Canada, which, of course, will come when the Conservative Party of Canada has the incredible honour of forming government soon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635726">On the second part, the “abusing [of] countless employees over the last year”, the government talks about how much it appreciates the people behind the scenes, and the high quality of people who serve the government. Here we have an individual talking about how it abused countless employees. This speaks to a government that is not a servant but rather a master, determining that what it wants will happen. It is the government's way or the highway and who is in the way does not matter; it is willing to throw them under the bus.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635727">There are so many violations here of Canadians' trust. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278683" Type="2">Saskatoon West</Affiliation> spoke of many other issues the government has been part of, all the way back to the ad scam and up to the WE challenge. There are just so many. I have one myself that I cannot help but recall, which really hit me as a new member of Parliament when I had the opportunity to speak for the first time to an issue in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635728"> It was a bill brought forward by the federal government to be discussed. It was actually the first debate I participated in that sought to remove the government's accountability to the House. It was in regard to an environmental framework, and the bill sought to give sweeping power to the minister and accountability to an advisory board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635729">I was somewhat concerned about this. I had not heard a lot about this approach, so I asked the individual who had spoken, the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country, about this board: what it was supposed to look like, how it would function, how many people would be on it, where they would come from, what their qualifications and credentials would be, what their mandate would be and all of these types of questions. We were at the beginning of discussing the potential of this bill and wanting to give good feedback on what we thought was appropriate or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635730">That member stood up and immediately was so pleased to say that the board had already been chosen. We were in the first hours of debate, and the deal was done. This gives just a bit of an example of how the government really does not care about the elected people representing this country and how they are to function within the responsibilities of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635731">As I said, so many violations have been discussed throughout the day, in addition to the green slush fund, that I cannot help but notice how much Canadians' trust in this particular NDP-Liberal coalition, and in government in general and many of our institutions, is waning. Canadians are very discouraged because they see these ethical violations taking place over and over again on that side of the floor, yet the government has no sense of having to apologize or to change its behaviour on behalf of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635732">Abusing employees is something else. The Liberals enabled the SDTC to give funds to those who should not have received those funds. I cannot help but think it is a very good thing we made the decision to request that these papers get to the RCMP so that criminality can be explored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635733">Then there is the question of financial management. People say we can give the benefit of the doubt the first time we hear of an error. I believe the new <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> even said, “As soon as we heard, we acted.” Well, two years later, it is the result of whistle-blowers that we are here dealing with this today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635734">Are the Liberals not capable of running the government in a respectful, transparent way that makes proper use of Canadian tax dollars? Are they not capable, or are they just indifferent? Here the Liberals are, in places of power, and not truly giving proper oversight to the departments they are responsible for. That speaks not only to indifference but to the potential for being incapable of doing their job and of ensuring their departments are being run properly.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8635735"> Then there is the third thing, and I think this is the one that is now so obvious to Canadians, which is that of a very self-serving agenda. That it is not about Canadians and is not about serving Canadians, but is about Liberals serving themselves and their friends and being focused on political gain at all costs rather than doing the right thing for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635736">The Auditor General's report showed that over $400 million, over the five-year audit period, had been awarded to projects that either should not have been eligible or was awarded to projects in which the board members were conflicted. A preschooler could understand the importance of doing this properly. If the Liberal government knew these are the things that were expected in these roles, it would see very clearly that this did not match that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635737">On the part about speaking about indifference and self-serving, I want to follow it up with a quote I have used before that speaks to the very essence of what we are hearing in this circumstance and in so many other conflicts by the government, which is, “It's hard not to feel disappointed in your government when every day there is a new scandal.” These are the words of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as the member for Papineau, when he was in opposition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635738">Liberals have said a lot that we Conservatives cannot blame them because we did the same thing. This is not true. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635741">Mr. Speaker, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s words absolutely ring true today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635742">After nine years of scandal, corruption and Liberal entitlement, the business of the House has been put on hold to discuss this scandal of monumental proportions and to request and demand what should be done by the government, which is to simply release those documents, as the government has been required to do by this place by the vote of the membership of the House, who have the right to demand those documents be presented unredacted. The documents should not be presented in piecemeal, but be presented as required. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635743">As the Speaker of the House indicated, the government was not doing that. Those documents need to be shared and they need to be provided to the RCMP so that the proper work can be done, work that respects Canadians' intelligence, their hearts and their love for this country, as well as their tax dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635744">I want to comment on a couple more things. The Auditor General gave SDTC a clean bill of health in 2017. What does that say? It was only after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked Liberal board members were appointed that this fund began voting itself absurd amounts of taxpayer dollars, and it is not arm's length from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635745">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> recommended board appointments, and ISED had senior department officials sitting in on every meeting monitoring the activities of the board and doing nothing about it. It is unbelievable that a senior department official would say nothing while witnessing how many millions of dollars were funnelled to companies in which board members held conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635746">I will end with one more quote. Basically, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself, in 2016, was saying how proud he was to be the Prime Minister, which meant first servant of Canadians. However, he also made the point of saying that Canada was “the first postnational state”, which to me was a very serious comment that basically indicated he was not concerned about Canada and what it is. He was not concerned about its sovereignty, but it was a post-national state that he was prepared to run into the ground for his own ideological purposes. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8635780"> In my 18-plus years as a parliamentarian in the House, I have understood that breaches of privilege of parliamentarians is a serious matter, however, it seems that the current Liberal government does not share that same understanding.

              <ParaText id="8635782"> In late 2018, the former industry minister expressed concerns regarding the chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, given that he had been publicly criticizing government legislation at the time. The then minister's office requested that the chair stop criticizing his government's legislation. The minister at the time, the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office were warned of the risks associated with their desire to replace the chair with a proposed candidate who was receiving Sustainable Development Technology Canada funding through one of their companies, which was a clear conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635783"> In June 2019, the minister decided to proceed with the appointment of the conflicted chair, despite repeated warnings expressed to the minister's office. The new chair created an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed by board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635784"> Board members then went on to award Sustainable Development Technology Canada funding to companies in which they themselves held stock or high-level positions within the companies that received the funding. Two additional appointed and controversial board members engaged in unethical behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada officials witnessed 186 conflicts at the board but did not intervene. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635785">In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. The Privy Council was briefed by the whistle-blowers about the allegations shortly after the commission's two independent reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635786"> In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public and the minister agreed to suspend Sustainable Development Technology Canada funding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635787">In November 2023, the Auditor General announced an audit of Sustainable Development Technology Canada. In June 2024, the Auditor General's report was released finding severe governance failures at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, and that brings us to where we are today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635788">On June 10, the House adopted a motion calling for the production of various documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada to be turned over to the RCMP for review. It was passed by a majority of members in the House.</ParaText>

These projects had nothing to do with the mandate of the organization. There was $334 million given to projects in which board members had conflicts of interest. In these cases, just a handful of board members managed to wind up in 186 conflicts of interest. We cannot make this stuff up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635817">There was $58 million given to projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were met. In other words, where there were matching funds expected, there was no requirement for the matching funding to come, so we would just send out another $60 million. Normally we would do due diligence and make sure that, before we released any taxpayers' funds, the matching funding would come. Who cares?

What a surprise it is that, even in the context of the debate in this place, the Liberal government is withholding information from Canadian taxpayers.

The Auditor General noted that $8 billion had been given away to companies, many of which do not even qualify. Looking at it, I saw that one of the companies that received government funding is a company called Geely. It received $15 million in subsidies. Geely is a Chinese-owned EV company, which is now, of course, subject to a 100% tariff on its cars.</ParaText>

It is not about good governance or making responsible decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8635826">We see what the government has been about the whole time. Finally, after nine years, Canadians see it. The only way to find a path forward is to have these documents produced to the House and to the RCMP. If that is not going to happen, then the people of Canada should have their say in an election to decide whether they want to continue allowing the government to spend the way it spends and commit the corruption that it commits. I hope that a Conservative government will follow, restoring some sense of accountability and good governance to this once-proud country.</ParaText>

Scientific evidence links these substances to severe health risks, including cancer, putting firefighters, who already face hazardous conditions, at greater risk. Research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the body, leading to serious health issues. Alarmingly, firefighters face a higher cancer risk than the general population.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636162">A week ago, the RCMP revealed chilling and disturbing information that Indian agents were engaged by Indian government diplomats in a campaign of terror in Canadian communities. This campaign included hiring and directing gang members to shoot at Canadian homes, to shoot at Canadian businesses, to extort Canadian businesses and to engage in car thefts and other criminal activities. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636164"> Canadians have been killed on Canadian soil. Bullets have flown in Canadian communities. Businesses and business owners have been threatened. People have been killed. People have been extorted. This is something that makes all Canadians less safe. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8636169">Mr. Speaker, Canadians from coast to coast work hard every day. They wake up early, put in long hours and make sacrifices to provide for their families. They play by the rules, pay their taxes and trust that their government is looking out for them. They expect honesty, integrity and accountability from the people who hold public office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636170">However, over the past nine years, that trust has been shaken. There is a growing sense that something is not right in Ottawa, that the NDP-Liberal government is more focused on helping itself and its friends than on serving the people who put them in office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636171"> In my travels across Yellowhead, I have spoken with farmers, small business owners, parents and seniors, and they are worried. They are seeing that their hard-earned tax dollars disappear into programs and projects that do not benefit them or their communities. They are struggling with rising costs, inadequate services and a lack of support from the people in government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636172"> They are asking me, “What is happening in Ottawa? Who is looking out for us?” They read headlines about scandals involving millions, even billions, of dollars. They see reports of funds mismanaged, conflicts of interest ignored and insiders getting ahead while hard-working Canadians fall behind. They wonder why their needs are overlooked while well-connected Liberals seem to have direct access to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636173"> The choices the NDP-Liberal government has been making have real consequences for everyday Canadians, choices that favour insiders and special interests over the needs of regular people. While families are struggling to make ends meet, the government is spending recklessly, often without proper oversight or accountability. Communities are facing challenges like underfunded services, lack of infrastructure and insufficient support for those who need it most, yet instead of addressing these issues, the government seems preoccupied with helping its friends and maintaining its own power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636174"> It is time to take a hard look at where our money is going and who is benefiting. It is time to ask whether this is the kind of leadership Canadians deserve. At the end of the day, it is about fairness. It is about doing what's right. It is about ensuring that Canada remains a place where everyone has a fair shot and where our leaders are held to the highest standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636175"> Canadians deserve a government that is transparent and accountable, a government that puts the interests of its citizens, not the interests of a select few, first. As representatives elected by the people, we have the duty to hold the government to account, to shine a light on misconduct and to demand better. We owe it to our constituents to fight for their interests, to be their voice in Ottawa and to work tirelessly to restore their faith in our institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636176"> Today I want to address these concerns. I want to talk about pressing issues affecting Canadians, the mismanagement and misplaced priorities and the lack of accountability, because Canadians deserve answers. They deserve to know that someone is standing up for them, challenging the status quo and working to bring about the change that is so desperately needed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636177">Let us turn our attention to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, known as SDTC. This organization was established to foster innovation and to support sustainable technology, noble goals that Canadians can stand behind. However, under the Liberal government, SDTC became something far different. It is now being referred to as the green slush fund, for a good reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636178">Reports have surfaced revealing that over $300 million of taxpayers' money was involved in 180 cases of clear conflicts of interest with SDTC. That is $300 million that could have been invested in communities, health care, education or infrastructure. Instead it was funnelled into ventures in which decision-makers had personal stakes. This is not just a minor oversight; it is a blatant misuse of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636179"> What is more troubling is that Liberal ministers were aware of the conflicts and did nothing to stop them. They allowed the mismanagement to continue unchecked. A senior civil servant even described the situation as “outright incompetence”, pointing out that 123 million dollars' worth of contracts were awarded inappropriately. The Auditor General confirmed that the government's oversight was severely lacking, stating that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> did not sufficiently monitor the contracts being handed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636180">This pattern of negligence and favouritism raises serious questions about whom the government is really serving. While Canadians are forced to make hard choices every day to make ends meet, the Liberals seem more interested in enriching their insiders and friends. Imagine what $300 million could have done for our country. It could have funded sustainable projects that genuinely benefited Canadians, created jobs or supported small businesses struggling in these tough times. Instead it was used to line the pockets of a select few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636181">The green slush fund is not an isolated incident; it is a symptom of a larger problem, a government that has lost touch with the people it is supposed to represent. Canadians are losing faith because they see a lack of integrity and accountability at the highest levels. We need to ask ourselves whether this is acceptable. Should we stand by while public funds are misused and trust is eroded? The answer is a resounding no. It is time for transparency, time for accountability and time for a government that puts Canadians, not the interests of Liberal insiders, first. The green slush fund is a stark reminder that we need change, a change that will restore integrity and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used responsibly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636182">Canadians have witnessed a series of scandals that reveal a constant disregard for ethics, transparency and accountability. Consider the WE Charity affair. The government attempted to hand over nearly $1 billion to an organization with close personal ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. Members of his own family received significant sums in speaking fees from WE Charity. Despite this clear conflict of interest, the Liberals moved forward without proper oversight or transparency. It was only after public outrage and media scrutiny that they reversed course. This was not an innocent mistake; it was a deliberate attempt to channel public funds to people within their inner circle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636183">Then there is the SNC-Lavalin scandal. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office was accused of pressuring the Attorney General to interfere in a criminal prosecution of a well-connected corporation. This led to the resignation of high-ranking officials who refused to compromise their principles. It exposed a government willing to undermine the rule of law to protect their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636184">There is also the millions of dollars awarded in contracts to McKinsey without proper transparency or competitive bidding. At a time when Canadian businesses were struggling and could have benefited from government contracts, the Liberals chose to funnel money to a foreign firm with ties to their own party. This raises serious questions about their commitment to supporting Canadian enterprises and maintaining fair procurement practices.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636185">These incidents are not isolated; they form a clear pattern of behaviour. The Liberals have repeatedly placed the interests of their friends and insiders above those of hard-working Canadians. This series of scandals reveals a government consistently sidetracked by its own ethical failings. Instead of dedicating its full attention to the pressing issues facing our nation, it is repeatedly caught up in controversies of its own making. This not only hampers its ability to govern effectively but also diverts valuable time and resources away from addressing the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636186">Canadians deserve leadership that is focused on and unwavering in its commitment to serve the public good. When the government's attention is consumed by managing scandals, then critical issues like health care, economic recovery and national security do not receive the full attention they require. This lack of dedicated focus hinders our progress as a nation and leaves many people feeling neglected and unheard. This is not just about politics; it is about principle. Canadians expect and deserve a government that operates with integrity, is transparent in its actions and is accountable to the people it serves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636187">The ongoing pattern of Liberal misconduct cannot be ignored or brushed aside. It is our duty to hold the Liberals accountable and to demand better on behalf of all Canadians. When government funds are mismanaged or siphoned off to benefit a select few, it is not just a matter of accounting; it is a direct hit to Canadians from all walks of life. The consequences of the Liberal government's actions are felt in every corner of our country, affecting families, workers and communities that rely on responsible governance to meet their needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636188">Consider the challenges Canadians are facing right now. The cost of living is rising, with families struggling to afford basic necessities like groceries, housing and child care. Small businesses, the backbone of our economy, are fighting to keep their doors open amidst economic uncertainty. Our health care system is under strain, with long wait times and limited resources impacting the well-being of our citizens. When hundreds of millions of dollars are misallocated or lost to scandals like the green slush fund, that is money that is not available to address these pressing issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636189">Imagine what could be achieved if these funds were managed wisely and directed toward initiatives that empower Canadians. We could implement policies to make housing more affordable, allowing families currently priced out of the market to purchase their own home and build a stable future. In health care, we could enhance patient care and reduce wait times by cutting red tape, improving efficiency and encouraging innovation within the system. By supporting educational choices and opportunities, we could equip our children with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive world. Investing strategically in essential infrastructure, like repairing aging roads and bridges and improving connectivity in rural areas, would bolster our economy and create jobs, all while ensuring responsible use of taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636190">These are not complicated ideas. They are real needs that, if met, would significantly improve the quality of life for Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636191">Moreover, the mismanagement of funds undermines the trust that citizens have in their government. When people see their hard-earned tax dollars being misused, it leads to frustration and disengagement. They begin to question whether their sacrifices are valued and whether their voices are heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636192">Seniors on fixed income worry about their pensions and access to health care. Parents wonder whether their children will have the opportunities they had. Young people question whether they can afford to start a family or buy a home. These are the everyday concerns that should be at the forefront of government priorities. Instead we are witnessing a pattern where the interests of Liberal insiders take precedence. This is not just unfair; it is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636193"> Canadians deserve a government that puts their needs first. They deserve transparency, accountability and assurance that public funds are being used to benefit the many, not the few. It is time to refocus on issues that matter most to Canadians: affordability, access to quality services and opportunities for a better future. We must commit to responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, ensuring that every cent is directed toward making a positive difference in people's lives. That is the standard Canadians expect and the standard they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636194">I want to take a moment to highlight a heartbreaking event that has deeply affected my community: the devastating wildfire in Jasper. This tragedy was not only the result of natural forces, but was made worse by government inaction and mismanagement, showing how misallocation of resources can have dire consequences. For years, experts warned about the risk of a catastrophic wildfire due to dead wood buildup and pine beetle infestation. Forestry professionals, local officials and residents urged the government to take proactive measures by implementing proper forest management and investing in prevention, yet these pleas were ignored as the Liberal government prioritized political optics over practical action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636195">However, the mismanagement did not end there. After the wildfire wreaked havoc, destroying a third of Jasper, displacing thousands and claiming the life of a brave firefighter, the government's response has been lacking. Recovery efforts have been slow and underfunded, leaving families without homes and businesses struggling to rebuild. Communities feel abandoned by those meant to serve them. Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of dollars were funnelled into scandals like the green slush fund and over $300 million was lost to conflicts of interest and mismanagement, funds that could have gone toward rebuilding Jasper, providing relief to affected families and restoring vital infrastructure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636196">It is disheartening that while our community was in crisis, resources that could have offered relief were squandered elsewhere. That is not about politicizing this tragedy. It is about misplaced priorities, a government more focused on its own interests than the urgent needs of its citizens. The people of Jasper are resilient, but should not have to face these challenges alone. They deserve a government that stands with them, providing the support needed to rebuild and recover. Transparency and accountability in allocating public funds are essential, especially when those funds could alleviate suffering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636197">This tragedy highlights the tangible cost of corruption and negligence, a stark reminder that decisions made in Ottawa have real consequences for communities. We must hold those responsible accountable and ensure that future funds are directed toward protecting and supporting Canadians, not lost to mismanagement. The people of Jasper and all Canadians deserve better. They deserve leadership that prioritizes their well-being and invests in their future. It is time to learn from this tragedy, reassess our priorities and commit to responsible government that serves the interests of all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636198">Canadians deserve a government that works for them, a government that is transparent, accountable and committed to serving the best interests of all its citizens. It is clear that the current direction is not meeting those expectations. We need to restore trust in our institutions and ensure that public funds are managed responsibly. That means ending the culture of mismanagement and entitlement. It means implementing proper oversight, enforcing ethical standards and holding those in power accountable for their actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636199">Conservatives are committed to putting Canadians first. We will prioritize the needs of everyday people and not insiders with special interests. We will invest in our communities, support small businesses and ensure that essential services are adequately funded.

              <ParaText id="8636229"> Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise in this House to speak to the important issues of the day. However, in this case, there is a sad irony in that opposition members are not using that privilege to promote or oppose legislation for the betterment of Canadians, but rather are being forced to defend those privileges on behalf of the Canadians we represent and against the stonewalling government across the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636230">Last week, the editorial board of The Globe and Mail wrote, “The Liberals' naked disdain for Parliament [and by extension Canadians] is showing”. The Liberal government has such a profound disrespect for Canadians and for the long-held traditions of this place that it is choosing to defy not only the opposition, but the Speaker and, worst of all, Canadians themselves, who want and deserve to know the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636231"> There is so much rot at the core of the government. The default toward secrecy and cover-ups, the antipathy toward law enforcement and the pattern of profound disrespect toward the people of Canada are all ingrained traits of the government and the failed and, as we can only be led to believe, corrupt <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has been the catalyst for a culture of cronyism, corruption and cover-ups. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636232">This is nothing new. We are here today, as we have been for the last two weeks, debating the undebatable. The Auditor General has found that Sustainable Development Technology Canada appointed Liberals to run the program, who turned around and gave $400 million of taxpayers' money, the Canadian people's money, to their own companies. The Auditor General found a whopping 186 separate conflicts of interest, and rather than comply with the Speaker's ruling to produce documents related to the massive scam, the Liberals are choosing to hold up the business of the House indefinitely as they scramble to once again cover up their tracks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636233">This is not the first time the government has been accused of unethical behaviour. I know it is hard to believe, but it is true, and this is not the first time that government members have defied Parliament, defied the Speaker and even stonewalled the police in an attempt to cover up their sordid deeds. In fact, as I was preparing for this speech, when I searching in my emails and typed in the keywords “refusal to hand over documents”, what popped up was not about SDTC, which we are debating today, but another incident from back in 2021, when the government allowed Chinese spies, Beijing-sponsored scientists with ties to the Chinese military and bioweapons program, to access our top clearance national microbiology lab in Winnipeg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636234">The lead scientist, Dr. Qiu, at the same time as she was working in our top security level 4 lab, was flying back and forth to China for meetings in Beijing and helping Beijing set up its very own level 4 lab in Wuhan. At the time, the former Speaker ruled the government, his own party, to have violated parliamentary privilege and to be in contempt of Parliament when the Liberals refused to produce the documents related to this improper transfer of deadly Ebola and henipavirus samples from Winnipeg to Wuhan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636235">We still do not know how serious a leak that was because this House, through the Speaker's predecessor, ordered the government to hand over the documents and the government refused. The Liberals sought to cover up the truth of what happened, not on the grounds of national security but for political reasons, because they were trying to protect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who had failed so spectacularly to keep Canadians safe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636236">It is the same <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who refused to hand over documents to the RCMP in yet another case. Back in 2019, it came to light that the Prime Minister had pressured and bullied the former attorney general of Canada to give SNC-Lavalin, which was ironically also facing corruption charges, a sweetheart deal to drop the charges so as not to negatively affect the Liberals' political fortunes in Quebec. She refused and he fired her, kicked her out of cabinet and eventually out of the Liberal Party. Clearly, there is no place for truth-telling and standing on principle in today's Liberal Party, especially when it comes to standing up to the Prime Minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636237">The worst part of that affair is that all of the members on the other side who were there, all of the hon. ministers, all backed the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. In fact, at the time, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, then the minister of tourism, called what Jody Wilson-Raybould had done “fundamentally wrong”. She was telling the truth. How morally backwards does one need to be to look at that situation and say that the former attorney general of Canada, who upheld the law, should be ashamed? The foreign affairs minister has been touted as a future leader of the Liberal Party. She certainly seems to fit into the mould. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636238">Speaking of backwards, members may recall that that same week, we had in this House about 50 young women as part of a delegation from Daughters of the Vote, a youth leadership movement, and they turned their backs to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in protest during his speech to the delegation. Jody Wilson-Raybould and the one woman in cabinet who had the courage of her convictions and the moral clarity to support her, Dr. Jane Philpott, were treated shamefully by their colleagues in the current corrupt government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636239">To bring it back to the point about the documents we are discussing today, the government was ordered to hand over the documents and refused. In fact, so desperate was it to cover up the misdeeds of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that it not only withheld documents from the House, but withheld documents from the Ethics Commissioner. In his 2019 report, Commissioner Mario Dion wrote, “I was unable to fully discharge [my] investigatory duties”. As we learned, later that year it also refused to turn over documents to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636240">Documents released by Democracy Watch, via an access to information request, show that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office refused to hand over documents to the RCMP when investigating the Prime Minister. I am really not sure what is worse here, the fact that the Prime Minister, who so clearly believes he is above the law, stonewalled the RCMP got away with it or the fact that the RCMP, under disastrous former commissioner Brenda Lucki, let him get away with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636241"> Subsection 139(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada states that it is a criminal offence “to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice”. In attempting to get the then attorney general to change her mind by attempting to convince her, the highest-ranking prosecutor in the land, to drop a criminal case for political reasons, it certainly appears that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his staff were trying to obstruct justice. In fact, if we look at the RCMP report, we can basically paraphrase it as follows: The RCMP did not look at all the evidence because it could not get it because the government would not give it up, but it was probably just as well. That is shocking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636242">Then we have the ArriveCAN app scam, with an app that should have cost $80,000 ballooning to $60 million. The RCMP again opened criminal investigations into the actions of the Liberal government, 13 separate investigations at last count. There were allegations of identity theft, fraudulent and forged resumes, contractual theft, fraudulent billing, price-fixing and collusion, all with senior bureaucrats in and appointed by the government. </ParaText>

If we do the math, that is $100 million over and above a normal profit. There was another $422,000 from the Department of Industry, the same department at the heart of the green slush fund.

We know it has to be bad for the Liberals when the radical ideologues and propagandists at the CBC are willing to bite the hand that feeds them, generously feeds them in the case of the current government, and criticize the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636249">On December 7, 2020, an aptly named series called “The Big Spend” started. It stated the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s government “won't say who got billions of dollars in aid” and that “While some payments have been revealed, the destination of billions of dollars in aid remains secret.” Then it goes on to note, with some irony, that the Prime Minister ran on a promise of openness and transparency, a promise that he has broken, like so many. Sunny ways and sunshine are the best medication, are they not?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636250">It used to be blackface. Now it is black ink on the scores of documents that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seeks to hide from Parliament, from the authorities and from Canadians. Every time the Liberals and their cronies get caught breaking the rules, they cover it up and refuse to tell Canadians the truth. Here we go again with another scandal, more Liberal cronyism and corruption, another cover-up, more blacked-out documents and more stonewalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636251">What happened? The Liberals created a $1-billion slush fund for funding so-called green technology projects and programs. They appointed Liberal insiders to run the program, but instead of helping Canadians, we know they were busy helping themselves. Just as with ArriveCAN and their crony COVID spending, the Liberals were helping Liberals get rich off the backs of struggling Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636252">Just as with ArriveCAN and SNC-Lavalin, the RCMP is investigating corruption in the government. True to form, as with previous investigations, the Liberals are blocking the RCMP from getting the documents it needs to determine who in the government broke the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636253">Like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and five of his ministers before, the Liberals' hand-picked chair of the Liberals' billion-dollar green slush fund, Annette Verschuren, broke the law. Canada's Ethics Commissioner has ruled that she violated subsection 6(1) and section 21 of the Conflict of Interest Act, finding that her actions “furthered her private interests”. To make matters worse, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> was warned of Verschuren's glaring conflict of interest but allowed her to keep her position until she was forced to resign. She only did this after being exposed for wasting Canadian taxpayers' dollars on projects that benefited her financially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636254">On top of this, the Auditor General found that over $330 million in taxpayer money was paid out in 186 cases where there was a conflict of interest, with Liberal-appointed directors funnelling money to companies they owned, including Verschuren's. There was $59 million given to ineligible projects that never should have been awarded any money at all. This is no small scandal. This is a big deal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636255">When this came to light, the Conservatives took action. Our job is to hold the government accountable, and that is what we are seeking to do with this privilege motion and this debate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636256"> Back in June, all parties, with the exception of the Liberals, voted in favour of a motion requiring the government to produce documents related to the mass corruption at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It should be noted that the Liberals do not deny any of these allegations, and that makes this so much worse. It actually admits to the wrongdoing, but it is still engaging in a cover-up. The House, the majority of the members of Parliament, who are the people's democratically elected representatives, demanded on behalf of Canadians that these documents be turned over. Rather than comply, the government handed over redacted documents, or in some cases, refused to produce documents entirely. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636257">The rules of parliamentary privilege are clear: The House has the authority, with its very broad powers, to request whatever documents it wants. It is up to the House to determine if those requests have been met to its satisfaction. The House has determined that they have not, so we sit here, day after day, asserting the moral right of the House on behalf of the Canadians who sent us here, including those who sent the government here and whom the government has abandoned. They are the Canadians whose money and trust it has treated with such carelessness and disdain. We demand answers, and we demand accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636258">Another scandal, which is criminal in nature, is the $400 million in conflicts of interest. There we have the same model, with the same players and refrains of denial and distraction from the government benches. It is just sad. The saddest part of all is that we will probably be here again. I am not sure if it will be the $10-billion conflict of interest they are setting up with Mark Carney, or on a much smaller scale, maybe the real Randy will finally stand up. Maybe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will finally tell us the truth about China. I do not know. What I do know is that, as long as the Liberals are in power, we will be back here again soon, doing something very similar to what we are doing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636259">The latest scandal has paralyzed the House of Commons from being able to deal with the issues that families are facing in Canada, including right here in Ottawa, like the cost of living, food inflation and the crime and chaos that are rampant in our streets. We know that everything is up. My constituents in Provencher know it. They talk to me about how their taxes are up. They talk to me about how the costs of everything they have to buy are up. They talk to me about how crime is up, especially rural crime. Then they add on, “And I think the Liberals' time is up, too.” I cannot disagree with them. I also think the Liberals have exceeded their shelf life and their best-before date has come and gone, if there ever even was one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636260">As a result of the Liberals' entitled attitude towards accountability, we have crime and chaos in government. It is not so much the gravity of what they have done as much as the artlessness and the utter brazenness, along with the regularity of and the apathy towards their misdeeds, that has even the most jaded Canadians scratching their heads in disbelief. What started as a simple flouting of ethics rules for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with his taxpayer-funded vacation to a lobbyist's private island, for which he received the dubious distinction of being the only sitting prime minister in Canadian history to be found guilty of violating ethics laws, quickly unfolded into a pattern of cronyism, corruption, cover-ups and ethical violations for the Prime Minister, his ministers and others in government. That is unprecedented in the history of Canadian politics. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636261">There is a saying, and I read it again just recently, that anyone who can be trusted with a little, will be trusted with a lot. We have seen that over and over again in the Liberal government. We want to trust it because we, as members of Parliament, know how important trust is. We expect our constituents to place their trust in us to bring their cares and concerns to Parliament, to vigorously debate, to defend them and their rights, and to uphold the integrity of this place. We do that day after day. Our constituents expect that of us. We know that the trust they have in us is not something that we can take for granted because trust can be broken. When trust is broken, it is very difficult to repair. If we can be trusted in the little things, these big things that we are talking about would not even be an issue because we know that trust would carry on, even for the big things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636262">We know that after nine years, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not worth the cost, not worth the crime and not worth the corruption. Only common-sense Conservatives are standing up for Canadian families, and only Conservatives would end the Liberal culture of cronyism, cover-up and corruption. The Liberals must end their cover-up and hand over the documents to the RCMP so that Parliament can get back to working for the Canadians who sent us here.</ParaText>

Is that not a valid question, and should Canadians not have an answer to that?</ParaText>

He was honest about it. He said it in his question. I know that he is going to want to try to ask me a question when it is time, but the reality is that there is nothing he can say that is going to reverse what he already admitted, which is what their tactic on this whole thing has been.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636304">The point is that there is a choice between sending the motion to committee to study the issue of the government's contempt of Parliament, and the Liberals' just ending their contempt of Parliament and tabling the documents. Indeed if members, who are elected to this place, want to debate this, as he is doing, then they are welcome to do so. When that debate is exhausted, we will go to committee unless they table the documents.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, rather than speaking about something fantastic that the government may be doing to better Canadians, we are here to discuss yet another scandal. That is right, another Liberal scandal: more corruption regarding the gross misappropriation of taxpayer funds, with a typical Liberal response of “Cover it up. Nothing to see here”. That is what we are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636332">I know that with all the Liberal scandals that have been going on, it is hard to keep track of everything, so let me clarify that what I want to talk about today are the Auditor General's findings that Liberal insiders at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, or as I would refer to it, the green slush fund, gave nearly $400 million in tax dollars to their own companies with over 186 conflicts of interests, all at a time when Canadians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. SDTC was a federal foundation that was supposed to support small and medium-sized businesses in the clean-tech sector by funding projects that were to develop technology that benefits the environment. The members of the Liberal-appointed board violated conflict of interest laws and turned it into a green slush fund for the Liberal elites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636333">On June 10, a Conservative motion was adopted by the House, calling for all documents relating to the green slush fund to be tabled within 30 days and eventually turned over to the RCMP. Thankfully, the motion was passed, despite the Liberals voting against it. That was another desperate attempt to cover-up. The Liberals responded to this motion on July 17, August 21 and September 16, but there were only portions tabled. There was partial disclosure due to either redactions or the withholding of documents. In other instances, the House order was met with a complete refusal by those departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636334">According to the Speaker's ruling, the law clerk reported back to the Speaker that the Liberals had not complied with the House order by the stipulated deadline of 30 days following the adoption of the motion. In response to the Liberals' refusal to disclose documents, the House <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">leader</Affiliation> for our Conservative opposition raised the question of privilege, arguing that Parliament's powers to order the production of documents are absolute and the government cannot disregard this binding order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636335">As parliamentarians, we have a right to ask for any documents to be produced that are necessary for us to fulfill our duties to Canadians. Therefore, on September 26, the Speaker ruled that the Liberals' failure to produce documents relating to the green slush fund scandal constituted a prima facie breach of privilege. As such, all debates are suspended until this matter is resolved. That is going on four weeks now. If parliamentarians do not have the rights and freedoms necessary to do their jobs, Parliament is paralyzed, as it is now, but the Liberal government seems to be okay with wasting taxpayers' money and government's time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636336">The Speaker ruled that “The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any...documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties”. In his ruling, he further stated that “The House has clearly ordered the production of certain documents, and that order has clearly not been fully complied with.” </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636337">In yet another attempt to obstruct the investigation, the Liberals have made the argument that since this motion calls for documents to be turned over to the RCMP, the motion would be inadmissible or out of order. However, the Speaker ruled that he did agree that “It is indeed unusual, novel and unprecedented for the House to order documents not for its own purposes but for a third party.” However, the Speaker also added that “I believe the best way for this to be achieved would be to follow the usual course for a prima facie question of privilege”. I would also argue that what is unusual and unprecedented is for the RCMP to have to be investigating a government over and over again with so many conflicts and absolute corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636338">For a government that claims to not be responsible for this scandal to then go to such lengths to try and cover it up instead of fighting on behalf of Canadians to get the truth out makes no sense to me. If the Liberals had nothing to do with this $400-million scandal, they should be as concerned as the rest of us about this gross corruption and theft of taxpayer money. One would think that a responsible government would take the lead on holding those responsible to be accountable for their actions and not be forced into responding appropriately. Liberals insiders have stolen $400 million from hard-working Canadian taxpayers, yet this Liberal government is doing everything in its power to prevent the House from gaining access to those documents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636339">In response to our demands that they give Canadians the answers they deserve, the Liberals have flat out refused, obstructing a criminal investigation into this misappropriation of public funds. The Liberals claim that this matter should be discussed in committee, because they think that nobody there will notice. However, I do not agree with that. The House has already passed a motion and the Speaker has made his ruling. The House is the place for the matter to be resolved, not at committee. This brings us to the privilege motion in front of us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636340">Parliamentary privilege is the individual and collective rights that we, as members of the House of Commons, have that allow us to effectively carry out our principle functions to legislate, deliberate and hold the government to account. Parliamentary privilege dates back to the 17th century when the people of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom fought to protect their power from the king. In Canada, parliamentary privilege is part of our Constitution. It is essential for maintaining the power and authority of the House in allowing members of Parliament to represent their constituents fully. It is called “democracy”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636341">Violating parliamentary privilege is no small thing. It means that the government cannot govern and the House cannot fulfill its duties to the Canadians we represent. When parliamentary privilege is breached, our constitutionally guaranteed rights as parliamentarians are disregarded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636342">We are left to wonder what could be so bad about what is contained in these documents that the Liberals have resorted to breaking parliamentary privilege and obstructing a criminal investigation to keep them hidden. I think Canadians know why. They know that these documents contain evidence of significant corruption. So far, we know that the report showed $400 million in tax dollars was misappropriated and there were 186 instances of conflicts of interest with the awarding of contracts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636343">Further, for a fund dedicated to supporting the development of new sustainable technology, $59 million of this green slush fund went to 10 ineligible projects. As the Auditor General said, “the projects did not support the development or demonstration of a new technology, or their projected environmental benefits were unreasonable.” Not only were funds misappropriated to Liberal insiders, they were given to projects that were not even relevant to the goals of the fund. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636344">Even more shocking is that the Auditor General's report found that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> did not sufficiently monitor any contracts from Liberal insiders. Why is no one in the government doing anything to get to the bottom of this gross misuse of taxpayer money? What makes this all so much worse is that the $400-million slush fund scandal comes at a time when Canadians face an economic crisis. Canadians are feeling the financial impacts of the government's policies over the last nine years. Not shockingly, the Liberals do not seem to care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636345">When I think of my riding of <Affiliation DbId="278222" Type="2">Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner</Affiliation>, it pains me to think of the hard-working Albertans who are struggling with the cost of living crisis under the tax-and-spend Liberals. If we then add the carbon tax the government has implemented, it adds to my constituents' struggle to fill their gas tanks; heat their homes, businesses and barns; dry their grain; buy groceries and so much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636346">Let us imagine how much the $400 million would impact the lives of Canadians who are struggling to make ends meet under this economic burden. How many additional doctors and nurses, or equipment, could we add with $400 million to help Canadians access health care? How about our school systems? How would $400 million invested in our communities impact the number of teachers, teachers' aides and school programs for our children?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636347">The average Canadian family now spends more of its income on taxes than on basic needs, such as food, shelter and clothing. Canadians also cannot afford housing. In 2024, the number of chronically homeless people increased by 38% relative to 2018. We have 61% of young Canadians age 18 to 34 who are concerned about their ability to pay their mortgage or rent over the next 12 months, and 28% say they are considering moving to another country for greater affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636348">It is shocking that during a time when Canadians are experiencing a once-in-a-generation cost of living crisis because of the out-of-touch government spending, the Liberals dare to allow $400 million of taxpayer money to line the pockets of their friends and insiders. They are absolutely out of touch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636349">It does not stop there. The affordability crisis is affecting Canadians in every aspect of their lives. Food Banks Canada's 2024 Poverty Report Card shows that almost 50% of Canadians feel financially worse off compared to last year, and one in four Canadians are experiencing food insecurity. Under the Liberal government, Food Banks Canada reported that food banks have seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636350">It is shameful that while Canadians are struggling to meet their basic food and housing needs, the government's priority continues to be lining the pockets of Liberal elites. The $400-million green slush fund scandal, along with all the other scandals, demonstrates the Liberals have no respect for the hard-working Canadians who dutifully pay their taxes every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636351">I have questions for the members present on the other side of the House. How do they respond to their constituents who are facing challenges in feeding their families, keeping their homes or ensuring their loved ones' safety? How would they explain to their constituents that the $400 million they earned benefited the Liberals' friends, instead of assisting those in need? Can members look their constituents in the eye and assert that the $400 million was spent more wisely than if it had been spent on the constituents who earned it and are currently struggling?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636352">The members on the other side of the House have overlooked the fact that we serve the Canadian public and that taxpayer funds do not belong to the government. These funds are the property of Canadians. It is unimaginable, unethical and corrupt to use Canadian taxpayer dollars in this manner and then fail to acknowledge that these funds have been misappropriated. On top of that, the Liberals are actively trying to cover it up. They are obstructing a criminal investigation into this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636353">I want all members of this House to imagine what $400 million could do in their riding. Unfortunately for Canadians, on top on the misappropriation of $400 million, the Liberals are stalling the work of this House on important issues by refusing to co-operate and they are effectively paralyzing Parliament, sidelining our efforts to tackle the rising cost of housing, food inflation and issues of crime that Canadians care about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636354">Speaking of crime, in Alberta alone, the total number of violent Criminal Code violations is up 37%; total violent firearms offences are up 118%, and extortion is up 410%. Law enforcement, from coast to coast to coast, is crying for support. Law enforcement officers feel the impacts of the government's soft-on-crime policies first-hand. Whenever I check the news, I am appalled to see stories of individuals out on bail who are recommitting offences, making our communities less safe and putting our law enforcement officers at risk. Speaking of risk, an officer was shot in broad daylight in the GTA by an offender charged with 41 offences; hours previously, after being taken into custody, he was released on bail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636355">The $400 million that was given to Liberal insiders could have been invested in making our streets safer, but no, the Liberals thought it was better spent on their friends. Canadians are worried about increased thefts and crime rates. They should not have to worry about their government stealing from them too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636356">There is also a drug crisis across the entire country. There are 47,000 people who have died from opioid-related deaths in the last nine years. That is more deaths from opioids alone than all Canadian deaths in the Second World War. If we think about it, that is inconceivable. That is all thanks to the Liberals' failed approach to the so-called safe supply and tax-funded drugs. Can members imagine how much good $400 million could do for treating those with mental health and addictions struggles? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636357">In addition to the issues faced at home, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal government have embarrassed Canadians on the world stage. Three months ago, the Liberal defence policy update revealed that Canada is nowhere close to its 2% NATO commitments. That hardly comes as a surprise from a government that has repeatedly failed the Canadian Armed Forces in recruitment, procurement and every other way. We are short almost 16,000 troops, with a further 10,000 undertrained and undeployable. Our warships are rusting out. Our fighter jets are worn out. Entire air squadrons have been shut down because they do not have enough personnel. If the government had been serious about our national defence, it could have committed the $400 million to support our troops and come a little closer to meeting our NATO goals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636358">I really wonder what the NDP-Liberals have done right in the last nine years. Things are clear. Crime is up and costs are up; quite frankly, I think time is up. Canadians are sick of the rising costs of crime, chaos, corruption and international embarrassments. They are ready for a change, for a government that will bring common-sense leadership back to this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636359"> On this side of the House, we are ready to form a government that will work for Canadians, not steal from them. We will reduce the cost of living and reward work and investment. Conservatives are ready to fix the budget by cutting waste, capping spending, investing in economic growth and cutting taxes. We will reduce bureaucracy, sell off federal buildings and invest in the building trades so that we can build homes. We will repeal senseless, soft-on-crime policies and catch-and-release laws, reinforce our borders, stand up for law-abiding firearms owners, focus on the real criminals and improve our national security. When we form government, we will ensure accountability and transparency. Canadians deserve to know where and how taxpayer money is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636360">These matters involving the green slush fund are criminal, and an investigation is needed and expected by Canadians. The government needs to come clean with Canadians and finally reveal the truth. It is time for the government to end the cover-up and corruption and provide the documents, so Parliament can get working for Canadians.</ParaText>

For folks back home watching this, SDTC is Sustainable Development Technology Canada, an organization that was tasked with providing money to organizations that are doing research on sustainability. It has been redubbed the green slush fund because it seems to have been left unchecked by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636403">Some might say that this was not the government; it was an outside organization with a board set up by the government. However, I would point out that most of the people appointed to this board who were making decisions had strong Liberal ties. In many cases, being appointed to this board seemed to have been a reward for past loyalties. That has been pointed out a lot.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636404">The other very interesting thing to note, for those trying to make the case that this was outside the government and the government did not necessarily know about it, is that the deputy minister, who reports directly back to the minister, the person right next to the minister, attended these meetings and would have taken notes, and his or her opinion on these things would have been taken into consideration. The deputy minister represents the minister, so they would have reported back to the minister what took place at these meetings and would have been there to advise the board as to the directions of the minister. The minister can say that he took a hands-off approach, and that is fine, but he still knew what was going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636405">I want to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, who has done incredible work on bringing this to light. It should be recognized that to some degree, bringing this scandal to light, in light of all the other scandals, has been a challenge. I commend him for his work, because it seems like every other week there is another major Liberal scandal breaking. People have become tired of the scandals that have rocked the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636406"> We do not need to go too far back to remember the SNC-Lavalin scandal, over which an indigenous woman lost her cabinet position. She is no longer a member of Parliament because of that. The government was trying to manipulate the justice system. We can look back at the WE Charity scandal as well, where the government tried to give away the debit card with the PIN written on the back for $1 billion, again with no accountability. Then we have the Baylis medical scandal. For those who do not know about it, a former member of Parliament, Mr. Frank Baylis, owned a company that got a contract to supply the government with ventilators during the COVID pandemic. Rumour has it that the ventilators were never used. The ventilators were not approved by Health Canada either, yet the government bought 237 million dollars' worth of them, and they appear to have never been useful in Canada. This is the level of corruption we are dealing with, so I again take my hat off to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> for finding out this newest scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636407">I should also mention the ArriveCAN app scandal, where an app that should have cost no more than $200,000 ended up costing the government $60 million. As I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, the government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and cabinet are responsible for the debit card of the nation, and they appear to have written the PIN on the back of it and handed it out wherever they went. Then when the scandals ensued, they said they did not know about them or that well-meaning Canadians abused the Canadian debit card.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636408">This goes right back to the very beginning, though, to the level of Liberal scandal we saw already right after 2015. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> became the Prime Minister, we can recall his notorious Aga Khan trip, for which the Prime Minister was found in violation of the ethics code and was fined. We have never-ending layer upon layer of Liberal scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636409">The one on SDTC is most closely related to the Winnipeg lab scandal. This scandal is very hard to explain to people because we do not know much about it, although we know there is something there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636410">What happened is that members of Parliament voted and demanded that the government release documents related to suspicious activities: the arrest of individuals who worked at the lab, a number of trips made back and forth between that lab and China, and Chinese nationals who had access to the virology lab in Winnipeg. We knew that something seemed fishy there, so the House of Commons demanded the documents to get to the bottom of what was going on with that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636411">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> Did we get the documents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636412">
                <B>Mr. Arnold Viersen:</B> Mr. Speaker, we did not get the documents. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sued the Speaker of this place. It was unprecedented in Canadian history for the Prime Minister to sue the Speaker of the House of Commons to prevent those documents from being released. Then, as that carried on, the Prime Minister called an election to prevent the documents from becoming open.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636413">Now we are in a similar situation. The House of Commons has demanded documents to be handed over to the RCMP. We are not asking for the documents for ourselves. We are saying to hand these documents over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636414">This is much the same as a person discovering that an employee of their business is embezzling. When the accounting department starts to put the pieces together, it might say, “We have a body of evidence that we think so and so is embezzling.” They might then confront the individual, but they would also most likely call the police. The first thing they would do is call the police and say they suspect that a crime has taken place, and they would hand over all of the documentation to prove the case. Then we would expect the RCMP or the police of jurisdiction to do its own investigation, which is an important part of police individuality. They do not just take accusations on their face; they do their own investigations. What we are saying here is that something stinks to high heaven. We can see what is going on. We can see how folks have abused the national debit card when they were entrusted with the PIN, and we are saying this is illegal; this is a crime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636415">The Liberals have pointed out that there have been Ethics Commissioner and Commissioner of Lobbying reports on this and that the Auditor General has had a report, which is great, but all of those people are not judging the criminal element of this particular thing. We suspect there was a crime, and we want the RCMP to do an investigation and to have the documents that it needs, which we are entitled to ask for. We feel that the RCMP should have those documents in order to build the case we want it to build. This is entirely within the purview of Canadian Parliament. It is one of the privileges of members of Parliament to ask for these documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636416"> However, it begs the question: Much as in the case of the Winnipeg lab, what are the Liberals hiding? We still do not know what they were hiding in the Winnipeg lab case, but what are they hiding in this case?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636417">Quite honestly, the Liberals have been all over the place. At first they said it was an arm's-length organization and they did know anything about it. Then they said we were violating people's charter rights. Now they are saying this is grinding the House to a halt. We agree that this is grinding the House to a halt, but the privileges of members of Parliament are an important thing to debate. An easy solution for the impasse we see today would be for the government to release the documents so we can hand them off to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636418">What is the crux of the matter? A board of directors was responsible for $1 billion of grant money being handed out, and these board members appeared to have made proposals to the board they were associated with for companies to get grant money. The Auditor General said that in 10 of these cases, there were no grounds whatsoever for these companies to get money, and in 180 other cases, the Auditor General said there was a conflict of interest in the companies getting the money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636419">We have studied the minutes of these meetings, and what appears to have happened is that folks affiliated with particular companies would make a pitch that the company they were affiliated with should get some money from this fund. Then, in most cases, they would recuse themselves from the decision. They would leave the room; the decision would be made, “Yes, we should give the company some money”; and then they would come back. Then it would be the next person's turn, and they would propose that their company should get some money, and they would say, “Due to a conflict of interest, I will not vote on it.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636420">The point of putting a board in place is to ensure accountability and oversight. Members of that board were colluding among themselves to hand money to each other, and the quid pro quo was, “we will vote for your company to get money with the understanding that you will vote for our company to get money.” That is what happened. We see over $330 million, a lot of taxpayer money, voted on by a board to be given to its members' own companies, when boards are generally there to provide oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636421">To go back to the beginning, this board seems to have been appointed to reward loyalty to the Liberal Party. If that is not enough of a connection to the Liberal Party, I do not know what is. There is also ministerial oversight: The deputy minister was in those meetings ensuring that things were going along as the minister would like them to and were also being reported back to the minister. This goes right back to the Liberal corruption we have seen over and over again with all of the other scandals along the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636422">Another element to this scandal has not been highlighted as maybe it should have been. Several of the folks on the board not only secured funds for organizations they were affiliated with, but in many cases they also owned shares in those companies. We have one case of a company that one of the board members was affiliated with that saw a dramatic growth in its stock price because it had secured funds from the SDTC board. He admitted in committee there had been a thousand-fold increase in value for himself. Not only did he secure taxpayer funds for a company he was affiliated with; he personally became extremely wealthy from it because he owned stock in that particular company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636423">The conflicts of interest, the corruption and the abuse of the taxpayer debit card know no limits with the Liberals. When we see the amount of waste and the lack of concern around financial controls, it is no wonder that this country is suffering an inflation crisis. We see that food, gas and housing prices are up dramatically, and we are calling for the government to axe the tax. When the government taxes the farmer who grows the food and taxes the truck driver who transports the food, Canadians cannot afford food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636424">We think it is time for a carbon tax election so Canadians can see hope on the horizon, a return to normalcy and a government that understands that the privileges of governing and controlling the country's debit card, and the PIN that comes with it, are important. We need to ensure that our finances are respected and that we are not allowing entities to enrich themselves off the taxpayer dollar with no benefit to the public good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636425">I look forward to the carbon tax election. I know it will be coming soon. All of my colleagues and I have heard from our constituents over the last week, those who are struggling under the carbon tax, going to the food bank and things like that. They are calling for an election and they hope it can happen sooner rather than later. After the election I am certain we will axe the tax.</ParaText>

The two billion trees was a great one. How many trees have we actually planted? We cannot get the information because the Liberals are not very transparent.

I will give him that as well, but there are so many scandals that when the member for Provencher started talking about them, I thought, “Oh my goodness; I forgot about all those scandals.” There are just so many to remember.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636453">I wrote down a number of them that I want to talk about. We are talking about transparency. We are talking about trying to get information. When we request information, it comes back redacted. For those people who may not have been listening to the debate, “redacted” means that big black sharpie or magic marker that goes over all the answers and gives probably less information than what we were trying to get.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636454"> I look at what has gone on, and it would seem this is not the first time the government has not offered up a number of things. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278435" Type="2">Provencher</Affiliation> talked about the Winnipeg labs. That is something that troubles me greatly when I look at what went on there. We asked for documentation, and we absolutely got stonewalled to the point where we actually brought someone to the bar, but not a member of Parliament. That is something that had not been done in over a century, and they still refused to give us the information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636455"> Then we found out that the scientists were working for the Communist Party of China. Give me a break, in terms of being able to vet people. I am sure that it has never happened before. The current government is always good at vetting people. I feel as if, at the end of the day, not only were they not vetted but they were also actually taking the information out of the lab and sending it back to China. They were probably sending it via Canada Post, as a matter of fact, trying to make sure it got there. This is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636456">I hear all the time about the fact that we are looking at things that are going on and that we are the party of big business. I do remember, from not so long ago, the $12 million the government gave to Loblaw for freezers. Not long after, Loblaw got charged in a half-a-billion-dollar price-fixing case over bread.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636457">Not only did a company like Loblaw not need the money, because it is doing very well, but after the government gave it money, this large, Canadian corporation agreed to pay a fine of $500 million. Think about that. How much bread was it price-fixing if it was prepared to pay a fine like that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636458">Someone mentioned Jasper, and I think we do need to raise Jasper as an issue. It is absolutely tragic. As more information comes out as to what was going on there and the fact that the government neglected any type of advice from experts, or neglected anything, it is absolutely devastating. I feel for the people of Jasper. Many times it had been said that we needed to do something around fire management and what was going on with all the dry brush. We also read stories about how volunteer firefighters showed up and were turned away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636459"> I wonder to myself whether the government is one we actually want to trust as it continues to lead. Is nine years not enough for the Liberals, in terms of moving forward?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636460">Frank Baylis was also mentioned. I cannot help but re-emphasize that one. There were $237 million in contracts he got two months after he left office. Talk about hitting the payday. At the end of the day, I do not know whether one could have worked here for 10 or 20 years and be able to get the kind of contract to the tune of what he got. We know what happened with all the ventilators; they were scrapped and never used.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636461">We are talking about some of the inside connections, and that is what this is about. We are talking about almost $400 million in contracts from SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada. We are talking about that and about the insiders who got money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636462">We see this happening over and over again, and that is the challenge that I see. The government loves taking care of itself and its buddies, and quite frankly I am not sure whether we can trust it. Let us go back to some of the promises it has made in terms of what it was prepared to do. The two billion trees was a good one, but I also love the fact that it wants to build almost four million homes, in about the same period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636463">If we look at the math, we realize that we probably need to build almost half a million homes a year. Currently we are building fewer than 250,000. It is pretty easy to make commitments just so people will be happy to hear what someone has to say, when they actually have no idea how they are going to fulfill the contracts, how they are actually going to get the houses built, and how they are actually going to get some of the obligations met. That is one of the things that are absolutely troubling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636464">Small businesses got crushed during Covid. They got absolutely destroyed. The government also promised it would be looking at a carbon tax rebate. I have not talked to one owner of a small business yet that has received a carbon tax rebate, and I would certainly love to hear from the government about when that is going to be, because a number of businesses have gone under and have struggled in such a way that the carbon tax rebate is probably not even going to help them at this point. However, it would be something that would be nice if we could move forward on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636465">I also want to look at some of the other things we have been talking about in the House. I find it interesting that the committee continues to look at which Randy got government contracts. Why are we asking the government all these questions and we continue to get zero response whatsoever in terms of being able to find out the kind of information we want? The Liberals give us a hard time, saying we should not be asking for all that information because they are not prepared to give it up at this point in time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636466">It has been said lots, and I will only touch on it, but one of the reasons we are here is the conflicts of interest when it came to the green slush fund. We have talked about over 186 conflicts. That is obviously very concerning. I am always amazed, when we start going through all these things, that there are actually so many different challenges, misappropriating of funds, things that could have been done better or things that could have been more efficient, that it goes back to my original premise: The government is incompetent. The government does not have the ability to get things done in a timely and efficient way.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636467">I think of the ArriveCAN app that cost just under $60 million and could have been done for a little over $80,000. I think of the testimony we have heard. Documentation from the Auditor General includes government officials' lying in an attempt to silence whistle-blowers. In this culture of openness and transparency, government is suppressing whistle-blowers and trying to suspend people without pay for telling the truth at committee. Consultants were making millions and millions of dollars while not adding any value to work, and while there were inappropriate relationships and friendships between government officials in charge of awarding multi-million-dollar contracts and the people receiving some of those contracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636468"> Part of being a government is being accountable for what it does, and not only being accountable but also making sure taxpayers receive value for the money. One of the challenges people tell me about all the time is that they are struggling right now with the cost of living, with the carbon tax and with the fact that everything costs more. It costs more to heat their homes, to buy food, to pay rent and to pay for a number of other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636469">When Canadians see that their money is not being spent appropriately by the government, in a way that makes some sense, is transparent and makes sure that people get value for money, they ask why we are not taking better care of their taxpayer dollars. Those are the things Conservatives continue to question and should be allowed to question. It was mentioned earlier that it is the opposition's job to question what is going on in government and to hold it to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636470">We have been talking about SDTC and a number of other things, but I think we almost forgot about all the consulting contracts that went to McKinsey. Do members remember that? It received over $209 million in contracts, and 90% of the contracts the Liberal government awarded to McKinsey were given without proper guidelines. At the end of the day, money was being handed out without following any type of process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636471">In many cases it was a little unclear what the purpose of the contracts was; the government did not know what they were for or the outcome that was supposed to be achieved. In one case, the Canada Border Services Agency saw that McKinsey did not qualify for contracts, so it revised the statement of work so it could qualify. Let us think about that for a second: The CBSA put out a contract for work that was not defined, so it reworked the contract so McKinsey could get the work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636472">If we look at the sole-source contracts, we see that there was never any type of justification for them. Over 70% of all contracts awarded to McKinsey were non-competitive, and in 13 out of 17 contracts given to McKinsey, security clearances should have been necessary but the Liberal government allowed McKinsey to operate without them. It is not a surprise that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave McKinsey hundreds of millions of dollars, because at that time, McKinsey was led by Dominic Barton, a close friend of the Prime Minister and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. We talk about Liberal-connected friends getting contracts and money as a result of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636473">We know that Dominic Barton was a key figure in the Liberals' advisory council on economic growth and on their Indo-Pacific advisory committee. It was Barton's idea to create the failed scandal-plagued Canada Infrastructure Bank, and it was Barton and McKinsey who had to pay nearly $600 million in damages in the opioid crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636474">Looking at a number of these things, we realize that when it comes to competence or the ability to get things done, there needs to be accountability. That is why we, members of the opposition, are asking questions. That is why we are demanding that we get a chance to see the documents unredacted and that they can move on to the appropriate authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636475">The appropriate authorities will do what they need to do. We are not indicating what should happen. We are saying that in order for the RCMP to do its work, it needs to see the documents. We asked for these things and did not receive anything at all. That is why we are here debating. This could all be over right away; if the Liberals would provide the documentation, we would move on to something else.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636476">That is obviously an issue. Part of the challenge that we have had is we realized that, through the contracting system, the RCMP revealed earlier this year that it had charged a scamster who received $250,000 through the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s broken contracting system. The Liberal-NDP coalition blocked questions to the officials responsible for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636477">We saw the RCMP previously testify that it had multiple investigations of federal contracting, in addition to its active investigation in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s $60-million arrivescam app, which was supposed to cost the taxpayers $80,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636478">We go over a number of these things, and we realize, at the end of the day, that the people who are doing well are Liberal insiders and those who are connected. We look at what happened with our <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation>, dealing with public relations, pomp and circumstance, conflict of interest and contracts awarded for communication services. In 2019-20, the Ethics Commissioner said there was no excuse for contracting with a friend's company. The commissioner went on to say that the minister twice failed to recognize the potential conflict of interest involving a friend, an oversight of her obligations under the Conflict of Interest Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636479">This sounds familiar because, as I just mentioned, of the terms of the contracts with the two Randys that we are trying to get to the bottom of and how some of these contracts were awarded during COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636480">Then, of course, as has been raised before and it does not hurt to mention it again, there is the whole issue of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s ethics convictions, dealing with the Aga Khan and the Paradise Island vacation. He was charged with an ethics violation after spending time on the Bahamas island. The investigators believed that there was reasonable grounds to think fraud may have been committed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636481">Ultimately, the RCMP did not lay charges because of the lack of clarity in the federal rules that applied to accepting gifts. However, the Ethics Commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was guilty of breaking laws that violated section 5, 11, 12 and 21 of the Conflict of Interest Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636482">The Ethics Commissioner questioned the Prime Minister's friendship with the Aga Khan. The Prime Minister used the words “close family friend” to refer to the Aga Khan, but the Ethics Commissioner found that this was not the case. The Prime Minister took the trip to Paradise Island and was brought in on a private helicopter. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thinks he is above the law. Canadians are well aware of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636483">What Canadians are finding right now is that they believe there is so much hypocrisy that their tax dollars are not being taken care of in a responsible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636484">We have SNC-Lavalin, which was mentioned here. The Ethics Commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> violated section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act by attempting to influence then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636485">The ruling stated that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> improperly used his position of authority to attempt to further the private interests of SNC-Lavalin by seeking to pressure Wilson-Raybould to offer a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have allowed the company to avoid a criminal charge and corruption charges. The Prime Minister was found guilty of breaking Canada's ethics laws through the efforts to protect a corrupt, politically connected company by firing his first indigenous attorney general, who would not bend to the Prime Minister's orchestrated campaign of political pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636486">The former ethics commissioner's report indicated that witnesses said they had relevant evidence to offer but were constrained by the limitations put in place by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The exact same tactics blocked the RCMP from probing the possibility of criminal charges related to the Prime Minister's orchestrated and systematic campaign to pressure then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to overrule the independent Public Prosecution Service and offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636487">Last year, the Liberal-NDP-Bloc coalition censored the RCMP by shutting down the commissioner's testimony in committee. They did whatever it took to protect the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from potential criminal charges. Common-sense Conservatives would continue to hold the Liberal-NDP government and its Bloc allies accountable. Canadians certainly deserve transparency and the right to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636488">I know I only have a minute left, but I need more time if I am going to go through all the scandals. We talked about the WE Charity.

Yes, we did appoint her to the board, and there were tangible actions taken.

              <ParaText id="8636519">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a matter of utmost importance: transparency and accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636520">Those are two words that the NDP-Liberal government's actions have proven it knows very little about, or it simply does not care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636521">The Cambridge Dictionary defines transparency as “A situation in which business and financial activities are done in an open way without secrets, so that people can trust that they are fair and honest.” It defines accountability as “A situation in which someone is responsible for things that happen and can give a satisfactory reason for them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636522">In 2015, the Liberals ran on a platform of transparency and accountability. Where is it? After nine years, Canadians are still waiting for it, proving that the NDP-Liberal government is not worth the cost. Crime and corruption, along with scandals and controversies, have plagued the government from the very beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636523"> We have had scandals like the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Aga Khan vacation, the India trip with Jaspal Atwal, the Jamaica vacation, the WE scandal, the blackface controversy, the Tofino controversy, cash-for-access fundraisers, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the handling of the Afghanistan crisis, “elbowgate”, Governor General Julie Payette's resignation, Queen Elizabeth's funeral, the Chinese election interference allegations, the use of the Emergencies Act, and now the corruption of the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636524">When will these scandals, controversies and corruptions end? They have deeply tarnished our democracy and damaged our reputation on the global stage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636525">Only common-sense Conservatives, led by our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, will continue to push for accountability, end the corruption and get answers for Canadians. Canadians have whiplash, and the NDP-Liberal government has been scandal after scandal, with a side of controversy and a splash of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636526">It feels like just yesterday we were debating the ArriveCAN debacle, and before Canadians had the time to process that scam, they were hit with the news of a billion-dollar green slush fund that failed to reduce emissions or support green technology. Instead, those funds went into the coffers of Liberal insiders. To add insult to injury, a government official, who was handpicked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, confirmed that no action was taken after gross mismanagement and conflicts of interest were uncovered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636527">For Canadians who are not familiar with this topic, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, was established by the Government of Canada in 2001. It is a federal initiative aimed at funding and supporting the development and demonstration of clean technology.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636528">It has two goals: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in innovative technologies and to support projects that contribute to environmental sustainability and economic growth. This initiative is meant to help Canadian businesses bring their clean technology to market, thereby boosting the economy and creating jobs. Sustainable Development Technology Canada provides grants and funding to companies working on projects that align with these goals, aiming to make a significant impact on Canada's environmental and economic landscape. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636529">However, this fund comes under scrutiny, and for good reason. The Liberal green slush fund has been accused of giving grants to start-ups with ties to the senior management of Sustainable Development Technology Canada. The Auditor General found that Liberal appointees gave, and members should hold on to their pants now, $400 million to their own companies. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636539">Today I rise to participate in this emergency debate to discuss the urgent issue of foreign interference in the lives of Canadians by the Government of India. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636540">I am a proud Canadian with Indian ancestry. My parents immigrated as teenagers to the United Kingdom and came to Canada in 1972. I was born in Calgary, and Canada exceeded their expectations in every way. They had the opportunity to grow their family, find financial success and have the freedom to participate in the political process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636541">Indians are proud of their democracy, and the Indian diaspora has had a profound impact on global affairs and business. Over the last 75 years, India has been a leading example of strong democratic institutions, civil society and economic opportunity in the developing world. India has uplifted millions of its impoverished citizens while being an important bridge in global relations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636542">However, as governments change in democratic societies, so do their policy objectives. Today India is stronger economically and more aggressive and muscular in its strategic foreign policy objectives. This does not justify abandoning its values of upholding justice and the rule of law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636543">As Canadian members of Parliament, it is our duty to protect the safety and sovereignty of Canadians. Canada is guided by the rule of law, and we adhere to the Vienna Convention at all times. We expect India to uphold these same standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636544">When our law enforcement and intelligence services began pursuing credible allegations that agents of the Government of India were directly involved in the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil, we responded quickly. Our government conveyed its concerns to the Government of India and urged them to collaborate with us in shedding light on this critical issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636545">Through the national task force and other investigative efforts, the RCMP has gathered evidence that reveals four serious concerns: Violent extremists are impacting both countries; there are links tying agents of the Government of India to homicides in Canada; organized crime is being used to create the perception of unsafe environments in targeting the South Asian community in Canada; and there is interference in our democratic processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636546">These are not mere allegations, but serious findings from our national law enforcement that require immediate attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636547">Investigations have uncovered that Indian diplomats and consular officials based in Canada have leveraged their official position to engage in clandestine activities, gathering information for the Government of India either directly or through their agents and other individuals who acted voluntarily or under coercion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636548">Evidence has also shown that a wide range of entities in Canada and abroad have been utilized by agents of the Government of India to collect information. Some of these individuals and businesses were coerced and threatened into co-operating with the Government of India, and the information collected was then used to target members of the South Asian community.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636549">Recently, one of my constituents was extorted and his home was shot at. He shared with me that every day he woke up scared for the safety of his wife and children. He stayed away from his home and loved ones in hopes of keeping them safe. This is not the life he envisioned when he immigrated to this great country. Fortunately, thanks to the diligent work of the Calgary Police Service, the perpetrators were apprehended, but as we have seen, this is not always the outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636550">As a member of the Sikh faith, I know there have been allegations of Indian government interference since the Golden Temple attack in 1984 and accusations by the Indian government against the Sikh community since the Air India bombing in 1985. In the anti-Sikh riots, Indian government officials were complicit in the killing of thousands of Sikhs during that time. Mothers were raped in front of their children. Some were cut into pieces and burned alive by violent mobs. In many cases, the bodies were never recovered. However, 40 years later, families are still seeking justice, and the pain and trauma continue to resonate with the community today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636551">All Canadians, regardless of their faith or background, are guided by our legal framework. We have the opportunity to express ourselves. The Government of India may not like what many Canadians have to say, but just like India, we are a country governed by laws. Our police and intelligence agencies speaking publicly during an ongoing investigation highlights how serious this matter is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636552">The police have warned at least 12 Canadians of a pending threat. A foreign government is being accused of being complicit in the murder of three others. A clear, dangerous and unprecedented red line has been crossed. As Michael Duheme, the commissioner of the RCMP, has stated, an “extraordinary situation is compelling us to speak about what we have discovered in our multiple ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the Government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636553">As shown by the RCMP, this is an extremely serious issue. An emergency debate is imperative so that we can come together to find solutions and address the concerns of those who feel targeted or unsafe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636554">Based on the information provided to Global Affairs Canada by the RCMP, we formally requested that India waive diplomatic immunity for six individuals based in Canada and co-operate in the investigation. This request was made so that these individuals could be questioned regarding the ongoing RCMP investigation into a number of violent incidents targeting members of the South Asian community here in Canada. Regrettably, India did not agree, and given the ongoing public safety concerns for Canadians, Canada issued notices of expulsion to six diplomats and consular officials. Following those notices, India also announced it would withdraw its officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636555">To be clear, we are not seeking a diplomatic confrontation with India. Still, we will not sit quietly when agents of any country are linked to efforts to threaten, harass and even kill Canadians, full stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636556">I urge my colleagues to view this not just as a national security issue or as a partisan issue, but as a matter of parliamentary responsibility. Parliament must address threats to national sovereignty with the seriousness they demand. It is our duty to ensure that all Canadians feel safe from foreign influence and intimidation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636557">Last September, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood in the House of Commons to speak about the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Conservatives sidestepped the issue, claiming there was no evidence. Well, now we have the evidence. I would encourage the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton, to obtain a top secret clearance so he can be provided with the appropriate classified information to make informed decisions in reference to any allegations against parliamentarians in his party, just as all other parties have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636558">We must stand united across party lines to protect Canada's national interests and the well-being of our citizens. The safety and security of our citizens, regardless of their background or beliefs, must remain our top priority, and we will not tolerate any form of intimidation, harassment or harmful targeting of communities or individuals in Canada. All Canadians deserve to live free from fear, and we must take decisive steps to ensure that.</ParaText>

I very much welcome the study undertaken by the public safety and national security standing committee, but the Hogue inquiry, by its terms of reference, is solely focused on foreign interference in our democratic processes within, for instance, elections. We know, as the member for Calgary Skyview just stated, that tonight's emergency debate was prompted by RCMP work, at a multidisciplinary level, that has revealed a criminal network within Canada that threatens people and has actually killed people, which is not within the scope of Madam Justice Hogue's inquiry. Is the Liberal Party or the government prepared to expand the mandate of that inquiry?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636572">Mr. Speaker, we are moving into a world where it is becoming easier for foreign countries to suppress freedom beyond their own borders and extend repressive policies on the international stage, using social media and online censorship and, sadly, through transnational intimidation and murder. The tools and playbook that these countries are using are evolving, and how we deal with them must evolve as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636573">I appreciate the opportunity today to speak to the very serious findings with respect to the involvement of agents of the Government of India in serious criminal activity on Canadian soil, disclosed by the RCMP last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636574">The RCMP and national security officials made several attempts to work with the Government of India and Indian law enforcement counterparts on this matter, with the goal of putting an end to these criminal activities. They were repeatedly rebuffed in their attempts, including earlier this month, when the deputy commissioner, Mark Flynn; the national security and intelligence adviser, Nathalie Drouin; and the deputy minister of foreign affairs, David Morrison, met with officials from the Government of India. As such, the RCMP was compelled to move forward with the disclosure of the evidence it had gathered, which it did on October 14. I agree wholeheartedly with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who said on October 14, “The government of India made a fundamental error in thinking that they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians here on Canadian soil.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636575">Canadians will not accept this happening here, because Canada offers a promise: to live in a democracy where fundamental rights are a guarantee and where freedom, rules-based order and safety are paramount. We share the common values that we are stronger when we learn from each other and when we peacefully share different ideas, even when we challenge each other's perspectives. That is why so many people call Canada home. That is why my family chose to come here. It is clear that for the Government of India, freedom is subjective, the rules-based order is only an uncomfortable theory and safety is clearly in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636576">The RCMP's investigation found that the Indian government and its agents have a vested interest in defiling the very institutions and freedoms that make Canada Canada, undermining our democracy, corralling our freedom and harming our citizens. Additionally, the RCMP and our security agencies will not tolerate acts of violence against Canadians for exercising their right to free speech, which is protected under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We will not tolerate this, and no one in the House should tolerate this. I would like to thank the RCMP and our security agencies for their thorough work in protecting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636577">It has been a difficult few months for Sikh Canadians. Our community has been seized by intimidation, extortion, coercion and other serious offences. They can rest assured that Canadians from outside this community are now paying attention. There is no justification for perpetrating violence against Canadians in Canada. This is not a partisan issue. This is not subjective. It is not fodder for two-bit slogans and diversion tactics. This is about freedom and the lives of Canadians that are at stake. The rule of law is under threat here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636578">Canadians rightly expect party leaders to have their security clearance, and this includes the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation>, to know and understand the threats, foreign and domestic, even within their own party. A leader who does not stand up for all Canadians does not deserve to hold the highest office, and it is clear that the Conservative Party does not stand up for all Canadians. It was clear last week, when the Conservative leader did not release an official statement on his channels following the RCMP's revelations. A lack of a response only emboldens foreign governments to perpetuate disinformation and interference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636579"> Every Canadian has the freedom to live their life in Canada without the fear of violence or coercion from a foreign entity. That does not come with an asterisk. Now, more than ever, it is crucial that Canada's principles are safeguarded, for dissent does not give leave to sanction murder in any civilized society. To attempt and actively pursue means of coercion, violence and extortion is the antithesis of a free, sovereign and civilized democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636580">I am proud that the majority of Canadians across the country have neither bowed to coercion nor to those in Canada who seek to facilitate it. In the weeks and months ahead, the RCMP will continue to do its important work, but this is a collective effort. If one sees something, they must say something by contacting the RCMP's national security information network. This would help us as we bring these individuals to justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636581">I have said this before, but it bears repeating, especially as we grapple with the reality of extensive foreign interference in the lives of Canadians.

              <ParaText id="8636600">The revelations that the RCMP presented to Canadians last Monday were absolutely shocking. I talked to a number of people across the country who were shocked at the idea that agents of the Government of India were not only involved in foreign interference but also going further than that, and that foreign interference included murder; extortion; use of organized crime, with some international crime syndicates and some here in Canada; intimidation of Canadians; and coercion of Canadians. It got to the point at which the RCMP had to essentially warn Canadians. It specifically warned 13 Canadians that their lives were in danger because of foreign interference. There were concerns that their lives were at risk because of actions that agents of the Government of India may take. This is a clear affront to our sovereignty as a nation. This threatens our democracy and threatens us as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636601">We must take steps to protect Canadians. We have to protect our sovereignty. We must protect our democracy. As well, we need to get answers for Canadians as to why this is happening and how this continues to happen. We need to take steps to stop foreign interference from all countries and, in this case, directly from India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636602">It is important that we, as parliamentarians, as well as the government, take national security seriously. We must take the threat of foreign interference very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636603">The idea of foreign interference from India is not new. When I was younger, we would hear of people who had spoken up on human rights issues or other issues that the government of the day might not have agreed with. There would be concerns that they may not receive a visa to go back to India. That was the type of threat that we commonly heard previously. However, what the RCMP has uncovered now and the evidence it has of murder, extortion, coercion and the use of organized crime goes way beyond what we used to hear about before. It is at the point that, in the United States, a plot to murder an American was thwarted by U.S. authorities. U.S. security agencies were able to thwart that plot. Soon after that, arrests were made in the U.S. Unfortunately, we do not have that here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636604">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, at the Hogue commission, admitted that Canadian security agencies have known about foreign interference from India and that it has been committing foreign interference for years. The government has not taken appropriate steps to protect Canadians, even after a Canadian was assassinated on Canadian soil. Canadians continue to be under threat.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636605">The fact is that, for a number of years, we have been attempting to bring solutions forward on foreign interference. It was our party that pushed for a foreign interference registry so that foreign agents would be registered. The Liberals rejected this, and the NDP supported them. Finally, after pressure from the Conservatives, we now have what is starting to become a foreign interference registry of agents to be registered to stop foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636606">Extortion is one method the RCMP has said agents of the Indian government are using to target Canadians. They are using international gangs. They are using and paying gangs here in Canada. One solution that we put forward was my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="12876247" Type="4">C-381</Document>. It is important that, as opposition members, we put solutions forward. The fact is that, right now in Canada, there is no minimum penalty for extortion, but with Bill C-381, anybody committing extortion would have received three years as a mandatory minimum sentence. It would have been four years if they committed that extortion with a firearm and five years if it was in relation to organized crime. That is precisely what we are talking about here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636607">This is exactly what the RCMP has said is happening in this case: Through organized crime, Canadians are being extorted. However, the Liberals and the NDP voted against that bill. When we put solutions forward, unfortunately, the Liberals rejected those solutions. The fact of the matter is that Canada is now much more dangerous than it was nine years ago in every respect and in every category. Crime is up. Murders are up. It is less safe to be in Canada, and as we are finding out, foreign interference from India has gotten to an extreme level in which Canadians' lives are threatened. We have already seen that a Canadian has been assassinated because of it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8636623">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House among my colleagues and talk about this critical issue facing Canadians. I know many Canadians have been hearing about this over the past week; certainly, for this kind of news to break on a Thanksgiving Monday was quite unprecedented, so I am honoured to put some words on the record. Certainly, we are hearing about very serious allegations from the RCMP out of what has been tied to Indian government officials allegedly plotting to work with criminal entities in Canada to extort, coerce and murder people. They are connected to criminal entities in India. In fact, it has been alleged that a number of individuals have been murdered in Canada as a result of some of these outrageous affronts to our sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636624">As a result of these criminal activities, we have really had our whole system of government rocked, and a relationship that we thought was quite strong is now an issue of concern. That should concern everyone in this place because we need strong allies, friends and relationships internationally. It was disappointing to hear of these allegations. It was odd and very surprising to see the RCMP have this unprecedented press conference out of the blue on a Thanksgiving Monday. The RCMP officials, remarkably, said that about 13 individuals are currently in peril and that they did not feel that they could protect them with their own resources; therefore, they had to go public. It is quite unprecedented that we have come to such a point with foreign interference that the RCMP had to hold an emergency press conference to see if they could protect 13 individuals residing in Canada. It is really unbelievable, and it was quite shocking to be eating turkey dinner while learning about some of these details.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636625">Interestingly, about a year ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> got up in the House of Commons and also did something quite unprecedented: He made these ties, saying that there were some very serious allegations that an individual was murdered in Canada in connection to the Government of India. I do not believe any government, at least in recent history, has ever gotten up and done something like that: accuse a foreign government in that way. It was quite shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636626">What is really interesting is that this was about 13 months ago. We had the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the leader of the Liberal Party, taking this quite unprecedented action in the House of Commons. By calling out a country that is supposed to be our friend in such a way, he was in essence accusing it of murder. However, nothing really happened. Then, 13 months later, we have an unprecedented emergency RCMP announcement, and six diplomats from India are kicked out of Canada in quite a dramatic fashion. This is done because 13 individuals are in peril and many more have been intimidated or coerced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636627">I mention this to say that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s unprecedented action did not seem to deliver any real results to stop foreign interference. It did nothing to fix the problem; in fact, it got worse. That really speaks to his lack of ability to ensure foreign interference in this country is brought to a stop. Certainly, anyone in this country who is connected to these illegal, criminal and murderous actions needs to be held fully accountable, full stop. We cannot, as a country, allow anybody or any foreign country to come in and murder, coerce or extort our citizens or threaten to take visas away. We have heard a lot of this going on with China as well, with election interference. We also see Russian disinformation, as well as intimidation of Iranian Canadians from the IRGC.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636628">It took the Liberal government about six years, I believe, of our calling for the Liberal government to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization. It took six years to ensure that standard in Canada to say that we would no longer engage and that this kind of foreign interference from Iran, for example, would no longer be allowed. It took many years for the Liberals to act on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636629">However, we have heard more and more about foreign interference in the last number of years, while in fact what we have seen from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are his repeated denials that there has been an issue. We saw this almost every day, beginning when there was a CSIS leak to The Globe and Mail regarding Chinese election interference in Canadian elections. “Nothing to see here” was really the message of the day from the Liberal government. In fact, they were more concerned about the leaks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636630">It was very much the case that Conservatives had to drag this government kicking and screaming to an authentic, professional, robust public inquiry into foreign interference, which we are finally seeing now, run by Justice Hogue, but it took a very long time to get there, and a lot of effort from us, to hold the government accountable and have that type of inquiry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636631">Members will remember that there was a sort of “in between” period when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> finally relented and decided to sort of do something about foreign interference. The Liberals had the David Johnston report, although it was found that he was quite close to Mr. Trudeau and was possibly not applying the most critical eye on what he may or may not have done on foreign interference, so that was in essence scrapped. Mr. Johnston quit midway through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636632">Then, finally, we got an authentic, professional, robust inquiry into foreign interference, but it took so long and so many leaks from CSIS to sound the alarm. In fact, if there had not been leaks from CSIS to The Globe and Mail, we would probably not even be here talking about foreign interference. They were the ones who blew the whistle because no one was listening to them. In fact, we have a lot of accounts of national security reports just not making it to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> desk. He was not reading them. This was not something that he was interested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636633">In fact, I would draw members' attention to a number of the quite concerning comments in the official report from the NSICOP committee about how seriously our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> takes foreign interference and perhaps why we got here.

              <ParaText id="8636637">I think Canadians should be concerned and I think that they are waking up to this. How did we get to a place where China, India, Iran, Russia and Pakistan are all just bullying Canada and intimidating our citizens and are allegedly connected to murder in some cases? This is very serious. How did we get here? Well, we have had the same <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for nine years, and it has never been worse. What does that say about his leadership? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636638">As Canadians, we should be calling on our government. In fact, the Privy Council Office, when the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> first got elected in 2015, had a very official report called “Open and Accountable Government”. It explicitly says that national security and international affairs are explicitly the special responsibility of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636639">What I have seen from this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are excuses. I have seen him not wanting to talk about it and dragging his feet, whether it is on China, India, Russia, Iran, Pakistan or others, yet it is solely his “special responsibility” according to his own “Open and Accountable Government” report from 2015, the governing document that was going to be the one document that this government would turn to to show Canadians what the responsibilities of ministers and the Prime Minister are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636640">National security is his special responsibility and his special responsibility alone, yet here we are, so I would say that he has failed in fulfilling his special responsibility to ensure that foreign interference is stopped and that our citizens are protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636641"> It has come to a point where there are allegations that foreign countries are literally murdering people in this country. Mr. Nijjar was a citizen.

              <ParaText id="8636642">In my last minute, I want to say that what would be real leadership in this regard is this: We know there is this list of names that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to have weaponized at this foreign interference inquiry, which is very disappointing. He has turned it into a circus. Other countries hold members of Parliament and others accountable by releasing the names of those individuals who have been in connection with foreign governments and working to undermine them. We have seen this in the United Kingdom with Christine Lee named and shamed by the U.K. government. Why is it we cannot know the names of the individuals who have been candidates and former parliamentarians or current ones? What is the Liberal government trying to hide when it will not release them? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636643">Things like that shed a real light and send a message to anyone looking to undermine Canada that we are going to find out what they are up to and who they are and that we will hold them accountable for it.

It is very transparent, in fact, why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> dropped this so-called bombshell and made a circus out of what was otherwise a very professional undertaking, the foreign interference inquiry. It is because his own caucus is looking to revolt. There has been an open rebellion within that caucus, and it came to a head this Wednesday.

According to some sources, when activists travel to Iran, their cell phones are confiscated. They are persecuted and interrogated, and they fear for the well-being of their families, who are also pressured and interrogated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636667">Reports from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, or CSIS, also showed that China targeted the members of Parliament who sponsored a motion to recognize the genocide of the Uyghurs, a motion to which I moved an amendment that was adopted. A representative from the Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project stated that Beijing is engaged in a systematic campaign of repression against this community. I am very familiar with the Uyghur community. Their word can be trusted. Uyghur Canadians have said that they could not share news of a joyful occasion with their family back home because communication had been blocked. He added that some Uyghurs in Canada do not even know if their family members are still alive or if they have died.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636668">Other diaspora communities on Canadian soil have the same concerns. I am thinking, for example, of the Hong Kong, Tibetan and Taiwanese diaspora communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636669">I asked my Liberal colleague a question earlier, but no one was able to give me an answer. On November 18, 2020, the House of Commons adopted a motion calling on the government to create a foreign agent registry. That was on November 18, 2020. The federal government did not begin public consultations on the creation of a foreign agent registry until March 2023. When I am told that these things take time because they are bills that have a real impact on people's lives, that is not true. The government did not start drafting a bill. It started the consultations in 2023, even though the motion was adopted in the fall of 2020. At that point, foreign interference had been known to be a problem for a long time, and yet the government still dragged its feet on this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636670">It is worth noting that the government did everything in its power to avoid a public inquiry into foreign interference in the election. As members will recall, it denied our requests over and over. After several months of the opposition hounding the government and the public losing all confidence in the so-called special rapporteur, the Liberal government was forced to give in and open a public inquiry. It took time. I even held a press conference with representatives from all the communities targeted by the Chinese Communist regime. We had Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese people and Uyghurs there with us. Three days later, the special rapporteur decided to resign and a public inquiry was launched.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636671">That inquiry is how we learned that although the member for <Affiliation DbId="278488" Type="2">Don Valley North</Affiliation> initially claimed to know nothing about the help he illegally received from China during his nomination, he actually knew more than he publicly let on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636672">After denying the problem of foreign interference for years, delaying the public inquiry into foreign interference and then also delaying the implementation of a foreign agent registry, as suggested by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278766" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>, the Canadian government finally seems to recognize the problem. Yes, I did say “seems to”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636673">The Bloc Québécois thinks it was appropriate to expel the Indian diplomats identified by the RCMP as having played a role in the attacks on Canadian citizens. Nonetheless, I want to note that, today, we are seeing the extent to which foreign actors feel they can act with impunity in Canada. It is the detrimental consequence of successive governments, Conservative and Liberal alike, deciding to turn a blind eye for commercial or electoral reasons. The negligence of consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments has led foreign states to believe they are free to attack Canadian sovereignty and democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636674">On October 14, the RCMP confirmed that India was behind the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia on June 18, 2023. Diplomats from the Indian high commission allegedly hired criminals to assassinate this Sikh opponent. According to the available information, the Indian high commission was engaged in other clandestine activities, including intelligence gathering for the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636675">When Parliament resumed in the fall of 2023, the federal government finally reacted to the Indian government's interference when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> publicly accused India of murdering Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. However, he did that without having any real plan for what to do next, particularly in terms of Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636676">Many people, including the Bloc Québécois, are wondering about the Prime Minister of Canada's highly questionable choice to level allegations against India the first day Parliament resumed in September 2023, but that is not surprising. The Canadian government does not seem to have a plan when it comes to foreign affairs or international relations in general. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278679" Type="2">Montarville</Affiliation>, has been disheartened to see this day after day, week after week, month after month, in short, since our work resumed in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636677">Most of the time, as parliamentarians, we get a sense that this government is making up its approach to foreign affairs as it goes. Back in 2015, members will recall, the Prime Minister said “Canada is back” in reference to Canada's place in the world. I think it would have been more appropriate to say that “Canada is in the back”. That is where we are today. We are in the back, unable to keep up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636678">We got proof positive of that today. A Quebec sovereigntist was the one who said it: Canada absolutely must get back to being a serious player on the international stage. As I said earlier, the foreign interference problem is nothing new. It has been out in the open for a long time, yet successive governments have really dragged their feet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636679">The first victims of this foreign interference are not necessarily Canada's democratic institutions. It is possible, but the very first victims of foreign interference are often opponents who sought refuge in Canada and in Quebec. They are people who thought they were safe. Now, they look at what is going on, watch the news, read the newspapers and they see foreign powers doing as they please on Canadian soil, even attacking foreign nationals who came here looking for a safe haven.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636680">Some of my Uyghur friends used to ask me if I feared for my safety because I was banned from China as a result of my work with the Uyghurs. I have never feared for my safety, and I never would. I am a Canadian parliamentarian; they are not crazy enough to come after me. However, it is different for the people I work with such as the Uyghurs, people from Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan and so on. These people have family back in China. The Uyghurs are just one example. They are the brave ones. They are scared witless because they have family members who are stuck over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636681">Today, when they turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to the radio, they learn that Canada is allowing foreign agents within its borders.

              <ParaText id="8636682">It is absolutely necessary that we have this debate tonight. The government needs to wake up and understand what foreign interference is. Yes, foreign interference in our elections is harmful, but the primary victims are real people. These are men, women and children who fear for their own safety and for the safety of their families. This government needs to wake up. The Conservatives need to act responsibly and in a non-partisan manner. This needs to be resolved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636700">Mr. Speaker, tonight we are talking about foreign interference. After listening to all of my colleagues' speeches and concerns, it occurred to me that the word “interference” rhymes with the words “negligence”, “indifference” and “complacence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636701">Consider water as an analogy. When water seeps in, when it erodes a road or shoreline, it does not happen suddenly. It happens gradually. We are here, tonight, debating foreign interference because of the previous governments' negligence and, I would say, their indifference, with one consequence being the assassination of a Sikh Canadian on Canadian soil. India considered this person a terrorist, but the RCMP questioned him and did not see fit to extradite him. Nevertheless, international regard for Canada is so low that India, through its representatives, managed to send contract killers to murder a Sikh Canadian. This is no trivial matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636702">Tonight we can also talk about the fact that, when it comes to interference, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader </Affiliation> is more interested in being free to promote his video clips than in discovering the truth. A respectable and careful attitude would involve going to the source to find out what the whole thing is about, especially since it also appears that people in certain parties were involved in foreign interference or may have been targeted by it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636703"> I would like to clarify something so that people understand. A Conservative member said earlier that Conservatives deserve the credit for the fact that we have a foreign agent registry and that the government was unwilling to create a foreign agent registry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636704">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278766" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> tried to make that happen. His name was chosen in the private members' draw and he drafted a bill to create such a registry. In the end, the government introduced a bill in that regard, Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document>, but not until four years later. The government reacted. I have to give it credit for that, but it did so four years later, or as we say in my riding, an hour later in the Maritimes, which shows that the government did not really take this seriously. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636705">There is a conflict between India and Punjab. Punjab is a province of India that borders Pakistan and India, and the Sikh community in India would like to create a country, a state, called Khalistan. The Sikh separatists are claiming their corner of the world, based on their religion, and the Indian government has totally prevented the Sikhs from obtaining that recognition since the partition of India in 1947.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636706">This conflict, which has been going on since that time, has been marked by acts of extreme violence perpetrated by both Indian governments and Sikh representatives. These include the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the bombing of an Air India flight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636707">The conflict finally reached Canada's shores in 2023, when Mr. Nijjar was assassinated. The absolute worst thing a country can do is fail to defend and protect the people who live there. That is the absolute worst thing, from a disrespected G7 country. People are coming here to commit their crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636708">Canada then decided to react by expelling diplomats. We supported that. The Indian government also retaliated. What is important to remember in this story, however, is that interference in a country does not happen overnight. Give them an inch, they will take a mile. The more the government loosens the reins, the more it will come to realize that it has zero control at any given time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636709">I identify first and foremost as a Quebecker, as everyone knows, but I find it embarrassing as a parliamentarian in this place that we have reached this point. What I also find embarrassing is how long it took the government to be transparent. It did not want a commission on foreign interference. It appointed a special rapporteur to buy some time. The rapporteur then said what we thought he would say, namely, that there was nothing there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636710">There is nothing there? Come on. Perhaps we were talking about foreign interference based on election results, but interference is much broader than that, and we wanted a commission to clear up the issue of foreign interference in all its forms once and for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636711">When I say that “interference” rhymes with “indifference”, “complacence” and “negligence”, that is what I am talking about. I do not think many people would tell me I am wrong. Even on the government side, I would find it hard to believe that they did not realize they were asleep at the switch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636712">This issue was raised by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> when he said that the government was dragging its feet. I do not understand. During his first four years in power, when his government had a majority, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seemed to be focusing only on matters of foreign policy and neglecting domestic matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636713">Then he had to deal with a pandemic that revealed all the Conservative government's failures that he should have addressed, but did not. He did not care. The Prime Minister travelled around the world, but what for? Given the state of foreign interference, we have to wonder what it was all for. He took a trip to India and took some nice photos for the upcoming election, but he could not even thoroughly, properly and respectably address an issue like the one that ended in the murder of a Canadian national.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636714">I am a little ashamed of that, not because I care that much about the Prime Minister and his indifference, but because if Quebec were a country, this type of thing would certainly never happen there.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636723">Mr. Speaker, according to what the Prime Minister said under oath, one political party has some problems with foreign interference. There could be people in that party who are more likely to be faced with that. I am trying to choose my words carefully. These people could be influenced or could be dealing with foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636724">When a prime minister says something like that under oath, the Leader of the Opposition, who is responsible for a political party and who aspires to hold the highest rank in the House of Commons, must look into that and must get the necessary information. It is a matter of trust. He must be able to take stock of the situation. He cannot just using lying as an excuse to spread fear. Politicians have to be responsible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636726">I would like to ask my colleague if he can help me reconcile the fact that in Canada, separatist movements from Quebec, such as the Bloc Québécois, are democratically represented in the House of Commons by elected officials, whereas in India or other countries, the state often accuses Sikh separatists of extremism and violence, rather than inviting them to take part in peaceful, democratic political discourse.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636728">Madam Speaker, I am indeed an independence activist, or, as my rivals would say, a separatist. India calls its Sikh citizens separatists. My belief in independence is based on democratic values. I have said before that I am a sovereigntist, because the democratic ideal is rooted in the sovereignty of the people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636729">In that sense, I do not think any comparison is possible between Quebec separatists and Sikh separatists. Our movement is not based on religion, and I can think of few violent episodes or years in the history of our movement. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636731"> Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636732">New Democrats fundamentally believe, as do many people in the House, that Canadians have the right to feel safe. They should feel safe in their homes. They should be safe when they go to work, at their places of work and when they come back home again. I know, though, that when guns and gangs are involved and bullets are flying, no one is safe. Even if it is a particular target, there is an impact on everyone in that community. This includes everyone who is walking around the block, kids who are playing in the streets and kids who are playing at a park nearby; everyone is at risk when there is violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636733">The reality is that what we have learned from the RCMP is something that I do not think any of us have heard in our lifetime. The RCMP has credible evidence that a foreign government directed, engaged, hired and instructed gang members in Canada to commit acts of violence against Canadians. That is an outrageous scenario, but it is where we find ourselves. That foreign government is the Indian government. The Modi government hired gangs to target Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636734">I remember receiving numerous calls from people across the country saying that they were being extorted, that they were worried about the rise in violence in their communities and that they were worried about gun violence. There was an increase in car robberies as well. The RCMP said, in a very shocking statement regarding the length and breadth of the crime that we saw in the past year, that there are significant ties to gang activities directed, allegedly, by Indian government agents, by Indian government diplomats. They were expelled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636735">From the beginning, when we started seeing more and more mounting evidence of foreign interference, New Democrats took it seriously; we said we needed a public inquiry. This is not something for partisan games. This is something to be looked at with the seriousness and the independence of an inquiry, so we can have clear recommendations that keep Canadians safe from interference. At every turn, the Liberals put up blockades. They said no. They said that a public inquiry was not necessary. We had to fight to get to the public inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636736">What is even worse is the fact that, in the House of Commons, there is only one leader of a federal party who refuses to get security clearance. There is only one federal leader who refuses to find out what is actually going on. I believe that we need a united front; Canadians expect our leaders to come together and say that, if a foreign government is engaging in a campaign of terror on Canadians, we are all going to stand together and denounce that; we are all going to say it is wrong. The behaviour of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> shows the Modi government that there is one leader in Canada willing to look the other way, who does not want to know the details about this foreign interference. He does not want to know what is going on or have additional information that could help keep Canada safer and could address the allegations of foreign interference that touch his own party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636737">Let us recap what the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> knows. He knows there are allegations about his own leadership contest and a previous leadership contest for the Conservative Party of Canada, saying that foreign governments were involved in some element of interference. Specifically, there are allegations about the Indian government. He knows that. It is in the public discourse. He also knows that members of his caucus and/or candidates are also potentially compromised. He knows that he could seek security clearance. He has been offered that opportunity, yet he refuses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636738">Refusing to get a security clearance means that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> will allow the rot in his party to continue. He is clearly saying that he is not prioritizing Canada; instead, he is putting his partisan interests ahead of the country. He is saying that protecting his party is more important than protecting the country, and he is wrong in that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636739">In today's emergency debate, one thing is clear. We need to send a very clear message to the Indian government that parliamentarians stand united against this type of activity: criminal behaviour, putting Canadians' lives at risk and putting our security and safety at risk. All of us take this seriously, and that is why I urge the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> to get his security clearance, find out what is going on and take the necessary steps to protect his party and, most importantly, our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636740">Turning back to the federal government, there are additional steps we are calling for. We said that we need a Canada-India relations committee to look at the ongoing elements of interference by the Indian government. It would keep this front and centre in our minds, so we can constantly make sure that every step possible is being taken to keep Canadians safe and that any material is reviewed as it comes forward. We have also demanded an emergency meeting of the public safety committee to review additional steps to keep Canadians safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636741">We are calling on the government to work with our allies. We know that the United States is currently dealing with a similar series of circumstances involving the attempted assassination of an American citizen. The American government has laid charges. It has charged Indian agents, and it is looking for an additional investigation and inquiry into this. The United Kingdom has also taken steps and is involved in a similar scenario, in which the Indian government is alleged to have interfered with its citizens. Three G7 nations need to work together to send a clear message of denunciation of these heinous acts of violence being perpetrated by the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636742">In addition, we have called for another series of measures. There is a violent, extremist, right-wing organization known as the RSS. It is a militant group based out of India that promotes violence against minority communities; it is very divisive, and it has branches across the world, including here in Canada. It needs to be banned. We want the most severe of consequences for anyone found to be involved in this campaign of terror against Canadians, whether as orchestrators on the Indian government side or as individuals carrying out those acts of violence. Everyone needs to be brought to justice and have the full weight of the law imposed upon them. We also want severe and strict sanctions imposed on the diplomats involved. They were expelled, but severe diplomatic sanctions are needed to send a clear message of denunciation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636743">Finally, what we are hearing from many Canadians is that they are worried about whether there is an information-sharing arrangement between Canada and India. The Indian government has engaged criminal gangs to commit various sorts of violence against Canadians. In light of those allegations, we should be pausing information sharing with that country. We should not be giving intelligence regarding Canadian citizens to a country and a government alleged to have hired gangs to commit violence against Canadians for over a year, including by killing Canadians. This is a time to acknowledge the fear and the worry that Canadians have, as well as the real pain that Canadians are going through. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636744">People have suffered from the impacts of that violence. Canadians have lost loved ones because of it. There are those living with the trauma of having experienced the violence, of being threatened, of being harassed and of having guns fired at their homes. Business owners have been traumatized by extortion. Given how serious this is, New Democrats have said very clearly that this is a moment in which we need to put Canada first and party second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636745">I ask everyone in the House to put the country first; to put the safety and security of Canadians first; and to put the safety and security of our democracy, our sovereignty and our nation first. I ask them to protect Canadians and do the right thing.</ParaText>

This is what is going on in Canada. This is the RCMP's evidence being brought before Canadians, so we need to take it seriously. All leaders need to realize that the priority now is keeping Canada safe. All Canadians are at risk when a foreign government is so cavalier that it engages in dangerous activities in that way.

              <ParaText id="8636757"> Madam Speaker, the truth is exactly as the member described it: People are very afraid. I met with community members who talk about the impact this has had on their lives. I have talked to folks who just hear about this and are worried about what it means. People who have seen the impacts of guns and gangs in their lives know that, if more guns and gangs are encouraged, incited, promoted or supported, it means that everyone's life is at risk. It means there is more danger and less security. People feel a deep sense of unease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636758">We have a responsibility in the House; we need to make a commitment that we are going to do everything possible to keep people safe. As the member pointed out, there are serious critiques of both the Liberals and Conservatives. The Liberals have been very slow to act. In fact, they have resisted action time and time again. Far worse, the Conservatives do not even want to act. They do not want to know what is going on.

              <ParaText id="8636759">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise for the very serious emergency debate that has seized the House of Commons, which was brought forward by the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>, the member for Burnaby South. What we are talking about tonight is, of course, the very serious allegations that have come forward over the last week, presented by the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636760"> Before I get into the crux of my speech tonight, I want to say that as the member of Parliament for Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, I represent a fairly large South Asian population. I want to tell them directly that we are taking this issue seriously. I know there is a lot of fear in that community, and I know there are some very complicated relationships with the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636761"> I also want to say that I bear no personal ill will toward the country of India or the Government of India, but the circumstances that have presented themselves to us demand that we as parliamentarians stand up and act. No self-respecting country would let these types of allegations slip by without a firm and serious response. That is precisely what we in the NDP are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636762">Let us go back to the bombshell RCMP announcement that came on Thanksgiving Monday, October 14, which presented evidence that agents of the Government of India were involved in “serious criminal activity in Canada”: homicides, extortions and other criminal acts of violence; the use of organized crime to create a perception of an unsafe environment targeting the South Asian community in Canada; and, of course, interference in the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636763">This is not new. This is something our country has been exposed to for over a year. It started in September 2023 when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood in this chamber and used the power given to him as a member of cabinet to make an explosive statement about the Government of India's interference in our internal processes. Since then, the Hogue commission has released an interim report, and in that report, we see references to India's clandestine activities littered throughout. That was followed, of course, by the report of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which detailed everything India has been doing, from election interference to the use of criminal activity to terrorize the South Asian population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636764">This is not just coming from hearsay. Both of these reports are based on credible and solid intelligence gathered by the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. It is from the men and women out there in the field working on our country's behalf, and they are ringing the alarm bell of what India and other countries are currently doing in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636765">I think the most worrying part of the NSICOP report is in paragraph 73. I am going to quote it because it was quite the revelation: “This paragraph was deleted to remove injurious or privileged information. The paragraph described India’s alleged interference in a Conservative Party of Canada leadership race.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636766">We know those tentacles are running deep. We know that members of Parliament for several months now have been operating under a cloud of suspicion because some members have been named as witting or semi-witting participants in foreign interference. They are taking direction and sometimes monetary resources from a foreign power to do that power's bidding and to influence the processes in this place. Canadians have a right to be concerned about that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636767">We came together in a rare moment at the end of June as the spring session was running out and passed Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document>. The Senate then passed it in short order and it found its way to the Governor General to receive royal assent. I was directly involved in that bill. I serve as the NDP's public safety critic and serve on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. The bill gave our law enforcement and intelligence agencies the important legislative tools they need in order to do their jobs. In fact, I talked with many CSIS members, and they felt that with the previous law, they were operating under an analog law that was out of sorts with what is required in the digital world. It is not enough, though, because we find ourselves here today following October 14 and the RCMP's announcements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636768">I briefly want to go over what the NDP has been doing since then, because we are the party in this place demonstrating to Canadians a solid commitment to uncovering the truth on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636769">We started off last week by spearheading a call for an emergency meeting of the public safety committee. I led the way in getting unanimous support for that, which is very rare. We had a meeting on Friday and were able to pass a motion to start a study on this. We are going to call upon the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, national security experts and members of the RCMP to come before our committee to provide us with the answers that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636770">That motion successfully passed, and I would like to thank members from all parties for passing it, as it was unanimous. I followed that motion up with another one, which basically called on the committee to report to the House the need for “all federal party leaders to apply for the appropriate security clearance level in the next 30 days in order to review classified information and take necessary actions to protect Canadians.” However, the Conservatives immediately started filibustering that motion, and I suspect they are going to continue tomorrow. They are the only party in this place whose <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> has refused to get the necessary security clearance to protect Canadians, and that is absolutely shameful. I will get back to that near the end of my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636771">Today, our <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> asked for unanimous consent to establish a special committee on Canada-India relations, and unfortunately the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> rushed in to shout out no. At a time like this, when we need to focus our attention on the fraught relationship between our two countries, it is absolutely unbelievable that the Liberals would say no to the formation of a special committee to investigate this very serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636772">That brings us to the emergency debate tonight, which was spearheaded by the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> and has allowed members of Parliament to stand in this place and report back on the serious things that are happening in our communities. We will not waiver on this issue. We will continue to show the leadership necessary to get to the bottom of it. When the Liberals and the Conservatives are too busy throwing insults at each other, the country needs moral clarity. It needs to see leadership that stands up on behalf of all Canadians, and the NDP will continue to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636773">I have been listening to the Conservatives dodge, weave and provide the most flimsy excuses for their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> not getting security clearance. Let me note what some of the top national security experts in Canada have said. I am talking about former CSIS executives and former advisers to prime ministers, both Liberal and Conservative.

              <ParaText id="8636786">Last week, the RCMP independently and publicly released extremely disturbing and serious conclusions about the involvement of the agents of the Indian government and serious criminal activity taking place in Canada, including coercion, extortion, interference in democratic processes, spying, arson and homicides. In fact there are links to Indian diplomats collecting information about Canadians and passing it along to organized crime groups that have directly targeted the members of the Sikh and South Asian communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636787">Let us be very clear. These acts are a grave violation of Canadian sovereignty, and we will never tolerate any form of foreign interference in Canadian society. As Canadians know, since the allegations that the Government of India was directly involved in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Canadian diplomats and law enforcement agencies made repeated attempts to work with the Government of India, but each time it failed to co-operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636788">After almost a year of inaction, obstruction and delays from the Government of India, earlier this month our security agencies presented Indian officials with clear and conclusive evidence that six Indian officials were involved in serious criminal activity linked to extortion, spying, arson and homicides of Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636789">Still, despite these very serious allegations, the Indian government has refused to co-operate in the investigation. Therefore our government took the necessary steps to expel six Indian diplomats from Canada. In the interest of maintaining public safety and protecting Canadians, the RCMP independently made the decision to disclose this information to Canadians in an effort to disable and disrupt the violent criminal activities taking place in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636790">Let us be clear. We will always stand up for a Canadian's right to feel safe and secure in their community. We will never tolerate attempts from any foreign government to intimidate or harass Canadians. Right now, as we speak, our police agencies and law enforcement agencies are working around the clock to disrupt and disable the transnational criminal activity by the Indian government and to ensure that everyone who is responsible for this grave violation of our sovereignty is held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636791">The RCMP has been working alongside police agencies across the country, including in my own community of Brampton with the Peel Regional Police, in Toronto, in Surrey and in Edmonton, to leave no stone unturned in its investigation. I want to take a moment to thank the RCMP for its tremendous leadership, for the work of our men and women in uniform and for their collaboration at every step.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636792">At the same time, our security agencies are also working with our allies in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, which have come to support us in our investigation. They have joined us in urging the Indian government to co-operate in the investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636793">Canada is a country that is rooted in the rule of law. We will never back down when it comes to protecting the rights of Canadians. The right of an individual to express their opinion and the right to peacefully protest are fundamental aspects of our democracy, aspects that all democratic nations should be working to protect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636794">I know that the events of the past week have left many members of the South Asian community, particularly the Sikh Canadian community, including my own in Brampton West, feeling anxious, upset and even scared. I want to take an opportunity to speak directly to the members of the Sikh community. As a proud Sikh myself, I want all Sikh Canadians to know that we see them, we hear them and we stand with them. They can know that their federal Liberal government, under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and of our colleagues who are here with me, is there every step of the way to ensure accountability for those responsible, to protect Canadians and to defend Canadian sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636795">I have also heard a lot of concerns from members of my community about the impact they think the issue is having on our relationship with India. Let us start by first acknowledging the fact that no one wanted to be in this situation. Canada and India have deep historical and cultural ties that I see every single day in my own community. Our families are connected and our cultures are connected, and we want this to be resolved. That is why we have been trying to work with the Indian government through our security agencies, through our diplomats and through our law enforcement agencies in order to find some way to resolve the issue, to protect Canadians and to ensure that there will be accountability and consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636796">However, unfortunately the Government of India did not choose to work with us. Simply put, we find ourselves in this situation because time and time again the Government of India refused to co-operate. Right now the safety and security of Canadians is our top priority. We will continue to do everything in our power to keep Canadians safe, and if anyone in the community has any information that could help an investigation, or if anyone is feeling unsafe, they should get in touch with their local law enforcement service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636797">During these uncertain times, we know it is not always easy to know what is true and what is false, particularly in online spaces. We know that this is especially difficult due to the misinformation and disinformation campaigns from India targeting the South Asian community, as has been presented by the Justice Hogue report on foreign interference, but we must be firm in recognizing and rejecting false rhetoric to stop it from entering our media and our community spaces. That is why it is so critical that we stay grounded in the facts and listen to our law enforcement and national security agencies as we seek the truth together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636798">Over the coming months, there will be full investigations and trials that will come before the courts. I want all Canadians to know that there will be justice and accountability for those people who are guilty, through our independent judicial system. However, right now as we navigate these challenging times and the feeling of anxiety, we know that our community is resilient, that our community is strong and that our community will get through this together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636799">Let me also take a moment to remind the Government of India that we will not tolerate any form of intimidation, harassment or harmful targeting of communities in Canada. This is a time for unity. Right now we as Canadians, regardless of political stripe, faith, race or religion, must unite and be steadfast in our values as Canadians: our values of freedom, of acceptance and of democracy, and above all our fundamental belief in the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636800">However, I have to say it is disappointing to see that in such a critical time for our country and for Canadians, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative opposition</Affiliation> has repeatedly refused to step up and protect Canadians by getting his security clearance. Canadians expect their leaders to be informed and to take action when it comes to things as important as national security and sovereignty, yet he is the only party leader in this place who has refused to get his security clearance in order to know the facts and to protect our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636801">Let us be very clear that foreign interference costs lives. The safety and security of Canadians and our democracy are at stake here. This is not a political matter. It is a matter of national security, and it is absolutely shameful to see the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative opposition</Affiliation> continue to put his own political interests above our national security and the safety and well-being of Canadians.</ParaText>

Such activity appears to have been conducted with the specific aim of creating a particularly threatening environment for Canadians of South Asian heritage and were connected to the revelations last year that the Indian government may have been implicated in the murder of the late Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636825"> Unfortunately, there appears to be a pattern of similar illegal tactics being used against diaspora communities across the western world. Just four days ago, the American Department of Justice indicted Vikash Yadav, a former Indian intelligence officer tied to a murder plot against a Sikh activist in New York City. Activists in the United Kingdom have also expressed fear of retaliation and violence from the Indian government, making it clear that such threats are not solely limited to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636826">I want to take this moment to commend our allies for their support in the last few difficult days. The United States and the United Kingdom have publicly and openly called on the Government of India to fully co-operate with our investigation and have expressed their unconditional confidence in our judicial system and our staunch adherence to the rule of law. Now it is more important than ever that the democratic countries of the international community come together to close ranks given the common perils that confront us all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636827">Some may say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, yet it is clear that the RCMP and the government have diligently investigated these claims following a thorough and methodological investigation. Last year, a credible link emerged between the operations of the Indian high commission and the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636828"> We have repeatedly requested co-operation from the Indian government. At every step in this process, Canada has been open about its investigation and has shared the RCMP's evidence with Indian officials. However, the Indian government has decided to not co-operate. It is absolutely integral that we take steps to signal to India and the world that such actions are completely unacceptable and that our procedures are not open to negotiation or to be adhered to à la carte. Rather, we will pursue any challenge to our national security forthrightly and with full integrity. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="45">(2045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636829"> Fundamentally, at our core, Canada as a nation has always demonstrated a commitment to the rule of law. We do not investigate, indict and prosecute without clear evidence warranting the attention of our law enforcement agencies and in strict pursuance of our judicial system. Any entity, whether or not it involves the backing of any state, cannot engage in malign actions without bringing the full attention and weight of our government to bear against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636830"> As a member of Parliament, I am committed to ensuring the safety and security of all Canadians. It is clear that the Sikh community in Canada, which numbers approximately 770,000, deserves our full protection and support now more than ever before. Despite our efforts, it is disheartening to see the Indian government's unacceptable response. Rather than engage with our investigation and help or assist us in uncovering the truth, the Indian government has systematically shrugged off any attempt at co-operation. Ultimately, this is a sad development. For over 75 years, our two countries have built deep, historical, cultural and economic links. Our relationship has always been underpinned by mutual respect and co-operation. By working together, our two respective countries have achieved great things for Canada and India. It is highly unfortunate and regrettable to see our mutual relationship threatened by the Indian government's obfuscation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636831">In conclusion, let me affirm that our commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law are sacrosanct. They do not admit of any exception. We are Canadians, and we pursue the law without fear or favour. We must stand firm in ensuring that no organization or country is able to engage in the repression and intimidation of Canadians. While we will continue to dialogue with India, we should draw upon our allies to stress the importance of co-operation in addressing these very serious allegations. All parties in the House must come together to support our government's efforts to fully uphold the safety of all our citizens by jealously respecting international norms, due process and the rule of law. A failure to stand together with respect to the allegations regarding the Indian government would send every country in the world with malign intent the signal that we are not resolute in protecting the rights of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636832"> I thank all members for their attention to this critical matter. Let us stand united in our pursuit of justice and the protection of our citizens and ensure that ties between Canada and India are based on mutual respect and accountability.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636843">The very serious revelations by the RCMP last Monday should be taken with the utmost seriousness. The RCMP has alleged that Indian diplomats and consular officials based in Canada were participating in foreign interference in Canada. To most Canadians, this might come as a shock that this could be happening in Canada. This is something the Sikh community has known about and was vindicated by what the RCMP alleged just last week. The community has been talking about this over the last 40 years. This is very close to the heart of the Sikh community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636844">As was mentioned by the deputy leader, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278483" Type="2">Edmonton Mill Woods</Affiliation>, there is a big difference in what has happened over those 40 years.

              <ParaText id="8636852">Canadians should feel safe in Canada, full stop. Their families should feel safe and our communities should feel safe. Canadians should be safe from extortion, murder and threats of violence, but after nine years of the Liberal government, Canadians do not feel safe anymore. Canada has become a safe haven and a playground for foreign interference under the Liberal-NDP government after nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636853">Just last year, a Canadian was killed on Canadian soil and the RCMP alleged that was done by a foreign government. In that case, it was by India. It is a very difficult time in Canada right now. Many do not feel safe. Many do not feel this is Canada anymore. Whether people were born here and grew up here or immigrated here, like my family and millions of others, the one common thing heard across the country is that Canada is not Canada anymore. Many people left their countries because it was unsafe, only to come to Canada and now feel that Canadians are not safe on Canadian soil anymore. I spoke about the Sikh community advocating for this. As I said, it is a stark difference in the change that has taken place in Canada for many diaspora communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636854"> We must realize one thing, which is that a criminal in Canada is a criminal and a Canadian is a Canadian. This is not a religious or a cultural fight. This is for the safety and sovereignty of Canadians. The security of Canadians is at risk after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government. As I have said many times, people just do not feel safe here anymore. There is no safety for their children. Extortions are up. Violent crime is up. All of these things have been happening because of soft-on-crime policies. That is the reality of living in Canada today. That is why so many people do not feel safe here anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636855">Last year, the U.S. government foiled an assassination plot. It went from allegations to an arrest within one week. By contrast, here in Canada, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made allegations and then it just went quiet. Canadians felt more unsafe after they heard that news because they did not see action being taken. That is the problem. There has been no action taken by the government about some of the serious crimes taking place in this country. In fact, it has become a playground for these types of activities to take place because it does not seem like there is serious leadership in this country anymore after nine years of the Prime Minister. Communities at large started feeling unsafe at that point. They felt like there was no law to protect them anymore and that they had to fend for their own communities. That is the reality after nine years. That is how diaspora communities are feeling today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636856">Canada is at a very critical point right now in stopping foreign interference. This should be a wake-up call to the Liberal government that is soft on crime.

I have a statement here from Richard Fadden, who served as the former CSIS director, who said, “I really think the Leader of the Opposition should accept a security clearance so that he can be briefed in detail. All of these other politicians seem to be able to function and fulfill their duties as members of the opposition while still having some measure of briefing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636873">At this point in time, and this is the most important thing, the last thing we need to send to India is a message that we are not united on this point, because it will take advantage of that point and use it in India, and it has. We have seen a former army official who is serving as a state media commentator in India now who said that India should spend $100 million to take down the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada. Why is that happening now? We are not united on this, and the member is talking about not being political.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636883">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278483" Type="2">Edmonton Mill Woods</Affiliation> for bringing forward an extortion bill that, I must remind everyone, the Liberals and the NDP voted against.

              <ParaText id="8636885">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278287" Type="2">Mississauga—Malton</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636886"> On June 18, 2023, a community leader from my riding of Surrey—Newton, Mr. Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was brutally assassinated outside the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, Surrey-Delta, which is also in my constituency. This shocking act has severely affected Sikh Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636887">At that time, many in the community alleged that this heinous crime was coordinated by the Government of India. In September 2023, the Prime Minister stood in this House and addressed members, stating that there is credible information linking the Government of India to Mr. Nijjar's assassination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636888">In recent years we have witnessed a disturbing rise in serious crimes targeting Sikh Canadians and others from the South Asian community, leaving many feeling anxious and unsafe. Last week the commissioner of the RCMP confirmed long-held suspicions within the community, that agents of the Government of India have engaged in activities that pose significant threats to our public safety, including threats of violence and murder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636889">The RCMP has obtained evidence that proves four very serious issues, including violent extremism; links tying agents from the Government of India to homicides and violent acts; the use of organized crime to create a perception of an unsafe environment targeting Sikh Canadians and others from the South Asian community; and interference into our democratic processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636890">Although the RCMP and national security officials have sought the collaboration of the Government of India on this matter, it has repeatedly refused to co-operate. The RCMP provided evidence to Indian officials indicating that six agents of the Government of India are persons of interest in these criminal activities, yet despite multiple requests, Indian officials have opted not to co-operate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636891">As a result, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> took significant action by issuing deportation notices for those six individuals, ensuring they can no longer act as diplomats in Canada or re-enter our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636892">The evidence presented by the RCMP cannot be overlooked. This is why our government has acted swiftly to try to disrupt criminal activities that continue to threaten public safety in Canada. Every Canadian deserves to feel safe. Canada is a nation built on diversity, peace and inclusion. We cannot and will not tolerate hate and violence. Our government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians feel secure in their own country. This situation raises serious questions about international relations and highlights our core values of justice, democracy and the rule of law. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636893">As Canadians, we take pride in our commitment to human rights and the principles of freedom and safety for all, regardless of background or beliefs. The credible allegations regarding the Government of India's involvement in violence and intimidation against Canadians are troubling and require our full attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636894">I have listened to the fears of many Canadians, including the residents of Surrey—Newton. When I go with my hon. colleague and dear friend from <Affiliation DbId="278676" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation> to talk to the community, we get one message: Community members are anxious about their safety and well-being. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636895">It is heartbreaking to hear their stories. I personally know of many individuals who have been targets of extortion in which money, services or information has been demanded through threats and intimidation. This not only impacts the victims but also tarnishes the image of Sikh communities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636896">Victims of extortion experience psychological trauma, financial loss and a sense of insecurity. The effects can lead to the breakdown of trust within diaspora communities, as fears may deter individuals from speaking out or seeking help. It is imperative that if anyone feels threatened, whether online or in person, they report the incidents to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636897">Since 1984, the democratic and human rights of Sikhs have been undermined globally, including right here in Canada. Many Sikhs have lost their lives in India and around the world. We must emphasize the importance of unity during these challenging times. It is crucial that we come together to condemn these heinous acts and uphold the principle of the rule of law. Our shared values demand that we address these threats head-on, supporting those affected and advocating for justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636898">Canada is founded on justice, fairness and inclusivity. Let us uphold these values and ensure they prevail in the face of adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636899">In conclusion, let us stand united as a nation that values justice and human rights. We must support the ongoing investigations with integrity and transparency, ensuring that the truth prevails. Together we can reaffirm our commitment to a Canada that protects the rights and dignity of all citizens, fostering a society where everyone can live freely and without fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636900">There is one other thing that bothers me, and I am hearing day in and day out from my constituents that every other leader in the House of Commons from every party, Bloc, NDP, Liberal and Green, all four of them, have taken their security clearance and looked at the evidence so they can come together, united, to work as a team and take action against the foreign government. There is only one leader, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, who is not taking that security clearance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="20">(2120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636901"> The word out there is that if he takes that security clearance and looks at that evidence, then he certainly would have to stand with other leaders and defend Canada instead of being on the side of India. That is the message the leader of the Conservative Party, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, is sending, and some of the members of his caucus are defending him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636902">I feel ashamed, and in fact they should be feeling ashamed as well with respect to what the Sikh community is facing, as some of them belong to the Sikh community. I would request the Leader of the Opposition to take the oath for security clearance and come up with the support shown by every other leader to protect Canadians and their safety. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636916"> Madam Speaker, it was a little over a year ago when I rose in this very chamber and called on all Canadians to unite. It was earlier that week when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood in this House to tell all Canadians that our security agencies had been actively pursuing allegations of a link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen. Since that time, much has taken place. I wish now to speak to all Canadians once more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636917">Last week the RCMP announced that it had indeed found evidence that agents of the Government of India are actively involved in a network of criminal activity here in Canada, including homicide, extortion, organized crime and interference in our democratic process, a network of crime that could even mean the involvement of some of India's highest-ranking diplomats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636918">In the RCMP's own words, an “extraordinary situation” compelled the RCMP to speak about an ongoing investigation. Despite law enforcement action over the past year, harm has continued to emanate from agents of the Government of India, so much so that the RCMP reached a pivotal point at which it had to confront that government and inform the public here of its very serious findings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636919">Let me be clear: The security of Canadians is our top priority. Our justice system will be relentless in holding accountable those persons who seek to harm any Canadian, regardless of their position or proximity to power, because the stakes could not be higher. It is clear that what occurred last year was not an isolated incident, and we continue to learn about the extent of the interference still. It is a culture of intimidation, endangering those in our communities. It is stunningly brazen interference in our democratic process, and in the worst of cases, it has manifested itself, as we have learned, in the deaths of fellow citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636920">The allegations levied against the Indian government, backed by evidence, demonstrate that we will not tolerate acts of violence. We will not tolerate efforts to retaliate against Canadians for simply exercising their constitutionally protected rights. These acts are a great example of the increased violent transnational repression that is targeting diaspora communities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636921">The core of the message that I seek to deliver today is the same that I delivered last September. It is our sovereignty, plain and simple, that is at stake, and defending it wholeheartedly requires all of us to set aside our differences. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636922">Now, more than ever, is the time to stand by our law enforcement. I want to express my deep gratitude to those in the RCMP and across security agencies who have been working tirelessly to not only protect Canadians across this country but who have also been at the vanguard in the fight to defend Canadian sovereignty in doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636923">I want to be clear in the House that in this age, we condemn violence and terrorism as political tools. Canadian citizens, regardless of where they come from, must never be prevented from the free and peaceful expression of their opinions and concerns. It does not matter what those opinions and concerns are; that is freedom of expression, an idea so foundational to our democracy that it finds itself enshrined in our Constitution, not just as words on parchment but in the ideals we live by.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636924"> Any democracy can and must defend the rights of its people to gather, to speak and to protest, through peaceful means, within the laws of the land. That is the fundamental liberty of our people. I ask this of the chorus of cynics who stand ready to point fingers: If not this, then what?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636925">In any other system, those in power would only repress those on the periphery. Those in the centre would keep those on the sidelines at the sidelines, as has happened for centuries. In the House, we must recognize the role we play as parliamentarians and as Canadians. Whether it is confronting difficult truths or challenging our long-held beliefs, defending our sovereignty deserves nothing less than our full commitment. It is unconscionable that any member of the House would willingly wear a blindfold rather than do right by Canadians. That is shameful. We, the citizens of this country, through our Constitution, have the right to hold whatever views we wish, to think what we want and to say what we think. Our fundamental liberties are the core tenets of our Canadian experience. They have guided us from the earliest days of our nation's founding, and they will guide us to brighter days ahead. I am sure of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636926">A year ago, I called on all Canadians to unite, saying that, although our heritage could vary, our destiny would be common. I once again call on Canadians to close rank. Our democracy will only endure when we have set aside our differences in service of a greater purpose: to protect the sacred right to hold an opinion, to say what we want and to do it without reprisal. That is foundational to our highest creed, and we can only endure when this creed endures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636943"> Madam Speaker, the news we heard last week from the RCMP was extremely concerning and must be taken seriously. I want to be very clear when it comes to this: Any foreign interference from any country, including India, is unacceptable and must be stopped. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636944">Our government's first job is to ensure that Canadians stay safe and that their livelihoods are protected. No Canadian should feel unsafe living in our country or feel unsafe because they are getting foreign threats. We expect a full criminal prosecution of everyone who has threatened, murdered or otherwise harmed Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636945">As a country, we need to ensure that we do every single thing possible and necessary to protect Canadians, our democracy and our sovereignty. However, over the years, under the Liberal-NDP government and with the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in charge, we have seen a failure to protect Canadians. We have seen the government and the Prime Minister fail to protect our democracy and our sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636946">Back in 2015, while working in the previous Conservative government, it would have been unheard of for foreign governments not only to threaten Canadians and their lives but also to go after them and take their lives. That never happened before, under our Conservative government. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has allowed foreign interference to run rampant in our communities and our country. He has dragged his feet and made things worse by bringing in soft-on-crime laws. We have seen the bills the Liberals brought in, such as Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>; these catch-and-release bail policies are soft on criminals and hard on victims. These laws send a signal to criminals in other countries that we do not take this stuff seriously in our country. It sends a signal that organized crime can run freely in our country and that the criminals have more rights than Canadians. The Liberal policies fostered this environment. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inaction made Canada a playground for foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636947">We heard some troubling news from the RCMP last week that foreign agents from India used organized crime to create a perception of an unsafe environment targeting the South Asian community in Canada, predominantly the Sikh community. We heard accusations of extortion and murder on Canadian soil, as well as the use of organized crime, intimidation and coercion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636948">Conservatives have been calling for action on foreign interference and clamping down on organized crime and transnational criminals for some time now. I have stood up in the House multiple times during question period to ask questions of the government on what its plan is to fight extortion. We got nothing from the government; it has been no action and all talk.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="45">(2145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636949"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not want to act, and what that has meant for Canadians is the loss of safety in our communities. Under his leadership, homicides are up 28%. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278287" Type="2">Mississauga—Malton</Affiliation> mentioned comparing the records of the two governments. I am talking about the Liberals' record. Violent crime is up 50%. Violent gun crime is up 116%. Can members guess how much extortion has gone up? That is the same crime that was mentioned by the RCMP last week. It has gone up about 360%. That is not a small number. Something had to have changed for that to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636950">It is the Liberals' policies. It is Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and the Liberal government's approach to fighting organized crime. If tough laws were in place, it would send a signal to criminals that we are not going to tolerate this in our country. Not just folks in Canada but those across the world would get the idea that Canadians will fight against this kind of action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636951">I have heard directly from business owners and members in the South Asian community who have been victims of extortion. I have listened to the calls they received, which they shared with us. Those are scary calls. Imagine a business owner, a prominent member of a community or an activist who gets a call from someone threatening to shoot up their home, their business or their family. Listening to those calls gives a person a chill down their spine. The Liberals' policies have allowed this to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636952">We have learned from the RCMP that transnational gangs are being used by foreign agents from India, who are trying to cause fear in our communities and take the lives of Canadians. Many people are afraid to return home. They are afraid to carry on with their businesses and worried about carrying on with their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636953">Some have separated from their families, with some living in different parts of the country and some living in hotels. Many have had to hire security and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep their families safe. They come from a wide range of industries. Some are in the trucking business; some are in hospitality or are restaurant owners. We have heard of prominent Punjabi singers being targeted in B.C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636954">This is not just happening in one part of Canada. We have seen this right across our country, in B.C., in the GTA, in Winnipeg and in Edmonton. No one should feel unsafe in their communities. Canadians from all faiths, Sikh, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, should not feel unsafe living in our great country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636955">That is why our Conservative deputy leader brought forward a common-sense Conservative bill to take on extortion head-on. The bill would have made it harder for extortion to happen in Canada. It would have sent a signal to these international gangs that we mean business here in Canada. These are the same crimes the RCMP mentioned just last week. The bill would have established mandatory minimum penalties and stopped extortion from happening, yet the Liberal and NDP members voted against the bill, leaving more Canadians susceptible to foreign interference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8636956">Earlier today, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278598" Type="2">Calgary Skyview</Affiliation>, who brought forward the motion for this important debate, shared stories similar to the ones I have heard from families who have been separated from their loved ones because of extortion. Here is what I do not understand. When we travel across our country and meet groups, as we have had town halls and seen other groups host town halls, they are asking for concrete solutions. When our deputy leader put forward that solution, a tangible piece of legislation that would have helped prevent this crisis, the NDP and the Liberal Party voted against it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636957">They voted against tangible solutions to the problems, and I know members hear about it in their communities. We have held dozens of town halls in the South Asian community where we have spoken to and heard concerns of those affected by extortion. They do not want symbolic gestures; they want real action. Our bill had real solutions. Those parties voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636958">We have also seen the Liberals dragging their feet on this issue and not taking foreign interference seriously. The government was repeatedly warned about foreign interference within its own party, the Liberal Party, but refused to act. I wonder why. It is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of his government who repeatedly claim they just were not aware of foreign interference that was happening right under their noses, despite a paper trail of warnings from officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636959">With Conservatives it is less talk and more action. Conservatives brought forward a foreign agent registry bill that, almost four years ago, was blocked by the Liberals and the NDP. The measures would have been useful as a tool to help keep our communities and the South Asian community safe. Despite multiple warnings, however, the Liberals continue to claim ignorance. The record shows otherwise, including mysterious delays of 54 days that we saw on a CSIS surveillance warrant for a Liberal power broker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636960">It is happening under their noses, yet they are not taking action. They plead ignorance. The ministers say they do not know anything about this. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> makes excuses. We saw even former staffers who gave absolutely no answers to the commission. We heard in the Hogue commission that this is not a new problem affecting Canada. This has been happening for years under the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636961">The red flags have gone up, lots of red flags, but again, there is no action from the government. It makes no sense. We have seen flag after flag, leaks in the media, yet no action from the government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8636962">If we look at the U.S., which has seen a similar situation unfold, within weeks it was able to arrest those involved, move forward with indictments and hold them accountable. Our government has not been able to do that. It has not been able to stop these attacks on our sovereignty. It has not been able to save the lives of Canadians. This is a serious matter. Canadians' lives are at risk, and the Liberals are in charge of keeping Canadians safe; it is their job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636963">At every single juncture, we have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of the government, backed by their coalition partners, who put pension and party before country, not acting on the information they have had. It is beyond rich for the Prime Minister to grandstand, given his government's record of not taking foreign interference seriously. Even with all the benefits he has from the government and agencies, and all the information he has from our great security services, he failed to act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636964">Conservatives are the only ones who have taken this foreign interference crisis seriously. The NDP members can laugh all they want, but they have been in bed with the government for nine years. If they cared so much about this, why did they not include it in the supply and confidence agreement? Why did they not make it a core pillar of their agreement? They do not care. They make it up on the fly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636965">Canadians deserve transparency. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must release the names of all members, from all the parties, who are collaborating with foreign entities, but he will not. The Prime Minister is doing what he always does. He is trying to distract us from the truth. He is trying to cover up a Liberal caucus revolt, which we are seeing. We saw four ministers recently announce they will not be running under his leadership again, because they continue to fail to make the lives of Canadians better. If the Prime Minister has evidence of challenges, he should bring it up to the public, because this is a public safety concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636966">Conservatives are committed to protecting our democracy and our sovereignty from foreign interference. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must be held accountable for his government's failure to act, and we call on him to release all the names of MPs involved in foreign interference, to restore transparency and to defend the interests of all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8636967">While some may try to divide our communities, try to stoke fear and hate, or spread disinformation to pit our communities against one another, it is important that we stand united as Canadians in protecting the integrity of our democracy.

The Conservatives stay silent. They are not calling for the diplomats to co-operate with Canadian investigating authorities, to give testimony so we can get to the bottom of who is doing this.</ParaText>

The New Democrats could have spoken to the Liberals, but they failed to do that. They failed to raise this when the NDP was in a coalition with the government. It is ironic that the NDP members are talking about a security clearance when their own former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has said that he would not have gotten a security clearance because it would gag the leader of the Conservative Party on the issues and holding the government to account.</ParaText>

They talk about a crisis that they have created, and now they want a pat on their own back. How does that make any sense? They dragged their feet on a foreign interference registry. That was under the current government's watch. It would have been a tangible solution, once again. They voted against an extortion bill that was in Parliament. They want a pat on the back for just empty words. It is not going to happen.</ParaText>

There are people out there who want to divide communities, but as leaders here in the House, it is our job as parliamentarians to bring communities together.

This past June, Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document> received royal assent, bringing a significant update to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, among several other legislative amendments. These amendments enhance Canada's collective resilience and uphold these values that we know are pivotal to maintaining a healthy and strong democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637007">With accountability comes transparency. That is why our government, through the public safety ministry, has established a new Canada foreign influence transparency registry. This registry imposes an obligation on individuals and entities to register their arrangements with any foreign principal and disclose any foreign influence activities in relation to governmental or political processes in Canada. Activities such as communication with a public office holder, communication or dissemination of information to the public by any means, as well as the disbursement of money or items, including providing a service or use of a facility, would result in a registration requirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637008">Not reporting can lead to penalties and fines of up to $5 million and up to five years in prison. Although this is a new policy for Canada, other allied countries, such as the United States and Australia, already have foreign registries in place that require those acting on behalf of a foreign state to register their activities. The United Kingdom has also announced its plans to introduce a similar process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637009">Our government knows that now is not the time to sit back on our heels and wait for things to happen. Now is the time to be proactive in our efforts to ensure that policies and mechanisms we have in place protect Canadians and our institutions. With these measures in place, our government is better able to hold those in positions of influence to account by ensuring that they report on matters of importance regarding foreign principals. As the age-old saying goes, knowledge is power, which is why the proper procedures and policies must be in place so that Canadians are aware and informed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637010">I, like many of my hon. colleagues, have received a heightened number of emails, calls and letters from constituents who are scared and who are worried about their families and friends.

Canadians have the right to express their religious beliefs, thoughts and ideas freely, without fear of persecution, without inciting any type of violence or hate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637011">I hope that what I have spoken to today can provide my constituents and all Canadians with reassurance that our government will always uphold their rights and freedoms and impose serious consequences on anyone who decides to infringe upon them. </ParaText>

Their bravery, dedication and unwavering response to answer the call of duty should be recognized and commended. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637013">No matter what our political stripes are, I know that all members of the House can agree upon condemning any acts of foreign interference. In the essence of unity, I know that we will continue to stand together in the pursuit of justice.

As Canadians, regardless of our political leanings, we need to continue to stand together against foreign interference that targets our communities, that wants to divide our communities, that wants to instill fear in our communities. We are united as Canadians. Let us continue looking out for each other and lean on each other, because that is what Canadians do.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8637035">Mr. Speaker, I commend the Conservatives for having some members here. I want to also remember the last time, on September 19, 2023, when they were all ordered to stay away from the chamber and not make any statements or ask questions. I wonder who called the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> to vacate the chamber at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637036">In 2023, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> rose in the House of Commons and affirmed what Sikh Canadians had feared. Agents within the Indian government were responsible for the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil and at a place of worship. Little did we know that this would just be the beginning of the shock waves across our nation, that we would find out about India's dangerous interference with Canadian democracy, public life and organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637037">In the months that followed this historic statement, Sikh and South Asian businesses within my constituency and the city of Surrey began receiving threats of extortion and violent calls and messages. One of many examples is a local Surrey business owner who was threatened to either pay thousands of dollars or face consequences, with the extortionist stating, “If you do not pay us, we are going to burn your car, and then we are coming in 20 minutes.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637038">Another experience involved a threat by an extortionist firing bullets through a home while families were present inside. To top this all off, multiple Sikh community leaders were given a “duty to warn” by the RCMP, indicating that they were in imminent threat of assassination due to their differing political opinions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637039">We then saw the home of one of Canada's biggest South Asian artists, AP Dhillon, being fired upon and vehicles in his driveway being lit on fire, all while it was being videotaped and subsequently aired by the perpetrators themselves, a technique designed to instill fear and terror in Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637040">The RCMP stated that these actions by the agents of the Indian government were not only against Sikh Canadians who oppose the Indian government but also against anyone who opposes the Indian government for any reason. Let me remind everyone that if that is the case, then anyone who opposes the current Indian government can be a target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637041">I want to commend the RCMP, our intelligence agencies and all the law enforcement agencies of this country for their extraordinary work in discovering the Indian government's criminal acts and transnational aggression. I thank them. These actions are a grave threat, not only to the sovereignty of Canada but also to the basic public security of Sikh and South Asian communities. Sikh Canadians whose families come to Canada to build a safe and secure future for their families, fleeing prosecution many times and violence from the Indian government, now find that the violence is being brought to their doorsteps right here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637042">We will not and cannot leave these families and communities vulnerable in a time of need. As Canadians, it is our duty to serve and protect all those who have worked tirelessly over the decades, contributing to the betterment of Canadian society. Many of the children of those who fled are now Canada's top business owners, lawyers, judges, nurses, teachers, doctors and entrepreneurs. We must stand up for them as a united chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637043">With the revelations coming out of the RCMP having evidence linking Indian government agents in Canada to these threats, extortion and violent crimes, including the murder of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and potentially other murders, the time has now come to put politics aside and unite as a country in condemning these acts of horrific violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637044">There is a lot of propaganda coming out of India, and, in fact, even from the Conservative leadership, that states, “Show the evidence.” It has now been confirmed that the RCMP shared the evidence with India. However, the Indian government refused to acknowledge it or co-operate with our authorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637045">We know who else did the same: the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation>. He is the only elected leader of a political party of the House who has not agreed to take an oath of secrecy that is required not only to see either the evidence against the Government of India in the murder, extortion and harassment of Sikhs and South Asian Canadians but also to see the unredacted report of NSICOP that identifies current or previous parliamentarians in the Conservative Party of Canada who are influenced by or work for the interests of foreign governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637046">Therefore there are only two institutions that refuse to see the evidence: the Government of India and the Conservative Party of Canada. This should make everyone extremely concerned. Does a person who wants to be Prime Minister and who is the leader of His Majesty's loyal opposition not want to know the truth? Could it be because he does not want to see his own name in the report? Leaks from CSIS reports shown in the media have said that the state of India decided to support the MP from <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> both financially and through institutes sympathetic to them to win the Conservative Party leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637047">Members and leaders within the House are elected to act on the concerns raised by their constituents. This means obtaining necessary security clearance that would allow them to identify threats from foreign nations, within their own parties and the chamber. For the last year, by not taking the oath for clearance, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has refused to protect the safety of Sikhs and South Asian Canadians. As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has revealed, there are former and active members within the Conservative Party who are or have been involved with foreign interference activities. Why does the leader of the Conservative Party continue to place his personal politics over the safety of Canadians?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637048">Foreign interference activities by India are at an all-time high. In fact, foreign interference from India far exceeds that from China, Russia or Iran, all non-democracies, as only India has been identified by the RCMP as a state that has had its consular staff actually gather information and coordinate with organized crime to commit crimes in Canada on Canadian soil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637049">To Hindu Canadians, I want to be unequivocally clear: This is not a Sikh or Hindu issue. This is a Canadian issue, an issue of Canadians versus the Government of India. Today it is about Sikhs. Tomorrow it will be about the Dalit, political opponents of the BJP, women's groups or Christians. Hindu Canadians cannot let the Indian media fool them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637050">This is a time when all Canadian parliamentarians must stand together, show the world that Canada is a place where people can speak their mind, express themself and live free from reprisal. It is time for democracies to unite, stand by the rule of law and defend their citizens. It is a time for everyone, from the leadership of this country down to its citizens, to stand by our law enforcement agencies and take no lessons from those who try to intimidate and destroy us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637051">Canada is a free country and a sovereign state, and it will never allow a country to intimidate or threaten our citizens.</ParaText>

On that basis, I would, not as a question but as a comment to all my colleagues on the Conservative side of the House, urge their party <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> to pursue top secret security clearance because it is only in his hands to remove the cloud of questioning.

              <ParaText id="8637069">Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say it was a pleasure to speak today, but it is certainly not the case tonight in the House. The news and the allegations from the RCMP are extremely concerning, and they must be taken seriously as opposed to what has taken place tonight in the House. This debate is primarily about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has the power to take them seriously and has not done so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637070">Any foreign interference from any country, that we have been hearing about in the House and outside of the House with the Liberal government for years, needs to be stopped. The government's first job is to keep citizens safe from foreign threats. The very fact that we are here in this place debating such a serious issue demonstrates that the government has failed. The government has failed in its obligation to keep this country safe and to secure the integrity of our nation. It is a natural consequence of nine years of incompetence, of chaos and of an attitude that puts the divisive nature of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> over the security of the public. We have seen it time and time again and particularly in the last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637071">Canada has become a playground for these activities. We hear it, the evidence is there and multiple people have said it out loud on record, and still it is ignored. While tonight's debate descends into unserious political distractions, Canadians need to know who knew what and when and why it took so long for the government to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637072">While we are here to address the allegations about foreign interference in India, this is about much more than that. It is certainly about India, but it is also about Beijing. It is about the tyrannical regime in Iran. It is about all of the times that our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a mockery of our democratic processes and frankly, our values. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637073">Every Canadian should be concerned, because it is putting our lives, our freedoms and our country at risk. The allegations that have been made are serious, incredibly so, and they should be investigated and pursued to the fullest extent of the law. As a country, we must stand resolutely against the attempts of other actors to interfere with the rights of our citizens and our democratic process. The idea that a foreign state would even attempt anything near these allegations certainly merits more than the anemic response provided by the Liberals at every turn over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637074">Furthermore, any suggestion that individuals collaborated or colluded with these attempts, or in any other attempts, should be fully investigated, and again, pursued to the fullest extent of the law. That is really not up for debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637075">Here is what these suggestions should not be. They should not be used as a means to score cheap political points that nobody is buying anymore to divide our nation into smaller and smaller groups, into smaller and smaller factions. What the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did when he appeared in front of Justice Hogue last week is exactly that. He went there with one mission, which was to level unfounded, unproven and unfair allegations against members of this party and members of his own party, casting aspersions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637076">If we cannot name the parliamentarians, then it should be equally wrong to say anything about them, such as what we know or their party affiliations. Frankly, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cast aspersions on the entire House and then walked away from the podium. It is behaviour like this that is unbecoming of a prime minister and has made a mockery of this whole process. If we look outside of the House and listen to what people are saying, it has made a mockery of this entire issue, which is unfortunate because it is a serious one. He should be less focused on trying to make this a mockery and more focused on the serious implications that it has for our national interests. He is more than just the Liberal Party leader, although I do not know how long he is going to be the Liberal Party leader; he is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and he should remember that. However, I suspect it might be difficult when his caucus is revolting against him and he needs to focus at least a bit of attention elsewhere for the first time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637077">My parents always told me growing up that if a person is going to make a serious allegation about Conservatives being part of something, they need some evidence to back it up, and that is what we are asking for. We are asking for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to release the names. If he has evidence about the claims he has made about MPs in the House, he should release the names. We all know that he can do that. We are asking the Prime Minister to release the names of the individuals who have been accused so we can deal with the actual problem and move forward constructively. That is what Canadians want to know on the matter at hand. However, the Prime Minister will not, because this is another crass and pathetic attempt by him to divide, distract and deflect from his mistakes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637078">Maybe they are not mistakes. Maybe it is an intentional hiding of facts the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has known about for a very long time, rather than trying to fix the issue at hand or look serious while doing it. He is trying to cover up that his caucus is in open revolt of his leadership, and it is a convenient distraction. He is trying to cover up that he has destroyed our economy through higher taxes, higher inflation and higher government spending. He is trying to cover up for his own failures to protect this country and safeguard the rights of Canadians. While this behaviour is unbecoming, we really should not be surprised by it. It has probably even benefited his prospects electorally; otherwise, why hide anything at all?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637079">The opposition parties have acquiesced to his tactics of swearing them into secrecy so they cannot do their jobs and cannot effectively prove their case. That has been proven tonight over and over again. Any opposition leader who has bothered to speak in the House to this motion could not hold the government to account. If they really knew there was something in the documents, then rather than sitting back, they would have asked the government what it has done, but it is exactly nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637080">The Liberals have muzzled their opposition so they can continue to turn a blind eye to the obvious wrongdoings, and they have brought the cabal along with them to acquiesce to all of it. They used to be members of an opposition that could hold the government to account, and now they have been silenced. We do not have to look very far to see that they have been completely ineffective at prosecuting the government's failure on foreign interference. After all, it is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who turned a blind eye when foreign interference was coming from Beijing, when a Communist dictatorship was spreading misinformation and even buying Liberal Party memberships to influence nomination races. To that I say release the names. </ParaText>

These are the things that happened under the Prime Minister's watch, and his weak leadership is the reason they are happening more and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637085">Our adversaries know that Canada is an easy target and that they can get away with almost anything here. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is actively in the process of proving them right at every single turn. We have a common-sense ask of the Prime Minister. It is to release the names. Canadians want to know. He should release the names of the individuals who have collaborated with Beijing against Canada, the individuals who have collaborated with India against Canada and all the people who knowingly and wittingly worked with hostile foreign states for personal gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637086">It is an easy thing to do. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did it once in the House of Commons already, and he can do it again. However, he will not. The Prime Minister does not seem to want to do that. He seems to want to continue the sideshow and political theatre as long as possible; this allows him not to talk about the issues that he does not want to talk about. He has lost all semblance of control. He looks unhinged. The Prime Minister continues to insist on some nonsensical argument about secret briefings when he can walk over here, two sword lengths away. He is pretty tall, so it is probably fewer than 10 steps. He can walk over and tell the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> exactly what the problem is, but he will not do that. Why is this? It is because he is using this for political gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637087">If the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> takes the briefing, by the admission of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own chief of staff, he will be unable to speak about the results or act upon them, just like the Prime Minister has failed to do. He cannot do that in any way. His own office says that. In fact, the former leader of the NDP says that too. He deserves the information and not the handcuffing. The CSIS Act actually allows for this. It allows for anybody to offer any information on anybody about risks of foreign interference without forcing them into sworn secrecy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637088">I want to repeat that. The CSIS Act actually allows the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to walk over here and tell the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> everything he needs to know. Why is he not doing that? It is because he does not want to deal with the problem in his own caucus. The government insists again and again on secrecy without ever telling us why. I will tell members why. It is because the Prime Minister is hiding things from Canadians once again. It is because he is scared and because he has benefited from it politically. What is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> hiding? What is he so scared of?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637089">We know there are individuals from all parties who are rumoured to be implicated, but Conservatives are not scared of anything. If the government acted, Canadians would not be asking questions about why it is keeping secrets. I think everybody would be better off, including every single member of Parliament, who has now had the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cast aspersions on them. That is irresponsible behaviour from a Prime Minister. The sooner the names are released, the sooner we can take action to ensure that our institutions and our political parties are free from interference. Otherwise, it is going to get way worse from a variety of actors, from a variety of places. As I said, they know that Canada is an easy place to do their dirty deeds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637090">Tonight's debate is another example of how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has failed on foreign interference. At the Hogue commission, the Prime Minister admitted that our intelligence agencies have been gathering information for years and that India has been committing foreign interference on Canadian soil. However, it is clear that he did nothing to act on it, even after a real and present danger to Canadians was known. An act was carried out; people have lost their lives. Even when provided with the opportunity to protect Canadians against extortion, one of the violent actions that the RCMP has accused Indian officials of engaging in, the Liberals voted against the bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8637091"> It was a bill by my co-deputy leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278483" Type="2">Edmonton Mill Woods</Affiliation>, Bill <Document DbId="12876247" Type="4">C-381</Document>, the protection against extortion act. Every single one of them voted against it. Some did not show up, but the rest voted against it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637092">The United States managed to thwart an assassination attempt on American soil. Canada was unable to do so. When the issue of Chinese interference came up, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to claim that it did not exist, and then that had been exposed as an outright falsehood. His government stalled for years on the creation of a foreign influence registry. It was only ever introduced as a result of Conservative pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637093">The government also did everything it could to avoid a public inquiry into foreign interference. Do members remember the special rapporteur, the friend, the ski chalet neighbour? Conservative pressure made sure that this was a full and open public inquiry so that everybody could see. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637094">It is clear that the Liberals have been ignoring the issue of interference. Just let us look at what is happening in our streets right now. Let us look at the international terrorist organizations parading their slogans through Canadian streets, the organizations designated as not-for-profits not so long ago. Let us take a look at the increasing violence and crime driven by multinational gangs and cross-border smuggling. Let us take a look at the country's reputation, lying in shambles on the floor of the international community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637095">It is only going to get worse, but the government continues to sit around and pretend nothing is wrong. The Liberals passed Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="13180632" Type="3">C-75</Document>, making it easier for violent criminals to be released back onto the streets again and again, while only being punished with a slap on the wrist. The Liberals repealed mandatory minimums for crimes like extortion with a firearm. They voted against Bill <Document DbId="12876247" Type="4">C-381</Document>, which would bring back this mandatory minimum punishment for extortion and implement even more tools for prosecutors and police to go after ringleaders and multinational gangs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637096">Extortion is five times higher than it was 10 years ago, but the Liberals are voting against the very things that they could be doing to stop all of this while pretending to have a debate, to say the right things, to placate the Canadian public, leading them to believe that they have acted when they have not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637097">Is the government going to empower CSIS or the RCMP to be able to do their jobs, instead of interfering in the work of those security agencies? Are they going to do a better job at screening the individuals coming into our country? How about tracking down the one million people the government lost and still cannot find?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637098">We need real, decisive action to fix this problem. We need to enforce laws that we have on the books. We need to stand strong against interference, not cover up allegations and hide the evidence. We need Canadians to trust that everybody here is doing the right thing. We need our rights and our integrity back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637099">A common-sense Conservative government will put those criminals in jail where they belong. We will take action whenever and wherever we are notified, despite the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inability to walk across the floor and tell the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> what the problem is. We will work with the RCMP and CSIS, not against them, and we will uphold the integrity of this country by running a government for all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637100">It starts with releasing the names. For the good of our political system, for our values, for our country, for the good of accountability to the people, release the names, I say to the Prime Minister. Anything short of that tells everyone what they already know: The Liberals are hiding from accountability. Canadians simply deserve better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637129">This past week, Canadians were taken aback, as we heard in the different speeches throughout this emergency debate, by the scope and seriousness of the Government of India's ongoing efforts to interfere in Canadian affairs. Last Monday, the RCMP made public its findings that Indian government diplomats have been engaged in serious criminal activities in Canada. These activities target Canada, Canadians and individuals residing in Canada, as well as Canadian interests. They are covert, deceptive and illegal. They threaten all levels of government, the private sector, academia, diaspora communities and the general public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637130">Through Canada's national task force and other investigative efforts, the RCMP has obtained evidence that demonstrates these agents supported violent extremism in both nations and links agents of the Government of India to homicides and violent acts. It demonstrates they were using organized crime to create a perception of an unsafe environment for the South Asian community in Canada and interfering in democratic processes. The most serious of these criminal acts took place in June 2023 when proxies were used to murder Hardeep Singh Nijjar in front of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., a holy place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637131">This government is determined to protect Canadians from these attacks. To push back against foreign interference, this government passed Bill <Document DbId="13064389" Type="3">C-70</Document>, amending the CSIS Act and the Security of Information Act for the first time in 40 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637132">In May, I spoke to and seconded my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278486" Type="2">Surrey—Newton</Affiliation>'s motion, Motion No. 112, about the real threats posed by foreign governments that seek to intimidate diaspora communities in Canada. Motion No. 112 specifically references the sharing of information and security intelligence to protect democratic institutions, maintain the rule of law and prevent violence and extremism. Information sharing with key allies is critical to pushing back against hostile actors. Since the Government of Canada made these allegations, Canada's Five Eyes allies have come out in support of Canada, because we share intelligence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637133">In response to the shocking revelations that Indian diplomats including India's high commissioner were actively undermining Canadian law, the Government of Canada expelled the commissioner along with five other diplomats. Evidence also shows that a wide variety of entities in Canada and abroad have been used by agents of the Government of India to collect information. Some of these individuals and businesses were coerced and threatened into working for the Government of India.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637134">This is not the first time foreign governments have worked to intimidate diaspora communities in Canada. I mentioned this before in questions asked today. Under the previous government, the now <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and Stephen Harper allowed Chinese police stations to set up shop in Canada. These became hubs where Chinese agents could intimidate, harass and even repatriate Chinese residents, claiming they were criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637135">Regrettably, efforts by Mark Flynn, the deputy commissioner of federal policing, to meet with his Indian law enforcement counterparts and discuss violent extremism occurring in Canada and India were unsuccessful. I call again on all levels of the Government of India to co-operate with these investigations. It is the only way forward.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637158"> Mr. Speaker, I stand in this House as the member of Parliament for Brampton North, a riding in this country that has one of the largest South Asian populations, the largest part being the Sikh community. These constituents are proud Canadians, and they cherish Canada for its constitutionally provided rights, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, our independent policing bodies and some of the highest standards for human rights in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637159">From a very young age, I have been an outspoken advocate, campaigning and advocating for many local issues, but one issue that shook me to my core at a very young age was an international issue. In 1995, I met a man by the name of Jaswant Singh Khalra on a trip to Canada. He was a human rights activist who had garnered global attention for his research concerning 25,000 illegal killings and cremations involving Indian policing agencies. His advocacy work led to his abduction and murder shortly after his return from Canada, which later led to the Central Bureau of Investigation in India prosecuting and sentencing nine police officers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637160">It was during the time of his abduction that it really hit me as to what we have in Canada. As a Canadian, I have always felt free to speak my mind without fear of persecution, although that is not the case in many places around the world, as we know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637161">However, as of late, that sense of security is no longer there, and I have heard those sentiments from the community as well. I have realized that the current Indian government and its diplomats will not let borders get in the way. It was the realization I came to last year when the PM stood in this House and spoke about the credible links connecting the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar to the Government of India and then again, on October 14, just last week, when the RCMP addressed Canadians directly because of the significant threat to public safety in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637162">The RCMP commissioner called this an extraordinary situation, which compelled the RCMP to speak about what they discovered in their multiple ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the Government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada. It is not their normal process to publicly disclose information about ongoing investigations, in an effort to preserve the integrity of investigations. However, they felt in this instance it was necessary to do so at this time in order to dismantle and disrupt the network that had been unleashed on Canadians by hiring criminal gangsters, with a trail leading to Indian diplomats ordered at the high levels of the Indian government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637163">Over the last year, the RCMP created a multidisciplinary team to investigate and coordinate efforts to combat this threat. The team has learned a significant amount of information about the breadth and depth of criminal activity orchestrated by agents of the Government of India, and consequential threats to the safety of Canadians and individuals living in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637164">This is outrageous. It is shocking. I have heard first-hand from constituents about these threats. Although there was suspicion at the time, that suspicion has been brought to light by the RCMP. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637165"> An example that the RCMP gave that day was that 22 arrests had been made by different policing agencies across the country that were linked to an extortion that linked back to the Indian diplomats, and eight arrests were made that were linked to murder on Canadian soil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637166">When we scan the newspapers of the last year, we will also find other investigations, such as ones happening in Edmonton, that refer to 27 events, including five extortions, 15 arson offences and seven firearms offences, all linked to a scheme orchestrated in India and executed by people here in Canada. Despite law enforcement action, the harm has continued, posing a serious threat to our public safety. The RCMP reached a point where officers felt it was imperative to confront the Government of India and inform the public about some very serious findings that they have uncovered through all of these investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637167">Although attempts have been made to co-operate and work with the Government of India to ask the diplomats who served here in Canada to co-operate with the Canadian agencies in their investigations, we have not been met with any co-operation from the other side. It is very unfortunate that these attempts have been unsuccessful, which resulted in the Government of Canada's having to consider six diplomats from India as <I>persona non grata</I>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637168">Through the national task force and other investigative efforts, the RCMP has obtained evidence that demonstrates four serious issues. It is really important that I point out these four issues: one, violent extremists impacting both countries; two, links tying agents of the Government of India to homicides and violent abilities; three, the use of organized crime creating the perception of unsafe environments, targeting the South Asian community in Canada and, in particular, the Sikh community; and, four, interference in democratic processes. I have heard from many of my constituents who have been targeted in these different cases, and they too are shocked and maybe even more worried that the links are not just to local gangs and organizations, but that they go back to foreign governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637169">As Canadians, I hope we can all agree that this is the most egregious type of foreign interference Canada has ever seen in its history. This deserves the serious attention of all parties in the House and it starts with the leaders of all parties. It is shameful that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> is the only one burying his head in the sand and refusing to get a security clearance so that he can better understand the issue and how his party and leadership race have been compromised by foreign interference. I believe it is on all of us to do the work that is necessary to protect Canadians. This is one of the most serious things I have ever heard of, and I believe that all members in the House could agree on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637180">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to stand tonight to speak to this very serious topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637181">Last year, we learned that a Canadian citizen was killed on Canadian soil by a foreign government. Very few things are more serious for the House of Commons to deal with. Then, of course, last week, we learned from the RCMP that the Government of India is allegedly intimidating members of the South Asian community, committing violent criminal activity and interfering in Canada's democratic process, which are shocking allegations. They are allegations that Canadians from coast to coast to coast heard on Thanksgiving Monday, and we are reeling from them as we think about the attacks on our democracy, the attacks on Canadian citizens the impact this has particularly on the South Asian diaspora. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637182">No role for the federal government is more important than ensuring justice for Canadian citizens and ensuring that foreign governments that interfere in our country are held accountable. We need to ensure that the Government of India is held accountable for the actions that have taken place. Any involvement of a foreign government in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an attack on the sovereignty of Canada. Many Canadians across the country are living in fear of threats from foreign governments like India's. We must hear their voices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637183">I sit as a permanent member on the Canada-China committee, and we have heard from those in the Chinese community for a number of years. For over 30 years, they have been saying that the influence and interference by the Chinese government have threatened them. We have heard from Canadians that the Russian government has actively impacted our democracy and that the Iranian government is actively causing disorder and misinformation and making threats against Canadians in our country. Now, of course, we know that India is also doing that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637184">However, that is not all; there are others. I want to make it very clear that, while tonight we are talking about Indian attacks on the sovereignty of Canada and the Modi government's alleged murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil, it is important to recognize that foreign interference needs to be dealt with across the board. The New Democrats have been pushing for a very long time to ensure that all foreign interference is addressed and that we are looking at all bad actors attempting to harm our democracy and harm the citizens of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637185">Tonight, as I stand here, I cannot help but think about members of the South Asian community who have been raising these concerns for years and who have not felt safe in their communities for years. I think about the fact that the South Asian diaspora helped build this country, yet they do not feel safe in their communities right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637186">I listened to a radio program earlier this week where members of the South Asian community said they did not know how to talk to their children about the fact that they could be killed at any time on Canadian soil by a foreign government. They did not know how to talk to their spouses about the fact that they could be killed by a foreign government on Canadian soil.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637187">We have heard that the violence that people are feeling, the extortion and threats of physical violence, is something that is not new in this community. We have heard tonight about the extortions and arson that have taken place in my city of Edmonton. That is deeply concerning. We have not dealt with this problem effectively. This has not been taken care of effectively. I am glad we are having this debate right now in the House of Commons, but we need to have an Canada-India committee, so we can look at this issue in greater detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637188">We need to do everything possible to protect the South Asian community in this country. Some of my colleagues tonight have brought up the fact that this is not an issue of Sikh or Muslim against Hindu. This is a Canadian issue. It does not matter which faith or background people come from or what their views are. The idea that there cannot be a foreign government influencing our democracy or threatening Canadian citizens is something that we all have to get behind. We all have to push and fight for it, yet we have seen that, despite the fact that community members from various diaspora have brought this up for decades, very little has been done by either Liberal or Conservative governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637189">In my opinion, the Liberals have been slow to act. They voted against our foreign interference commission. They also voted today against a Canada-India committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637190">The Conservatives, of course, are compromised. The <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation> refuses to get a security clearance, even though we all know that the Conservative leadership race was interfered in by the Government of India. It is incomprehensible that the leader would not take the steps necessary to get information about how the Government of India interfered in the Conservative Party leadership race. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637191">The fact that we have not heard a single Conservative today condemn the human rights abuses by the Modi government, along with the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, who is on social media quite regularly, has basically been silent, gone missing and refused to comment on this, is so shocking. Canadians are watching, and there can only be one rational explanation. It must be that the leader is afraid of what he will find, or perhaps afraid of whether he would even pass the security clearance screening. It has been months since the NSICOP report pointed out to Canadians that India interfered in the potential election of a Conservative leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637192">Members will not be surprised to hear that I am also interested in talking a little about human rights. I speak about human rights a great deal in this place. I am the foreign affairs critic for the NDP. For years, I have expressed concerns in this place about the Modi government and its attack on minority groups in India. We have raised the alarm within the NDP about the violations that the Modi government has brought forward, and we have not heard an adequate response from the Liberals or the Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637193">In 2022, the New Democrats called the Liberal government to ban entry to BJP officials from India who have called for racist and genocidal violence against Muslims, Sikhs and other minorities in India. We have also called on the Canadian government to boycott G20 events in India's Kashmir region. The Liberal government ignored both of those calls. I do not want this to just be me talking about the human rights abuses that I worry about with the Modi government. </ParaText>

Government officials, political leaders, and supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)—the ruling political party at the federal level—advocated hatred and violence against religious minorities with impunity, particularly Muslims, marking a rise in hate crimes. Punitive demolitions of largely Muslim properties—including homes, businesses and places of worship—resulting in mass forced evictions after episodes of communal violence, were commonplace and went unpunished. India continued to impose arbitrary and blanket internet restrictions including internet shutdowns. The government withheld the Twitter (now known as X) accounts of journalists and civil society organizations without due process. Dalits, Adivasis and other marginalized groups continued to face violence and entrenched discrimination, with women and girls facing specific attacks on their right to bodily autonomy.</QuotePara>

Canada's fourth-largest destination for arms exports in 2022 was India, with the highest-ever total of $54.8 million. These items were designed for military use. They include ground vehicles, aircraft, firearms, ammunition, imaging equipment, software and parts. That goes against our Arms Trade Treaty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8637231"> Mr. Speaker, this intervention by the Conservative member is interesting, because it gives me, obviously, an opportunity to point out that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has not said a single thing on social media. He has not said a single thing in the House. He has not commented at all about this. The fact is that a Canadian citizen was murdered by a foreign government on Canadian soil, and the Leader of the Opposition not only will not get his security check done, will not even find out the information about how that foreign government may be infiltrating his own party, but he will not even stand up in the House and say a single word about it during the debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8637232">Absolutely, I am extraordinarily proud of my <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> for bringing this emergency debate forward. I am extraordinarily proud of the speech my leader gave. If anyone would like to go online, I am sure they can see it there. They can find that speech and see exactly how strongly my leader feels about foreign interference and the attacks on our democracy and on Canadian citizens. </ParaText>
