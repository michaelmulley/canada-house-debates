These advisers in Canada have been working without income for 19 months due to COVID‑19 travel restrictions. The Liberal Party promised financial aid for these advisers, but sadly there was zero mention of it in the throne speech and they are not included in the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867366">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to table this petition on behalf of residents from Errington, Hilliers, Parksville and Qualicum Beach in my riding who are calling for support for volunteer firefighters, who account for 83% of Canada's total firefighting essential first responders. In addition, they cite that approximately 8,000 essential search and rescue volunteers respond to thousands of incidents every year, including the floods in my riding recently. They cite that the tax code of Canada currently allows volunteer firefighters and search and rescue volunteers to claim a $3,000 tax credit if they provided 200 hours of volunteer services in a calendar year. That works out to a mere $450 per year that we allow these essential volunteers to keep of their own income, which is about $2.25 an hour. If they volunteer for more than 200 hours, which many do, this tax credit becomes even less. The petitioners are calling upon the Government of Canada to increase this tax exemption from $3,000 to $10,000 to help our essential volunteer firefighters and search and rescue people across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867368">The petitioners point out that a child's brain is not fully developed and is particularly susceptible to advertisements that are targeting children, whether that advertisement is to increase a culture of materialistic wants that parents may not be able to fulfill, creating a sense of dissatisfaction, encouraging children to want things that their parents might prefer they did not have, whether it is sugary drinks or junk food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867369">Therefore, the petitioners call on the government to protect children, families and communities by banning advertising that is specifically geared to children.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867378">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time this morning with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278473" Type="2">Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867379">It is an absolute honour and privilege to rise and reply to the Speech from the Throne. I listened very carefully to the speech and identified two concerning issues that I heard repeatedly while knocking on thousands of doors during the past election campaign, namely the escalation of crime, particularly gun offences, and the failure of the Liberal government to prioritize a meaningful relationship with our indigenous neighbours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867380">The safety and security of Canadians must be the top priority for the government. As a former Crown attorney, I am deeply concerned about the escalation of crime in Canada and particularly in my riding of Brantford—Brant. Unfortunately this topic was completely neglected in the throne speech, despite many details published by the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867381">The report shows that in 2020, Canadian police services reported over 2.2 million Criminal Code and other federal statute violations of which 743 were homicides, which is 56 more than the previous year. Let me repeat that number: 743 people killed in Canada last year and yet there is no plan to reduce the escalation of crime in the throne speech. Canadians deserve better. My riding deserves better. People want to feel safe and protected in their home and communities. The Liberal government must stop playing politics and pushing its ideological agenda. It must fight crime and finally end these horrible trends in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867382">The fact that crime was not addressed in the Speech from the Throne did not surprise me. If we reflect on the Liberal government's track record on this issue, we would see that there is nothing new here. In 2019, the Liberal government, while having a majority in the House of Commons, put into effect Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, the criminal justice bill. Liberals were claiming that the bill was designed to reduce sentences for milder offences, but the reality was that it implemented softer sentences for serious violent crimes including participation in an activity of a terrorist group, abducting a child and participation in activities of criminal organizations, just to name a few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867383">In 2020, the same Liberal government tabled a bill colloquially known as the “no more jail time for criminals” bill, which proposed to reduce jail time for dangerous offenders. If implemented, it would have allowed individuals found guilty of horrific crimes like sexual assault, arson and kidnapping to serve their sentence under house arrest instead of real jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867384">It would also remove mandatory jail time for anyone who commits robbery with a firearm, trafficking in crystal meth and criminals who smuggle firearms across the Canada-U.S. border. When talking about the smuggling of firearms across the border, it is very concerning during the last session when the Liberal MPs, with the support of their loyal and faithful NDP friends, voted down the Conservative bill that had been designed to address the prevalence of smuggled weapons and the rise in gun crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867385">The “soft on crime” agenda is simply irresponsible and dangerous. The Liberal government must do better to ensure the safety and security for everyone wherever they live in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867386">For six years, in throne speech after throne speech, we heard the same rhetoric: the government is going to get handguns and assault weapons off the streets; we have to focus on reducing gun violence, we have seen the devastating effects of gun violence; too many lives lost; too many families shattered; time to show courage and strengthen gun control; the government will invest to help cities fight gang-related violence. Now, in 2021, our throne speech makes one opening statement: The Liberal government will ensure that it will take steps to allow our communities to be safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867387">During the election campaign, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to give $1 billion to provinces and territories that want to ban handguns, but the reality is this would not lower gun violence, as almost 80% of the guns used to commit crimes in Toronto, for example, are illegal handguns originating in the United States. As quoted in the press recently, “Since criminals aren't deterred by the Criminal Code, it's a given they won't be deterred by any provincial legislation or municipal bylaws.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867388"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government know this. The 2018 paper by Public Safety Canada “Reducing Violent Crime: A Dialogue on Handguns and Assault Weapons” reports that the vast majority of owners of handguns and other firearms in Canada lawfully abide by requirements; that most gun crimes are not committed with legally owned firearms; that any ban of handguns or assault weapons would primarily affect legal firearms owners; that jurisdictions differ in their approaches to controlling handguns and assault weapons; and the data do not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to any reductions in gun violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867389">The former minister of public safety and former Toronto police chief told The Globe and Mail in 2019 that banning handguns would not work because most illegal guns are smuggled into Canada from the United States. The former minister was quoted as saying:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867391">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is now poised to reintroduce legislation that died on the Order Paper when the election was called last August to remove minimum sentences for many gun-related offences, including robbery with a firearm, discharging a firearm with intent, reckless discharge of a firearm and possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with ammunition. This is another example of the government's soft-on-crime agenda that will not reduce gun crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867392">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government are completely tone deaf on what it takes to keep our community safe. It is time to target the real source of the problem. It is time to take bold and decisive action to strengthen our borders, provide the maximum support to our Canadian border agents and work in partnership with the U.S. authorities to stem the tide of illegally smuggled firearms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867393">On September 30, I proudly attended the ceremony on Parliament Hill and stood shoulder to shoulder with indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians, reflecting and honouring the victims and survivors of the residential school system. The good people of Brantford—Brant sent me to Ottawa for this purpose. I am honoured to represent my riding, which includes the largest first nations reserve in Canada. On the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, I did not take a personal day and spend it on a beach.</ParaText>

Mary Simon, the first indigenous person ever to hold the position of the Governor General of Canada. As Canadians, we are very proud of this historic moment. This past summer, the collective consciousness of all Canadians was shocked and saddened with the discovery of unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools. It is our collective responsibility to accept the truth and reflect on the failed and tragic policies of our previous leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867395">Six years ago, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission presented its final report. It presented 94 calls to action to help redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation. Under the watchful eye of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the Liberal government has failed to implement the vast majority of them. According to a 2020 status update on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action conducted by the Yellowhead Institute, only eight actions had been implemented. At this rate, it would take until at least 2062 to complete all 94 calls.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867423">Madam Speaker, it is a true honour to stand here once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867424"> My thanks to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278577" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation> who may have just had his first speech in the House of Commons. I think that all of us Parliamentarians do better when we have more Crown prosecutors in the House of Commons to teach us about our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867425">It has been a really good, busy few weeks getting Parliament back and getting back to business. While I was encouraged to see an acknowledgement of the ongoing emergencies, to have the debate on British Columbia and to have it acknowledged in the Speech from the Throne, I will continue to push the government for concrete action on flood recovery and building infrastructure. My constituents and British Columbians are demanding that of all British Columbia MPs right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867426">Government ministers have been responsive, and emergency personnel from the military have been essential, to disaster response efforts on the ground, including today. I commend their work and thank them for their attention, but when the rains let up and the flooding is managed, will the federal government still be there? Will the media still be paying attention in a few months' time? That is my greatest concern right now. I repeat that I am going to be resolute in my efforts to make sure that the upcoming federal budget responds to the Speech from the Throne, and that it addresses the critical challenges my province is facing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867427">I will ensure that the village of Lytton, which I represent and which was devastated by one of the most disastrous forest fires in our country's history, gets the type of federal support it needs moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867428">The upcoming federal budget must contain a comprehensive suite of supports, and must revise policies for those who have lost their homes and do not have insurance, for impacted businesses that might not be able to secure loans, and for agricultural producers, especially the blueberry producers, dairy farmers and chicken farmers whose crops and livestock were devastated. We need updated flood mapping to account for future disasters and to adapt to climate change. Municipalities need money for dike upgrades and critical infrastructure, and there has to be provincially led construction of resilient infrastructure across the board to address the highways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867429">I have been walking around showing photos of Jackass Mountain summit and Highway 1 to many people in the House. The road is completely washed out. We have to build those roads back better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867430">Finally, we need to do more on emergency response policies and capacity for our indigenous brothers and sisters. Frankly, the way we handle disasters right now in British Columbia is not sufficient. We have to empower first nations leaders and emergency responders, and make sure they have the tools they need, especially in rural parts of my province, to do their jobs effectively and to help keep their people and their nations safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867431">I just have a few more comments. The Speech from the Throne often gives members of Parliament a time to reflect on the election, on what people told them during the election and how they can respond to that in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867432">Before I go into some of the things I heard on doorsteps during the election campaign, I want to give a shout-out to a very close friend of mine. Ten years ago, he was my roommate, and we were sitting around the kitchen table in our apartment. We were staffers under the Stephen Harper government, and we were looking at the redistribution boundaries. They were creating a new riding in my home town. It was at that moment I decided that I was going to pursue a career in politics. Blair was there with me from day one. I do not think I could be here today without a friend like Blair, who has supported my family for so many years. When someone works in politics, having a staffer to confide in who knows your strengths and weaknesses is a blessing. I did not get a lot of sleep last night. Whenever that happens, I start to cry.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6867433"> Blair is moving on. He has a wonderful woman in his life and is moving to the Prairies. He is going to be leaving my office at the end of the year. Blair will be sorely missed. He exemplifies public service and is an amazing dude. I thank him so much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867434">The Speech from the Throne talked about listening to diverse voices. Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon is one of the most diverse places in all of Canada. I also think it is the number one riding in all of Canada, and I challenge anyone to have a debate with me on that anytime in the House of Commons. Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon is 22,000 square kilometres of ruggedness. It spans from Matsqui and Abbotsford, British Columbia, up into the Bridge River Valley in the South Chilcotin Mountains. The only connecting feature of my riding is the Fraser River, which runs right through it from the north to the south. I am proud to live in a place where there is a rich indigenous culture and a rich immigrant culture. All of these people bring so much to the work that I do and so much to the communities that I represent. I am so proud and honoured to stand up for them every single day. It is a true honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867435">During the election campaign everyone talked to me about one thing, and that was housing. In Abbotsford and Mission, not too many years ago a family perhaps working in the Gloucester Industrial Park in Langley, or working for a local small business, could afford a home. It was not too long ago that homes were selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range in many of the communities I represent, but over the last seven or eight years, those prices have skyrocketed to levels that none of us could have ever imagined. The values of homes have doubled and tripled. Now we find ourselves in the situation where a good job is not good enough to have a secure place to live anymore. Many families appreciate the Canada child benefit, mine included, and the positive things it does such as helping to pay for day care and good food to put on the table. However, the Canada child benefit, or a small increase for seniors to old age security or the GIS, does not account for the significant and drastic increase we have seen related to the cost of housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867436">The government talked about a housing accelerator in its budget. I do not know what a housing accelerator is. Frankly, it kind of reminds me of something the Liberals do not talk about anymore, and that is a supercluster related to an industrial area. They never mention superclusters, but a few years ago, every single day Minister Bains would talk about superclusters. We do not hear that anymore. What Canadians want from the government is a concrete plan to address housing supply. The reality is that we are not building enough. Where I live is a key place for immigrants to come to live. Immigrants do not have safe places to live anymore. The government needs to set targets, to be accountable to those targets and to help municipalities build the types of homes that people need to live their best lives. We are failing on that front.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867437">During the election campaign, there were some good points in the Liberal platform and there were definitely some good points in the Conservative platform. However, people are acknowledging the issue now. There needs to be no more rhetoric, and we need to see action. We need to see the federal government working with municipalities to incentivize the construction of new homes. We need to see housing tied to infrastructure development so that when the new SkyTrain stations are built expanding out to Langley, or if hopefully one day we expand the West Coast Express in Mission, housing is a key component of how we look at infrastructure. If we do not start looking more comprehensively at some of these key challenges we are facing as a nation, we are not going to address the housing supply crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867438">I will say one more thing on housing, and that is regarding indigenous housing. My indigenous constituents want “for indigenous, by indigenous” housing. If there was one thing in the Speech from the Throne that I was very concerned about not seeing, it was that. Let us work toward reconciliation. It has been a tough year for British Columbia. It has been a tough year for Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc nation, which I represent. Let us work toward reconciliation and let us give indigenous children safe places to call home. There is so much more we can do on that front collectively in the House to address this scar on our nation.</ParaText>

Regardless of partisan differences, their participation in the democratic process matters deeply.

              <ParaText id="6867471">Madam Speaker, we have seen some very challenging times in Alberta over the last number of years, and in my riding in particular. The economic downturn, a massive hailstorm in 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have had profound impacts on those who call Calgary's northeast home. No matter the challenge, we have come together time and time again to fight for what matters: safe neighbourhoods, healthy families, well-paying jobs and a bright future for our children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867472">I am proud to be part of a government that has put forward bold solutions to the difficult problems facing our city while always focusing on a fair recovery for all. I especially want to acknowledge that the Province of Alberta has received the largest dollar amount in per-capita transfers from the federal government to assist us with pandemic relief and economic recovery. This federal government had our backs when we needed it most. More than ever, Canadians appreciate the value of a strong national government that shows leadership in the face of adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867473">The riding I represent is one of the most ethnoculturally diverse in Canada, with people from all around the world who have come to Canada to build better lives for their families. Sadly, all levels of government have not always fulfilled all of their commitments to invest in new Canadians and to adequately respond to racism and discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867474">When I was elected city councillor, I committed to being a strong voice for my constituents by immediately addressing long-standing inequities. In my new role as a member of Parliament, I will continue to embrace my duty to carry on much of this work by investing in people and infrastructure. Our government must help transform Calgary's economy while supporting workers, always making sure that nobody is left behind. I am grateful that our government has committed to continuing its important work in combatting inequities, systemic racism and discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867475">Working Calgarians were instrumental in getting us through the pandemic. Calgary Skyview is home to thousands of essential workers: health care workers, public transit workers, truck drivers and taxi drivers, people working in grocery stores and food preparation, utility workers and tradespeople. These workers did not have the luxury of working from home and were directly exposed to the virus throughout the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867476">It is easy to thank them, but we must do much more to show our gratitude. Leaders need to show leadership, and those of us with the privilege of sitting in the House need to work even harder, whether we are here in person or working in our constituencies. This federal government has walked the talk by providing key benefits to those who lost their jobs and by procuring vaccines for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867477"> I have encouraged all Calgarians to get vaccinated and to follow public health guidelines. I will continue to advocate for public health as vaccines become available for our children. Working Calgarians, particularly visible minorities, were often criticized for the high infection rates, even when they were sacrificing their personal health by ensuring the safety of others, volunteering and sharing, and keeping the economy moving by ensuring the flow of goods. Today, upper northeast Calgary has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Canada, at 99.3%. All of those over the age of 12 have had at least one shot. It very likely has a higher percentage vaccinated than my colleagues in the Conservative caucus across the aisle.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867479">The cost of living has become one of the most critical concerns facing Canadian families, and the situation is no different in Calgary Skyview. This government has done great work in tackling the affordability crisis. One example of this is the rapid housing initiative. In Calgary Skyview, across the street from the Akram Jomaa Islamic Centre, the rapid housing initiative is supporting a seniors housing facility with the conversion of a former hotel into a much-needed seniors facility. Local non-profits, such as the Dashmesh Culture Centre, have also shown tremendous leadership through collaboration with government to build the first women's transitional housing project in northeast Calgary. Projects like these save lives and give those in need a chance to get back on their feet and live safe and dignified lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867480">There is much more work to be done, and our government is ready to get to work on several meaningful initiatives, such as the multi-generational home renovation tax credit. This would impact thousands of families living in northeast Calgary by helping them add a second unit to their home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867481">I recently had the privilege of joining the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278909" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation> for an important announcement in Edmonton.

Thousands of working families in Calgary Skyview will benefit from our government's commitment to making life more affordable through $10-a-day child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867482">We cannot talk about how to build resilient and inclusive communities without talking about how we move around them. I have been a long-time advocate for robust and affordable public transit.

Two is the fact that the government is putting forward a “light on crime” agenda that is letting criminals out on our streets, which is having a serious impact, especially in the rural communities I represent.

I am sure Ontario will come onside at some point, but all of Canada will benefit from the $10-a-day child care program. That is caring and listening to our constituents. It is advocating for programs that are going to make a difference.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867522">Madam Speaker, the problem is that I am very much limited on the time I can speak on all these wonderful initiatives, so I would appreciate it if the members on the other side would be more quiet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867523">Another area in which this government has done exceptionally well is supporting our seniors. Again, from day one, we increased substantially the guaranteed income supplement. The GIS is there to support the poorest seniors in Canada. We gave substantial increases, approximately $900 annually, to the poorest seniors, again, lifting literally thousands of seniors out of poverty in all regions of our country. That happened even prepandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867524">During the pandemic, we gave direct payments to seniors, with an additional payment for those on the lowest income. We made an election platform commitment to increase payments to those seniors age 75 and over because of the limitations in terms of abilities and additional costs that they had to incur. It was 10%, which was unheard of. These are the types of commitments this government has made to our seniors from day one and we still continue to make them today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867525">Listening to our constituents and advocating for programs really make a difference. That is what Liberal members of Parliament are doing. I would encourage my Conservative friends to get on board with some of these programs as opposed to suggesting, as they did in the last election, that our proposed child care program was not a good thing, that they would take it away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867526">Now we have the new horizons program. The government has enhanced the funding for this program and continues to promote it, because it is to the benefit of seniors throughout the country. I would suggest that all members of Parliament look at that program and promote it in their communities. The program has tangible results for seniors in all our constituencies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867527">Much like our support programs for seniors, such as new horizons, we also have programs for young people. Let us look at the youth summer program. Over the last five or six years, we have more than doubled of the program. Thousands and thousands of youth are getting employment, often their first opportunity for employment, because of this program. It is making a real difference in all our communities. Much like the new horizons program, which as members of Parliament we all get to contribute to the success of that program in our constituencies, members need to look at this program and promote it among their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867528">When I was first elected as a parliamentarian in 1988, one of the primary issues was health care. Health care is not just provincial jurisdiction. I know this will upset the separatists from the Bloc, but Canadians love and cherish our health care system. During the pandemic, we learned a little more about areas that needed more attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867529"> I am thinking about national long-term health care. We need to have better long-term care for our seniors. This government is committed to delivering that. Every Liberal member of Parliament understands it and advocates for that in his or her constituency, and nationwide. We understand the importance of medication. Since day one, we have invested literally hundreds of millions to keep prescribed medicine prices as low as possible for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867558">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame is a large riding that makes up 40% of the island portion of Newfoundland and Labrador. I come from a tiny fishing village called Wild Cove, in the very northwest corner of the riding, in White Bay. I was involved in the fishing industry from a young age and eventually ran our family fishing enterprise for nine years. For the last 17 years, I have owned and operated several restaurants. At times, I have had up to 60 employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867559"> Coming from an entrepreneurial background, I know what it is like to hold my head in my hands, and what it is like to make a payroll. The feeling of walking into my restaurants in late March 2020 and not knowing if they would ever reopen due to the unknowns of the pandemic will never be lost on me, nor will being at sea, caught in a hurricane and having the responsibility of my crew and the vessel on my shoulders. Now, a different responsibility rests on my shoulders, and it is a very heavy weight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867560">Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame, in fact, the entire province of Newfoundland and Labrador, faces an uncertain future. Our main economic drivers are related to natural resources, but the Speech from the Throne neglects the support needed for our natural resource industries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867561">The current Liberal government has relentlessly worked to dismantle our offshore oil and gas industry with ballooning red tape, which has destroyed investor appetite. We have lost 5,500 jobs as our oil industry has been scaled back. However, Norway is rapidly expanding its offshore oil industry after incentivizing companies early in the pandemic, which lured investment from our offshore to theirs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867562"> The rhetoric that the government sells the people of my province is that there is no future in oil and gas and that these jobs are being phased out, yet countries like Brazil, Trinidad and Guyana ramped up their drilling and exploration programs. Why is this government spreading false information, and why is it forcing the men and women in the oil and gas industry to leave their families to go to the shores of far-off countries in order to find employment? These are people like Luke Jarvis of Harbour Breton, who was one of the 5,500 who lost their jobs in our offshore oil industry. He now has to leave his family and commute to Brazil to work in its oil industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867563">The attack on Newfoundland and Labrador does not stop with the oil and gas industry. The fishery also has been thrown into peril as a result of six years of Liberal government mismanagement. Fishers in my riding are fearful of plans to increase marine-protected areas from 14% of Canada's oceans to 30% by 2030. These marine-protected areas are arbitrarily chosen, with very little industry consultation, as if done with a paintbrush. In most cases, fishers are barred from accessing prime historical fishing grounds and not even allowed to use low-impact fishing gear, like hook and line. Fishers need to fish where the fish are and not where they are told to fish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867564">DFO science is another bone of contention within the fishing industry. This year, fishers like Brad Rideout in Robert's Arm were dealt a blow when the mackerel quota was cut in half. American science suggested we could sustainably harvest 10,000 tonnes, but our scientists set it at 4,000 tonnes. As waters warm, species like mackerel migrate further north. Therefore, science needs to adapt and relocate where they survey species. Fishers in my riding have observed mackerel in quantities never seen in their lifetime, and their frustration mounts with the way quotas are being set.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6867565">Not all species are as lucky as mackerel to migrate south before seals invade from the north. Since the eighties, the seal population has grown from two million to at least ten million. Scientists estimate that harp seals alone, with a population of 7.6 million, consume anywhere from four to eight kilos of fish per day. That means harp seals consume our entire provincial landed tonnage of fish in three to six days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867566">In 3PS, a region that has communities like Harbour Breton and Hermitage, grey seals have had a population explosion. Historically, there were approximately 100,000 in that herd. Now the number sits at five times that amount. Fishers there now watch seals even consume lobster. It was no coincidence that this year, sport salmon fishing was stopped in this region and the cod quota was cut in half within the two-week period. Fishers in 3PS are fearful that the <Affiliation DbId="278923" Type="4">minister of fisheries</Affiliation> will place cod on her moratorium once again in 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867567">The fishing industry is crying out for a solution to the overpredation caused by seals. By bringing the seal populations back to historical levels, our $2-billion fishing industry could grow to a$6-billion or $8-billion industry. If we do not act now, our fishery is doomed by this ecological disaster. The possibilities for expansion in our oil and gas and fishing industries are endless. We just need the political appetite to make it happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867568">Speaking of appetite, the Speech from the Throne did nothing to address food security in our province. Make no mistake, food security cannot be overlooked. In Newfoundland and Labrador, we only produce 15% of what we consume. The ongoing pandemic and the recent devastation caused by the flooding on the west coast of the island, which cut off supplies coming in from the mainland, shone a spotlight on this very issue. Typically, we have enough food on the island to last for just three days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867569">No matter how much food we have, one group in our province is really feeling the pinch. Seniors make up more of our population than anywhere else in Canada. I receive emails on a daily basis from seniors who have to choose between heating their homes, buying medication, or putting food on the table. The short-sightedness of the government resulted in giving to seniors in one hand and taking it away from the other. Seniors are especially affected by increasing inflation. Our country's national inflation rate of 4.7% is the highest it has been since 2003. Many feel that this figure is closer to 15% in my province.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867570">The ever-increasing carbon tax applied throughout the logistics chain has compounded the effects of inflation in rural Newfoundland and Labrador, where a rebate cheque is never seen. This is a disgraceful attack on the people of Newfoundland and Labrador by a government that is constantly virtue signalling with no regard for the human cost. We have to consider the human cost and the impact of the decisions made in this sacred place. That seems to be lost on the party opposite. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Action needs to be taken.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867589">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand today to represent the people of the Bay of Quinte. I am extremely proud to have been elected the first Conservative member for my riding. I want to thank all the volunteers who worked hard putting their time into the election, especially my campaign manager Susan Smith. We know how much work it is, especially to manage me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867590">As many members of the House know, it is also a family affair. My mother Heather was one of the greatest volunteers. She is an Atlantic Canadian. She was born in Fredericton and grew up in Prince Edward Island. It is no surprise that door knocking is just easy for Maritimers. My kids were all involved as well. Jack is eight, Patrick is seven and Zooey is four. My biggest thanks go to my wife Allyson. Most of us know that the biggest sacrifice in this job is our families and especially our partners. I am not sure if this was meant to scare us, but our first training in this work was a work-life balance seminar, where I was told that 75% of MPs end up getting divorced. That is a big number. I moved right next to my father-in-law in Ottawa, which he has said is a blessing and a curse, so time will tell. It is a big sacrifice to have us away from our families. My biggest thanks and love go to my wife Allyson, who is home with my children right now sacrificing her time for us so that we can make this region and country a better place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867591">My wife and her family are from Thunder Bay, or T-Bay as they affectionately call it. Thunder Bay residents are extremely strong people. I went there once in the winter and can say that they are so tough because it is so cold in January. My wife lives by the motto “always choose love”. In 2015, we lost our son Teddy at birth to a congenital heart defect. Every year there are thousands of Canadians who experience the terror of infant loss or miscarriage. Allyson was instrumental in our region for being a voice to women who experience loss. She wrote a blog called alwayschooselove.net and she continues to be a tireless advocate for women. She is a light for so many, and I love her dearly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867592">I would also be amiss to not talk about my grandfather and father, who were both political candidates provincially, in 1975 and 2003 respectively, for the provincial Conservative Party and who did not get to represent their constituents. This proves that the third time is the charm. My grandmother Audrey said that she was happy to be alive to see a Williams elected to the House. Both have immensely contributed to our region. My grandfather Don Williams was an entrepreneur. He operated Stirling Motors from 1956 for 20 years and then successfully started Williams Hotels, which he still runs today. He raised awareness for organ donation in Canada, having received one of the first heart transplants in the first decade, in 1991. As well, he supported Camp Quin-Mo-Lac and many local charities. He would always tell people to sign their donor cards. My grandfather taught me tenacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867593">My father John Williams became the mayor of Quinte West for eight years and then was the honorary colonel of CFB 8 Wing in Trenton. My father passed away in 2020, but would have loved to have been here. He lived by the motto “get 'er done”. My father, alongside long-time Liberal MPP Hugh O'Neil, created the Afghanistan memorial in Bain Park in Quinte West, having attended every repatriation ceremony during the Afghanistan war, and was instrumental in the creation of the Highway of Heroes on Highway 401 to commemorate those men and women of our military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867594">As an MP, I look forward to the challenge of representing my constituents in this House and feel very privileged to be here in this place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867595">Never before have we had the challenges we face in this country. We all know that we live in the best country on the planet. Our standard of living, history, culture and freedoms are among the most revered in the world. However, we have some persistent problems facing Canadians right now. Inflation is the highest in 20 years. I have had calls from seniors this week who cannot decide whether to pay for groceries or rent. We consistently hear that employment is back to pre-COVID levels, yet we have heard of well over a million job vacancies in this country. I can say we have 2,500 skilled jobs we cannot fill in the Bay of Quinte today. We have had restaurants shut down for up to two weeks. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867596"> Housing is a disaster right now, with prices doubling in the past year. Prince Edward County, in my region, had one of the highest jumps in housing costs in the last year, at 170%, with the average price last month at $1.2 million. How could anyone who is 25 or 30 years old afford a house at $1.2 million?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867597">What are the solutions? I am a Conservative because I believe that Conservatives believe in the dignity of us as Canadians to be individuals, and that as Canadian individuals we have the right to be free, live free and pursue that which motivates us the most, not because man or government says it is the right thing to do, but because it is our God-given natural right. I also believe that to fix our inflation on housing and other things caused by the overprinting of our money, we need to be producing more of the things money buys. That means homes. It means freeing up home builders to build the things that Canadians need. It means unleashing Canadian innovation and making things in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867598">I come from rural Canada. If we are to fix the persistent problems facing Canadians and build the next decade into a time when Canada can lead the world, then we need to focus on urban and rural Canada producing more of the things that money buys. To fix our inflation nation, we need to become an innovation nation to produce more wealth. That means allowing individuals to pursue what motivates them and ensuring that the government assists individuals to make, grow, dream and do things in Canada so that individuals making things in a free and enterprise-motivated economy will create wealth and jobs, reversing inflation and ensuring Canada does not see any more decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867599">This is not just in urban Canada, where there are 94 cities with over 100,000 people, but in rural Canada, where there are over 3,700 municipalities. The key to Canada's growth is not just in urban Canada, but in rural Canada. An innovation nation includes all 3,700 municipalities, its regions and its more than 600 first nations, Métis and Inuit reserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867600">In 2018, I was part of Canada's first Canadian Rural Innovation Summit in Belleville, at which we hosted the thinkers, dreamers and doers to talk about empowering Canada's rural regions, accelerating businesses and growing our Canadian innovation share. We have an alarming rural out-migration number. Eighty per cent of our youth in rural areas end up leaving the rural areas to go to urban centres because that is where the jobs are. I lost many of my friends growing up, as they left for bigger city centres. We need youth in our regions and in our rural regions. Some say youth are the voice of tomorrow. I believe that youth in this country are the voice of today. How can we truly listen to our children if they continue to leave the place we call home? How can they stay in the place we want them to call home when they cannot afford the home? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867601">We need a great rebuild of what will make Canada thrive: its rural regions. These are regions like the Bay of Quinte that have so much potential. It is potential I know how to unlock and potential we saw in 2018 when we hosted Canada's first Canadian Rural Innovation Summit. We need to start demanding the best from Canada and that specifically means the best from rural Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867602">Right now we are not seeing entrepreneurs create the greatest wealth they can in Canada across all regions, rural and urban. We need to strengthen the innovation in this country and protect Canadian ideas and enterprise. Our intellectual property, the measure of intellectual ideas that translate into wealth in this country, is massively underperforming that of other nations. In 2019, prior to COVID-19, Canada produced $39 billion in IP. That is not bad, but compare that with the Americans, who produced $6.6 trillion of IP, or 169 times that of Canada, when they only have 10 times the population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867603">We are not protecting the stuff that creates the stuff that creates wealth and kills inflation: homes; technology; our natural resources, including our softwood lumber industry; and new world-leading clean energy, including our clean, ethical oil and natural gas and advanced manufacturing. Ontario made a great announcement this morning that a new modular nuclear power unit is being developed in the province. It is going to create a large amount of GDP for the province and Canada. Innovation means improving what we are doing in the world and here in Canada, and we can do so much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867604">Members cannot see it but I am wearing red socks. I wear red socks because red represents the colour of our flag and the sacrifice that has been made by our soldiers to ensure that this is a free, democratic country, and because I believe that just like yesterday when the House came together on Bill <Document DbId="11476884" Type="3">C-4</Document>, the House can and will come together more often in Canada.

Growing companies creates more wealth, it contributes to our GDP and it will help solve the inflation crisis we have.</ParaText>

That is the current problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867629">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time today with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278266" Type="2">Mississauga—Erin Mills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867630">It is an absolute privilege to be back here in the House to bring the voice, perspective and views of the good people of Kings—Hants. Of course, this is the second time I have had the privilege of being elected as the member of Parliament for Kings—Hants, and although it is not my first time speaking in the 44th Parliament, I want to take the opportunity to thank the residents of Kings—Hants for placing their confidence in me to be their voice and their member of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867631">All members of the House will certainly appreciate that when we get into public life, there has to be people in our corner. First and foremost is our family, so I would like to take the opportunity to thank my fiancée Kimberly. She is my rock. There are challenges when we need to be in Ottawa and are having busy nights on the road meeting constituents, so I thank her. To my mom, my grandmothers and my entire family, I have the best support system one could ask for. I could not be here without them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867632">I also thank my campaign manager, Kristina Shannon. She and I went to high school together. She has had work experience with Premier McNeil in Nova Scotia. Dale Palmeter, before her, worked on my campaign in 2019. Without them, I would not be the member of Parliament standing here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867633">I also want to thank all the volunteers, and not only those on my team, whom of course I am very thankful for. Democracy relies upon volunteers getting behind candidates of all stripes to contribute to something bigger than themselves. To the volunteers for the candidates in Kings—Hants and indeed across the country, I give my thanks for their work and commitment to democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867634">I want to quickly describe Kings—Hants to my colleagues and to Canadians who might be watching. It is largely a rural riding. The area of Kings—Hants, and East Hants particularly, includes communities that I would describe as suburban. They are about 40 minutes outside of Halifax. There are some large rural townships, but also areas that are extremely rural, where there could be a kilometre between houses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867635">I call it a mini Canada. There are three indigenous communities: Sipekne'katik, Annapolis Valley First Nation and Glooscap First Nation. We are home to the highest tides in the world. We have a burgeoning wine sector too, so to members of Parliament and Canadians who enjoy a nice glass of wine, please consider supporting the Nova Scotia wine industry. It is very robust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867636">We are also what I would call the agriculture heartland of Atlantic Canada. We have the most supply-managed farms east of Quebec, a number of horticulture-based businesses and are known for the Annapolis Valley apple. Of course, we have Acadia University, which has drawn significant alumni and people from across the world and indeed across the country. There is also the Michelin plant in the Annapolis Valley and of course Halifax Stanfield, which is just outside the perimeter of Kings—Hants but is indeed a major employer in the area. Finally, we are the birthplace of hockey, in Windsor, Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867637">The Speech from the Throne is a document that, as my colleagues would know, is very broad in nature. It puts out the principles the government hopes to achieve in the days ahead. I want to take some time to highlight things I heard on doorsteps and that I hope parliamentarians in the House will work collaboratively to help advance in the days ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867638">First and foremost is labour and immigration. Our government was there throughout the pandemic to make sure there were supports in place for small businesses and individuals. The fact that 101% of the jobs we lost during the pandemic have been returned is a marquee element that shows we have been successful in that domain, and especially successful given the pandemic and the challenges of immigration over the past two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867639">As we have heard in the House, across the country labour is a major issue, and I know the government will be focused on this in the days ahead. One area of particular interest to me is the seasonal agricultural worker program. Over 1,500 people from countries such as Jamaica and Mexico come to the Annapolis Valley, and particularly to Kings—Hants, to support the agriculture sector every day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867640">In our platform, there was a commitment to an express entry program and the ability to reduce administrative red tape. This will not only help the employees coming from their countries of origin, but also help the employers in the farming community. As a member of Parliament, I will be working closely with the government to help implement this in the days ahead.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6867641">Let us talk about housing. We know that housing is a major challenge in urban communities, but indeed it is in rural as well. One of the silver linings of the pandemic is that, during the height of it, many individuals, who are working-class professionals, who have families, chose to move from urban locations to rural parts of our country. That is extremely beneficial for the long-term demographic outlook of rural communities across Canada, but it has put a pressure on our housing supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867642">I will give one example. I remember in the 2019 election, I was on the Hants shore. It is an area that largely has an older demographic. There were a number of houses that were for sale, and they had been for sale for quite some time. There is no real estate available on the Hants shore right now, and housing prices are up 40%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867643">I know our government will be working hard on this issue, but I do want to highlight that this is not just a Government of Canada issue. This is going to require all three levels of government between the federal, provincial and municipal leaders. We know that indigenous communities have to be part of that conversation, the private sector and indeed non-profits in terms of the work that we have to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867644">Let us talk about climate change. I just mentioned that Kings—Hants is home to the highest tides in the world. What a constant, everyday reminder of the important work that needs to be done. Over the past two elections this has been a predominant theme. I have heard from my constituents the need for the government to do more and to move hard in that direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867645">On the heels of COP26, we know that there has to be more work to be done to be able to protect 1.5°C of global warming. The forest fires in western Canada combined with the flooding that we have seen in British Columbia, but not just British Columbia, as they are also in my province of Nova Scotia and indeed in Newfoundland and Labrador, I think is a reminder for all Canadians, indeed all parliamentarians, that we need to be collectively working in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867646">Our government has promised and has mentioned in the Speech from the Throne caps on the oil and gas production and the emissions associated with such, the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies and the development of EV vehicles. These are going to be crucial in the days ahead for us to be able to meet our target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867647">As a member of Parliament, what I intend to focus on is the way we can work with the agriculture community to help reduce their emissions. Farmers are doing incredible work, but at the same time, we need to be able to do more. That is where I will put my focus. I also think we need to be mindful of how we can draw private sector investment in and how the government can make that happen because government investment in subsidy can only go so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867648">I mentioned I have three indigenous communities. We just had the Speech from the Throne delivered from the first indigenous Governor General in Canada's history. I want to particularly focus on indigenous housing, infrastructure and investment in social programming. I look forward to building relationships with chiefs and council that are there and to be able to move that forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867649">In my view as a parliamentarian, the two biggest challenges we will all face in the 44th Parliament, those that will be on the heels as we work our way out of this pandemic, will be twofold: One, growing our economy to make sure that the expenses we took on during the pandemic are sustainable when coupled with the investments the government is planning in the days ahead; and two, addressing climate change and reducing emissions. Both of those require real attention to investments on how to grow the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867650"> I want to mention agriculture. As I said, it is the backbone of the economy in Kings—Hants, and I would argue it is the backbone of the economy in Canada. One in eight jobs in Canada are tied to the agriculture sector. It is a $130-billion industry. We have tremendous opportunity to be able to expand that to not only feed Canada but the world. I look at things like the Barton Report and the ways that government can move ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867651">That is where I will be putting my attention. I am pleased to see that there was a commitment around business risk management. To help drive the wine industry in Canada, we have put $101 million in that. That will matter in Kings—Hants and supply managed farms. We were there for farmers at the height of the negotiations of the new CUSMA. We will be there to make sure that they are protected in the days ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867652">Two quick points I would say before I finish are, first, the importance of child care, and what that is going to mean to the people in Kings—Hants, and indeed to people across the country, to get parents back to work and help make sure that it is affordable. Finally, we need to work on ways that we can increase interprovincial trade and reduce barriers in light of global protectionism. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867653">Madam Speaker, in my colleague's riding, much like mine, agriculture is the main driver of the economy. Over the last 20 years, farmers have been making changes to their farming practices to make farming more sustainable. In fact, in a worldwide index, Canada has the most sustainable farming in the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867654"> Prior to the election, the government said it was going to have a 30% emissions reduction on fertilizer, but it has not said anything about how it is going to do that. Farmers in my riding are extremely concerned about this because, without the use of fertilizer, the amount of crops they can grow will go down, our exports will go down and food insecurity will become a problem. Also, as we pursue biofuels as the next wave, we will need more canola to meet that demand, but we are going to see less canola grown because of a 30% emissions reduction in fertilizer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867655">I wonder if the member has any information he would like to share with the House about how this might be accomplished by the government, so we can get some certainty for our producers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867658">We have to work as a government to bridge that gap between recognizing the work farmers are already doing, while at the same time, asking them to be a part of the solution and do even more. I certainly want to highlight that there was $130 million in the last budget for this, whether it was in business risk management, being there for our dairy farmers or some of the initiatives around climate and agriculture.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867681">There are local businesses in my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills that had a very successful Black Friday weekend, only because they had our support to survive. Now, as we move forward, we must focus on economic recovery. That means focusing on jobs, affordability, taking stronger action against climate change, moving forward toward a path of reconciliation and ensuring everyone has access to health care. Last week's Speech from the Throne highlighted just that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867682">It is no secret that housing prices have risen drastically across the country over the years, and we are feeling the impact in my riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills. Since I was first elected in 2015, hundred of constituents in Erin Mills have written to me to share their concerns about the rising cost of living, and our efforts for Canada's economic recovery must continue to focus on affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867683">From day one, our government has made housing a clear priority. We launched Canada's first national housing strategy and invested more than $72 billion over 10 years, starting in 2017, to ensure Canadians have a safe and affordable place to call home. To date, our housing strategy has supported the creation of over 100,000 new units and repaired over 300,000 more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867684">As we continue to address supply issues, our government has helped put home ownership back in reach for Canadians with a more flexible first-time home buyer incentive, a new rent-to-own program and a reduction in closing costs for first-time buyers. In the term ahead, I look forward to working with our new <Affiliation DbId="278914" Type="4">Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion</Affiliation> to push ahead on the home buyers' bill of rights, which would help ensure that the process of purchasing and selling one's home is fair and transparent. We are taking action because each and every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867685">As I was knocking on doors over this summer, I met Janet. She is a nurse and a working mother in my riding with two young children. While she has worked on the front lines of this pandemic, she has relied on child care programs to ensure that her children are taken care of. Between the long hours at work and the costs of these services, she has been struggling to get by. For parents like Janet, our government's plan to build a Canada-wide early learning and child care system is a game changer. We have backed this plan with $30 billion and earned acclaim from stakeholders across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867686">Our government has always prioritized investing in early learning and child care because it is the right and smart thing to do, not only for parents, but also for our economy. We have signed agreements with Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon, Nova Scotia, British Columbia and, most recently, Alberta. For parents in these jurisdictions, it means that their child care fees will be cut in half by the end of the coming year and reduced to just $10 a day by 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867687">Suffice to say, we in Erin Mills are all waiting for Ontario and other remaining provinces to come to the table. Our government will remain focused on making life better and more affordable for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867688">This summer we were shocked, horrified and heartbroken by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites located near former residential schools. These graves, and countless more waiting to be found, confirm the stories that survivors have been telling for generations. As Canadians, we still have a lot to learn about this undertold part of our country and a lot of work ahead of us. To move forward on the path of reconciliation, we need to ensure that the truths and history of these tragedies are never forgotten.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6867689">Our government is committed to continuing to support indigenous peoples in these communities by investing in a distinction-based mental health and wellness strategy, accelerating work on missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and 2SLGBTQ people, and appointing a special interlocutor to advance justice for those impacted by residential schools. We must push forward to complete the remaining Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action under federal responsibility, and continue pushing the other named parties and levels of government to do their part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867690">I would like to turn my attention to the climate crisis. On that, our government's position has never wavered. Climate change is real, and it is among the greatest challenges of our generation and future generations. That is why we are taking action by increasing the price on pollution and putting more money into the pockets of Canadians. We are investing in public transit, developing alternative energies such as hydrogen, and making zero-emission vehicles more affordable and accessible for everyone. Building something new takes time, and it takes investment. Canadians want us to make the investments today to build a cleaner economy, and that is what we are doing to reach that goal of a clean energy grid from coast to coast to coast, and net zero by 2050.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867691">Residents in Erin Mills are done debating the legitimacy of the climate crisis and so am I. Canadians want all parties, at all levels of government including provinces and municipalities, to get on board and take this seriously. If we work together and continue to push our ambitions higher, we can make Canada the proof that a clean future is possible. Our children are watching. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867692">Earlier this month, I heard from Ms. Chen's grade 10 class at Meadowvale Secondary School, asking our government to take action on mental health. I could not agree more. At the onset of the pandemic, we created the Wellness Together portal to provide free, confidential support to Canadians of all ages. Within the first two weeks that portal had received over 1.2 million calls. That tells us we need to continue to make mental health more accessible for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867693">We have invested $100 million to support mental health projects across Canada, and over the next five years we intend to invest $4.5 billion to expand access to mental health services. To oversee these investments, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has appointed the first-ever federal <Affiliation DbId="278900" Type="4">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions</Affiliation>. This is the same person who not long ago helped build the Public Health Agency of Canada. For our youth, seniors, frontline workers, BIPOC communities and Canadians of all walks of life, we must ensure that mental health supports are ready and available when they need them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867694">I have only scratched the surface of what our plan will deliver for Canadians. When I look to the future, we are building a cleaner, more affordable and more resilient Canada for everyone. I am optimistic. I am optimistic because, yesterday, we saw what the House is capable of when we put partisanship aside for the sake of Canadians. If we can move forward in that spirit of unity and co-operation, we can get this done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867695">It is an honour to be back in this chamber representing my wonderful riding of Mississauga—Erin Mills, and I look forward to working on this progressive agenda with members across the chamber to ensure we move forward together toward a better and more prosperous Canada for everyone. It all starts with this throne speech.</ParaText>

However, when we heard the Speech from the Throne, we were concerned about how the government wanted to address the issues that we had with health care during the pandemic. It is once again forcing its way into a Quebec jurisdiction. However, all the provinces and Quebec have been asking for a very long time for health transfers to be increased to around 35% of costs. We in the Bloc Québécois have proposed to the government that a major health care summit be held.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867714">Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to my community of Edmonton Mill Woods for their continued trust in me to represent them here in the House of Commons. It is a privilege and a great honour to stand here on behalf of such an amazing and diverse community. They have shown incredible resilience during times of uncertainty and many challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867715">I also want to thank my family for their unconditional support, and to personally thank my amazing campaign team and the dedicated group of volunteers who worked tirelessly during the last election campaign. I thank them for all of their outstanding efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867716">I do not know if you, Mr. Speaker, have ever been to Edmonton Mill Woods, but if you went you would find a diverse community in every sense. It is an economically diverse group of mostly middle-class, hard-working Canadians. There are young families and seniors, and Mill Woods is really known for its cultural and faith diversity. That makes it the great place that it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867717"> I am proud that I grew up in Mill Woods, and proud that the son of an immigrant cab driver can have a seat here in the House of Commons. My father is the hardest-working person I know. He is out there driving a cab right now because he just does not want to sit at home. I believe that says a lot about the people of Edmonton Mill Woods, and it says a great deal about this amazing country we live in and the opportunities that it provides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867718">Nav Bhatia, the superfan and now Canadian icon, says that Canada is heaven on earth. I agree with him. In Mill Woods, we have tremendously generous organizations that have stepped up to help each other in the past couple of years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867719">These include organizations such as the Edmonton Care Closet, which provides food and clothing based out of Calvary Community Church, and our Rotary Club of Edmonton Southeast. Fulton Meadows Community League provides food for the food bank and a clothing drive, Millhurst Community League created a coats for kids campaign, Leefield Community League provided Thanksgiving turkey dinner for hundreds of people, and Youth Rise provides great support for youth in our community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867720"> United Aid and Sikh Youth Edmonton recently teamed up with the All India Super Market and New Way Trucking to donate and send food free of cost to B.C., to help people during these devastating floods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867721"> Sangat Youth YEG has been doing a great job. Hope City Church has been providing support in our community. Our local mosque, Markaz-Ul-Islam mosque, has also been helping. Ahmadiyya Jama'at Edmonton, the Hindu temple Bhartiya Cultural Society, Philippine Business Society of Alberta-Edmonton and Guru Nanak's Free Kitchen are all organizations in our community that have been helping their neighbours. There are many more that I could list. My heartfelt thanks and gratitude go to them and to their supporters for all of their great work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867722">The reason they have had to step up and help their neighbours now more than before is because from coast to coast to coast life is getting more expensive for Canadians. We see it everywhere we go: at the gas pumps, in the grocery stores and even when we try to buy Christmas gifts. Conservatives have repeatedly warned the government that its reckless spending would cost Canadian families. For more than a year, we warned that this flood of money would fuel inflation. Now, we are watching the consequences of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s reimagined economy in real time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867723">Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s political priorities announced in the Speech from the Throne do nothing for middle-class working Canadians. The cost-of-living crisis that we are in right now is pricing families out of homes and driving up the costs of essential goods. It is clear that families in Alberta are not a priority for the current government. Instead of presenting an economic plan for families, seniors and small businesses that have been left behind by the government, the government's approach means more of the same: More deficits leading to higher taxes. One thing is clear. Middle-class Canadians cannot afford more of the current Liberal government's reckless spending.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867724">Being a middle-class Canadian no longer means living comfortably. Being a middle-class Canadian in Alberta, especially an energy worker, comes with an even greater set of challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867725"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has waged a war on our energy sector. At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis and the President of the United States is calling on OPEC and other energy producers to increase the production of oil and gas to lower soaring energy prices, the Prime Minister and his new <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> want to deny our energy sector the opportunity to supply the world with ethical, lower-emission Canadian energy at a time when it is desperately needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867726">Through the Speech from the Throne, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to attack our energy workers. The only time he mentions Alberta energy is when he talks about putting a cap on the work they do. He makes no mention of the world-class, ethically sourced energy that is using world-leading technology to reduce its environmental footprint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867727"> The demand for energy is not going away soon. What the Prime Minister does not understand is that our made-in-Canada energy will be replaced by unethically produced energy. His attack on our energy sector is not out of concern for the environment, but, instead, it is about furthering his own Liberal agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867728"> The Liberal government's short-sighted plan to limit made-in-Canada energy will only embolden foreign oil-producing dictatorships. Its plan will drive up the prices of oil and gas and make it more expensive for Canadian families to drive to work and heat their homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867729">The Conservatives know that it is possible to work with our energy sector, lower emissions and provide jobs and opportunity in Canada. We should be proud to supply the world with sustainable and ethical energy to developing countries, which want to source their energy from a country like Canada where our environmental and labour standards are world class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867730">On top of inflation and the rising costs of food and gas, we are also in the midst of one of the worst housing crises the country has ever seen. The dream of home ownership is being pushed impossibly out of reach for first-time homebuyers. Home prices in Canada have shot up over 20% since 2020. We need to reduce inflation and increase supply, increasing housing availability. One of the ways we would do that through the Conservative plan would be to release at least 15% of federal surplus land holdings to allow for more housing. The rise in cost of affordable housing is a serious issue that requires a serious plan, which has not been provided by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867731">Earlier I spoke about a number of the great organizations that were helping their fellow Canadians in Edmonton Mill Woods, and I know there are organizations like that right across the country. Many of these organizations are faith-based and cultural-based organizations and many of them may not have the same values as the Liberals do. However, that is just part of our diversity in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867732"> In 2017, the Liberal government required organizations to sign a values test to receive funding to hire summer students. Because of this values test, many worthy organizations were excluded from the program just because their values did not line up with the Liberal Party. Thankfully, the federal government changed course after considerable outcry from across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867733"> Now I am hearing considerable concern from many people in my community about a Liberal campaign promise to take tax-exemption status away from organizations that do not align with Liberal values. Once again, the Liberals love diversity as long as we all agree with them. I hope the Liberals will listen to all voices across Canada and represent them all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867734">Another issue is the rise in gun crime. This has been an issue in many major cities, including Edmonton, and we have to have serious solutions to this. Instead, the government relentlessly continues to go after law-abiding gun owners, hunters, farmers and sport shooters. It is simple. Every time the government spends $1 taking firearms away from a law-abiding Canadian, it is $1 not going to fight the core issue of firearm crime in Canada, which is illegally smuggled guns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867735">Canadians across the country elected the Conservatives to hold the Liberal government to account, and we are doing just that.</ParaText>

It is using world-leading technology. It is ethically produced energy right here in Canada, supporting Canadian jobs and families, such as the families in my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods. If we can take that technology and export it around the world, we would actually bring global emissions down, because countries would be producing at the same high standards we do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867753">I also want to take a moment to thank my campaign team, Bryan Walton and the team he put together. We had an amazing crew door knocking and putting up signs in a large rural riding, which is always a challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867754">Most important, I want to thank my wife Louise, and my kids Graeden, Kinley and McKenna. This has been a trying time to be an elected official. I think all of us in the House understand what this past two years has been like. Often we take that home to our loved ones. My wife Louise has been a counsellor, a confidant and my best friend. I want to take a moment to thank her for her love and support through all that it is to be a politician. I certainly could not do it without her.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867755"> It is very good to be back in Ottawa. I am sure I was getting on her nerves being home as much as I was over the last two years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867756">Canadian who listened to the throne speech, who were looking for inspiration and a clear strategy for economic recovery were probably very disappointed. What they heard were more platitudes, more word salad and empty promises. Whether it is balanced budgets, clean drinking water for first nations, affordable housing, rural Internet or even transparency and openness, these promises by the Liberal government have been broken again and again over the past six years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867757">What the Liberals have left us with are deficits, debt, crippling inflation, the housing bubble, higher cost of living, a labour crisis and an eroding relationship with some of our most trusted trading partners, including the United States. I do not think our relationship with our southern partners has been any worse in our history. There are real consequences to these mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867758">The Liberal policies have put our finances on a very rocky footing. Clearly the Liberals have no concrete plans to solidify Canada's financial footing. Our foundation is rocking and there is no plan to fix it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867759">If there were a plan, the Liberals certainly would have talked about two of Canada's most critical industries, agriculture and energy. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278483" Type="2">Edmonton Mill Woods</Affiliation>, spoke eloquently of Canada's energy industry, so I want to focus on agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867760">Agriculture employs 2.1 million Canadians. One in nine jobs in Canada are linked with agriculture and agribusiness. It has generated $140 billion in GDP in Canada, about 7% of Canada's total GDP. One would think that would be a pretty important part of the Liberals' throne speech. How many times was agriculture mentioned in that speech? Not once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867761">When we have primary industry that Canada relies on, and it could be an integral part of our economic recovery post-pandemic, being completely ignored, that tells me clearly that the Liberals have no plan to get Canada's finances back on strong footing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867762">It actually goes the opposite way. Rather than embracing and ensuring that Canadian agriculture and agribusinesses have the resources they need to reach their full potential, the Liberals are going the other way. They are attacking one of our most important industries. Let me take a few moments to outline the ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867763">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="246260" Type="4">agriculture Minister</Affiliation> recently said, “it’s not like we can adopt a law for reducing the price of food.” I have a message for the Liberal government. In fact, it can. It just has to get out of the way. Liberal policies are increasing the cost of everything, including food at the grocery store, the escalating carbon tax, the cap on fertilizer, trade failures, labour crisis. This is having an impact on farm families across the country, and it is increasing the cost of food that we put on our table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867764">Adding the carbon tax to the farm fuels and escalating that carbon tax to $170 per tonne would devastate Canadian agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867765"> As an example, I had Michel and Jeannette from Ontario contact my office earlier this week. They provided my staff with a spreadsheet of the impact the escalating carbon tax would have on their operation. When it gets $170 per tonne, they will be paying more for the carbon tax than what they actually pay for the natural gas they use to heat barns and dry grain, essential practices for modern agriculture. At $170 per tonne, they will pay $19,477 in carbon taxes and $8,800 for natural gas. They will be losing money as a result of the Liberals' escalating carbon tax. There is no way they can operate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6867766"> Hessel Kielstra, in my riding, has Mountain View Poultry. His carbon tax right now is $25,000 a month to heat his poultry barns. That is before it starts escalating to $170 a tonne. If we cannot grow food, we cannot feed Canadians. If we cannot grow food, we cannot play our integral role in feeding the world. It is that simple. The Liberal policies are pricing Canadian agriculture out of business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867767">The Liberals have also announced recently, at COP in Scotland, that they are going to put a cap on emissions and fertilizer use. There are real consequences to this decision. They want to reduce it by 30%, a number that they just grabbed out of the sky. They did that with no consultation with agriculture, no consultation with stakeholders and no consultation with agribusiness. They just picked it out of the sky, and now it is up to Canadian agriculture to try to meet that standard. There are real consequences to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867768">According to a study by MNP, the 30% reduction in fertilizer will cost our economy about $48 billion by 2030. What does that have to do with each province? Let us go with canola and wheat. In Alberta, that is $2.95 billion gone. In Saskatchewan, that is $4.61 billion gone. In Manitoba, with corn, that is $1.5 billion gone. That is funding, money and revenue that is gone out of local communities and rural businesses, affecting rural economic opportunities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867769"> Those numbers do not include an escalating carbon tax. They do not include the Liberals' clean fuel standard, and they do not include lost global markets. Basically, what is happening is Canadian agriculture will be bankrupt under the Liberal policies. Can the Liberals make changes to reduce the price of food? They absolutely can, by backing off from their ideological policies, which are devastating one of our most important industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867770">However, it continues to get worse, so they are going to be putting on these regulations, red tape and imaginary numbers that Canadian farmers are going to have to try to meet, which really have no basis in reality. It does not even take into consideration the incredible job that Canadian farmers have done to improve their carbon footprint. Our Canadian farmers and ranchers are at the front line of conservation. Let us talk about 4R, zero-till farming and precision agriculture. None of those things were taken into consideration when these numbers and policies were put forward. Our yields are much higher on much less, but this is going to put us back decades, and we are going to have to be growing more on more land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867771">We also have issues with trade and transport. We asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> this week about the crisis with shipping containers, and he said it is an issue about global supply chains. It is not about global supply chains. The Americans have figured it out. President Biden has put on penalties and a shipping czar, and they have resolved their problem. As a result of that, shipping lanes are being rerouted from Canada to the United States. Meanwhile, Canadian agricultural commodities and manufactured goods are stuck at the ports in Vancouver and Montreal. This is having a significant impact on our relationship with our most trusted trading partners. We are losing our reputation as a reliable partner, and as a result, those contracts are going to other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867772">We have seen what is happening with the United States, but I also want to go back to February 2018. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made this big announcement. He said we were having a huge breakthrough in resolving the fumigation issue with India. It is 2021; we still have that issue in place and we have lost our pea and pulse market to India. We have lost canola trade with China. All these things continue to add up and can lead to food insecurity and a labour crisis. Members can understand why Canadian farmers and ranchers feel they do not have a friend in the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867773">The disappointing thing with this throne speech is that if the Liberals truly had a plan to rebuild Canada's economy coming out of the pandemic, they would have ensured that Canadian agriculture and energy were key players in that plan. However, they are missing. Obviously, they are not a priority for the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867798">I have had the great honour of serving the riding of Ottawa Centre as a member of the provincial Parliament for almost 11 years. As a result, I have built deep connections within the community. I know our neighbourhoods and I have community connections where we have worked together on issues that are important to our community, from protecting our waterways like the Ottawa River, the Rideau River or the Rideau Canal to making sure that our post-secondary institutions, like Carleton University, which is located in my riding, continue to thrive. We have helped countless individuals, whether they are new to Canada and new to the city of Ottawa or residents who have lived here for a very long period of time. Again, I want to say a big “thank you” to them, from Carleton Heights to downtown and from Old Ottawa East to Westboro, for putting their faith and trust in me to be their strong voice in this great House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867799">I would be remiss if I did not take some time to thank my parents, Anwar and Qaisar Naqvi. My family and I came to Canada almost 33 years ago. We moved to Niagara Falls, where we made our home and, like any newcomer family, we worked hard so my parents could ensure that all of us could have a better life. The circumstances under which my parents left were not ideal. Both my parents were involved in a pro-democracy movement in the country of my birth. In fact, my father led a pro-democracy march. For that he was arrested and tried in a military court and served nine months as a political prisoner. I was 10 years old. Members can imagine the profound impact of that experience on me to this day. I saw my father pursuing and standing up for democratic rights, and I saw my mother fight for his rights while he was imprisoned, while at the same time raising a family and running a law practice so that we were all taken care of. Members can imagine where my drive for public service comes from, and how indebted I feel to this great country of Canada, which has given us the opportunity to live in a free country and enabled me to devote my professional life to serving my community and my country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867800">I was often asked in the last federal election why I had decided to come back to public service and put my name forward to be the member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre. I thought quite deeply about this, and the answer was simple. We find ourselves living in a very pivotal moment. This pandemic has impacted all of us. It has really shone a light on the inequities that exist in our society, and this is our opportunity to rebuild Canada in the most inclusive way and make sure no one is left behind. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867801">We often talk about building back better. Well, here is my take: We cannot build back better by building back the same.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867802"> There are issues I have identified that are important to me, such as making sure that we end chronic homelessness in our communities. I want to do that in my city of Ottawa. We must fight climate change so that our children have a better future. We must put an end to systemic racism and systemic barriers against indigenous people, Black people and people of colour. These are the kinds of things that I want to work with all members on and champion in this House. I was so excited and heartened to hear very precise language used in the Speech from the Throne on these three issues. I look forward to working with the government and each member of this House on these important issues, because that is how we are going to build a Canada for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867803">As my time is winding down, I have a commitment that I want to make today in my inaugural speech. Please hold me to account if I do not live up to my commitment. I am 100% committed to serving my community and my country. I want to do that by working with every member of this House. We all have come here because we want to challenge the status quo. That is why we knocked on doors and asked for this mandate. We may have different ways of getting to that, but at the end of the day we all want to build a better country.

              <ParaText id="6867808">One of the applications came from my riding in Port Alberni to buy the old Beaufort hotel, and it was supported by the Salvation Army, the Bread of Life, KUU-US Crisis Line, the Canadian Mental Health Association and Lookout. ESDC said that this was a great application supported by the city, our local MLA and the local Tseshaht Nation. It was filling a gap that the province of B.C. identified for the hardest to house. The parole board even wrote a letter of support. It said it had no housing for inmates when they were released. In fact, 98% of those inmates were indigenous. As well, it was identified that two-thirds of the people in our local homeless count are indigenous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867809">They applied again. They were just told that they were denied. More people are going to be dying on the streets of this country.

Seniors' purchasing power has gone down, and drugs, housing and groceries are expensive. Ms. Gagnon has never understood why the government created two classes of seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867826">They have sent me here to focus on the issues that matter most to them. In my community, particularly for the youth of Milton, that means standing up for the environment. We need to fight climate change to ensure that the health and safety of our planet for ourselves and for future generations is upheld. The terrible flooding in B.C. and other extreme weather events have given us a sharp reminder about the urgent need to prioritize a green, clean and sustainable future for all of us. We may not get another chance to get this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867827"> We must also continue walking the path of truth and reconciliation with indigenous peoples. As my work on the indigenous and northern affairs committee in the previous Parliament emphasized for me, we must ensure that while we work to address the wrongs of the past, we also must focus on building stronger, more collaborative bonds in the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867828">Milton is one of the most diverse communities in Canada, but diversity is the fact and inclusion is the act that will ensure that no Canadian anywhere will be targeted by violence or hatred because of their race, religion, who they love or how they live. These are not small tasks. Achieving them will require a renewed focus, a strength of purpose and a spirit of collaboration. As yesterday’s unanimous passing of Bill <Document DbId="11476884" Type="3">C-4</Document> showed, we do have the capacity to come together and improve the lives of our neighbours and Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867829">If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that there is nothing in this world more valuable than our collective health and well-being. The good news is we have all the tools necessary to defeat this pandemic and build a healthier Canada for this and future generations. The best tool to fight this pandemic has been vaccines. I want to take a moment to thank Halton’s Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Hamidah Meghani and her team for helping to make Halton region one of the most vaccinated communities in Canada. Now that seniors over 70 and kids five to 11 are eligible, I encourage everyone to continue making appointments. I also want to thank everybody who worked at a clinic, volunteered at a clinic, shared a vaccine selfie or chatted with or encouraged a hesitant neighbour or family member to get the shot. It has been a team effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867830">The reverberating impacts of COVID-19 have gone well beyond the disease itself. We have work to do on finding solutions for delayed procedures, ensuring there are more ways and more services available for the mental health impacts of these last two years. They have had a devastating impact on families, kids in particular, and, of course, we must continue to build a more resilient long-term care system in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867831">It will not surprise too many of my colleagues to know that I would like to talk a bit about the role that physical activity and recreation must play in our “build back better” strategy. Canada was experiencing a crisis of inactivity before this pandemic and COVID-19 has made it much worse. I want to highlight the call to action led by Participaction to tackle the inactivity crisis and add my name to the long list of supporters who champion solutions to this issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867832">The solutions are not as simple as just telling everybody to go outside, ride their bike and go for a walk. While those things are helpful, important and the right thing to do, not everyone has the ability to make those decisions. Vulnerable and under-resourced Canadians lack the infrastructure, the time and the freedom to simply take an hour to get a workout in. Improved access to programs that teach physical literacy to kids and families is an essential aspect of the solution to this complex challenge. Physical literacy is defined as “the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that establishes purposeful physical pursuits as an integral part of our daily lifestyle.” Moving our bodies is essential for our physical health, our mental health and the health of our communities and relationships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867833">I am on my soapbox and I could talk for hours about how sport, physical activity and recreation can build more resilient communities. It is time to move on to talk about the current challenges that this country is facing with respect to the economy. The challenges that our neighbours are facing with respect to unaffordability are both real and complex. The labour shortages and challenges with regard to supply chains and inflation are easily worth a 10-minute speech of their own, so I would like to narrow my focus to two campaign commitments that also represent tangible solutions: child care and affordable housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867834">In the previous Parliament, I met with dozens of child care stakeholders to discuss building a $10-a-day child care program to save Canadian families money and rebuild our economy in the most equitable way possible. That list included MCRC, the Milton Community Resource Centre. I want to acknowledge the hard work of Tina and Rebecca and their team at the MCRC for providing Milton families with care, resources, solutions and products that have contributed directly to the healthy development of kids and the ability for parents to go to work, earn a good income and pay their bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867835">As an Ontario MP, I am also thrilled that the provincial government is in talks with our federal government to make $10-a-day child care a reality for families in my riding and across the province. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867836">Moving on to housing, it is a complex ecosystem, so I am going to narrow my focus once again on non-market solutions for the housing crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867837">I am a proud co-op kid. I lived at Chautauqua Co-op with my mom and brother throughout my childhood and even after university. My mom still resides at Chautauqua. She is a co-op builder who works at Briarview Co-op in Mississauga. I know I am biased, but nobody in Canada knows more about co-op housing, its past and its place in our potential future in Canada than my mom. The last time we built meaningful co-ops in this country was 1994, and that needs to change today. When Canadians are paying their rent, they should not be paying off somebody else’s mortgage or contributing to huge profit margins and shareholder value. </ParaText>

However, home ownership should not necessarily be the only ambition of the housing continuum. Secure housing should be, and those who want to live in non-profit housing for their entire lives should be able to. It allows for fuller participation in the economy.

Milton has one of the best farmers' markets in the country, and we love to eat and shop local. We appreciate and rely heavily on our neighbours in agriculture, and they deserve to be acknowledged and supported in our transition to a greener future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867857">In Montreal, for example, taking into account all of the federal programs to house the most vulnerable people in Canada, this creates housing that costs $2,200. I have no idea who can afford to spend $2,200 on housing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867859">It is a very good program, but the problem is that it is grossly underfunded.

The CMHC used to deliver co-op and social housing and was really good at it, but this was gutted because in 1993 the federal Liberal government cancelled the national affordable housing program. As a result, we have not built housing the way we used to. In fact, Canada lost more than half a million units of affordable housing that otherwise might have been built had the program not been cancelled.</ParaText>

In 1993, when I was 11 years old and living in co-op housing, my mom came home from work and had lost her job. That was because the Mike Harris government of the day cancelled all provincial programs. It meant she was no longer a co-op builder and had to find a new job. Since then, she has been working as a community coordinator in the non-profit housing industry and is still the biggest expert, so I would welcome another—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867873">As this is the very first opportunity I have had to rise in the House, I would like to start off with some quick words of thanks. It is an incredibly humbling and exciting honour to stand here, to sit here and to be a representative for my constituents here. From the bottom of my heart, I wish to express just how grateful I am that my constituents have renewed their support in me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867874">My favourite thing about running a campaign is the amazing volunteers who come alongside to support me. I am talking about those who give their time, talent and money to invest in my success. To them I also wish to extend a very sincere thanks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867875">“Where there is no vision, the people perish.” Those are the words permanently etched into the stone over the west window of the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill. The words are strong and they are true. Humans have this incredible ability to dream, cast vision and inspire. They should have the ability to pursue those things. The throne speech is usually the vehicle used by the prime minister to communicate and provide hope and optimism for the Canadian people. Sadly, this was not the case this time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867876">I was anticipating a detailed plan in four specific key areas that I believe every single federal prime minister, regardless of political stripe, should be prioritizing if they wish to lead well. Here they are: one, keep the country united; two, ensure Canadians are kept safe and secure; three, facilitate an environment of economic prosperity; and four, advance Canada's place on the world stage. To the detriment of Canadians, however, all four of these points were largely ignored in the document that was read in what I would call a monotone manner by the Governor General. Perhaps she simply read it in that tone in order to match the lacklustre content that was within.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867877">Before the budget was tabled, my constituents shared with me that they were hoping to see a real plan to reopen the economy and restore hope and confidence in our future as a great country. Those who are unemployed were hoping to see a plan that created new jobs and opportunities for wealth creation. Those in the oil and gas sector were hoping to see support for this world-class industry. Those in the agriculture sector were hoping to see a little something for them. A nod of appreciation would have gone a long way, but there was nothing. Local businesses that are on the verge of permanently closing their doors were hoping for a carefully thought-out plan, not for more handouts, to get back to normal. Sadly, they had no luck.</ParaText>

Food banks are finding it difficult to keep up with the level of need they are seeing, and one of the biggest changes over the last year has been the rise in the number of people who are employed full-time having to use food banks because they simply cannot pay their bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867903">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says he does not think that much about monetary policy. That is obvious. He handed himself a blank cheque in the spring of 2020, and he has been printing and spending money ever since. The government has handed out exorbitant amounts of money in the name of emergency income, but the books show that the personal disposable income of Canadians has actually increased during the pandemic. Earned income has dropped significantly, but the enormous government handouts have more than covered the loss. As a result, tons of extra money are flooding the economy, but there is the same number of goods, if not less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867904">The outcome is higher prices, because an endless supply of printed money combined with limited goods actually drives up prices. The sad thing is that it is the wealthy who benefit when those prices rise, because it adds to their profits. Meanwhile, low wage earners must make their dollars stretch further to cover their necessities. All the while, the government is bloating in size not only by spending all this extra money, but by raking it back through taxation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867905">One dollar used to be worth one dollar. Today, one dollar is only worth 95 cents. If the government were to increase taxes by 5%, there would probably be massive outrage, but that is just it. That is exactly what the government did. It is called inflation tax. It simply comes with this name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867906">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> has pointed out, “countries that are not printing money to pay their bills have maintained a low cost of living and an affordable life for their citizens.” Meanwhile, “Those countries that are flooding their economies with cheap cash are driving up the cost of living,” and making it less affordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867907">There is an inconvenient truth that seems to have been willfully ignored. Reining in fiscal spending would necessitate limited government. This, of course, is a horrible restraint for any political party that only attains or maintains power when people are reliant on the government for its programs and handouts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867908">The Liberals are actually choosing to be fiscally irresponsible for the sake of political advantage, and it is putting our economic future in great jeopardy. What is the solution? It is simply to stop printing money, rein things in and be fiscally responsible. That is what this country deserves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867909">“We, the people” is a powerful phrase. Is it not? When the people feel the freedom to live up to their potential all of society benefits, but in order for this to happen the government has to get out of the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867910">Serving as a member of Parliament has afforded me the extraordinary opportunity to speak with many Canadians about the type of Canada they desire. I have heard countless stories from visionaries who want to build businesses, invent new technologies, help those who are suffering and improve our society in areas where we have fallen short. All of these conversations and general observations have given me a tremendous amount of hope for this nation's future. Unleashing the potential of the Canadian people is the key to our success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867911">Members can imagine what it would look like if the bridles of red tape and regulation were thrown off and entrepreneurs were given the freedom to take risks, to make investments, to prosper and to help others prosper. This is the type of Canada that we can create, not through government handouts and increased control, but by creating opportunity for each and every Canadian to invest their gifts, talents and abilities to prosper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867912">It is Canadians who are the problem solvers, the solution makers and the wealth creators, not the government. No matter the handouts it gives, we will not get ahead. A good leader puts people first. Sadly, that is not what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did in the throne speech. It is not what he has endeavoured to do on behalf of this great country, and for this reason, I cannot support the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867931"> Like all members, my ability to stand here is a result of a team effort of family, friends and volunteers who believe in all of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867932">For me, it has been a long journey, starting with my service for eight years as a ministerial assistant in the Mulroney and Campbell governments. I learned so much from those whom I worked for, from MP Bill Attewell, to ministers of the Crown, the Hon. Barbara McDougall and the Hon. Peter McCreath. I must thank them for their mentorship and guidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867933">I must also acknowledge my wife Wendy Waite whom I met when she was working for the Hon. Pat Carney and the Right Hon. Kim Campbell. Free trade brought us together, but I can tell members about that another time. She has supported my lifelong journey to this place like no other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867934">I acknowledge my parents Rosemarie Borgald Perkins and William Perkins, who instilled in me the belief of possibilities and the need for hard work to achieve those possibilities. My mother's family landed in Lunenburg 277 years ago, in 1753. I am the eighth generation in a row to live in my community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867935">Two other people I need to thank out of the hundreds of volunteers are my campaign anchors for seven years in South Shore—St. Margarets. Evelyn Snyder and Rick Muzyk have been with me on this journey since 2014. It started with my nomination campaign against Richard Clark. I could not stand in this place without their support and belief.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867936">When I had the great privilege of joining members of all sides last Tuesday to march to the other place to listen to the Speech from the Throne, I had high expectations that issues that were of concern to my community would be addressed. While I stood behind our Speaker in the other place, I was sorely disappointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867937"> As I listened to the rehashed broken promises of the 2015 Liberal platform, it reminded me of one of the most famous quotes by the Right Hon. Kim Campbell when speaking of a political opponent. She said that style “without substance is a dangerous thing.” Style without substance appears to be the theme the PMO speech writers were thinking of when they wrote this document. I say this because the most important industry in my province and my riding is the fishery. There was no mention of the importance of the fishery in the throne speech. There was no mention of our forest products industry. There was no word said about tourism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867938"> From Peggy's Cove to Chester, from Lunenburg to Liverpool, from New Ross to Mahone Bay, from Cape Sable Island to Shag Harbour, my community was looking for their concerns to be in the throne speech. My constituents were looking for a commitment from the government that we would all work toward more access to the commercial fishery for first nations, a commitment that this access be granted on the same rules and enforcement measures to which all commercial fishermen were subject. We have seasons for a reason.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867939"> My community was looking for a commitment that any public policy on the moderate livelihood fishery be developed in compliance with the legal framework of the Supreme Court's Marshall decisions, not outside of them as has been done so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867940">When I was speaking with lobster fishermen Vincent Boutilier, Sandie Stoddard and Bobby Hynes, they expressed little surprise that the fishery was not mentioned. They said that over the last six years they had come to expect nothing but more bureaucracy from the Liberal government and more initiatives aimed at making it more difficult to earn a living from the sea. They recognized that the attacks by the government on the fishery, whether through reduced quotas backed by questionable research, increased regulation and the threat of targeted marine protected areas aimed at shutting down the industry, were insidious ways the Liberals were using the smokescreen of conservation to reduce commercial fishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867941"> People who earn a living from the sea were looking for some recognition from the Liberals on the need for predation policy, an invasive species policy. There is an explosive growth of seals and sea lions, which is devastating our Atlantic and Pacific fish species. The government claims to care about the biodiversity of our oceans, but it has no policy and makes no effort to try to get our oceans back in balance. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867942">The fishing communities were looking for some indication from the government that it acknowledged that it had made a huge mistake in the clawback from the fishermen who received the COVID-19 fish harvester benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867943"> When launching this benefit during the COVID crisis, the government said, “Our fisheries operate under a unique structure and have faced distinct challenges throughout this pandemic.” The Liberals bragged about how hard they had worked to get it right, and now they have it wrong and are attacking the men and women at the back of the boat.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867947">Mr. Speaker, this tradition made it into the application process for the government's fish harvester benefit as a recognition that the traditional wage earner COVID benefits did not work for fishermen. The application the government put forward stated five situations which qualified for benefits. It recognized the centuries of pay structure for fishermen. DFO's application stated one of the types of fishermen's pay that was eligible, “sharepersons...who are crew members who earn a share of the revenue”, which is bang on. Therefore, why is the government taking it back from them? It is bait and switch, the Liberal approach to everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867948">The federal government is demanding that 4,193 Canadian fishermen repay $25.8 million in COVID-relief assistance. More than half the fishermen issued overpayment letters are in Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867949">Travis Nickerson of Clark's Harbour in my riding received an overpayment letter. Travis said that the situation was a mess. He said, “They gave me something when I really needed it, and now they want it back.” Nickerson is paid a share of the catch. He saw his income drop in the first half of 2020 when COVID-19 crushed the demand for lobster worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867950"> The share-based earnings are evident, and there is record of employment, like all other fishermen. It is easy to see, yet the government seems to have its own departments fighting each other. It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="278923" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries</Affiliation> to step up and do her job for all fishermen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867951">I will be relentless in speaking out for our fishermen, our forestry workers, our agriculture workers and our tourism businesses. All are being ignored and harmed by the government. When the chapter of the government is written in the history books, it will be a slim chapter of achievement. It will likely be titled with that great quote from Kim Campbell “Style without substance.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867953"> This war on the resource industries has to stop.

              <ParaText id="6867957">With regard to the CERB and the fish harvester benefit, the member probably does not know and understand, since he is from a non-fishing riding in Winnipeg North, although I am not sure, that 99% of fishermen are paid by a percentage of the catch, and they have been for hundreds of years. That is why they did not qualify for CERB. CERB was for wage earners who were paid a regular wage. Fishermen are paid like a commissioned sales worker when they are at the back of the boat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867958">A special program, which we supported, was designed. It was a properly designed program with a proper application. The problem is that it was designed by DFO, but Revenue Canada does not understand how fishermen are paid. It just looks at a T4, notes that they are employees in the box and it wants their money back. The two departments will not talk to each other. All they have to do is look at the record of employment, see the week-by-week earnings and they will have the solution, but that is too complicated for the Liberal government.</ParaText>

Absolutely, it was a fantastic thing that the whole world was able to get together, including businesses, to quickly develop a vaccine so we could control the spread of COVID. That is thanks to all the work of these global companies that produced a vaccine in record time, for which we should all be thankful.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6867977">My name is Lena Metlege Diab. I am a proud Lebanese Nova Scotian, a mother of four children, a grandmother to four, a small business owner, a lawyer and a community volunteer. Though I am new to this chamber, I am not new to political life. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867978">Prior to the election, I served two terms as a member of the legislative assembly of Nova Scotia, with you, Mr. Speaker, when you were in that chamber. I also served as the provincial cabinet minister responsible for justice, public safety, immigration and population growth, labour and advanced education, and Acadian affairs and francophonie. In 2013, I was appointed as the first female attorney general in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867979">In my previous roles, I worked hard to push forward the cause of equity, address Nova Scotia’s economic and demographic challenges, and support businesses and workers. That is why I was so encouraged by the themes and priorities laid out in this year’s Speech from the Throne. What was clear to me was that the government gets the type of action this moment calls for. If ever there were a time when Canadians needed an active government, a government that takes the reins and charts the course, that time is now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867980">That is the vision I see in this year’s Speech from the Throne, one that is bold, forward-looking and intentional. It is an acknowledgement that our biggest problems will not simply right themselves, including the climate emergency, the housing shortage, the inequities experienced by many of our community members, and the challenges of building back our workforce and our industries from a once-in-a-lifetime economic shock. We have to act intentionally, collaboratively and urgently on them all, and we have to back that up with real investment and meaningful policy change.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6867981">I will now come back to the incredible diversity in my riding. As I knocked on doors in Halifax West, I met people from around the globe. Many are not yet Canadian citizens, but their stories are touching and inspiring to me. I myself experienced life as an immigrant when I came to Canada at the age of 11. What struck me the most about these people was their great hope and immense pride in being here and soon joining our Canadian family and community.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6867982">I remember my days as a young girl at St. Agnes Junior High in Halifax, feeling brand new to my city. At the time, I was still working to learn English, and I did not truly understand what the other children were saying about me. I knew they looked at the way I looked, the way I wore my hair, and I could sense they saw me as different from them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867983">However, after eight years serving as Nova Scotia's immigration minister, I know that today the hearts of Nova Scotians are more open than ever before. This is why I am so encouraged by the Speech from the Throne’s mentions of increasing immigration, reducing wait times for reunification and a continuing the commitment to resettle those displaced from their homes. My community is a daily reminder and living proof that our diversity is our strength. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867985">There are many forms of hatred and discrimination in our communities, and truly addressing them requires continuous, vigilant action from all levels of government and collaboration from all members in the House. This is something I am committed to working on in my time here, and I see that too in the Speech from the Throne. We need active, renewed initiative when it comes to eliminating racism and bigotry from our communities. An essential part of my mission here is to do what I can to ensure my community and my country feel like home for every individual and family, no matter where they come from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867986">In Nova Scotia, we are now just counting the days before the mark of one million residents is passed. Having been on the front lines of that work, I could not be more proud. It is clear from the Speech from the Throne that this government understands how essential immigration is in strengthening our economy, our workforce, our communities and our public services in Nova Scotia and across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867987">At the same time, we must act purposefully to ensure that the economy we rebuild after this pandemic includes everyone. It is inconceivable to me that we would let the pandemic roll back the gains made by women and under-represented communities in the workforce.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6867988">I see the government's commitment in that in its establishing of an affordable national early child care system and its investing in the empowerment of Black, racialized and indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6867989">I am encouraged by the priorities and the focus. I am encouraged because I came here to make a difference in the lives of Canadians, and I welcome the attention given to these pressing issues, which I heard about on the door steps.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868020">Our community held two incredible national events last month at Red Deer's Westerner Park. Agri-trade is one of Canada's premier agricultural events. It features the very best in equipment, technology and services, and showcases true farmer ingenuity. We also hosted the 47th Canadian Finals Rodeo, which not only is a vital part of our western heritage but also highlights how sports and agriculture are key to our growing economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868021">Agriculture is also the backbone of our nation's economy. Events such as these foster the grassroots relationship that connects us to the legacy of Alberta farmers, who put food on our tables and preserve our environment.

              <ParaText id="6868027">Mr. Speaker, as of today, the Media Food Drive, also known as the guignolée des médias, is under way across most of Quebec. The goal is to collect donations to help less fortunate individuals and families as the holidays draw near. Every year for the past 22 years, except last year, media organizations are out on the streets, creating a festive atmosphere, asking passersby for donations, and cultivating the generosity of Quebeckers who are more than willing to give money and non-perishable food items. Many merchants pitch in by collecting food donations. Cash donations can also be made at guignolée.ca.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868028">Over 100 community organizations will then redistribute the proceeds of Quebeckers' solidarity to individuals and families. This year, because of the pandemic, the cost of living and grocery bills have been going up faster than ever, and food insecurity affects thousands of people in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868029">The Bloc encourages Quebeckers to give as much as they are able to so everyone can enjoy happy holiday celebrations.</ParaText>

No less than one in five articles of cotton clothing sold in the world is made in part by Uighur slave labour. Yes, I said one in five articles of clothing. Tragically, the Uighurs are being subjected to a genocide, and forced labour and slavery is just one horrific part of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868072">Despite this, the Government of Canada is bowing to China. Yesterday, it refused to use the Olympic Games to put diplomatic pressure on China to authorize an investigation into the abuses inflicted on Uighurs.</ParaText>

Disposing of waste in this manner is dangerous to people, to the environment and to our fish stocks, and it is unacceptable. It is one of the reasons our government modernized the Fisheries Act to protect and restore fish habitats, which a previous government had cut out. We will hold any individuals who violate this act to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868295">In his intervention, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278422" Type="2">Banff—Airdrie</Affiliation>, citing references and precedents, alleged that the board neither has the statutory authority nor the delegated authority from the House to make the decision it made on October 19, 2021, requiring that members be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or provide a valid medical exemption coupled with negative test results to be able to access the precinct. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868296">The <Affiliation DbId="278913" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> stated that the board acted within its mandate as per section 52.3 of the Parliament of Canada Act with regard to action respecting all financial and administrative matters concerning the House, its premises, its services and members. He noted that the board’s decision takes into account the collective interest and health of all members to permit the House to discharge its functions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868297">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278185" Type="2">Salaberry—Suroît</Affiliation> also later rose on a similar matter, stating that the Conservative Party's refusal to disclose its members' vaccination status is in itself a violation of the House’s privileges. She noted that the collective privileges of the House take precedence over those of individual members insofar as the health and safety of members is concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868298">The Chair wants to address this particular concern by assuring everyone in this House that all medical exemptions, whether for members or for staff, are reviewed by the health and safety personnel of the House administration. Anyone with a valid exemption must provide a recent negative COVID-19 test result in order to access the buildings in the precinct.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6868299">The question for the Chair to consider is whether the issue of the interplay between the board’s decision and the privileges of the House deserves priority of consideration over all other business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868300">The Board of Internal Economy is the statutory governing body of the House of Commons. Its authority comes from the Parliament of Canada Act, the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the Standing Orders of the House. It is composed of members from all recognized parties and chaired by the Speaker. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the board has instituted various health and safety measures for the protection of everyone working in the precinct and to ensure the continued functioning of the House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868301">Among its privileges, rights and powers, the House has the right to regulate and administer its precinct, as well as the authority to maintain the attendance and service of its members. As stated in the third edition of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, at page 122, and I quote:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The privileges of the House of Commons include “such rights as are necessary for free action within its jurisdiction and the necessary authority to enforce these rights if challenged”. It is well established that, by extension, the House has complete and sole authority to regulate and administer its precinct, without outside interference, including controlling access to the buildings.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="6868303">If limits are to be placed on members’ access to the buildings, it would seem consistent with these principles that such limits be established by the House itself. However, it is important to consider the unique context in which the board’s decision was made. During a time when Parliament was dissolved, the board was faced with a decision regarding mandatory vaccinations in order to access the precinct. It made a decision, after considering recommendations from various public health authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic, to protect the health and safety of all those who work in these buildings. As the House had not yet been called into session, it was not in a position to pronounce itself on the matter.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868304"> The board's decision to restrict access to the precinct only to those who are fully vaccinated or who have a valid medical exemption, including members, has the effect of putting conditions on members' participation in the proceedings of the House. Since the question of privilege was raised, the House has adopted a motion that addresses this matter, meaning the House has explicitly endorsed the BOIE's decision and the conditions it imposes on members' participation in the proceedings. While the matter of mandatory vaccination for members has been settled, the Chair is satisfied that the interplay between the rights and privileges of the House and the jurisdiction of the board remains an issue, with the board appearing to have exceeded its authority in a way that conflicts with the privileges of the House. </ParaText>

The Chair has previously stated, in similar circumstances, in a decision from June 16, 2021, on page 8552 of the Debates, “given that the parameters for such motions are clear and that the practice is well established, the proposed motion should be a motion of censure or to refer the matter to the appropriate committee for study.” </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868311">I will put aside the question of the appropriateness or the ability of an order made in one Parliament to bind a future Parliament. Rather, I will stick to the substance of the matter raised in the previous Parliament, and our government's desire to work collaboratively with opposition parties to find an appropriate mechanism to deal with the request for documents that contain information subject to national security confidentiality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868312">As we all know, in the 43rd Parliament all opposition parties pressed the government to publicly release documents that contained information subject to national security that would have been injurious to Canada's reputation with its international security partners. In the previous Parliament, members should know that the Public Health Agency worked diligently to try to comply with the order of the House. In undertaking this work, the agency attempted to balance the right of parliamentarians to have access to information and the duty of the government to protect such information from public disclosure.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868318"> This spirit brings to mind Speaker Milliken's ruling of April 27, 2010, respecting the right to institute inquiries and to order the production of documents. I will quote from Speaker Milliken's ruling:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Certainly from the submissions I have heard, it is evident to the Chair that all members take seriously the sensitive nature of these documents and the need to protect the confidential information they contain. The Chair must conclude that it is within the powers of the House of Commons to ask for the documents sought in the December 10 order it adopted. Now it seems to me that the issue before us is this: Is it possible to put in place a mechanism by which these documents could be made available to the House without compromising the security and confidentiality of the information they contain? In other words, is it possible for the two sides, working together in the best interests of the Canadians they serve, to devise a means where both their concerns are met? Surely that is not too much to hope for. </QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868320">Building on the approach taken by the House in 2010, our government believes there is good reason for hope of a resolution. I would like to walk members through a proposed vetting mechanism that would allow certain parliamentarians to see unredacted versions of the documents while ensuring the ongoing protection of sensitive information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868321">The proposed mechanism is based on the ad hoc committee of parliamentarians and the panel of arbiters used in 2010 for records related to the transfer of Afghan detainees from the Canadian Armed Forces to the Afghan authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868322"> The proposed model balances two key principles: first, accountability to Parliament by maximizing disclosure and transparency to the greatest extent that is possible; and second, the protection of sensitive and confidential information from disclosure where it would be injurious to our nation. It reflects the government's understanding of the House of Commons' role in holding the government to account and its need for complete and accurate information in order to fulfill this role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868323">At the same time, it reflects the House of Commons' understanding of the government's responsibilities in matters of national security, national defence and international relations. It further reflects that information subject to solicitor-client privilege or cabinet confidences are classes of information that Parliament has long recognized are sensitive and may require protection from disclosure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868324">I would now like to walk members through the proposal detailing the composition of the committees, the panel of arbiters, appropriate security measures to safeguard the information and the methods for screening records. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868325">Let me begin with the proposed composition of the committee and the panel of arbiters. The government and opposition parties would sign a memorandum of understanding to create the committee and select a panel of arbiters. The committee would be comprised of one member from each of the signatory parties and one alternate member from each party. The panel of arbiters could be comprised of three former senior judges who were agreed upon by the signatories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868326">Second, let me address the security measures to safeguard information. Members of the ad hoc committee would conduct their business within a secure government facility and be subject to appropriate security measures to safeguard sensitive and confidential information. This includes procedural, physical and technical security measures and the requirement that members of the committee would undergo the same security screening as members of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians in order to obtain the appropriate security clearance. The work of the ad hoc committee and the panel of arbiters would be supported by security-cleared, non-partisan public servants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868327">MPs on the committee would be provided with both the redacted and non-redacted versions of the documents provided by the government. Where there is a disagreement concerning what information should be released publicly, the committee would refer the disputed information to the panel of arbiters. The panel of arbiters, agreed upon by all parties, would make a binding determination regarding how that information could be made available to members of Parliament and the public without compromising national security, national defence or international relations. This could occur by redaction, the writing of summaries, or the full or partial release of the material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868328">Finally, let me touch upon methods for the screening of records. The proposed model has a method for screening records containing information, the disclosure of which would be injurious to national security, national defence or international relations, otherwise collectively known as national security confidentialities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868329">Madam Speaker, as you can see, our government has taken seriously the need to provide a reasonable oversight mechanism for the review of documents containing confidential national security information, as stipulated in Speaker Milliken's April 2010 ruling. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868330">Members will note the similarity to the approach taken in 2010, which was deemed by a majority of the recognized parties at the time to be both reasonable and an effective balance between the interests of parliamentarians in obtaining the information they need and ensuring that confidential national security information is treated with the discretion necessary to protect the interests of Canadians and our great country.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6868331">I was a critic at that time in 2010. I can say the system worked with great effectiveness at achieving that balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868332">I look forward to fruitful deliberations with my colleagues on the opposition benches and, as Speaker Milliken stated, I believe that collaboration among all parties is truly not too much to hope for. I thank members of the House for their attention to this important matter and for their indulgence in responding to this question of privilege. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868333">In closing, we believe this proposal constitutes a good-faith effort by the government to resolve this matter responsibly. It recognizes the role of the House of Commons to do its work, and it also respects the government's obligation to protect Canadians from the harm that could occur with the release of sensitive national security information. In the end, it is a responsibility that we each bear as a member of Parliament. We must do our jobs in this place, and we must fulfill our duties in a responsible manner to uphold the principles of national security designated to us to protect this great country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868362">In terms of health care and COVID-19, I want to first of all start by echoing some of what we heard in the Speech from the Throne. My condolences to not only the family of the senator who passed because of COVID, Senator Forest-Niesing, but also to the families of 29,714 individuals who, as of early December of this year, have lost their lives due to COVID-19.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868363">We have, by international accounts, one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world as of right now: 86% of all Canadians who are 12 and over are fully vaccinated. In my city of Toronto, it is 85% and that surpasses many other major cities such as London, England; New York City; Chicago; and Los Angeles. We will continue as a government to build off the fact that we have provided 60 million vaccination doses thus far, including boosters and first doses to young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868364"> In terms of young people, members heard me mention Zakir and Nitin. My boys are age 10 and 7, respectively. They got their first dose last Sunday at a walk-in clinic in Toronto, making me and their mom, Suchita, very proud of those two little guys. Instead of exhibiting vaccine hesitancy, they exhibited vaccine restlessness and fought with each other over who would get to go first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868365">My parents, both nearly 80, are being vaccinated for the third time this week. Now that I am of the tender age of 50, apparently in Ontario I will be eligible for my third dose because that is what is happening with boosters for those who are over 50. I am now part of that little group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868366">I think what is important is that we have a track record as a government of providing vaccines for free to all Canadians who want vaccines. I am proud of that record and our record of making vaccines mandatory for federal civil servants, federally regulated industries and interprovincial travel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868367">I am also very proud that one of the first acts that we have taken as the Liberal government was to table legislation, Bill <Document DbId="11474302" Type="3">C-3</Document>, which would create a new offence for those who intimidate health care workers or seek to prevent someone from accessing health care treatment. I am not just speaking about my wife here. I am speaking about thousands and thousands of other health care workers who have done so much to keep us safe from COVID-19 in these past 22 months. Those individuals deserve our praise and our gratitude, not our scorn or our abuse.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868368">However, I know that ending this pandemic requires investing in our health care systems and dismantling barriers for vulnerable populations. I am thinking about Joyce Echaquan and the indigenous experience in health care in this country. It is also about clearing the backlog of COVID-19 cases. It is about reducing delays, strengthening the protections in our long-term care homes and protecting seniors in care, improving access to mental health and addictions services and I am proud that we now have a minister devoted to just that, and preventing privatization from entering our health care systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868369">Members heard me speak about climate as one of my priorities and one of the priorities of my constituents. Climate change was top of mind for voters in this fall's election, not just in my riding, but around the country. Obviously, our thoughts, prayers and hopes go out to all of our neighbours in British Columbia who are, in the span of several months, dealing with wildfires and now dealing with tragic mudslides. Tackling climate change is not a B.C. issue. It is a Canadian issue. It is a global issue. We were elected with a mandate to move on this and that is exactly what we are doing. We heard that outlined in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868370"> We are increasing the price on pollution and the climate rebate, which allows Canadians to make changes in their own personal lives. We are banning single-use plastics. We are making it impossible to buy a new car or light-duty truck that is not electric by 2035, and we are making that more possible by providing generous federal rebates for the purchase of such vehicles and by providing more vehicle charging infrastructure. We are putting a cap on oil and gas sector GHG emissions and moving the entire country to net-zero emissions by 2050 on legislated five-year increments. We are ending fossil fuel subsidies by 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868371">On the electricity grid, we are phasing out coal as a source of energy across the country by 2030. This is something that we, as Liberals, were successful in doing in Ontario over a decade ago by phasing out coal. How does this impact my constituents? In ridings like mine in Parkdale—High Park, we have increased bike shares and bike lanes. There are nine new bike shares to promote active transport. We have provided funding for green infrastructure to the High Park Zoo and the High Park Nature Centre to the tune of almost $4 million for sustainable energy projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868372">On housing, we are strengthening our economy by ensuring that housing is affordable. I heard repeatedly on the campaign trail from all sectors about supportive housing, rental housing and those who want to buy. We are delivering for communities like mine through things like the NHS, the national housing plan, subsidies for co-op renters in federal co-ops and $1.2 billion put into TCHC to maintain, repair and renovate units. We have also implemented a rapid housing initiative and expanded it, which has delivered $14 million to constituents in my riding to ensure that new housing is being built. This is critical to that inclusive recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868373">I also talked about human rights and fighting discrimination. I came to this place as a Constitution and human rights lawyer in 2015. The orientation that I have and commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms has not wavered. In these past six years, I have been very privileged to work on many aspects such as settling Syrian refugees, re-enacting a national anti-racism strategy, fighting Islamophobia, securing legal aid for refugee claimants and tabling legislation to combat online hate in the last Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868374">This is important human rights work and it must continue. I pledge to my constituents to continue to be a strong voice for human rights for those in Eastern Europe who are facing aggression by Vladimir Putin and Russia, including Ukrainians and Poles. I also redoubled my commitment to my Tibetan constituents who seek nothing more than the basic permission to speak their language and practise Tibetan Buddhism from the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Middle Way approach, advocated by the Dalai Lama, can help secure this and I will continue to advocate for that approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868375">Domestically, advocacy for human rights must include renewed commitment to reconciliation. I learned so much about where we are and how far we have to go when I was privileged to work on the Indigenous Languages Act in the 42nd Parliament. My constituents, like me, were horrified by the discoveries of the unmarked graves at residential school sites. I have committed to my constituents publicly and I will commit to them here today that my work on fighting discrimination will focus on fighting anti-indigenous discrimination. There is so much more work to be done in terms of boil water advisories and ending discrimination in the child welfare system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868376">Finally, I commit to the work that is needed to be done with the LGBTQ2 community. We had a historic day in Parliament yesterday with Bill <Document DbId="11476884" Type="3">C-4</Document> receiving unanimous consent, but the work is not done until that bill passes through the Senate and becomes law through royal assent. Only then will the equality rights of LGBTQ2 Canadians and all Canadians be fully protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868377">This is the work I am committed to in terms of climate action, housing action, fighting against inequality, and fighting against discrimination and for human rights, domestically and abroad. The Speech from the Throne outlines what we will be doing as a government and I am very proud to be partaking in that work.</ParaText>

Fundamental freedoms have been at issue, in terms of COVID and the response to the COVID pandemic, but when we are talking about charter rights and mobility rights, it needs to be crystal clear that people have the right of entry and exit from the country, and the right to re-enter. Even the most recent restrictions we have put on people who have been travelling to places or countries that have an omicron epidemic in their localities do not restrict the return of Canadians into this country. That is the first point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868381">The second point is understanding that all charter rights are subject to what is called the saving clause, under section 1, where reasonable limitations can be put on charter rights if they are reasonably prescribed and deemed a reasonable limit that is commensurate with a free and democratic society. The pandemic we are living through is an emergency of a type not seen in 100 years. It has required extensive measures and sometimes extensive limitations in order to keep people safe. That is something I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="278446" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation> and I would agree on, and it is the fundamental—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868388">In fact, health care is a shared jurisdiction between the two levels of government. I could give a number of examples, the first being the Canada Health Act, which divides the health care powers and allocates some to the federal government.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="6868389">I can also highlight the Tobacco Control Act, which allows the federal government to enact regulations that deal with health and has been upheld in litigation cases as properly falling under the federal health care jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868390">Of course, we would also recognize the fact that the federal government, at the Canadian level, has jurisdiction over health care matters with respect to first nations populations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868397">I would like to take a moment to thank the volunteers at the Centre d'entraide Saint‑Colomban, the parish of Saint Francis of Assisi in Oka, and the Carrefour d'entraide Saint-Placide for organizing their charity drive. This was a tremendous act of selflessness, and I commend them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868399">As a new member of Parliament, I was hoping to hear great things here, especially in the Speech from the Throne. To me, that speech was the ideal time for the government to set out its agenda and, without explaining each of its policies in detail, at least share its ambitions for the next four years. I say four years because I hope the Liberals realize that they cannot just call an election whenever they feel like it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868400">I had expectations when reading the Speech from the Throne, and this may have been the academic in me, but I was looking for footnotes because the speech was lacking in content, which bothered me. During the tough election campaign, I met with Mirabel residents who wanted to know why the election had been called and why they would have to go to the polling station in the middle of summer in the middle of a pandemic. These people, these families, these young people, including people from flood-stricken Sainte‑Marthe‑sur‑le‑lac, also talked to me about the environment and climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868401">I was expecting to find answers in the throne speech. The Bloc Québécois has been sounding the alarm for years now, saying that the government, whether current or previous, is not doing anything. We are told that we have it all wrong, so we respond that the government is not meeting its targets, and then we are told again that we have it all wrong and that the government is taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868402">Did the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development have it all wrong when he indicated in the report he released a few days ago that the government had not delivered? Canada is the laughingstock of the G7. It cannot even meet its own targets and it is using 2005 as the baseline year instead of 1990 so that it can conceal 15 years of unchecked exploitation of dirty oil. That is unacceptable. The other self-respecting countries, including Quebec and the 27 EU countries, use 1990 as the baseline year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868403">Being open-minded, I was curious to see how the minister would explain these facts. The minister told us that it was because of the Harper era. He said this even though the environment commissioner's report covered all the years under the current government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868404">As I said, however, I keep an open mind, so I kept listening. The government told us that the Liberals were taking action, but that the Harper government had been so terrible that we were still suffering the consequences. I decided to do a bit of research to see what this government has done for the climate, and I will admit that it has taken action: it went out west to buy a pipeline that cost $4.5 billion of taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868405">Not being very smart, I did not quite understand why the government did that. The explanation it gave was that the pipeline would be so profitable that the government could use the profits to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868406">I am a good researcher, so I checked reports from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. I figured that the federal government must be making money on this, because every 15 minutes, the minister says that the government is taking action on climate change. However, the rate of return on the public money invested in the pipeline is 0.5%. In comparison, as the Conservatives keep saying, the inflation rate is 5%. As members can see, the environment is of virtually no importance to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868407">I wanted to make a joke. I wanted to calculate how many trees could be planted with the profits from this pipeline, but I realized that without Alberta's tax relief, the pipeline would be in the red. In order for my joke to work, I would have to go into the forest and tear down trees, which makes no sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868408">I continued to think about this. I am a very calm and logical person. I told myself that there was surely something going on that I did not understand. There are so many intelligent people in this place who are helping to save the planet. It was at that point that I understood what comes next.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868409">What comes next is that the pipeline has to be expanded. We did not figure it out, but Canada has to inject at least another $12 billion of public money into the pipeline. If we expand the pipeline, pump out more oil and increase production, what will happen? There will be more money to combat climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868410">This is the kind of thing that makes Quebeckers and Canadians cynical. However, if Canadians and Quebeckers do not fully understand the message that the government is sending, the financial markets do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868411">What message is the government sending the financial markets? It is the following. If you are a foreign company that decides to set up shop in western Canada and you make a bad investment in a pipeline, which, besides being unprofitable is not supported by civil society, the Liberal Party will be there to help you. If the company fails or is no good, the Liberal Party will be there to help. That is what is known as <I>too big to fail</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868412">Let us not then be surprised when there are problems and a big part of the country is trapped in this industry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868413">The Bloc Québécois is a party that makes proposals. What this situation shows us is that we must address the issue of the money going out to those provinces and this industry. The facts show that over the past five years, our own banks have invested $700 billion in this industry, money taken from savers, families, people who put money in the piggy bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868414">We are therefore proposing a green finance platform. It is very simple: We believe that Canadian banks should be required to publicly declare how much they are investing in the oil and gas sector. It is a matter of transparency. They should have to disclose their investments. Nutritional information is disclosed, chemicals are disclosed, the content of feather pillows has to be disclosed, but when we deposit our money with a Canadian financial institution, we cannot find out if our money is brown or green. That is what we are asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868415">I know that the Conservatives will not like me. They believe in the free market, but as it happens, I am an economics professor. The first thing we teach CEGEP students is that a market economy only works when there is transparency, when people know where they are putting their money, when they know what they are doing. That is what we are asking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868416">In conclusion, I just want to say one thing. We know the western provinces are victims. Jean Chrétien himself said that, if he had given as much money to Quebec as he did to Alberta, he would have won every seat in Quebec. I personally think Quebeckers have better judgment than that. Still, the message is there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868417">Western Canada's fossil fuel industry is essentially a state enterprise subsidized and supported by various levels of government. <Query /> That is why we also want to propose green equalization, which is so important to us. This program, which will benefit provinces that do their utmost to reduce emissions, will take equalization and current oil subsidies into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868418">We are reaching out and hoping for a little introspection on both sides of the House. I can guarantee that there are not a lot of fingerprints on the dictionary page with the word “introspection”. If we want to fix the problem, we have to admit there is a problem. We are a petrostate. Quebeckers are victims of the petrostate. Quebec's economy is a victim of the petrostate. We need to cap production and reduce it. We need to focus on the future. That is a fact. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868439">Madam Speaker, my brilliant economist colleague from Mirabel is a hard act to follow. I do not know if I will be able to reach the bar he set, but I will give it a shot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868440">As I rise today for my first speech in this 44th Parliament, I am filled with immense gratitude. I would like to begin by thanking all of my volunteers, the members of my office team, my family, and my partner. I will stop here with the acknowledgements, not only because I am afraid that I will forget someone, but also because I want to save some time for my speech. However, before I begin, I do want to thank the voters of Shefford for placing their trust in me for a second term in these unusual times. This election was held in the middle of a pandemic, and now we can finally see what it was all for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868441">Here we have a new throne speech. My first impression is that this speech is full of things that interfere in areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces, such as housing, police reform, mental health, natural resource management, violence prevention, and women's services. As well, it fails to mention major issues like health transfers, the energy transition, green finance, EI reform, agriculture, and, most importantly, seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868442">My colleagues will understand that, as the critic for the status of women, gender equality and seniors, my speech will focus on the following areas: seniors, health, women, and the economic recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868443">First, I noticed that seniors are completely left out of the Speech from the Throne, even though we have seen that they continue to suffer the effects of the pandemic. Their financial situation, which was already precarious long before the pandemic, has been exacerbated by the crisis, yet there is nothing for seniors aged 65 to 74, the ones the government always leaves behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868444">The government could have taken advantage of the Speech from the Throne to right another wrong. I am referring to something that simply does not sit well with the seniors' groups I consulted, this idea of creating two classes of seniors: those 75 and up and those 74 and under. They should all be eligible for an OAS increase of $110 per month starting at age 65, as the Bloc Québécois is proposing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868445">It gets worse. In its Speech from the Throne, the government said nothing at all about seniors. I may be repeating myself, but it could have also addressed the GIS clawback that seniors who received the CERB are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868446"> As early as spring 2020, ACEF groups contacted the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> to share their concerns on this issue, but they got no response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868447">In August 2021, I sent a letter to the former <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation>, and my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation>, sent a message to the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. The election campaign started, and nothing happened. We have since sent letters to the new <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> and the Minister of Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868448">Let me stress that our solution is simple. Drastic times call for drastic measures. We want CERB, in this case, to be considered employment income, not an “other benefit”. That is actually what it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868449">Seniors who had to leave their jobs because of the pandemic were entitled to CERB. They should not have an average of $400 clawed back from their cheques. They should all be entitled to a review of their file based on their actual income. The impact on their monthly income is huge. They have to decide which medications to buy, they cannot afford good food, and they could lose their housing. For some, this is taking a significant toll on their health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868450">If pandemic recovery is still a priority for this government, it should make massive investments in health care and help lift the most vulnerable seniors out of poverty. Instead of interfering in areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces, as it is attempting to do by setting standards for long-term care homes and mental health, it should focus on what it can and should do: respond to Quebec and the provinces' demand to raise federal health transfers from 22% to 35%. That means increasing transfers from $42 billion to $60 billion, a difference of $28 billion per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868451">The government has not made its intentions with respect to health transfers clear, but this is an absolutely vital issue, especially in light of events that have exposed what goes wrong when the system is chronically underfunded. Since the 1990s, neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals have invested enough. They have even cut their health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868452">Quebec and Canadian provinces all agree that health transfers should be increased. The only ones objecting to fixing the chronic underfunding of health care systems are the Liberals, who were the only party that voted against a motion on this subject in the House of Commons that had the support of FTQ, CSN, CSQ and CSD leaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868453">The third point I want to make is about gender-based violence, a topic that is particularly important to me as my party's status of women critic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868454">The national action plan to end gender-based violence is already in place, but a 10-year plan is far too long. The government needs to stop conducting studies and take action by sending the necessary money to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868455">The federal government may not know what to do, but Quebec does. The Bloc Québécois has always said that funds allocated to combat domestic violence should come from Canada health transfers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868456">Quebec is once again in a class of its own when it comes to family and social policy and the structure of its support network. Quebec has a single, cohesive, integrated network to provide health care services and social programs. The federal government's one-size-fits-all policies often overlap with existing Quebec programs, and it is harder for the Government of Quebec to implement its programs when it does not have full control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868457">This reality cannot be ignored and must be taken into account to ensure that any federal involvement is designed to be effective and to respect the ways in which Quebec is different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868458">The recognition of Quebec's special status needs to be an integral part of the process. Any federal involvement must be positive for Quebec and must support Quebec women and girls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868459">I could have spoken about many other issues, but that is what I hope will be brought forward in the next Parliament, only with a lot more teeth than what we read in this very meagre throne speech. On climate change, the government must not just say that Canada needs to put words into action and that time is of the essence. It must make far more commitments. For example, it must put a cap on oil and gas production, not increase it by focusing on fossil fuels. There is no such thing as clean oil or coal. The Liberals must stop their greenwashing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868460">The government has yet to table a plan with concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reach the 2030 target. It must admit that the Trans Mountain expansion is pointless and cancel this project. The money saved must be used to fund the green transition and a green recovery, as was already proposed by the Bloc Québécois in the post-COVID-19 recovery plan it released when Parliament resumed in September 2020. It proposed creating real green financing by encouraging the banks to invest heavily in the green recovery, clean energy, green technologies and energy efficiency, which will provide real protection for our environment in the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868461">We also need to ensure that the economy grows with targeted and prudent spending support, including the extension of support measures, as well as targeted support for affected industries, such as culture and tourism. Both of those economic sectors are so important to Shefford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868462">We will keep a close eye on how Bill C-2 is implemented and propose improvements. We also need to combat inflation and address the very important issue of the labour shortage, for which the Bloc Québécois made seven very worthwhile proposals during the last campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868463">We also need to work on family reunification and on a refugee resettlement program, and, really, the issue of immigration in general, since it remains so problematic and takes up so much of my office staff's time. We also need to work on the issue of social housing and homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868464">In closing, I would point out that getting out of this crisis calls for a clear plan, and we saw no such thing in the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868465">To bring this full circle, let us look at seniors again. One way to protect people from the effects of inflation is to ensure decent purchasing power, especially for seniors. That is why people must be outraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868466"> As the great Quebec humorist Yvon Deschamps once said, one is always better off being rich and healthy than sick and poor. That was true in the 1960s and it is unfortunately still true in 2021 for far too many disadvantaged seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868467">We should be appalled by the disregard being shown to those who built Quebec and Canada. We must do something about it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868468">Madam Speaker, where I could agree with the member is that there are a couple of issues, both health care and environment, which are very important issues to Canadians. Where I tend to disagree with the member is on the issue of a plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868469">Just because an opposition member says there is no plan, does not mean there is not a plan. Actually, it is quite the opposite. There is a detailed plan.

Even during the election, independent sources made it very clear that the Liberal Party had the best plan when it came to the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868470">Would the member not agree that Canadians in all regions, including the province of Quebec, recognize that the national government needs to play a stronger role in long-term care facilities and mental health, both of which are very important issues for my constituents and, I would argue, for her constituents too?

              <ParaText id="6868479">Madam Speaker, what we saw most often during the pandemic was women trapped 24 hours a day with their abuser, women who had trouble breaking out of that cycle of violence. As I mentioned in my speech, 10-year action plans take too long, because the time to act is now. We have had 18 femicides in Quebec this year, and that is far too many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868480">The money could go through Quebec, which already has an all-party committee in place and an action plan to fight violence against women, but implementing it will obviously depend on the transfers Quebec receives. Ottawa therefore needs to transfer funds to Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868481">The same thing goes for housing, because the other problem is that we have to find somewhere for these women to stay. Right now, there is a freeze on funding transfers for women's shelters, so these women are having trouble finding a place to live. That is why I mentioned in my speech how important it is that we take action and transfer money for more housing so that Quebec can implement its action plan to fight violence against women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868482">Ottawa will soon be introducing legislation related to the Department of Justice that will require careful consideration by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.

I am all for getting rid of that pipeline. We cannot meet the Paris targets if we increase oil sands production. However, many members seem to be misunderstanding something.</ParaText>

It was, until the floods, bringing crude oil from Alberta to a refinery in Burnaby. That one I do not think anyone had any trouble with. It had been running for a long time, it was just old, and we spent way too much money for it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868490">Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak this afternoon from the unceded lands of the Algonquin people. I want to acknowledge that I represent Scarborough—Rouge Park, the lands of many indigenous nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868491">I want to first thank the people of Scarborough—Rouge Park for their incredible support. I was able to secure over 63% of votes in the last election, and it is my third time representing the great people of Scarborough—Rouge Park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868492"> Of course, I could not have done this without the incredible volunteers. I had over 600 volunteers who worked day and night. We knocked on over 115,000 doors. They inspired me greatly, the young men and women who came out day and night. I had to set a very high bar for the type of campaign I ran. It was a very positive campaign. It was not about taking down the opposition; it was about presenting a very positive vision of Canada. I was very proud to do that throughout the campaign.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868493">I want to take the time to acknowledge those who were part of my core team, including Shauna, David, Waleed, Gavin, Piyush, Ella, Anojini and Asma, who worked diligently to get the results we got; my election day chair Gowthaman; and campaign managers Joshua and Dorine. They were incredible in their efforts. I also want to thank the donors, those who cooked, those who put up signs, those who scrutineered, those who did everything possible to make this election a success, including the very responsible staff at Elections Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868494">Endeavours such as politics involve the entire family and I would be remiss if I do not acknowledge the steadfast support of my loving wife Harini and my children Sahanah and Bairavi, who, as every election comes and goes, seem to be getting older and wiser, I might add, but who continue to guide me in all the things I do, including my mother, who has always been my rock and my strength.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868495">I want to congratulate all my colleagues who have been elected for the first time and re-elected, and their families for their sacrifices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868496">I will now reply to the Speech from the Throne and I will be splitting my time with my dear friend from <Affiliation DbId="278602" Type="2">Oakville North—Burlington</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868497">The primary focus of our government over the past two years has been to end the fight on COVID. This is a very important fight that has taken many Canadian lives, but we know we are at the forefront in leading this fight, including the procurement of vaccines and ensuring that those in Canada are vaccinated. Of those eligible, 82.3% have had their first dose and 79.6% have their second, which is an incredible feat for any country. We are also on the cusp of administering the third dose to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868498">This fight has always been taken by frontline and essential workers, many from very marginalized communities. I want to thank them and acknowledge their incredible efforts over the past two years. In my community, the Scarborough Health Network, the TAIBU Community Health Centre, the City of Toronto, led by Dr. Eileen de Villa, and others have been instrumental in this fight. I would be remiss if I did not thank and acknowledge them and their families for their service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868499">Some of the things that have been highlighted over the last two years include mental health. We have lost many people due to mental health over the past few years, but particularly during COVID. I had a very dear friend who took his life, and I know many others are struggling. The Speech from the Throne directly responds to the issues of mental health and addiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868500">Long-term care homes have been a significant challenge. In my riding, in one particular institution, over 53 people died, including one personal support worker. The Speech from the Throne responds to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868501"> Just last week, I had the privilege of visiting the Tony Stacey Centre. It was initially built as a veterans home for seniors. I was able to meet with the chair and some of the staff. There are long-term care homes across the country that are in a similar state of disrepair, but because of the hard work of their management, staff and universal care, they have been able to pull through with minimal loss of life. It is really a sad reflection of the state of our long-term care homes. This is an area where the federal government has a very important role to play, one that is outlined in the Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868502">I want to talk about the resilience of our economy. There are a number of things we need to do, but, first and foremost, it is heartening to see that we have been able to recover 100% of the jobs we lost during the pandemic. Our GDP is close to prepandemic levels. By all accounts, our economy is starting to throttle in full force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868503">However, there are very important lessons we need to learn from the pandemic, including the need for child care. In our case, we proposed $10-a-day child care. I believe eight provinces have now signed on, with the exception of Ontario and New Brunswick. It is a very important initiative and so fundamental for families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868504"> When our kids were young, we had such difficult choices to make, balancing work and other things in life, including, and most important at that time, child care. This will transform families. It will transform the ability of women to be in the workforce in full form. I am very excited about this. I hope the Province of Ontario will soon sign onto $10-a-day child care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868505">We have heard about housing affordability and the cost of living. With the measures we are introducing here, including child care and incentives for first-time homebuyers as well as rent-to-own programs, we know they will support families in Scarborough—Rouge Park and everyone in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868506">The need for bold climate action is so prevalent, as we see floods on both our east and west coasts, as well as very erratic temperatures across the world. We know that some countries may not even exist in a decade or two. As a result, the need to accelerate the fight on climate change is so important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868507">Locally, I want to highlight a couple of things that are happening in my riding of Scarborough—Rouge Park. Earlier this year, the federal government committed to investing $2.26 billion toward the Scarborough subway extension. It is the single-largest investment by any federal government in Scarborough and is a very important tool in the fight against climate change. As well, there is a need for the extension of the Scarborough LRT East to Malvern. The City of Toronto has put in $1.3 billion and I am hopeful that the federal government, through permanent public transit funding, will be able to put its share into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868508">The second part of our action on climate change is the Rouge National Urban Park, which is the model for the rest of Canada. I know we will build on that as we build national parks in other urban centres, including Windsor, Saskatoon and places like Halifax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868509">I would like to acknowledge and reflect on the recent findings in Kamloops and the other children's graves found around the country. It is heartbreaking and it requires a collective effort on the part of all of us, not only to double down on the 94 calls to action but to also ensure that we have truth, accountability and justice. We need to move forward on this to ensure that the survivors who need closure will be able to get it through interlocutory and any other supports that can be provided by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868510">There is a lot more in the Speech from the Throne, but I commit to continue to collaborate with my colleagues across the aisle. I want to ensure that, like the historical vote we had yesterday, we are able to work together to better the lives of Canadians, to ensure that justice exists for the survivors of residential schools and to ensure we move toward a path of reconciliation.</ParaText>

The government was running substantial deficits prior to the pandemic, and it ramped up the spending after the pandemic hit. It was, in fact, printing money, and inflation is on the rise. The solution from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to be to solve inflation by coming up with yet another government program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868513">We know that nothing is really working on that side of the House. Indigenous communities are still waiting for boil water advisories to clear.

              <ParaText id="6868516">However, I have to disagree with him. Child care is so fundamental to families in Canada. When I was knocking on doors, I spoke with many families about the need for affordable child care. Ontario is a rare exception in that it has not signed on. I am very hopeful that it will sign on. It will be transformational, and it will ensure that more people are in the workforce, particularly women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868517">This is an important step. We have learned an important lesson through the pandemic, and it is high time we implement this. We are long overdue for a national child care program. The $10-a-day program would serve that purpose. I look forward to working with my friend opposite on other initiatives that the government brings forward.</ParaText>

However, we know that the Department of Immigration is one of the most dysfunctional departments in the federal government. I do not think that it is right to have staffers in our members' offices spending half of their day dealing with immigration cases that are gathering dust on someone's desk. I get the impression that the Department of Immigration does not have enough resources or people working to deal with the growing backlog.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868520">What solutions does my colleague have in mind? Should we immediately inject more resources into the Department of Immigration? Should we transfer some of these responsibilities to Quebec so that at least everything will be in the same place and there will be less buck-passing between the two levels of government? What does he believe are the solutions?</ParaText>

The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly stated that the heart of reconciliation is to reconcile the pre-existing rights of indigenous peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty.

              <ParaText id="6868541">Building a better future starts with getting the pandemic under control and finishing the job on vaccines. It is because of the efforts of all Canadians that more than 86% of us over 12 years old are fully vaccinated, and children between the age of five and 11, like Roisin and Tiernan O'Meara, are getting the vaccine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868542">Halton Region has done outstanding work distributing vaccines in our community. The leadership of our medical officer of health, Dr. Meghani, has been exceptional, and I want to thank her and her colleagues for their work to keep our community safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868543">To build a healthy future, however, we must do more than get needles in arms. We must strengthen our health care system and public health support for all Canadians, especially for seniors, veterans, persons living with disabilities, vulnerable members of our communities and those who have faced discrimination by the very system that is meant to heal. There is much work to be done on mental health and addictions treatment, on improving long-term care and accessibility, and integrated data collection to inform future decisions and get the best public health results possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868544">Over the last year and a half, I have heard from businesses and individuals who have told me that they do not know how they would have survived without supports from our government. I have heard repeatedly about the labour shortage in Canada. Each of us in this place can be leaders in our communities by talking to business and our chambers of commerce about the untapped potential of people living with disabilities. Twenty-five per cent of Canadians are living with a disability, and about 70% of those are unemployed or underemployed. What an opportunity for employers to bring on someone in a wheelchair to their law firm or an individual with an intellectual disability to their assembly line or child care centre.</ParaText>

When my son was born, I had four months maternity leave, which was the law at the time. When it came time to return to work, the cost of infant care was more than we could afford. I almost did not return, but thanks to an incredible boss who doubled my salary, gave me an extra month at home and promised that I could take whatever time I needed for my son, I did return.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868546">My life would be very different if it were not for Ken Field, and I know my experience was the exception not the rule. Women should never have to decide between having a child and their career. Our plan for $10-a-day child care, which we still need Ontario to sign on to, will not only be good for children and families, but will grow the economy by billions of dollars when women are able to fully participate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868548">I have heard about home ownership for young people repeatedly, and that is why we are going to be putting home ownership within reach for first-time homebuyers with a first-time homebuyer incentive, a new rent-to-own program, and by reducing closing costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868549">Indigenous women are the fastest-growing prison population in Canada, and have been for some time. Most of these women are in prison because of poverty, trauma, mental illness, addiction or gender-based violence. Recently I visited Grand Valley Institution for Women and spoke to some of the women there. Sadly, because so many indigenous women are entering the criminal justice system, we have run out of room for them at institutions near their communities, and they have been transferred out of their home communities. Sixty-five indigenous women are now held at Grand Valley, while a few years ago it was just 13. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868550">We must implement changes to mandatory minimum sentences and other reforms to the criminal justice system, including restorative justice, to stem the tide that is disproportionately sentencing indigenous women to federal prison. It has been said that when they sentence a woman to prison, they also sentence the child. While the mother-child initiative at Grand Valley is outstanding, too many of the children of these moms are in foster care. We must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868551">During the election campaign, I was once again targeted by the gun lobby. I have been a vocal advocate for enhancing public safety through gun control, from extended background checks in Bill <Document DbId="9710291" Type="3">C-71</Document> to banning military-style assault rifles. Over 80% of Canadians support these measures, but the Conservative Party and Canada's gun lobby do not. From depicting me in demeaning and misogynistic cartoons, to distributing flyers door to door in my riding, the gun lobby and the Conservative Party are becoming more and more intertwined and more and more out of touch with the concerns of Canadians. I know my constituents overwhelmingly support our efforts on gun control, and I am looking forward to continuing to work with our government on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868552">I heard repeatedly at the doors that Canadians want us to work together in Parliament. They appreciated the early pandemic response when we all worked together.

It has only helped 9,100 Canadians actually purchase a home because the government has changed the criteria. As of this throne speech, this will be the third set of criteria since September 2019. If we just look at the number of homes sold last year in 2020, which was a pandemic year, over 550,000 homes changed hands, from a willing buyer to a willing purchaser, which is 1.6% of people. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868560">The Liberals have promised to make the buyback mandatory, which is a very good thing. However, the problem with the May 2020 list of banned firearms is that similar firearms or variations on them, like the SKS, are still available on the market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868561">Why not try to include a definition of a military-style assault weapon in the Criminal Code? That way, we would know what type of firearms to ban, instead of making a list of banned firearms and leaving similar firearms on the market.</ParaText>

This is the third time the people of Barrie—Innisfil have sent me here to be their representative. I am very humbled by this. Since 2006, I have served publicly, first as a city councillor for nine years in the city of Barrie, and now for six years as the member of Parliament for Barrie—Innisfil. I am very, very honoured and humbled to be that member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868579">No one can do this without a team, a big team of not just campaign volunteers, but also friends and families. I would like to acknowledge a few of them right now, if I can, such as Rob Decker, who was my campaign manager, who worked with a group of people that really organized terrifically during the campaign. Then there were Robin McClennan and some of my “big sign guys”, as I call them: Al, Richard, John, Kevin, Barry and, of course, my dad, who has been there since the start of my being here politically. There were numerous “little sign people”. There has not been an election that I have been involved with since 2015 where I have had more signs placed.

I really want to acknowledge them: Susan, Sara, Brandon and Jennifer, and former staff Rhea, Andrea and Chelsea, and of course my family. There is no way any of us could have placed ourselves in this symbol of democracy to work on behalf of the people we represent, not just within our ridings but across this country, if not for the strong support of family. I thank my mom Doreen, my dad Jean-Guy, my sister Cathy, my sister Linda and, of course, my family: my wife Leanne and my four kids.

              <ParaText id="6868584">It is not just housing. It is the cost of everything. The cost of the necessities of life is going up as a result of what we are seeing with these inflationary pressures. Gas, food, heat and hydro are all going up, and it is becoming increasingly difficult. The anxiety that exists today among the people I represent, affordability anxiety, is real.

              <ParaText id="6868585">The House of Commons is a place where we come as the people's voices. I have been receiving, and I am sure my colleagues have, numerous emails about the affordability crisis that is happening and how it is directly impacting people.

He said, “People my age are” for lack of a better word, it is unparliamentary, but he said, “screwed when it comes to housing. We are done for. We will be paying rent of $3,000 a month or more forever, unable to save anything for a home and barely making ends meet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868587">“I was distressed when I found out that developers are buying up detached houses with the aim of renting them at inflationary prices,” wrote Sherry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868588">“I see Barrie is now the highest rent in the country. I am a homeowner. I know that rent is tied to the value of the house, but this is getting out of hand. There are many people in my age group, 25-35 and lower, whose dreams of owning a home have been dashed with the current situation,” wrote Sean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868589">Speaking about the first-time homebuyers assistance, Greg wrote, “It is awfully difficult to access and it is time for a little non-partisan politics for the benefit of the country.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868590"> Kim wrote to me, “I have been trying to help two friends look for different places to rent in Simcoe County, and I cannot believe how difficult it has been for both of them. This is a serious issue.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868591">This one is particularly troubling. Steph and Christie wrote, “We are a family of seven. Rent was $800 a month just two months ago, but the landlord sold the house to a new owner and now our rent is over $1,500 a month.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868592">This is the kind of stuff that is happening not just in the riding of Barrie—Innisfil but right across the country. People are anxious. They are worried about affordability and how they are going to pay not just to put a roof over their head, but for the necessities of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868593">In the throne speech, little mention is made of the issue of agriculture. There was nothing of any substance in agriculture. In the large rural area I represent, the producers are concerned about the increasing costs, not just of the products they need to farm but also of heating, dryers, barns, etc., and in particular the impact the carbon tax is having on those.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868594">There is very little mention of guns and gangs. I know we have been talking about that over the course of the last week, the difficulties that are going on and how there is not enough being done to deal with that issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868595">There is nothing about the military. One of the things that concerned me as well is that there is nothing about veterans either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868596">As I said at the outset, it has been a hell of an 18 months. We have really been focusing on the expense side of the ledger through the different supports and programs that have been put in place, but we need to start looking at the revenue side of the ledger and how we are going to pay for this. The only way we are going to pay for this is through the power of the Canadian economy, and it will be led by business: the people they employ, the products they produce and the services they provide in every sector and every region of this country. It does not need big government intervention. We have to be competitive both domestically and internationally, and big government intervention will not allow for that to happen. We need to be focused and tactical in our approach to the way the economic recovery will happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868597">Lastly, as I conclude, this Christmas season businesses need our support more than ever. They have been devastated over the last 20 months, and I encourage everyone, not just in Barrie—Innisfil but right across this country, to make sure they shop local and support local as well.</ParaText>

Let us shop local and encourage our constituents to recognize the difficult times that our businesses have had to endure over the last 18 months. One of the ways we can support them is to shop local.</ParaText>

We understand now that Bill <Document DbId="11473161" Type="3">C-2</Document> will be going to committee, and I am hopeful and optimistic that we will see it come out of committee and ultimately get the support that is necessary to see it pass, because it too would support small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868600">My question is more related to the issue of housing. We have seen over the years the amounts of money being invested in social housing, and they have been historic. There has been a housing strategy too, something that has never happened before in the history of Canada, at least for the last number of generations.</ParaText>

My dad and I share something very unique to Canadian politics. My father is our current MPP for Hastings—Lennox and Addington, while I now hold the federal seat. He is my political mentor, and more importantly he is my dad. May I follow his lead but mark my own path moving forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868626">To the people of Hastings—Lennox and Addington, know that I will remain laser-focused on the task that has been given to me: holding the government accountable. I will be more than just a critic. I will propose solutions while representing my constituents, and I will never stop being an advocate for our riding. There are those who have grown tired of politics, and I hope to inspire them and restore their faith in this great institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868627">Last Tuesday, the Governor General read the Speech from the Throne, the document that sets out the government's agenda and vision for the upcoming session. Unfortunately for the people of Hastings—Lennox and Addington, as well as other rural ridings across this great country, the speech did not appear to include them. Whether it is rural broadband Internet, the agricultural sector or rebuilding main street, the government has signalled that these issues are not areas of concern for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868628">There is no plan to lower inflation, nor to address labour shortages and supply chains. There is no plan to ease the financial burdens of struggling business owners. The current government loves to talk about money. It talks about the amount of money promised, committed or spent, but the results are just not there. We have more consultants, more studies, more bureaucracy, more debt and more disappointment. Accountability and transparency matter. In my opinion, we are experiencing the most corrupt and divisive government in history. This matters and we need to do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868629">Too many Canadians are suffering from depression, anxiety and burnout. Canada's mental health crisis has deepened. Mental health is health, and we should be collectively supporting it in a non-partisan manner. For those personally affected, please reach out. Surely the six people who may be the pallbearers at someone's funeral would rather lift them up now in their time of need. We send our love to Matt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868630">Allow me now to address the outlook for our agricultural sector. It is bleak. The farmers and livestock and dairy producers who are found in every corner of Hastings—Lennox and Addington are once again an afterthought of the government. In a nearly 3,000-word document, our agricultural sector was mentioned one single, solitary time. Let me be clear: Our united Conservative caucus knows it is farmers, like those found in Stirling and Napanee, who feed Canadians from coast to coast to coast. It is high time the members on the other side of the House recognized this fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868631">I was pleased that the throne speech spoke to the issue of reconciliation with Canada's first people. I have the good fortune to count the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte among my communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868632">During my very first week as a member of Parliament, the people of Tyendinaga voted to ratify a partial land claim returning 300 acres to the Mohawk territory. In the spirit of reconciliation, I call on the government to settle the remaining land claims expeditiously, with fairness to all concerned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868633">As shadow minister for seniors, I would like to now focus on an area that is very close to the hearts of many Canadians. With this Speech from the Throne, the Liberal government has sent a chilling message to Canada's most vulnerable. With only a single mention in passing, the government chose to completely ignore some very serious issues. There was no mention of combatting social isolation, no mention of cracking down on elder abuse, no mention of improving access to palliative care and no mention of fixing the rising costs of critical goods such as groceries and medicine. This is a troubling trend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868634">During the previous Parliament, members of this place from every party and every province were receiving frantic phone calls, emails and letters from seniors in their ridings. The complaints were nearly identical: The GIS had been severely reduced or, in many cases, completely eliminated after the July recalculation period. Seniors who depended on the guaranteed income supplement to pay for food to eat, a bed to sleep in and medicine to live had their financial safety net torn out from underneath them overnight. The people who built this country suddenly found themselves abandoned by it as a result of poor communication from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868635">Realizing the very serious consequences of such a sudden and unforeseen reduction in disposable income, my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278203" Type="2">Battlefords—Lloydminster</Affiliation>, quickly took action and sent a letter to the then minister of seniors asking her to address the situation. She never received a response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868636">Not only are seniors' dollars not going as far as before, but they now have fewer to start off with. On top of this, many seniors are embarrassed to come forward. They are embarrassed to go to food banks or to ask for help. Traditionally, seniors and our country have been self-reliant. This is becoming increasingly difficult. On page 14 of the 2021 federal budget are the words, “We owe our elders a great debt. This is a partial repayment.” What the government has done in the intervening months is not only a spectacular failure to partially repay our elders, but rather it has increased the debt we owe to them. I know the government does not have the best track record on balancing budgets, but as a former financial adviser I can assure the government that it is not difficult to figure out that its policies have added to the debt it owes our seniors, not repaid it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868637">Being elected as a member of Parliament to represent the people of Hastings—Lennox and Addington, or anywhere across this great nation, is a privilege. We must never forget the people who sent us here and we must never stop fighting for them. It is my sincere and perhaps naive belief that every person who comes through the doors of this chamber has the intent to make our country a better place to live for ourselves, our children and our seniors. I grew up having so much pride in Canada being a self-reliant, resilient and resourceful nation. I ask members to join me in wanting to earn this back. Let us work together to give our young leaders the tools and resources to continue to make this country strong and free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868638">We all have a different approach as to what progress looks like, but it is that personal drive, that core tenet of public service, that unites all of us. This is what makes this place such a profound and powerful institution. Regardless of people's paths in life, they should do it to the absolute best of their ability. They must never stop learning, improving and making a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868639">In closing, I was fortunate to learn a great deal from an amazing parliamentarian. That knowledge and relationship shaped me into who I am today and is why I am here. The growth I was able to achieve learning from one parliamentarian was profound, and I cannot wait to see what learning from 337 others will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868640">I thank my mom and dad for their kind words of wisdom: we should always believe in ourselves and always keep our doors open. Things do not happen unless we make them happen. We should be kind, love life and seek happiness along the way. God bless.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868658"> First, I want to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your election to the chair. We worked closely in the past on the Standing Committee on Health. I know you will do a good job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868659">I also would like to thank the people of Brampton South for putting their trust in me for the third time. Representing them is the greatest honour of my life. I commit to them to continue to be their strong voice and represent Brampton's best interests in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868660">Behind each 338 members of Parliament is a strong team of volunteers who get us elected. I have an amazing team of volunteers and I could not have done it without their unwavering support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868661">Of course, a big thanks to my family. I know they are already proud of the work we are doing here. They are the real force behind me. I want to thank my son Akash, who is always supporting me, especially on the campaign trail. He is always there by my side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868662">It is an honour to address the House on behalf of residents of Brampton South to speak in support of the throne speech, which introduced our government's vision for the future of our country. I will be speaking about the priorities of the residents in my riding, as these priorities are reflected in this speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868663">I have spoken to hundreds of residents in my community over the last few months and they are optimistic that we are coming through this pandemic. Businesses in Brampton are bouncing back. They know their government is ready to lead us through this recovery, tackle the challenges ahead of us and to build an economy that works for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868664">The vision outlined in the Speech from the Throne delivered last week is the plan to finish the fight against COVID-19, make home ownership achievable, make life more affordable, confront public safety challenges and take strong climate action, while creating jobs and growing the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868665">Vaccination remains the most important tool in fighting COVID-19. This is the only way we can end this pandemic. Almost 90% of those aged 12 and over have received at least one dose, and our government is continuing to encourage uptake. We have mandated vaccines for civil servants and federally regulated workers. As of this Tuesday, all travellers taking planes and trains must be vaccinated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868666"> Many of us see this decision as the right step. I heard international experts saying they wished to have the same system in their country. This will help our economy to reopen, but also protect our health care system and essential workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868667">Peel Region, especially Brampton, was one of the hardest-hit communities in the country at the peak of the pandemic, with over 400 new cases a day at its highest point. We are a community of essential workers. They continued to go to their jobs every day so others could stay home. We are also a very diverse community, with over 100 different languages spoken at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868668">I want to thank Dr. Lawrence Loh and his team at Peel public health, all the frontline health care workers in Brampton, the testing and vaccine clinics as well as all the multicultural community partners, faith leaders and service organizations that helped in the vaccination efforts. Thanks to their outreach efforts, working through language barriers and complicated work schedules, we are now one of the most vaccinated communities in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868669">We are coming through this global health crisis. Our government will be there to work with the provinces to deliver the changes needed to improve health care. This includes mental health and addiction, long-term care and addressing and delivering vaccine boosters, and vaccine doses for children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868670">For most Canadians, housing is the single biggest portion of their monthly budgets. Whether it is through rent or a mortgage payment on a recently purchased home throughout Brampton and the GTA as well as many parts of Canada. It is a cost that is becoming unaffordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868671">It is an issue I regularly hear about from my constituents. This is why our government has a plan to address this rising cost. Our government will do this by working with the municipalities to help them increase supply, with the housing accelerator fund, providing more support to first-time buyers and implementing an innovative rent-to-own program that will help Canadians obtain home ownership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868672">All members of the House agree we need to build more housing and build it faster.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868673">Our government has a clear record on lifting hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. Thousands of families in Brampton South have benefited from the Canada child benefit introduced by our government over the years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868674">In my riding, child care is also one of the most expensive costs for families with young children. In Brampton, it is not uncommon to find costs as high as $1,500 or even $2,000 a month per child in many cases. We are a community of essential workers, many of whom do not have the option of working from home. This high cost is unaffordable for too many people. One parent, usually the mother, will decide to leave the workforce. This is not because she wants to, but because finding child care is impossible. At the status of women committee during the last Parliament, I frequently heard how important this was and how affordable child care options needed to be expanded. Affordable child care is the priority I have heard at the doors often in my riding. Our government's $10-a-day child care plan will save families in Brampton over $9,200 a year in 2022. That is a future year of tuition payment for the child or a year of groceries. By 2026, Brampton families are going to save almost $16,000. This is a big number. The difference that our government's child care program can make in the life of a young family is significant. Our federal plan will allow many women to remain in the workforce and will increase economic output in Brampton and across Ontario once the new deal is signed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868675">I was also reassured to see that our government is taking action on keeping our communities safe. We have taken action to ban and restrict access to firearms and will continue to work with municipalities and law enforcement on fighting gun violence. However, as many residents know, the leading reason for 911 calls in Peel is for domestic and intimate partner violence. Every hour, Peel police receive two calls on average, mostly from women. Sadly, we see many instances of gender-based violence from coast to coast. Many of them are women of colour, those who are racialized or are indigenous. This is unacceptable. It was important for me to see that our government is taking this issue seriously by continuing to provide funding to shelters and women's centres as well. As with the commitment to address gender-based violence with the 10-year national action plan, this plan will account for women of all colours, abilities, ages and backgrounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868676">I had the pleasure to speak with the middle school students earlier this year. The single greatest issue they are talking to me about is climate change. Climate change is real and we see the horrible consequences in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Climate change is not up for debate; it is a reality. Our government has a plan that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050. We will invest in the green technology sector so we can create good, clean jobs for the future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868677">Brampton seniors remember the devastating floods in Brampton in the fifties and sixties. By investing in disaster mitigation projects like the Brampton Riverwalk project in the past, they are committed to working with the municipalities on green and sustainable infrastructure projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868678">Our government is addressing both the infrastructure needs of our communities and fighting climate change. One of the biggest announcements that I participated in last year was when the City of Brampton received $400 million from the Canada Infrastructure Bank to fully transition our transit fleet of 450 buses to electric vehicles by 2027. This is a real example of helping cities across the country to be leaders in the climate fight. I am looking forward to continuing this work over the coming years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868679">We need to build a cleaner, healthier and more prosperous nation for future generations. As a mother, this is what I want to leave for my children and future generations. I am asking all members of Parliament to support the values of this speech so that we can work together to build a better Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868694">Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the member opposite that the previous Liberal government was in the process of implementing a child care program, but we needed the remaining provinces and territories, including Ontario, to sign the agreement. This agreement will help young families in Brampton and all across the country to save money and help women enter the workforce. Our government will continue to pursue this until every Canadian family with young children has access to affordable, quality care. The Province of B.C. signed the agreement, and families in B.C. are already benefiting from it, which is great news. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868696">Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be standing in the House of Commons as the newly elected member of Parliament for Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, located on lands covered by Treaty 13 and the Williams Treaties. Over several centuries, it has been traversed by many first nations and is currently home to indigenous peoples from across Turtle Island.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868697">I am very honoured to be here to work for all residents of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill. I am committed to respectfully listening to all stated viewpoints and concerns from my constituents and my fellow members of Parliament to fully consider them and address them to the best of my abilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868698"> I would not be sitting here today without the support of my family and, of course, the hundreds of community members who spent years with me knocking on doors and making phone calls.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868699"> My husband of 27 years, Peter, has been unwavering in his support of my pursuit to serve, even though it has turned our lives upside down. Our six children, Peter Jr., Chris, Kyle, Tristan, Nadiya and Kristina, have all been supportive of my foray into politics in different ways. However, I want to call out, in particular, our youngest daughter Kristina, who stepped outside of her comfort zone, which is working with horses, to come out and canvass door to door with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868700">My parents Kate and Tom Taylor have inspired and supported me since my birth, but never more than during this past election, when at age 86 they worked tirelessly making phone calls, putting up signs, preparing food and providing me with much-needed emotional support. My sisters Theresa and India have been at my side since I first ran for the nomination in 2019, despite their own personal challenges. My brother John, already stretched as the mayor of Newmarket, came out countless times to canvass door to door with me, and always provided invaluable advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868701"> As everyone can see, I have a large and supportive family of which I am very proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868702">I am also proud of the residents of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill and Canadians across our great country. They have shown how they work together through difficult times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868703">Today, I want to focus my response to the Speech from the Throne on women. Why the focus on women today? Because this year is the 100th anniversary of the election of the first woman to our Parliament, Agnes Campbell MacPhail. Because this week, we are in the midst of 16 days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, as 32 years ago, on December 6, 14 women were killed at the École Polytechnique in Montreal simply because they were women. Because today women are still discriminated against and under-represented in elected office and leadership positions in my community, across Canada and in this great House of the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868704">The issues that our government has focused on in the Speech from the Throne are of immense importance to all Canadians. However, they are of particular importance to women, as women have felt the negative impacts of the challenges we currently face more severely than men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868705">In the Speech from the Throne, our government is rightly focused on ending this fight against COVID-19. This is the most important step we can take to continue rebuilding our economy and in helping women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868706"> Let us not forget that women were 12 times more likely than men to leave the workplace during this pandemic. Women are disproportionately represented in those sectors hardest hit during this pandemic: hospitality, tourism and small retail operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868707">Women, who represent the majority of personal support workers and nurses, have been on the front line during this pandemic. They have been working tirelessly and bearing the brunt of the anger and anxiety that people have felt throughout this stressful time. Likewise, women have experienced domestic violence more often throughout this pandemic, and the people who work to help them, the majority of whom are female, have been overwhelmed by the demands on shelters and services to help victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868708">Women have most acutely experienced mental health challenges during this pandemic as we still carry the greatest responsibility for the care of our children and our elders, both groups that have themselves struggled with mental health throughout this pandemic. The toll the pandemic has taken on our mental health can often be overlooked in light of the terrible economic and other health consequences it has caused, but it is no less significant.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868709">This pandemic has taught us many things. One of the most important is that we need to view every policy through a feminist lens, which is something our government is committed to doing. Our government's actions encouraging all Canadians to get vaccinated and to follow public health recommendations and travel measures will work to contain new variants, such as omicron, and end this pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868710">In addition to this, we must also directly address the economic challenges we face as a result of the pandemic. While Canada's economy is recovering well due to our government's support for workers and small businesses, the global health crisis has led to global pressures on the cost of living. The Speech from the Throne focuses on two areas to address rising costs: child care and housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868711">In my riding, parents are faced with some of the highest child care costs in the province, with average fees coming in at just under $1,600 a month. For a young family with more than one child, it is the equivalent of a second mortgage. Our government's bold, accessible and affordable universal child care and early-learning program will not only reduce costs for young families, but will result in greater workforce participation and productivity, producing significant economic benefits across our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868712">As the women's commissioner at the University of Toronto, I remember working with the National Action Committee on the Status of Women and fighting for a national child care program. This had been recommended in the Royal Commission Report on the status of women in 1971. Yes, we have been advocating for universal child care for 50 years. It is about time. It is an incredible honour to be here in the House and to see this finally come to fruition. It is the fulfilment of countless years of work from men and women, and is a significant accomplishment for this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868713">The Speech from the Throne also outlines the important work our government will continue to do on increasing housing availability and affordability. It is an area of great concern for all Canadians trying to find affordable homes and for everyone who believes that all people should have a place to call home in a country as wealthy as Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868714">Once again, women are more likely to struggle to find an affordable home. Women are more likely to live in poverty, either as seniors living alone or as mothers raising a family. Lone-parent families headed by women are three times more likely to live in poverty than those headed by men. Of course, women living with disabilities, indigenous women and women in racialized communities experience even greater poverty and challenges in finding adequate affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868715">New Canadians and immigrants also have an incredibly hard time finding housing, and I want to recognize the work of two women. Fariha Shabazy and Sajida Habib are working tirelessly in my riding to settle newcomer families, including Afghan families, into affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868716">I am also pleased to see that our government has listened to the voices of Canadians on the need for increased mental health resources and supports. There are so many groups offering support for mental health in my riding, including Home on the Hill in Richmond Hill, CMHA York Region, the women's shelters and shelters such as Yellow Brick House and 360° Kids. I will continue to advocate here in Parliament to ensure they can deliver much-needed supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868717">As I raise the issue of empowering women and protecting community health, I would be remiss if I left out the connection between these aspects of our lives and the very urgent climate crisis we are facing. Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill is fortunate to contain parts of Ontario's greenbelt and the beautiful Oak Ridges Moraine. These contain fragile ecosystems that we must work to protect and preserve for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868718">In the Speech from the Throne, our government laid out how we will be taking bolder climate action and focusing on innovation and green jobs. I have heard from many in my riding who have innovative ideas to help create more resilient infrastructure. In this work, as in every other program our federal government is undertaking, we must work with the indigenous people with whom we share the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868719">The path to reconciliation, truth and justice is ongoing, and there is much more to be done. I was so pleased to see our Governor General, a strong indigenous woman, deliver this throne speech and to hear part of it spoken in an indigenous language, Inuktitut, as well as our two official languages of French and English.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868720">I am grateful to be embarking on the road ahead as a parliamentarian, and I am looking forward to working respectfully and co-operatively with all parliamentarians in the House to deliver on the priorities set forward in this Speech from the Throne and help my constituents and all Canadians.</ParaText>

I know that the money that has been put into these institutions to help these women to meet the challenges during the pandemic is much appreciated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868725">There are different initiatives. I was just talking to staff at Blue Door, an organization that addresses homelessness and helps build homes. They are talking about working with initiatives from the rapid housing initiative with the women's shelters to build townhouses that will provide transitional housing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868728">Her government is ambitious about fighting climate change, but in reality, Canada has the worst track record in the G7. We believe we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and to do that, we need to cap oil and gas production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868729">However, her government talks about capping greenhouse gas emissions. I am not sure how we can do that without capping production. I would like to know what she thinks about that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868731">I think we can cap emissions on the oil and gas industry without capping production because we are moving toward means of production that are cleaner.

I really appreciated the emphasis on lifting up women and much of what she said resonated with me. However, as I was listening, I was really asking myself when many of these words that are being spoken today were going to be shifted into solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868734"> I think about affordable housing that is needed for so many women, not just home ownership, but rent. I think about pharmacare and having access to the medications that we need. I spoke to a single mother who could not afford her daughter's diabetes medication, just as one example.</ParaText>

I believe the very ambitious child care program will help address overall affordability. When we free up $1,500 to $2,000 for a household, it provides more money for other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868737">The Canada child benefit that this government has put in place and increased has lifted 900,000 children out of poverty, many of those living in single-parent families and with women who are struggling. We will continue to work on these issues and continue to address the demands and needs that women are facing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868762">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand here today, an Inuk from Nunavut. Like my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation>, said, I am here following extraordinary circumstances. I first thank my family, volunteers, Nunavummiut and the NDP for supporting me to be here. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to respond to the throne speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868763">Nunavut is a beautiful territory that spans millions of kilometres. I know the challenge of being here and of being heard. I am committed to ensuring that, with my seat in this 44th Parliament, Nunavummiut, first nations, Métis and Inuit are heard and are touted for the strength that exists in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868764">All indigenous people, Inuit, first nations and Métis have been here on these lands since time immemorial. The knowledge passed from generation to generation still exists in the first peoples. I remember and am reminded of John Amagoalik when he spoke to the Inuit Circumpolar Council in 1986. He said, “I was born in 1947, but I have lived a thousand years.” At that time, he was only 39 years old. In that statement, he showed the burden of holding knowledge and the need to pass it on for the future generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868765"> Within that same speech, John Amagoalik named a few people who were known to have died by suicide, including my father. My life, unfortunately, is not a unique story. There are too many Inuit, first nations and Métis who share my story. Our stories of tragedy, of injustice, are not just history; we are still facing colonial acts of violence to this day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868766">Imagine, sitting here every day, being forced to listen to me speak and me teaching those people here only in Inuktitut with no interpreter services, no devices, only a yardstick. Imagine me hitting members' hands with that yardstick each time I heard them speak English or French. This was the reality of first nations, Métis and Inuit in residential schools. It hurts us. We suffered a lot, going through the residential school system. The last residential school closed in 1996. That history is not long gone. It is still present today. Many first nations, Métis and Inuit still suffer from the intergenerational trauma imposed upon us by governments.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="6868767"> Those governments are not long gone either, but now we have an opportunity as parliamentarians to instruct the federal government to do better, to ensure justice, to uphold indigenous rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868768">The attempt to hide this colonial history has driven far too many first nations, Métis and Inuit to addictions and too many, ultimately, to suicide. It is all of those too frequent stories of colonial violence that drive me to respond to the Speech from the Throne very critically. I wish to address it that way as an indigenous person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868769">Canada's relationship with Inuit and indigenous peoples has been very fractured right from the beginning. We are still living through the realities of systematic government action that sought to destroy Inuit identity and our way of life and those of other indigenous peoples in Canada. The Inuit were forced into permanent settlements with the promise of jobs, housing, safety and education for children. Some were threatened with violence to move. Families were separated, sled dogs were killed and a way of life was irreversibly altered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868770"> Many elders are still alive today to recount those horrific events and, shamefully, many of those decisions that led to the violence and colonization of Inuit during that time are still being perpetuated to this very day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868771">I often hear countless stories of heartbreak and hope. All too often, being in poverty prevents many from hopes of achieving a socio-economic status equal to that of Canadians across this country. Nunavummiut understand that there are incredible opportunities to make our communities stronger and a better place for the next generation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868772">Overcrowded and mouldy homes are at the heart of too many of the challenges we face. Families are forced to live in unsuitable conditions, communicable diseases spread, elders are put into humiliating positions and gender-diverse individuals are forced to stay in dangerous positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868773">In a country as rich as Canada, we have traditional knowledge and custom knowledge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868774">I would like to take the opportunity to work with members to look at our traditional, legal knowledge and philosophy of life, so that we can work together to solve our problems. If we are going to work together, then we need to approve the declaration of the indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868775">I will shorten my speech as per your request.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868792">Every riding in Canada has something unique about it, and among the many unique features of Skeena—Bulkley Valley that stand out, one of them that is remarked on the most, especially by folks from more urban parts of Canada, is its sheer size. Visiting the many communities across such a vast rural region is both the most rewarding and important part of this role, and often the most challenging. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868793">The last community I had a chance to visit before I headed east to Ottawa for the start of this sitting was the very special community of Takla Landing on the territory of the Takla Nation. To get to Takla from my home in Smithers, we drove three hours eastward on Highway 16, turned left on Highway 27, drove on to Fort St. James then drove and stopped in the communities of Binche and Tachie on the shore of Stuart Lake, and then continued on another three hours on a radio-controlled, forest service road to a part of remote northwest B.C. where few people live and very few people visit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868794">The community of Takla is a special one. It is hard to convey the setting in words in this place, but the village is perched on the shore Takla Lake. When I got there, the first snow of late fall was sitting on the mountains. When the clouds lifted and the sun was shining for a brief moment, it was such a spectacular setting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868795">The territory of the Takla Nation includes three great watersheds, three great river systems. The water from its lands flows into the Skeena and into the Fraser system, both of which flow into the Pacific, and also into the Finlay, which flows to the Arctic Ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868796">We were welcomed in this community by a number of local leaders, including Elder Janet West and Councillor Wilma Abraham. The staff toured us around the community and showed us, with pride, their school, water plant, potlatch building and their new transfer station. They showed me the land that they had cleared adjacent to the community to protect it from wildfire, like the big wildfires that we saw in my region back in 2018. They plan to build housing on that land now and have a vision to build 100 houses in 10 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868797">It was a memorable visit, and one of the things that I will remember most about that visit is something that Dave Thompson told me. Just as we were leaving, we were gathered in their boardroom at their band office and he said, “Takla is a proud community. We are proud of what we showed you today, and we wanted to focus on the community's strengths, but I hope that does not give you the impression that this is a community that does not need help.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868798">His words made me think about northwest B.C., this place I am so humbled and honoured to represent here in the House of Commons and the people who call it home. The people of the northwest are resilient, resourceful, proud of where they live and proud of how they live. If I were to simply rattle through the list of the myriad challenges that people in northwest B.C. face, I would be worried that this fact would not come through first. So, instead I thought it was right to start by honouring the innate strength of my neighbours, their resilience and their love for the place that we call home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868799">As we face the most serious public health crisis in a century, a growing climate crisis that has been felt so acutely in British Columbia right now and a housing crisis that is denying such a basic human right to so many families, it is all too clear that the need for federal leadership has never been greater. Yet, reading through the Speech from the Throne, I think that many Canadians would be struck by its lack of depth and its lack of addressing the many issues that we face. At a time of so many pressing challenges, this speech failed to reflect the kind of bold vision and leadership I think Canadians and certainly the people in northwest B.C. feel that we need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868800">Across the northwest, the collapse of wild salmon stocks is causing real alarm. It is hard to describe how integral these fish are to people's way of life in Skeena for food, culture and livelihood, yet in a single generation this resource that people have depended on for generations, over thousands of years, is disappearing right before their eyes. The salmon that arrive at Takla Lake are not Skeena River salmon: they are Stuart River sockeye. They are from the Fraser River system. They swim over 1,000 kilometres from the ocean to spawn there. It is truly a miracle of nature. Sadly, the Stuart River sockeye have been decimated by the Big Bar landslide, mismanagement of fisheries, industrialization, habitat impacts and all of the other things that are impacting wild salmon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868801">When I was in Takla, Keith West gave us a tour of the new salmon hatchery. Earlier in the year, the residents travelled down to Lillooet on the lower Fraser and intercepted the early Stuart River run of those few fish that make it back up the river. They took the eggs from those fish and are now incubating them in a tiny shipping container hatchery in the community of Takla. They hope that the few that survive will make it back down the river, out to the ocean and then all the way back home to replenish the stock that community has existed on for millennia. In communities up and down the B.C. north coast, people are looking to the current government to finally come to the aid of wild salmon. There is hope in recent funding announcements, but people are waiting to see results on the ground and in the water. There was nothing in the Speech from the Throne about wild salmon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868802">Similarly, forestry has long been at the centre of many communities in the region, such as Burns Lake, Houston, Fraser Lake, Fort St. James and my home community of Smithers. Getting a softwood lumber agreement would make a real difference for the viability and long-term success of the processing facilities in those communities. However, after years of uncertainty, instead of an agreement what we see is the Americans doubling softwood lumber duties. There was nothing in the throne speech on softwood lumber and a softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868803">In a huge rural riding, transportation is a constant feature of the daily lives of people and often a challenging one. A few weeks back, as part of my commute east, I had a chance to ride on BC Bus North. This is the new regional bus system the B.C. government put in place in the wake of Greyhound pulling out of our region. In a region that includes the Highway of Tears, which tragically so many people have heard about, the trip on the bus was convenient and it was safe. At $25 for a two-hour trip, it was also affordable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868804">A lot of regions across Canada are not as fortunate as northern B.C. I do not think any member in this place who is from a rural riding would disagree that having safe, affordable, consistent passenger transport is vital for their constituents. Today rural, low-income Canadians who do not drive have fewer transportation options than they have had in 100 years, yet there was nothing in the throne speech on connecting rural Canada. Sadly, the current government gave up long ago on passenger rail as a way to connect rural residents across our country. We cannot let it give up on bus transportation in the same way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868805">Housing affordability is a challenge in every single community across Canada, but in addition to affordability, there is another aspect that is being neglected, which is housing in indigenous communities. In the riding that I represent of Skeena—Bulkley Valley, the community of Klemtu is struggling with housing issues. It has a vision for building new houses and repairing the ones that are in the community. I heard recently from Chief Councillor Doug Neasloss about a storm that damaged 16 houses. These are now leaking and have mould issues. These homes house elders and children. That has to be improved upon, yet there was nothing in the throne speech on indigenous housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868806">To finish, I will end where I began: with the strength and resilience of the people of the northwest. It has been a hard year and a half with this health crisis. People have lost loved ones. People have lost livelihoods. We have been called upon to look out for our neighbours and each other in ways that we have not for a long time. I know we are going to make it. In the meantime, there are many other pressing issues that deserve our attention, and I am thankful to the Speaker for giving me the time this evening to highlight a few of them.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6868809">Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, I went to the Joel Steele arena in my hometown of Winchester, excited to donate blood for the first time. Little did I know, until I got to the questionnaire and it asked if I was a man who had sex with a man, that I would be disqualified from doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868810">I told Canadians, through a video earlier this year in some advocacy I have been trying to do to end the discriminatory blood ban, that this was one of the very few times in my life that I felt there was something wrong by being gay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868811">Here we are at the end of 2021, 17 years later, and that discrimination still exists in our country today. There is an experience and that experience is replicated by thousands of MSM men across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868812">The frustrating part is that there is a clear, scientific solution to end this discrimination and end this stigma that has lasted for far too long. The Canadian Medical Association, the All Blood is Equal campaign and numerous countries around the world have changed their questionnaire to be based on sexual behaviour as opposed to sexual orientation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868813">Six years ago, three elections ago now, the government promised to end it. It did not promise to study it or say it was pending review. It did not claim it was independent and could not do anything about it or that it could only study it and see what was recommended. It promised to end it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868814">Nevertheless, here we are the end of 2021 and Canadian Blood Services finally, back in June during pride month, said that it was going to recommend an end to the ban on donations for men who have sex with men. It is good news and a step in the right direction; I acknowledge that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868815">The government has now known for six months that this recommendation would be coming from Canadian Blood Services. It had the option, through the Food and Drug Acts, to act earlier to eliminate a provision no longer deemed necessary.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868822">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for giving me my first opportunity in this Parliament to address the House and thank all those who put their faith in me for the third time just a few short weeks ago in the great riding of Québec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868823">Of course I want to thank my family, my partner Marie-Chantal, our children, Étienne, Clémence and Antoine, my parents, who guided me toward everything I have ever done, as well as my volunteers and my amazing constituency team members, who work for the people of Quebec City every day.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868825">Protecting the safety and security of the blood supply across the country is a top priority for Health Canada. Canada has one of the safest blood supply systems in the world thanks to complete regulatory oversight of blood collection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868826">Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec supervise and administer Canada's and Quebec's blood supply systems. These organizations operate independently of governments and politicians and cannot be forced to change their blood donor exclusion policy unless safety issues arise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868827">The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the safety and security of the country's blood supply, and we are also committed to supporting blood donation policies in Canada that are not discriminatory and that are based on science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868828">In 2016, Health Canada approved a change in the waiting period for men who have sex with men and reduced it from five years to 12 months. In 2019, this waiting period was reduced again, this time to three months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868829">These changes were made following the detailed review of scientific data provided in the regulatory submissions of the Canadian Blood Services and Héma‑Québec, and are gradual steps. In the meantime, the research is tending toward the ultimate objective of the pre-selection of donors based on behavioural criteria rather than gender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868830">To date, Health Canada has not yet received a request from the Canadian Blood Services or Héma‑Québec to totally eliminate the waiting period in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868831">Canada is a leader in this area. The United States, Australia and New Zealand all established a three-month waiting period after Canada made this change. Furthermore, in September 2021, Health Canada authorized a submission from the Canadian Blood Services seeking to implement other pre-selection and collection processes that would let men who have sex with other men donate plasma for fractionation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868832">The Government of Canada has also given $3 million to the Canadian Blood Services to work with Héma‑Québec on creating research projects that would help inform changes in this area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868833">Finally, as time always passes too quickly, I will add that the 2019 budget contained an additional $2.4 million over three years for plasma donation research.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868841">Mr. Speaker, this is really happening in Canada. The poorest seniors in our entire country are losing their ability to support themselves. Just to be clear, and so that all Canadians understand, single seniors who are receiving the guaranteed income supplement make an income of just over $19,000 a year. Couples make just over $25,000. Regardless of what part of Canada they live in, they are below the poverty line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868842">My office is hearing from seniors across Canada. They are scared, desperate and afraid. A few have come forward to share very personal stories and to express their concern about the realities they are facing. I want to point out their tremendous bravery. They are terrified that by speaking out, their voices will mean that they are punished further. I certainly hope that the <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868843">I received an email yesterday from a 71-year-old senior who had been working. He applied for pandemic relief because he was no longer working due to the pandemic. Now his GIS has been cut off, and recently he was diagnosed with cancer. The reality is he cannot afford the medication he needs for his treatment. He is also facing eviction on December 23. I hope the <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> puts that in her calendar. A 71-year-old senior in this country, sick with cancer, will be homeless on December 23, this month. This is what is happening to an estimated 88,000 seniors across the country, according to the PBO's report. It is one story of far too many.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868844">I have heard the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> say in the House that they are working on it, but I am here to say that is not good enough. This is a crisis. The most vulnerable are seeing their lives go up in smoke. When they do not know where they are going to live, and they do not know what is going to happen to their health and well-being, how can we ask them to wait? For me, this is about a bar of dignity. All of us as Canadians should collectively decide the bar, and if we see anyone fall below it, we are going to stand up and say that is too far and we must do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868845">Imagine my shock when I heard the <Affiliation DbId="278928" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation>, in response to a media question on this issue, say, “It's a more complicated issue than one would think because there's serious kind of fairness and equity issue for people who may have earned similar amounts in employment income. If a senior worked last year and made an equivalent amount, they too would have lost their GIS or had their GIS potentially reduced, and so we're working on a path forward that recognizes this.” It appears that for the government, the bar of dignity needs to be lowered more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868846">May I remind the House again that single seniors receive just over $19,000 a year and couples just over $25,000. May I also remind the House that these seniors were working, and when the pandemic happened, this was the only source of help they could receive. Is it the plan of the government to punish the poorest? It certainly appears to be a plan to punish the poorest and protect the rich, such as the big corporations that received tremendous amounts of taxpayer dollars and wage subsidies and then gave their shareholders significant payouts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868847">Here is a quote from The Globe and Mail. Perhaps it will help the <Affiliation DbId="278919" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> understand. The article states, “Beyond a handful of hedge funds, some of the largest wealth managers in the country - household names such as Franklin Templeton, CI Financial, Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates - collected CEWS. Collectively, these three companies manage close to $110 billion of assets in Canada.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868848">The Scotiabank Canadian Hedge Fund Index, which measures the monthly performance of Canadian-domiciled hedge funds with assets under management of at least $15 million, shows an average return of 11% in 2020, the best year for the industry in the decade. The government owes seniors some respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868849">Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member on her re-election and on her role as shadow minister for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868850">Before I respond to my hon. colleague's question, allow me to briefly take a moment to thank the constituents of Brampton West, who have elected me to the House for the third time as their voice. I will continue to fight for the priorities that matter to them. Allow me to also briefly thank my volunteers and supporters, who made this possible, and of course my family and friends, who have always had my back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868851">Being my community's voice in Parliament is truly the greatest privilege of my life, and as the new Minister of Seniors, I look forward to working with the hon. member and indeed all members of the House to find the best ways to serve Canada's seniors and ensure that the most vulnerable get the support they need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868852">My connection to seniors is a very personal one. During the pandemic, I volunteered to go back to my roots as a registered nurse. I spent my time on the front lines vaccinating health care workers and members of my community, and standing alongside the Canadian Armed Forces, who came to a long-term care home in my city of Brampton. It was one of the hardest hit long-terms care homes in my province. The experiences I had remind me every day to continue to fight for the most vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868853">The health and social well-being of seniors across Canada has been top of mind for many, and the financial situation for seniors has been a challenge. However, when it comes to supporting seniors, I am proud of our record to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868854">One of the first things we did as a government when we were elected in 2015 was to reduce the eligibility of OAS to age 65 from 67. The Conservatives had attempted to raise the age of retirement and take money out of the pockets of Canadians who need retirement benefits to make ends meet. We enhanced the CPP in a historic way that was mirrored by QPP. We also strengthened the OAS and raised the GIS for single seniors, which made a real difference in the lives of many seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868855">For immediate support during the pandemic, we provided a one-time $500 payment for older seniors this year and will be increasing OAS by 10% for those age 75 and older next year. This historic increase will be their first real increase in decades, beyond inflation increases. This will make a difference for older seniors as they live longer and as their needs increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868856">Canadians re-elected a government on a bold, ambitious plan that will help seniors who need it the most. I look forward to working with all members of the House on delivering this ambitious agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868857">We can all agree that the pandemic has been challenging for many seniors, but every step of the way, our government has been there to support seniors, especially the most vulnerable. We moved very quickly to provide immediate and direct financial support to seniors. Every year seniors across Canada benefit from programs and funding that our government provides through the New Horizons for Seniors program. I am extremely excited to announce that this year's call for proposals for NHSP is now open, and I encourage all members to apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868858">When it comes to the CERB and GIS issue, to remind the hon. member once again, we are aware of it, as I mentioned earlier. We know it has been hard on some seniors this year, and I can assure the hon. member that we are working on this issue to find the right solution to support those who are affected.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868860">I know that less than 8% of those living in the member's riding are seniors, but there are many seniors across the country who are at a point of total crisis. They are going to lose their homes. They are being evicted right now. They cannot afford their medications, which means they are in and out of the hospital because they are getting sicker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868861">Seniors used their pandemic funds to fix their cars, fix their teeth and pay off a bit of debt. It is so wrong that we are punishing the poorest while rewarding the wealthiest. This should not be a debate in the House and I am totally embarrassed that it is. The government needs to do better by the seniors who built this country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6868864">Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk in the House about housing supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868865">Across the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, up to 25% of newly built luxury condos are sitting vacant and homes, including older housing co-ops and purpose-built rental apartments that have served our communities for decades are being bought up by developers at a rapid speed. Developers are buying them up, because government policies have turned the housing market into a stock market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868866">Governments at every level have overseen the financialization of housing. Instead of protecting our social housing stock they encouraged upzoning and gentrification in the name of density. Density dreams belong to developers. The financialization of housing is only working for the wealthy and leaving people behind. Truly affordable social housing has been sacrificed to create an asset class for pension funds and the wealthiest people and companies across the globe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868867">Right now in my riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam, hundreds of older townhomes and apartments are sitting empty. There are entire blocks of single-family homes boarded up ready for redevelopment, and these homes have been empty for years. Developers choose not to fill them, so they do not have spend one cent on maintenance or pay tenants out when the time comes to begin redevelopment. This is wrong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868868">During this housing crisis, governments have allowed wealthy developers to hoard housing, allowing perfectly good homes to sit empty to protect the profits of corporations over the well-being of my residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868869">There is also a problem with the marketing of housing. High-end sales centres for luxury condos exist overseas. Actually, when a traveller arrives through the international terminal at YVR, there are enticing posters of luxury housing to attract international investment. Even on the local front, developers begin marketing projects even before the municipalities rezone the land. It is disrespectful and it disregards communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868870">The current housing crisis appears to be a crisis of negligence in protecting precious housing supply that people call home. I hear the calls for “supply, supply, supply”, and I need to clarify that call. What is needed is affordable supply. The federal government must put a laser focus on maintaining what is left of housing co-ops, purpose-built rentals, not-for-profit-run housing, in the country before it is all gone, and the federal government needs to immediately reinvest in social housing, not in capital loans, but ongoing, stable operating funds to get people housed now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868871">I want to share just a few of the things I have heard from social housing partners on the ground that are competing with corporate interests to keep the most vulnerable housed. For every new purpose-built rental unit that is being built, we are losing three. The federal government needs a moratorium on REITs. The rate they are buying up co-ops and purpose-built rental housing is alarming and is contributing to disappearing rental stock. We need a social development acquisition fund in addition to the urban housing accelerator fund, so not-for-profits can buy housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868872">What I hear from the not-for-profits is that right now they need to put up their own capital to secure funding for the rental housing incentives, and that does not work for them. CMHC is not nimble enough. The limitations at CMHC need to be fixed. It has not been able to deliver housing at the pace of the need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868873">I ask the minister again to get much-needed affordable homes to people now.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278914" Type="4">Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="6868874">Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278718" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation> for her question and for her advocacy, and I want to congratulate her on her recent election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868875"> I welcome the member's focus on affordable housing, and our government agrees with that side of the House that every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. This is an issue that should unite all of us. The need for more affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges our country is facing. It is not just a question of housing; it is also a question of making sure our economic recovery after COVID is an inclusive economic recovery. Housing will be key to making sure no one is left behind. This is not a new problem. It requires a long-term plan and consistent action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868876">Housing, therefore, is a key priority for our government. That is why we developed Canada's first-ever national housing strategy, followed closely by the National Housing Act and a commitment to take a human rights approach to housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868877">In 2017, the national housing strategy was projected to spend $40 billion over the next 10 years, and that program has now grown to $72.5 billion. In the past year alone, we have made hundreds of announcements and held countless opening celebrations to welcome people into their new homes, in British Columbia, for example. All of them were possible through the national housing strategy. It required, and was the result of, strong partnerships from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868878">Take, for example, the bilateral housing agreements that we negotiated with every province and territory. Through those agreements, we are able to not only build new housing but also maintain the federal community housing stock that is there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868879">As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278718" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation> may recall, just last March we announced significant support for individuals and families in British Columbia. Our 10-year, $517-million Canada-British Columbia benefit will go directly into the pockets of British Columbians, helping 25,000 households across the province of British Columbia to pay their rent. That is the national housing strategy in action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868880">As we continue to make progress on that strong foundation, we recognize that more work needs to be done, so that is why we introduced the rapid housing initiative in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a response to the housing challenges made worse by the pandemic. Through the first round, we were targeting building 3,000 new permanent affordable housing units, and we blew past that target to build 4,700 housing units: 100% federally funded, permanent, affordable housing units. In the second round, collectively with the first round, we seek to build 9,200 permanent affordable housing units for Canadians experiencing homelessness or those who are at risk of experiencing homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868881">As I said, there is more work to be done, and I agree with my hon. colleague. That is why, in the throne speech, members heard that we are planning to launch a housing accelerator fund that will help cities expedite housing. It will bring on more planners. It will offset the cost of land purchases. It will help build the infrastructure needed for housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868882">Home ownership is also important. We need to make sure more and more Canadians can access the dream of home ownership, so I look forward to the hon. member's supporting these initiatives. We are making deep, sustained and long-term investments in housing, but we share the member's commitment to making sure all Canadians have a safe and affordable place to call home.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868883">Mr. Speaker, I remember the minister coming to my community for an opening, for a photo opportunity, and the government came in at the very last minute, at the 11th hour of that project, with a loan. After almost five years of negotiation with local partners, with non-profits, with our city and with the taxpayers of the city of Coquitlam, who came forward with their own money, the government showed up at the 11th hour with a small loan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868884">This is not working for housing providers. The housing is just not getting on the ground at the speed that it needs to come. In relation to the rapid housing initiatives, that information did not come down to municipalities fast enough. There were so many problems and gaps with it. There were many, many projects denied, which did not get built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868885">We need solutions now. I understand there are plans. What can we be doing now?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="6868886">Mr. Speaker, for every challenge the hon. member mentioned, we actually have a different program in the national housing strategy to address it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868887">On the issue of loans, that is for rental construction. We have another program called the co-investment fund that builds deeply affordable housing. On the rapid housing initiative, I am surprised the hon. member is saying the money did not get there quickly enough. We had a separate stream for cities, and we gave the money directly to them. The only condition we put on them was that the housing had to be built in 12 months or less and had to target vulnerable populations. Whether they built new housing or acquired existing properties was totally up to them; we trusted them to make the right decisions because they know best what they need to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="6868888">In terms of the project stream, those projects are landing in British Columbia and they are creating deeply affordable housing. Does that mean that the job is done? Absolutely not. We need to do more. In terms of the solutions that are necessary, we are always open to partnering with municipalities, provinces and territories, and indigenous governments to make sure that more and more affordable housing is being built for Canadians.</ParaText>
