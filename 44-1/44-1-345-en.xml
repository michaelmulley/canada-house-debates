            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8568632">Mr. Speaker, there are critical moments in the life of a democracy, and today is one of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568633">The government has once again demonstrated how inconsistent it is through its blatant incompetence in managing public programs and its inability to ensure transparent and effective accountability. It is not complicated. The total lack of robust oversight and accountability mechanisms within the current government make the problems that the government gets itself into even worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568634">I want to tell the government representatives that they are political officials. They need to show that they are capable of clear and consistent accountability, whether in terms of public spending, tangible results or the assessment of objectives achieved. Government accountability is not limited to vague, incomplete reports, which, as we know, are often filled with technical jargon to cover up failures. What is worse, the lack of transparency makes it difficult to have confidence in democracy. Democracy around the world is struggling right now. We do not need to make things worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568635">Ineffective accountability allows secrecy to flourish. It opens the door to abuse of power, corruption and the gradual erosion of democratic institutions. Instead of promoting efficiency and equity, poor program management leads to chaotic management of public resources, which plunges essential services into paralysis and prevents citizens, the taxpayers, from having their needs met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568636">Instead of talking about housing, inflation, lack of cell phone coverage—a major problem in Laurentides—Labelle, the industrial transition, the energy shift, increased benefits for seniors aged 65 to 74, we have been talking about the government's failings and secrets since yesterday. We are staring down the barrel of another scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568637">After the Liberals came to power, we saw the WE scandal. I have been here since 2019, and I have spent hours at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. It ended with prorogation. There was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> vacation at the Aga Khan's island; the Trans Mountain pipeline purchase; the COVID-19 conflicts of interest; and the latest, ArriveCAN, which cost millions of dollars in public money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568638">While all that is going on, we are neglecting our people. That is unacceptable to the public. Because it holds executive power, the government needs to be accountable to the legislative branch. Of course, preserving, protecting and treasuring the separation of powers is important. These days, the line between these three branches is becoming increasingly blurred. We have to protect the separation of these powers. This must not be used as an excuse. The government is accountable to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568639">Parliament's authority to demand government documents is clearly established. The only limitation on the House's ability to demand information from the government as it deems necessary is the good judgment of the House, not the goodwill of the government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8568640">We must avoid setting a bad precedent. The government does have the right to disagree. However, it must respect an order of this House. The government must respect Parliament and its members. It cannot simply carry on as usual. Can we set aside partisanship? That is what we are dealing with here. If there is one party that can speak out against partisanship, it is the Bloc Québécois. I urge my colleagues to show respect for our democratic institutions. In closing, I call on the government to get its act together.</ParaText>

She talked about preserving, protecting and valuing the separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. She touched upon the lack of democracy across the world and the degradation of public institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568642">My question is on what we are trying to do here. With Parliament using the supreme power it has, are we not trying to interfere in the workings of public institutions like the RCMP? What is her position? It was not very clear. If she could elaborate on it, I would be happy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568643">Mr. Speaker, I think we need to go back to the beginning. When there is an order of the House indicating that the documents requested have not been produced and the House refers that obligation to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to shed some light on it, that does not mean recommending that the RCMP investigate. We said so yesterday. It is about respect for the institution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568644">The question of privilege was brought forward yesterday and was upheld. The government may not agree, but that is the privilege of the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568645">Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with the Bloc Québécois member's comments. According to the Auditor General of Canada, at least $300 million was paid out in more than 180 instances where there was a conflict of interest. She said the Liberals were entirely responsible. On top of that, $58 million was allocated to projects for which no environmental benefits were demonstrated.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568649">Mr. Speaker, the member started off with the litany of moral failings we have seen from the Liberal government. However, I cannot help but reflect on the fact that Canadians and Quebeckers would be correct in assuming that they get a bit of the same thing regardless of whether they vote for Conservatives or Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568650">We have seen a litany of problem with the Liberals. Yesterday in the House, I brought up challenges with the moral bankruptcy of the Conservatives. I think about Harper's Senate scandal, the Afghan detainees and the misappropriation of funds for the G8 when Harper was in power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568651">How does the member think we should propose to Canadians that there is a better path when, regardless of whether they vote Conservative or Liberal, they end up getting the same thing: corruption and moral failings?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568652">Mr. Speaker, I am so discouraged. When we go out into the communities, people stop and talk to us and ask us what is going on, what is happening to our democracy. Our party has to shed light on this affair, denounce the secrets and ensure that the institutions are respected. Partisanship has no place in any of this. There is so much talk about elections these days. Today, we are talking about an important topic and some people are trying to distract us.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8568654">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>. I appreciate the opportunity to share my time with him and to talk about this important issue. We agreed with and supported not only the original motion but also the ruling by the Speaker.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568655">It is important because this gets to some of the essence of the principles of democracy and information related to SDTC, which is Sustainable Development Technology Canada, and the misappropriation of funds and information that took place there. In particular, it also brandished some very good companies that are being lumped in with this. I am disappointed in the Conservatives' not focusing any attention on protecting those organizations and companies that did nothing wrong and were sucked into what is basically a patronage system that was set up by the Liberals, along with Annette Verschuren and others on the board of directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568656">The focus for the New Democrats has always been on the whistle-blowers; they have taken a hit with regard to loss of employment and loss of pensionable years. We had asked for them to be transferred to any federal public service agency they chose. They are going to an agency, NRC, which has an association and not a union, but at least it is a step forward. However, at the same time, many people have left, and they had to sign waivers and confidentiality agreements. We are now asking the government to rip those up, to make sure that those individuals no longer have that hanging over their employment record in the federal public service. It is unfortunate that this has not happened, and we will continue to request that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568657">We also want a third party to investigate and review the new model of SDTC, in terms of a working environment, because there has been some good work done there. Quite frankly, what the Conservatives also do not mention in this is that they actually have been the custodians of SDTC in the past, in large part. I would certainly like to see more light shed on what went wrong. Their simple analysis of it is that, basically, the Liberals picked their own people, who did not live up to their expectations. However, I can tell members that I have a long list of Conservative appointments that have never done the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568658">What we would rather see is a better process that would actually be more robust and protect against this patronage system that continually rewards Ottawa insiders who have been close to those political parties in particular. It has been a carousel, at times, of appointments that are based upon not the merits of one's contributions to the general public and to an issue but the merits of one's contributions to a political party, in my opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568659">SDTC has fallen into that issue, in the sense that it sucked in a number of different employees and companies that actually do good environmental work. I think there is an edge on this too. However, the Conservatives do have a point, in the sense that there was a motion moved to get the documents. On that, I also want to highlight the difference between the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP in all of this. We believe in more open, accessible, transparent government, which is actually coming up across the planet, especially with the other G7 nations that we are part of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568660">I am talking about Crown copyright, where information, studies and other types of documents are more readily accessible to the public. Our original law was crafted in the early 1900s, and it has not been substantially overhauled since then. Can members imagine if we still drove around in vehicles that were originally crafted in the 1900s and never substantially overhauled to this day? At the same time, the United States and other nations have opened up their information-sharing systems quite significantly differently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568661">This has allowed us to protect these so-called independent associations, but for the taxpayers, as well as in terms of the Conservative and Liberal strategies on how to deal with these issues, it is important to note how they create these agencies. This one was created to be independent from Parliament and the minister, but the government stocks it full of appointments when they choose. Later, when there is a problem, those in government claim they had nothing to do with it, because it was an independent process. They say this even though the association reports wholly to the federal government and the employees are actually 100% federally funded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568662">As such, the employees do not get the whistle-blower protection they should. They do not get the union representation they should.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8568663">At the same time, when their friends either get sloppy or enter into practices that allow this type of malfeasance to take place, then they can claim that they are at arm's length, which gives them the ability to basically try to punt on this. I will talk a little about a particular number of things that took place at the boardroom of SDCT. There is no reason whatsoever that the Conservatives could not have changed this situation in the past. They had such industry ministers as Maxime Bernier, Tony Clement and others who behaved scandalously as well and who were perhaps not interested in addressing the fact that SDTC had an opening to allow this to take place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568664">People are wondering what took place at these corporate boardrooms. We can imagine that, if we were in a boardroom of a not-for-profit charity or a municipality, we would have to declare a conflict of interest on things that are financial or personnel matters. There is a very prescribed system. However, what happened is that, a number of times, this was not followed. The Auditor General even points this out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568665">I asked this of the witnesses who came forward, such as board members, chairpeople and so forth: Were the rules provided? They said that, yes, they were, but at the same time, they were not followed. Nobody could really explain the next part. They do not know why they did not follow the rules; they just did not. Therefore, there was a lazy corporate boardroom culture there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568666">I asked the following questions of a couple of witnesses but never had a straight answer: Were they socializing together? Were they doing things outside the workplace? I suspect they were. In this country, we saw in the past how many deals were cut on a golf course somewhere at the expense of consumers, the rights of people, and insider business and other businesses that were competing legitimately because they had the inner edge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568667">In this case, at SDTC, this was very much the case, which is why we are doing this investigation. Therefore, in the motion that was put forth, we requested procurement of more of those documents. We gave a time plan and, in fact, studied and talked about this at committee. I would point out that Conservatives also did so. However, it is hard to understand some of their strategy on this because they have smatterings of it across several committees. It is almost as though they are not even interested at getting at the final, real, good result, because it is being put in three different places. One would suffice to get to the bottom line of all of this at the end of the day, instead of shopping around and having us do different parts here and there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568668">At any rate, we asked for more documentation to be provided to us because we want to make sure that there is accountability as funds are restored to the program. The program was suspended by the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> for a brief period of time and then reinstated. Therefore, there is a legitimate concern about what happens next, especially because we still do not know the full oversight that is going to take place with the NRC and so forth. Thus, we asked for those documents and gave them sufficient time, but we have not received them to the fullest extent. That is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568669">It is important to note that this is unnecessary in terms of House time, which could be spent on other significant issues. There is the Israeli issue with Lebanon that is taking place internationally right now. We also have the issue that I have been working on in committee to try to advance the credit card rates. We are getting a study on that, but the Conservatives brought forward another motion that we had to deal with; if we do not watch it, we are maybe going to lose some time with regards to that study. However, in all fairness, some answers are deserved here, and the motion has merit. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568670">To wrap up, as we send this issue back to committee, we have to be very careful about how we handcuff committees, if we are going to do that. Those are some of the questions that we still have to answer as we go forward. At the same time, we need more open, accessible government. There are better ways to do this. This is a situation arising from a structural flaw in our current Parliament. It has been done before with other issues, for example, the detainees in Afghanistan. Therefore, again, I would call for a better process in Parliament. However, I have a lack of faith at the moment because the two political parties that have been in control of Canada have wanted to control access to information for their own political reasons, depending upon the political time, versus actually exposing it publicly and letting the public come to its own conclusions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568674"> I guess the backstop for me about that issue is that we still do not control the RCMP or tell it what to do. The RCMP will get the documents and come to a decision from their own deliberations, investigations and so forth. The RCMP is similar to the Auditor General and the Competition Bureau. Suggestions can be made to those bodies, but it is up to them to decide whether they should go farther with the information and do the next part.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568675">For those reasons, I still feel comfortable with that process. I appreciate the question, though, because it clarifies one of the misconceptions out there, which is that we are directing law enforcement. We are not. They are going to be able to look at the information and make their own independent decisions.</ParaText>

It was very alarming. This is why I hope that, at some point in time, we can actually enhance the necessary protections for whistle-blowers.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8568690">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to follow my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>, the dean of the NDP caucus, in this important debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568691">As our dean just said, our caucus has always been concerned about government transparency. When we look at all the NDP governments across the country, we see that they have not only been transparent but also that they are much better financial managers than the other parties. I am not the one saying that. It is the federal Department of Finance, whose end-of-fiscal files show that, over the past 40 years, NDP governments, as a collective body, manage the public finances better than all of the other political parties. We are very proud of that. We are waiting for the NDP to have the chance to form the federal government, because then we will be able to put the fiscal house in order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568692">As my colleague from Windsor West just said, the NDP has always advocated for whistle-blower protection. It is extremely important, because protecting whistle-blowers means having the opportunity to get the real information and prevent scandals from happening. That is something we pushed hard with the former Harper regime. We are still pushing today. We think it is important to protect whistle-blowers to both avoid scandals and bring them to light. It is important that we enable workers to report the misuse of public funds to the public while being protected. We also want to strengthen the independent offices of officers of Parliament, such as the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Office of the Auditor General of Canada. All of these elements add up to better protection for the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568693">When we look at this Sustainable Development Technology Canada scandal, we see that the Liberal government's failure to strengthen these independent officers of Parliament has reduced their ability to expose the misuse of public funds. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278412" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> just mentioned this. It is clear in this case that Annette Verschuren, who was the chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, handed millions of dollars over to companies she had ties to. Obviously, that was absolutely inappropriate, and we need to get to the bottom of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568694">Every time we have had minority governments, the NDP has sought out the truth and has tried to get to the bottom of things. Whenever scandals were exposed in one way or another, the NDP always pushed to get to the bottom of things and pass on important information to the general public. As I mentioned earlier, the NDP has also highlighted the importance of implementing solutions to prevent scandals like this from happening again. The NDP is waiting for an opportunity to put all these protections in place, because we cannot keep going in circles as Liberal scandals give way to Conservative scandals that give way to Liberal scandals that give way to Conservative scandals. During the last two Parliaments, we have at least had an opportunity to expose and get to the bottom of every one of those scandals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8568695">In a minority Parliament, because the NDP has more weight, we have been able to expose these scandals. The much larger scandals we saw under the Harper government were all covered up, because the majority Conservative government simply refused to put into place the protections that allow taxpayers to know money is being spent in an effective way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568696">What I found most reprehensible during the Harper regime was the fact that not only did Conservatives cover up these scandals, and I will come back to those in just a minute, but they also strangled the Auditor General of Canada and the PBO's office. They cut funding dramatically. They did that because, of course, when Conservatives are in power, they do not want independent officers of Parliament trying to get to the bottom of these many scandals. Under the Conservatives' watch, it was terrible. It was the worst financial management we have seen in a party's history. There were myriad scandals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568697">We can talk about the Senate scandals and the scandals through the PMO, but let us just talk about some of the Conservative scandals that were covered up by the Conservative government members when they were in power. Unlike now, where we have a motion that is being debated, that I am sure will pass and that will direct PROC to actually do its work, in each of these cases in the Harper majority regime, Conservative MPs simply slammed the door shut on any investigation of the myriad scandals of the Harper government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568698">Let me just enumerate a few of them. First is the ETS scandal, which represents $400 million. We talked I think quite legitimately about the misuse of funds around the ArriveCAN app, which was $60 million. The ETS scandal was many times that, and yet Conservatives clamped down to make sure that no parliamentary committee could review it, no documents were exposed and there was no way for the public to ever know the truth of what was a misspending of nearly half a billion dollars. It is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568699">However, it is not just that. I think of the Conservatives putting in place the Phoenix pay system, which cost over $2 billion. It is a scandal we are still seeing the repercussions of today. The Conservatives forced the Phoenix pay system to move forward, a system that had not worked in other parts of the world. It had not worked in Queensland, Australia and had been rejected by other governments that understood the importance of not saying yes to a pay system that was so clearly inadequate, yet Conservatives forced it through and cost Canadians billions. Even today, we are still paying for the repercussions of that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568700">Members will recall, of course, the Harper regime clamping down on the F-35 procurement scandal. We still do not know how that money was used. Fortunately, very good journalists were part of exposing the Harper regime and the Conservative scandals around the G8 funding, the gazebos and the money that was misspent. Up to a billion dollars was misspent around the G8, and again Conservatives clamped down to ensure that the public never knew the truth. On anti-terrorism funding, $3.1 billion disappeared, could not be found, and yet Conservatives again clamped down to ensure that the public never knew the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568701">While we are having this important debate, while we are openly referring this to committee to ensure we get to the bottom of this scandal under the Liberal government, we cannot forget the fact that the Conservative government was absolutely reprehensible in shutting down any sort of parliamentary ability to get to the bottom of things, in clamping down to ensure that the billions of dollars that were misspent or could not be found were never gotten to the bottom of and to ensure as well that they would cut the funding of the independent officers of Parliament, who do such an effective job of ensuring that the public gets the information that is a vital part of democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568702">Transparency in financial affairs is an essential component, a foundation of our democracy. What we saw under the Harper regime was all of those rules being thrown out the window. Billions of dollars were misspent, could not be found, and the Conservatives would never allow any of those scandals to actually be exposed to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568703">This is a matter of relevance coming to a possible election, because of the preponderance of corporate lobbyists now on the Conservative national executive, and the fact that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>'s closest advisers are lobbyists. If the Conservatives were bad under the Harper regime, we can imagine how much worse they would be now. We need transparency. That is why we need an NDP government in this country.</ParaText>

When tough action is needed, when a tough stand is needed, NDP members run away. This is the same thing.

              <ParaText id="8568706"> Mr. Speaker, there is a whole ton of rhetoric there and not any substance at all. I think this is the problem and why the Liberal government has become so unpopular. It is because of stands like the one my hon. colleague has just taken, regarding getting to the bottom of what is clearly a scandal. When we have somebody who is appointed by the Liberals to run an agency and we are seeing money then going to companies connected to that person, it requires getting to the bottom of. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568707">I think the Liberals should have taken the NDP's response, rather than the Conservative response, which was to just tuck it under the rug. That was the problem under the Harper majority government and certainly under the Liberal majority government. Neither Conservatives nor Liberals ever respect independent officers of Parliament and ensure that public transparency on the use of public funds is paramount. This is why I think it is time to throw out Liberals and Conservatives and elect an NDP government.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">Mr. Rick Perkins (South Shore—St. Margarets, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8568727"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deal with the ruling of the Speaker with regard to the production of documents ordered by the House on the scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, otherwise known as the Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund. The process, for those watching, was that the House ordered the production of the documents around the scandal, to the law clerk, and the documents could then be transferred to the RCMP for investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568728">As we know, the power of the House is greater than any one act, yet the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the PCO, decided to execute the order by telling departments to send in documents but redact them. As a result, that was, in our view and obviously in the Speaker's view, a breach of members' privilege, because the order from the House did not say “redact”. As a result, we are here to discuss the issue today, and it has been referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for further consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568729"> In doing this, it is pretty important to understand that there are some objections from the government about some alleged breach of the charter. There is no breach of the charter, and here is why. If criminal activity is suspected in a company someone owns, say they are part of a bank management team and they discover that somebody who works for them has stolen the money of depositors, that company has the right and indeed the obligation to call in the police and to turn documents over to the police. Police are not required to go to court to get access to those documents. The owner of the company, or the management team, can supply the documents to the police to start the investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568730">Why does that matter with regard to this instance? There is a foundation set up in 2001 called Sustainable Development Technology Canada, with the purpose of providing taxpayer financial assistance to green technology companies before they are commercialized. Since the government was elected, the foundation has received a billion dollars of taxpayer money. The result of probing by parliamentary committees is that we found that in 82% of the funding transactions approved by the board of directors during a five-year sample period that the Auditor General looked at, 82% of those transactions were conflicted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568731">What does that mean? According to the Auditor General, that is $330 million of taxpayer money that was given to companies where the board members who voted to give it to those companies had a conflict of interest. In addition, the Auditor General found that the same board approved another $59 million in projects that they were not authorized to do; they were outside of the mandate of the foundation that the government and Parliament set up. It broke the SDTC contribution agreements, and the directors broke the conflict of interest laws of Canada as public office holders and broke the SDTC act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568732">How did they break them? What do the two acts say? They say that a Governor in Council appointment, a person appointed by the government entrusted to oversee taxpayer money, is not to personally profit from their work on a committee, as a GIC appointment, and neither is their family. However, that is exactly what happened. In a five-year period where there were 405 transactions approved by the board, the Auditor General sampled 226, so only half of them, and found that 186 of those 226 transactions were conflicted. That is the 82%. That is the $330 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568733">If the Auditor General looked at all 400 transactions, statistically that would probably mean the rest are just as conflicted. Those 400 transactions are $832 million of taxpayer money. Therefore the Liberal, hand-picked appointees of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, from the chair on, got themselves into a position to benefit their own companies.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8568734">How did they do that and what were their conflicts? Every transaction, every bit of money approved by the billion-dollar green slush fund, every single dollar, had to be approved by the board of directors. The way the system worked was that beforehand, a note would be sent out of what transactions were on the board, and directors would declare a conflict. At the beginning of every board meeting, they would say, “Here is the list of transactions we are considering and the list of which directors are conflicted with which companies, so now let's go to work.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568735">In some cases, the director would stay in the room, according to the minutes, while they were voting on their own project. In other cases, the director would get up and leave the room while the others voted on it, and then that director would come back into the room, and the next director would get out of the room for their project. It was a nice little tidy conspiracy of conflict of interest to enrich themselves and the value of their companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568736">One director was particularly aggressive at this. She was appointed in 2016 by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Her name is Andrée-Lise Méthot. She runs a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital, in green technologies. Andrée-Lise Méthot's companies, before and during her time on the board, received $250 million in grants from SDTC. Some of that was before, and I will talk about that in a minute, but while she was on the board, $114 million went to green companies that she had invested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568737">During her time on the board, the value of her company, Cycle Capital, tripled because getting an SDTC grant is a stamp of Government of Canada approval that allows those companies to raise other funds. The House will never guess who her lobbyist was, her in-house, paid lobbyist for 10 years before he was elected. It was the current radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>. While he was lobbying for Cycle Capital, the current radical Minister of the Environment got $111 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568738">The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, according to the registration of lobbyists portion of the Lobbying Act, lobbied the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the industry department 25 times in the year before he was elected. For all his hard work, he owns shares in Cycle Capital. He still owns those shares. He has not answered how much the value of those shares has gone up since they have been granted and since the company got this kind of support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568739">If that were not bad enough, this particular director in 2022 left and went to the Canada Infrastructure Bank board, and the first thing she did was to vote $170 million of infrastructure bank money for a company owned by the chair of the green slush fund, Annette Verschuren. Annette Verschuren also sought $6 million for the Verschuren Centre at Cape Breton University because it was failing. SDTC said no when it went through the process, because there was a conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568740">However, in emails, it said it would help her find money from other government departments. Pretty soon after that, the Verschuren Centre got $12 million from ACOA and the ISET program. Her other companies got $50 million from Natural Resources Canada, and then of course there is the Infrastructure Bank one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568741">This is the story we hear. Nine directors, according to the Auditor General, accounted for the 186 conflicts. That is why the CFO of the industry department, when the whistle-blower called on him and sat down with him, said that this is way bigger than the Chrétien government sponsorship scandal, which was $42 million of taxpayer money going to advertising agencies and friends of the Liberal Party. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Why we are asking for the documents is that every time there is a witness at committee, every time we ask a question, new information comes out.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8568742">The government has opposed us at every step of the way in getting those documents, and we know why. With just a scratch of the surface by the Auditor General, which is a small part, we see that $390 million has gone to Liberal insiders. That is what Liberals are trying to hide. That is why they are opposing this production order, for documents to be turned over to the RCMP. That is why the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal department, the PCO, defied the order of the House to produce these documents and ordered departments to redact all the sensitive information. Surprisingly, they used a lot of black ink and went through a lot of toner in photocopiers when they printed the documents, because they are all blacked out. What are Liberals hiding? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568743">What they are hiding is more malfeasance and abuse of taxpayers' money. We know the little bit we have seen, the 226 of 400 transactions identified by the Auditor General, is just the tip of the iceberg, and that is $390 million. Apparently, that does not concern Liberals, for some reason. It does not concern them that this happened. It does not concern the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, who has not had a single meeting with the new acting board or the NRC, where he is proposing it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568744">With the new transparency that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> talked about in June, Liberals are giving out money again, and not a single bit of information is available anywhere on the website. The SDTC used to put out a quarterly report on every company. It no longer does. It is silent. It is hidden. The corruption of this organization and the nine Liberal directors abusing taxpayers' money in this way is beyond anything I and many members of this House have ever seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568745">Mr. Speaker, I will continue in enlightening the House after question period.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8568746">Mr. Speaker, Canada and the world will soon observe the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas terrorists against innocent Israeli citizens. For almost a year, the Liberal government has turned a blind eye to numerous pro-Hamas rallies that incite violence and hatred. Jewish-owned Canadian businesses have been vandalized, schools and synagogues shot at, and people assaulted. Even my wife was stalked, and our home targeted with posters falsely claiming that I support genocide. I support the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8568747"> However, hate promoters like Samidoun, an entity outlawed in Germany with its leader banned from the EU, are free to have a rally in Vancouver to celebrate a terrorist act. Other rallies will also be held to support Hamas. Thanks to U.S. intelligence, Canada thwarted one terrorist attack being planned on Canadian soil by a foreign national to mark the anniversary. Does someone have to be killed before the Liberal government acts to keep Canadians safe in the lead-up to October 7 and beyond?</ParaText>

They call for two things from the Government of Canada: to reform or abolish the safer supply strategy and safe injection sites; and to focus federal funding on strategies that actually break the cycle of addiction and support community safety.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8569017">Mr. Speaker, I will resume and summarize where we are. We are debating the Speaker's ruling on the privilege motion on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s department, the PCO, redacting documents against the House order to provide documents regarding the Liberal green slush fund to the law clerk to be transferred to the RCMP for investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569018">Where I left off was in the middle of discussing the various conflicts of interest of the various directors. Members will recall I was talking about the director, Andrée-Lise Méthot, who owns a company called Cycle Capital. Her companies have received $250 million, before and during her time on the green slush fund board, and her lobbyist, before he came to the House, was the current, radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569019">In his time as the lobbyist for Cycle Capital, when he lobbied 25 times in his last year before entering the House, the PMO and the industry department gave over $100 million in green slush fund money to Cycle Capital. Shockingly, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> still owns shares of that, even though, as a cabinet minister of government, he participated in discussions that gave the green slush fund another $750 million, of which over a quarter has gone to that company. He still owns shares in it. He has not disclosed what they are worth. I know he is familiar with orange jumpsuits, but I think this needs to be explored more by the RCMP, and hopefully the documents will show that when they are transferred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569020">I will speak also about another board member handpicked by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Guy Ouimet, who has admitted in committee that $17 million of green slush fund money went to companies he has a financial interest in. He said that it is a small amount of money. It may be a small amount of money to him, but it is not to most Canadians, and that amount of money, he admitted, had gone up 1,000% in value since that investment was made in 2019. It pays to be a Liberal insider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569021">I will bring our attention to another director, a fellow named Stephen Kukucha from British Columbia. Stephen Kukucha was a political staffer to former Liberal environment minister Anderson, and he was the organizer for the Liberal Party for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in British Columbia. As a reward, they put him on the green slush fund board. Surprisingly, we have another Liberal on the board in whose company he had a financial interest. In his time on the board, the companies he had a financial interest in received almost $5 million from the very board he was serving on. He said they were small amounts of money, but in committee, unlike Mr. Ouimet, he did not have the courage to say how much the value of his investments had gone up. That is why these documents need to be produced and why these directors need to be investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569022">We all know about Annette Verschuren, so let me talk a bit about one of the processes that they established. They established something called accelerators, and those accelerators were outside organizations that the board hired to vet proposals and make recommendations to the board. One of those was an organization called the Verschuren Centre at the University of Cape Breton, which is in the name of and was set up by the chair of the green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569023">There is MaRS Discovery District at U of T. Members probably know that. Can members guess who chairs MaRS? It is the chair of the green slush fund, Annette Verschuren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569024">Companies would be screened through board member-controlled organizations, and shockingly, their companies got recommended to the board for funding. That is just a pure coincidence. With 82% of the transactions that they approved, nine directors were conflicted. These directors do not represent 82% of the green technology industry in Canada, yet their companies got 82% of the funding. It is strangely a pure coincidence with these hand-picked directors from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569025">We are debating the issue of systemic conflict of interest and corruption in this green slush fund. We only know right now about $390 million because a forensic audit has not been done by the Auditor General. The Auditor General did a sampling of things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569026">The Ethics Commissioner has not investigated any of the other directors, other than the one my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278390" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation> asked to be investigated. When I asked the Ethics Commissioner if he had the power to investigate anyone who is a GIC appointment, he said yes. When I asked him why he had not investigated the other eight GIC appointments put out in the Auditor General's report as having conflicts of interest, where money flowed to companies they had an interest in, do members know what the Ethics Commissioner said before a committee? He asked what the point would be in investigating GIC appointments of people who are no longer on the board. That is what the Ethics Commissioner of this institution said. I said that because the taxpayers pay him to discover and expose conflicts of interest of GIC appointments, appointments by the Liberals, of featherbedding insiders funnelling money, perhaps he should do his job for a change. He is not doing his job. He was shocked that anyone would ask him that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569027">Why is all of this important? Every one of us was sent here to be very careful when spending the hard-earned money Canadians make that we are privileged to oversee. That is an essential part of our job. This organization stuffed its own pockets with taxpayer money, yet the Liberals are fighting it. They say it is not their role. Taxpayer money that we oversee was authorized by this Parliament and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> is responsible. For 40 months, he sat there, with an ADM in every meeting, the current <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, and did absolutely nothing until it made it into the press.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569028">This is corruption like we have never seen in Canada. This is why we have asked for the documents, because the Liberals are hiding documents. This is why they are resisting and hiding the documents, because they know there is more corruption there with their hand-picked directors. If we were a private sector institution, we would be turning those documents over to the police to investigate. That is our job. No, it is not just the job of the police to go to the courts to seek that. It is our job to expose the corruption in the things we have authorized money for in this Parliament. It is our job, and it is time the Liberals started caring about it.</ParaText>

There was the $3.1 billion that could not be found around anti-terrorism activity. The G8 fund, and a gazebo, was a billion dollars, and the Harper regime shut it down so we could not get to the bottom of it. There was the F-35 procurement scandal. The Phoenix pay system that we are still afflicted with today cost $2.2 billion, and the Harper government refused to have any sort of inquiry on it. There is the ETS scandal, which is $400 million, and again, the Harper government shut it down. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569055"> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on your finding of a prima facie question of privilege arising from the Liberal government failing to abide by a clear and unequivocal order of the House, namely to turn over documents relating to a massive scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, more accurately known as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s billion dollar green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569056">On June 10, a majority of the House, not only Conservatives but also New Democrats and Bloc Québécois members, called on the government to turn over all relevant documents to the RCMP to shine a light on the self-dealing conflicts, corruption and law-breaking that have mired the SDTC foundation, or again, better known and more accurately described as the green slush fund. For three months, the Liberal government has obstructed that order of the House, and in so doing, it has once again demonstrated its utter contempt for the House and the supremacy of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569057">It is all part of a pattern of cover-up by the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to protect Liberal insiders who got rich by ripping off Canadian taxpayers. The level of scandal and corruption at the green slush fund is truly staggering. It was laid bare in the Auditor General's report issued last June. The Auditor General found, among other things, that $400 million in taxpayer dollars went out the door improperly at the green slush fund. That is $400 million out of the $800 million in the green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569058">I should note that was just based on the sample by the Auditor General because the Auditor General did not do a full audit of SDTC. Even with that sample, she found $400 million. If a full and complete audit had been undertaken, it is almost a certainty that she would have identified tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars of taxpayers' money that improperly went out the door in addition to the $400 million that she identified. Of the $400 million that went out the door, the Auditor General found that a staggering $330 million involved conflicts of interest of board members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569059">In some instances, board members voted to funnel money into their own companies. In fact, the Auditor General found 186 cases of conflict. Essentially, just to provide Canadians with a picture of what was going on at this Liberal green slush fund, board members were appointed by Navdeep Bains and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. These were board members who all had various financial interests in green tech companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569060">Funding decisions would come up at board meetings. A board member would say they had a conflict of interest and step outside the door, while all the board members knew that was that board member's company, and the board would then approve the money to go into that board member's company. The board member would then come back in, and another funding decision would be considered. Another board member would say they also had a conflict of interest, they would walk out the door, and the board would then approve funding to that board member's company. Then that board member would come in and another board member would step out and on and on it went, rinse and repeat. Talk about a total racket.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569061">This went on 186 times since 2017 according to the Auditor General. The times that board members walked out the door were instances where, arguably, compared to other conduct at the green slush fund, they acted ethically. In 90 cases, the Auditor General found that board members actually sat in, deliberated on and voted on funnelling monies into companies that they had an interest in or had a conflict of interest with. There were blatant conflicts of interest in 90 cases. I would submit that is not only a conflict of interest, but that is out-and-out corruption and out-and-out theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569062">One person who was involved in voting to funnel money into her own company was none other than the chair, Annette Verschuren, who was hand-picked by the former corrupt Liberal minister Navdeep Bains. She actually said, to her credit, she had a conflict of interest upon Bains tapping her on the shoulder. However, Bains said it did not matter, that conflicts of interest did not matter to him or to the government, and they would manage the conflict of interest. Of course, that set the tone for the culture at SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569063">What did Annette Verschuren do? She actually sat in and moved two motions to unlawfully funnel $38.5 million out the door in so-called COVID relief payments. By unlawful, I mean monies that went out the door in contravention of the contribution agreements that the green slush fund had with ISED or Industry Canada. Not only did $38.5 million improperly go out the door in those so-called COVID relief payments, but $220,000 was funnelled into her own company, a company in which she was the CEO, founder, majority shareholder and sole director. She moved a motion and voted on sending $220,000 to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569064">Ms. Verschuren is a sophisticated business person but it does not take a sophisticated business person to realize that when they are a shareholder, sole director and CEO of a company, it is completely unethical and improper to be sitting on a board, moving a motion and voting on funnelling $220,000 to their own company. However, that is what she did and it is one example of many of conflicts, self-dealing corruption and law-breaking at the green slush fund. The Ethics Commissioner, last month, found Ms. Verschuren guilty of breaching multiple sections of the Conflict of Interest Act. I underscore that Ms. Verschuren's misconduct merely scratches the surface of self-dealing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569065">To that end, I would note that another bad actor at the green slush fund is Andrée-Lise Méthot, the CEO of Cycle Capital. This is someone whose firm has received, and the companies connected to her firm have received, more than $40 million from the green slush fund. This is someone who sat on the board as tens of millions of dollars went out the door. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> happens to be a shareholder. He happens to have worked closely with Ms. Méthot prior to his election. We have a minister in the government who is profiting off the conflicts and corruption at the green slush fund. Perhaps that may explain the total lack of interest in getting to the bottom of the corruption.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569066">It must be noted that, through all of the meetings involving conflicts and self-dealing, a senior official in the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s office sat in on those meetings. This was not just any senior official. The assistant deputy minister sat in on 186 conflicts. In that regard, we have a government that turned a blind eye and was essentially, in so doing, complicit in the corruption at the green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569067">Members need not take my word for it. They can take the Auditor General's word. Paragraph 6.74 of the Auditor General's report reads, “an assistant deputy minister of the department regularly attended meetings of the foundation's board” and “that the assistant deputy minister's presence at meetings provided an implicit agreement by the department for any decisions that the board made.” In other words, it was wink-wink, nudge-nudge. They were going to turn a blind eye to this corruption. That is the finding, essentially, of the Auditor General. </ParaText>

Well, I certainly do not. I think it is a very serious thing. It is too bad that she and her party sold out time and again to prop up the corrupt Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569070">Be that as it may, we have that finding from the Auditor General. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> says that he had no idea. Now, given that his assistant deputy minister sat in on each of those board meetings, it is beyond belief to accept that the minister had no idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569071">In the unlikely event that the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> did have no idea, it does not really get any better for the minister because this means that there was either one of two scenarios. Either the minister knew and turned a blind eye to corruption, and was therefore complicit in the corruption, and I would submit that that is the likely scenario, or the minister had lost complete control of his department, in which case the minister is utterly incompetent. In either case, the minister has demonstrated himself wholly unfit to serve in the high office that he holds as <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister of industry</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569072">The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s failures and complicity in all of this is not speculation. Last week, a whistle-blower appeared before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. His testimony about the minister's conduct in this entire matter was absolutely devastating. The minister would have Canadians believe that he only learned about this in February 2023 when a whistle-blower came forward. Essentially, in February 2023, it was going public, and the minister really had no choice politically but to act as though he was doing something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569073"> Therefore, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> appointed a firm to investigate, RCGT, and frankly, the scope of its investigation was inadequate. According to the whistle-blower, RCGT came back with an interim report in May 2023, which the minister blocked from being released. The minister blocked the release of the report. Not only that, but according to the whistle-blower, the minister tampered with evidence that was being considered by the RCGT report. He actively intervened and tampered with its investigation as he pushed for further delay and to water down the findings of RCGT.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569074">Then, when the report was issued in the fall of 2023, despite it being a very damning report that identified many of the conflicts that had been confirmed by the Auditor General, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> kept the corrupt board in place. He kept his corrupt Liberal friends, people he and Navdeep Bains appointed, in place so that they could continue to enrich themselves. At the very least, he did not see to any level of accountability and he, according to the whistle-blower, ignored the consensus within the department that this rotten and corrupt board needed to go, needed to be fired.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569075">To that end, I would cite the testimony of the whistle-blower, who said at committee last week, with respect to the minister and with respect to the government, the following:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569077">I would submit that this is a damning indictment of the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="8569078">Let me again say that 400 million tax dollars were improperly spent from the green slush fund. That $400 million is only scratching the surface of the corruption that likely took place beyond the conflicts that have been identified. So massive is this scandal that the former deputy minister of industry was recorded as saying, “It was free money. That is almost a sponsorship-scandal level kind of giveaway.” That was before the report of the Auditor General. Based upon the findings of the Auditor General, the green slush fund scandal is significantly bigger than the sponsorship scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569079">In the face of corruption, self-dealing and conflicts, it is enough obstruction and enough delay. It is time for accountability. It is time to ensure that those who abused positions of power are held to account. To that end, as a step in doing that, it is necessary for the government to abide by the order of Parliament and turn over all relevant documents to the RCMP in the face of this corruption. It is long past due to call in the Mounties.</ParaText>

It is absolutely shameful. This is a great example, what we find ourselves in the House talking about today as a result of the member's support for the government.

              <ParaText id="8569111">What does the government do as soon as it is ordered by the House to produce documents? Of course, we find that the government is turning its back on its obligation to the sacred institution of Parliament, refusing an order to produce the documents. Why is that? Well, of course, the Liberals got caught stacking a board with their friends, like the chair of the SDTC board, a friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Annette Verschuren. What did their friend do when she got put into this place of trust, a place of privilege?

It is not that kind of friend; it is a friend like Mark “carbon tax” Carney, and we could call him conflict of interest Carney, but it is almost synonymous with everyone who associates themselves with the Liberals.

However, instead of firing her, they just appointed some man who is a friend of the Prime Minister and who shares his ideological bent to tax Canadians just for the crime of trying to feed themself, heat their home and put gas in their car to get to medical appointments and to their jobs.</ParaText>

One would say that is enough of a scandal to put an end to the latest conflicted appointment, and one would wonder why the conflicts of interest of Carney are not under the purview of the same rules that designated public office holders have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569118">They are paying him through the Liberal Party to avoid the necessary disclosure that would have also revealed to Canadians that his company, of which he is the chair, Brookfield Asset Management, is going to benefit substantially from changes to the mortgage rules that the government made a day after the last announcement it made that was conflicted, on Telesat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569119">The Liberals are going to put more burden on Canadians with their changes to mortgage insurance. They have a terrible supply problem in the housing market, but they did not announce some program to solve supply. No government has ever spent so much to achieve so little as they have on housing. What did they do? They decided to increase demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569120">Why on earth would they take measures to increase demand in housing during a housing supply crisis? Of course, the company of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s new economic adviser, Mark “carbon tax” Carney, stands to benefit financially from it. This is within just days of his being appointed. We have to wonder why the Liberals would not bring him under the umbrella of the conflict of interest regime. It is because everyone they bring under it gets found guilty of breaking it.</ParaText>

Liberals will ask, “Wasn't SDTC started by Conservatives?” Yes, it was, and in 2017, it received an audit by the Auditor General and got a clean bill of health. What happened between 2017 and 2023? The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his accomplice, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>, allowed for Liberal insiders to ransack the place, push the organizational objectives aside and allow well-connected Liberal insiders to get ahead.

What does that tell us about their respect for the rule of law, for Canadians and for the democracy that each of us has been elected into to represent Canadians here in this place? They certainly do not think much about it. They do not think much about the effect it is going to have on Canadians, unless of course those Canadians are their well-connected friends. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569166">Mr. Speaker, what we have seen from the Auditor General time and time again is that, after nine years, the NDP-Liberals cannot seem to manage the government.

              <ParaText id="8569172">The Auditor General found that for 10 ineligible projects, it was $58,748,613, and in 90 cases where conflict of interest policies were not followed, it was $75,974. For projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were met, it was $58 million. Another 96 cases, where conflict of interest policies were followed, was $259 million. The numbers do not lie when we look at the corruption that was allowed to fester under the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569173">We have to ask ourselves what was in it for them. What was in it for the Liberals and their friends? Of course, it was their financial betterment, their personal enrichment. This was all about helping Liberal insiders while Canadians have been struggling to feed themselves. It is a shameful legacy, but it is one that, as the member rightly pointed out, follows on the heels of the $60-million arrive scam or the $1-billion WE scandal and, of course, the other cases where the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found to be outside of the law or to have broken the law, just like the long history that includes the ad scam, of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569174"> I think that goes to the heart of it. The reason the Liberals do not want any sunlight or disinfectant to be applied here is because the last time there was a massive scandal of this scale, it brought down a Liberal government, a tired, corrupt Liberal government. What is old is new again. It looks like they have the very same concerns about this multiple-hundred-million dollar scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569189">The actions of the government, such as the implementation of the carbon tax and the mismanagement of the economy, have led to increased inflation, among so many other things. Canadians, in record numbers, are being forced to visit food banks. I see some of the numbers provided to me by local food banks, often run by volunteers, and they are absolutely heartbreaking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569190">I have heard from some of the folks who run one of the local food banks, and they were stunned that it is not just folks who have fallen on hard times who are being forced to visit the food bank, and it is not just those who have lost their jobs who are being forced to visit the food bank. In some cases, it is people from around the community who simply have no other options. Their credit cards are maxed out, and they do not have anything left at home to feed their children. They were, in those cases, forced to visit a food bank. That is the legacy of the Liberals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569191">We have 25% of Canadians, according to reports, facing poverty-like conditions. What is the government's response? It is 390 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately given out, many of which went to well-connected Liberal insiders. It was $390 million not going to help Canadians, and not going to grow the economy, but $390 million, more money than most people could ever imagine, going to well-connected insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569192">The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects. The government talks big about the environment, yet it gave $58 million to projects that were supposedly to help the environment. That was the reason this fund was created. However, it could not demonstrate that there would be an environmental benefit or the development of any green tech. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569193">I know there are many Canadians watching because of the absolute corruption that has been normalized under the Liberal government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, which has been supported by the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569194">It is absolutely astounding that, in the midst of a time when the Liberals talk big about the environment, they are giving dollars to projects connected with Liberal insiders that did not even try to explain and did not even try to defend what they were doing as being good for the environment, even though that was why these programs were created. The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the government and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were being given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569195">I hear often from members of that side of the House, and I hear from Canadians as well, asking what we would do differently. I am proud to stand as part of a party that takes governing seriously and that would fight corruption and incompetence, especially the sort of incompetence that leads to this type of gross mismanagement scandal to the tune of $390 million being misappropriated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569196">I want to talk about why the finding of a violation of privilege is such an important issue. I believe that many people outside this place and in fact, certainly from some of the questions I have heard from members of other parties in this place, some in this place also, do not take seriously Parliament's constitutional role. Let me unpack that a little bit for the benefit of those watching and explain why documents matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569197">It is less about whether or not there are physical documents we can read from; that is not the whole point here. The point is that there is an institution that is Parliament, which in our Westminster system of governance is the supreme authority of our country. As parliamentarians, we are that which makes up a Parliament. I believe that there are two Liberal vacancies with by-elections forthcoming, and at the rate at which the Liberals are losing seats, it will certainly be interesting to watch what those election results are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569198">The MPs who make up Parliament have unfettered access to call for documents and for people to come as witnesses. We talk about that a lot in the context of committee, and it is a key element of the constitutional role that this place plays in our country. We cannot dismiss the importance, because that is the cornerstone of the democratic system we have. It is this place, the only place in the country, I would add, that is truly representative of our country. Every square inch of the nation of Canada is represented in this place and only in this place. That is why Parliament is given such significant latitude to be able to do things like call for documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569199">The government refused to be transparent and provide the documents in question. Its members gave a whole litany of excuses. In fact I found it very interesting that when the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">House leader</Affiliation> was speaking very negatively about the Speaker's ruling that has led to this debate, quite astonishingly, she pivoted away from saying that she was disputing the ruling but said that she was dismayed at the ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569200">I would suggest that any member of this place who is dismayed at the constitutional authority of what Parliament is meant to be needs to go back and look at the history, the construction, of the constitutional reality and the traditions that make up what this place is. It has to come down to the very idea of where the buck stops. It stops with Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569201">I want to highlight something in the context of what I have just described, because there has been, under the Liberals, a concerning trend of wanting to distance the executive function of government from Parliament. I understand that it is inconvenient that the Liberals do not have unfettered power to do anything they want; it is an inconvenient thing they are forced up against. I have seen, over the last close to five years that I have had the honour of serving in this place and serving the people of Battle River—Crowfoot, how the Liberals have been able to sign deals, have backroom handshakes and have the whole deal with other opposition parties in order to have a functional majority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569202">However, Canadians sent a minority Parliament to Ottawa in the last election, and this place has the ability to do things like demand documents; it has the full constitutional right to do so. It is outlined very clearly that this is in fact the case. When members of the government are making excuses and figuring out ways around this place, it is deeply concerning and should cause concern to every Canadian, regardless of what political party they are a part of.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Damien Kurek:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member from Winnipeg seems to be laughing when I say that the very foundation of our institutions is not a partisan issue, and therein lies the problem. The very foundation of our democratic system is taken so flippantly by members who pursue their personal politics. As we have seen outlined in the course of this SDTC scandal, back in 2018, when former minister Navdeep Bains did not like that the chair of the board of SDTC was criticizing things the government was doing, the chair was replaced, contrary to advice from those within his own department. We have seen a continuation of that political manipulation since, which has led to this scandal. A very clear timeline has been laid out. The Liberals do not take seriously Parliament's role. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569206">I understand that they would rather an audience than an opposition. They would rather have carte blanche to do whatever they want and pursue their personal, political, financial and other interests. However, that is not how this place works. MPs are sent here to represent their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569207"> I will speak to those on the Liberal backbench. They have an obligation to not simply prop up their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are sent here as members of Parliament. We are on the ballot as members of Parliament. They will stand to be judged in the next election by Canadians as members of Parliament, and they will have to answer, just like the NDP and the Bloc, for supporting this type of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569208">I would encourage them to take seriously the role that this place is meant to play, because as we have seen, there is a distancing. With the way the Liberals operate, they want unfettered control to do whatever they want, and they treat Parliament only as an inconvenience. That is truly a national scandal that is eroding the trust that Canadians have in their institutions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569209">As a proud Canadian, as somebody who has grown up in this country and spent a lot of time being involved as a volunteer and staff member, and as a passionate politico, I have watched and studied a lot about government and other institutions, such as United Kingdom's Parliament, and about the history of our democratic system, how like systems around the world have developed over the course of the last number of centuries and some of the history that goes much further back than that. As it used to be, while we may not have liked or agreed with the person in charge of the country, just as we may not like the current Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or may not have liked a previous Conservative prime minister or previous Liberal prime minister, we could respect the offices and institutions. It is troubling that, increasingly, I hear from Canadians that they are losing trust in the institutions we have. This is from the actions of the Liberals, who are bent on trying to keep the truth from coming out and, in this case, refusing to provide documents. Now it is the authority of the House and a violation of privilege that have led to the motion and amendment we are debating today, which I am proud to support. It comes down to that very simple choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569210">Part of the challenge is that the erosion of trust and the normalization of scandal have led many Canadians to question the legitimacy of much to do with government, and that is going to take hard work to restore. I am so proud to be a part of a party committed to doing the hard work required to restore trust in our institutions and ensure that this place, Parliament, is respected. I would suggest that the very root of where we are today on this motion related to SDTC is these documents. These documents matter. The heart of our parliamentary institutions, our democracy, is at stake, and we have seen continual attempts by the Liberals to try to erode it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569211">This adds to a litany of scandals that is quite astounding. I talked about the normalization of scandals. As soon as the ruling was delivered yesterday evening, I went through and reflected on some of the scandals. I have been a member of the ethics committee for a significant portion of this and the last Parliament. We are, of course, debating the document production related to SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569212"> Prior to this, there was the arrive scam, with $60-plus million on an app that was budgeted to cost less than $100,000, and sole-source contracts. We are seeing a massive mismanagement of those contracts today. We see that they seem to be going to friends and insiders. As well, there is the fact that during a time of crisis, the government would, instead of working in the best interests of Canadians, choose to enrich its friends. It is absolutely shameful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569213"> There was the WE Charity scandal. Again, in the midst of what was a national crisis, the government chose its friends over well-established protocols that could have easily been expanded. There is the Canada summer jobs program. Instead of using a program like that and expanding it, the government was going to give $1 billion to its friends, who had given significant benefits and paid, to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars, close members of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family. I would remind the House that the Prime Minister went as far as to prorogue Parliament to keep the names and the amounts of those payments from coming out. I was on the ethics committee at the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569214"> Further, we have the SNC-Lavalin scandal, where the only reason that the RCMP did not lay charges against the sitting <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is because they determined it was not in the public interest of Canada. Imagine, there has been such a deterioration of our institutions that it has led to it being deemed in public interest that the Prime Minister should not be dragged in front of a judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569215">There was the Aga Khan Island trip. There are the indigenous contracts, which I know are being studied at committee, as there seem to be Liberal insiders who are manipulating that process, taking money that should be going to first nations here in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569216">We have the massive growth of consultants. In fact, there have been some very interesting editorials of late that say that it has become a consulting capital and that the only way to get anything done is to hire the right consultants. That is not how a government should be run.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569217"> There have been billions of dollars in handouts. I cannot help but think of the ventilators that went to a former Liberal MP and ended up in a scrapyard, to the tune of, again, hundreds of millions of dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569218">Where does this leave us? Once again, MPs will be given a choice, to support accountability and, I would go further, support the very foundation of what our democratic system is supposed to be, the idea of parliamentary supremacy. To ensure that we can get the answers, not that Conservatives want, but that Canadians deserve, that's where the rubber hits the road.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569219"> I would urge all members, Liberal backbenchers, members of the NDP, members of the Bloc Québécois, and the few independents we have, every MP in this place, to think seriously about the role of Parliament, the principles of parliamentary supremacy, and ensure that we all do our part to combat the corruption and do the hard work required to restore trust in the institutions that Canadians need to be able to trust and look at with respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569220"> I would urge every member in this place to support this motion, to take seriously our democracy and ensure that that hard work can be done. Let me simply conclude with this, because I have my doubts after nine years of seeing exactly what the Liberal attitude is. When it comes to the hard work of restoring trust, I am proud to be a part of a party that has a plan and the energy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569223">Let us be clear. The primary job of a member of Parliament is to hold the government to account, regardless of its political stripe. It makes no difference whether it is a majority or minority government. Our job is to hold the government to account. When the government has a majority, it usually tells us to take a hike. The fact that this is a minority government helps us enormously, because it means we can end up in a situation like the one we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569224">Let us be clear. The government made a mistake. When the House votes to demand that documents be tabled, they must be tabled. An investigation will eventually be needed to get to the bottom of this. If the RCMP does not want the documents, it does not have to accept them. However, we need to have a say in the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569225">I have a question for my colleague. If there were an election tomorrow, the Conservative Party would form a majority government. In ethics, we say that a principle is a real principle when the choice is made to put it into practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569226">If my colleague ends up sitting on the other side of the aisle, will he still stand up and staunchly defend the principle of tabling documents, as he is doing now, or will he play the Conservative government game and tell opposition members to take a hike?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569245">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278707" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569246">I am pleased to rise today as a member of the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology. We have the pleasure of working in this committee with our colleagues from the Maritimes to advance the development of new technologies and industry in Canada. We have had the opportunity to debate various issues with our Liberal, NDP and Bloc colleagues and we work in very close collaboration. We are truly trying to advance Canada's economy within this committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569247">Today I am obliged to talk about what we discovered when we heard something rather alarming. We found out that there had been some misappropriation at Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, regarding the green fund. Some people had been appointed to SDTC's board by the Liberals. Those people paid themselves knowing full well that they were in conflict of interest. This has been proven, and not by us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569248">The Auditor General was the one who discovered that these directors had given large sums of money to their own business, or to organizations they held shares in or had ties with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569249">I had the opportunity to speak with the former chairperson of SDTC, Annette Verschuren, who appeared before our committee not once but three times at our invitation. The last time I spoke to her, I told her that I had a high school diploma in auto body work. I am a guy who never enjoyed going to school. I graduated from high school with my mother's help and I am grateful to her. That high school diploma in auto body work got me into the workforce. Based on what I learned in school, I always knew that no one can take what does not belong to them, or acquire something through a conflict of interest that they are not entitled to. I always knew that no one should use their relationships for monetary gain or preferential treatment. I do not understand why such a smart, socially-active businesswoman like her could not grasp the position she was in. That is what I said to the former chairperson of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569250">This position was actually offered to her by the former minister of industry, <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">Mr. Bains</Affiliation>. Unfortunately, Mr. Bains now seems to be suffering from Alzheimer's, because he does not remember appointing her to that position. There was a conflict between these two individuals' different interpretations. Neither of them could remember what was said. No one could tell us how she ended up in that position. To make matters worse, before being appointed, Ms. Verschuren had already received funding thanks to her connections with the fund. She knew full well that by taking the appointment, she would be in a conflict of interest. When I asked if it had occurred to her that she could be in a conflict of interest, she admitted that it had crossed her mind, but that she had not withdrawn from consideration. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8569251">The fact that she is no longer sitting on this board of directors would mean that she is no longer accountable. That is interesting, because she and the other board members awarded themselves tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars. Those amounts were given to people who were in a clear conflict of interest. I am not the one saying that. It is the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569252">As elected officials, we find ourselves in the House today because of non-compliance with a request that was made by all parliamentarians. Of course, I am talking about the members of the opposition parties, because the government did not want to co-operate in producing documents that would enable us to confirm and verify all these facts. In addition to the projects that these people approved for themselves, the Auditor General identified 10 ineligible projects worth close to $60 million. On 96 occasions, conflict of interest policies were followed, but in 90 cases, they were not, which means that these people allocated money to themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569253">I want to come back to the fact that I just have a high school diploma and a diploma in auto body repair. I was 18 years old when I finished high school, but I already knew that this is not how things should be done. About 10 years ago, I took a course at the Collège des administrateurs de sociétés, Université Laval's college of corporate directors. The first thing we learned about governance was the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest. Imagine if we, as members of Parliament, gave ourselves public dollars belonging to Canadians, either from our MP budget or through other channels. That would be an absolute scandal. In fact, in the past, with the sponsorship scandal, we saw how the Liberals were scheming to help their friends. The same principle applies today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569254">It is important that we have access to all the documents, because tens of millions of dollars were given to directors who were in a direct conflict of interest. This money may also have been misspent. The Auditor General actually said herself that $60 million was allocated to 10 projects that were ineligible. Who were these people who received that money, and why did they receive money from that fund? People can apply for funding from any number of funds in Canada. What is the relationship between the people who received money and the companies in question?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569255">All the documents requested were sent to us completely redacted for reasons of confidentiality. I heard my Liberal colleague say earlier that the documents could simply be handed over to the RCMP. In Canada, all of us here come before the RCMP. We are here to make laws and implement them. It is our privilege to receive these documents. They were requested on June 10. Today is September 27 and we are still waiting. It is a question of privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569256">This is not the first time that the government has concealed information. In 2015, the Liberals boasted that they would be the most transparent government in this country's history. I think it is fairly obvious that this is far from true. It is really unfortunate that we are still talking about this in the House of Commons even now, when, in fact, it is a question of parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569257">Mr. Speaker, I assure my colleague from Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup that I do not have Alzheimer's. I have a very good memory. The motto in Quebec is “Je me souviens”, or “I remember”. I do not trust people who preach to others when things in their own party are not entirely above board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569258">I would remind my colleague about the G8 and G20 spending scandal. That was not even about people on boards of directors who might have been giving money to Liberal cronies. It was the minister himself who diverted public funds to run ads in his own riding. I am not making it up. We know it. It is in Sheila Fraser's report. She was the auditor general at the time. Thirty-two infrastructure projects were funded in Minister Tony Clement's riding. He is a former Conservative minister. We are talking about $50 million to make tourist information signs and install public washrooms and build roads in unrelated areas, in connection with the projects for the G8 and G20 summit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569259">I would like my colleague to tell me how Quebeckers can feel reassured? When the Conservatives were in power, they dipped into public funds to divert money. That was also called out by the then auditor general.</ParaText>

I will remember, as will all Quebeckers, that, as we speak, the Bloc Québécois is supporting a centralizing, spendthrift government. The Bloc supported spending hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, over the past nine years, and particularly over the past four or five. As a result, we now have two million people using food banks. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569262"> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he does not think that what he is trying to do is counterproductive. I understand that the RCMP wrote to the law clerk of the House of Commons in July saying that it is highly unlikely that any records that they receive through this process could be used in an investigation as it would affect the suspect's Charter of Rights. Does he not understand that the process that is being undertaken now is actually counterproductive to bringing any criminals to justice?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569263">Mr. Speaker, what is counterproductive is the fact that the Liberals do not want to co-operate and ask all the opposition parties that are here, that are represented in the House, to provide the documents in question. That is what we call counterproductive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569264">The privilege that we have to be able to access those documents is an extremely important parliamentary privilege. Unfortunately, the Liberals do not want to co-operate. That is very harmful to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569268">My colleague's question is very simple. We have the privilege of being in the House of Commons. We are here to keep an eye on things. As my Bloc Québécois colleague, who taught ethics for 30 years, said earlier, the primary role of parliamentarians is to ensure that the country is well governed. That includes knowing how the public's money is being spent. That is our role. Frankly, it is an absolute priority for the opposition to make sure that the government is doing its job and giving us the information in full “transparency”. I use quotation marks because, obviously, the current government does not know the definition of the word transparency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8569269"> Mr. Speaker, what the House is debating today is astounding, mind-numbing corruption under a Liberal government kept in power by the NDP. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8569270">This government is also supported by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8569271">We are talking about the billion dollar green slush fund, known as Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It was set up in 2001 to provide financial assistance to green technology companies that were looking to be commercialized. This was a worthy objective, and Conservatives favour technological breakthroughs that help the environment. That is the way to do it. We do not support a carbon tax that hurts Canadian companies and Canadians. The carbon tax is a tax plan, not a climate plan. Conservatives have called for a carbon tax election, which the Liberals, Bloc and NDP have said no to, not just to us but to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569272">In 2017, the Auditor General produced a report and gave the SDTC a clean bill of health. The SDTC at that time was under the chair who was appointed by the Conservative government. Fast-forward to today. Thanks to whistle-blowers, who had access to information within the government and the SDTC, a web of corruption, of Liberal-friendly individuals and firms, has been exposed, totalling hundreds of millions of dollars. The Auditor General has released a new report examining 226 out of 405 transactions. She found, out of the 226, that 186 of them had conflicts of interest totalling $330 million, or 82%. Extrapolating from the entire amount that was given out by SDTC, that equals about $800 million of expenditures that were conflicted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8569273">What do we mean by conflicted? It means that the people on the board who were appointed received personal benefits. Their companies received personal benefits from the transactions. It really undermines a lot of the expenditures that the Liberals make. We have to, as the opposition, as taxpayers, second-guess almost everything that they are doing. We start scratching the surface and wonder about the connection to a Liberal-friendly individual or company. We have seen it throughout. In 2019, the Minister of Industry at the time, Navdeep Bains, appointed a chair who, he was told, had a conflict.</ParaText>
