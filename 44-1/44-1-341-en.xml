          <ParaText id="8556625">The House resumed from June 5 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C-378, An Act amending the Canada Labour Code (complaints by former employees)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText>

          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bittle" id="12870532">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="311619" Type="18">Mr. Chris Bittle (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8556626">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278366" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation> for her work on this file. The government supports this legislation, and I would like to take a few moments to explain why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556627">Everyone deserves a healthy workplace where they feel safe. It is a basic right, yet one that many workers are denied. Harassment and violence at work still happen and no workplace is immune to them. No one should face this on the job or anywhere else. The Government of Canada must set an example, and we are. In 2021, we put in place stronger protections against workplace violence and harassment under the Canada Labour Code and its regulations. This historic piece of legislation, Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document>, is now better protecting workers from these harmful behaviours, which disproportionately impact women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556628">To continue improving protections for workers, an important part of this work is monitoring the progress of these new measures. Last year, we published our first annual report on taking action against harassment and violence in workplaces under Canadian federal jurisdiction, which covers harassment and violence reported to employers in 2021. The first report showed that not all workers experience harassment and violence in the same way or to the same degree. This information is critical. With each annual report's findings, we are able to evaluate what is working and identify improvements that will ensure workplaces are safe and healthy across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556629">When occurrences of workplace harassment and violence are reported, it is important that the investigations are truly independent. In 2021, the government set up a registry of workplace harassment and violence investigators to make it easy for employers to identify qualified investigators and better protect federally regulated employees. We currently have 75 qualified investigators listed who can be contracted by employers to lead independent investigations and make a positive difference in the workplace. In March, we launched a selection process to expand our registry of qualified investigators. These additional resources are expected to be made available by June of next year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556630">We are also investing in partner organization-led initiatives that will help drive culture change in federally regulated workplaces and protect workers from harm. With the workplace harassment and violence prevention fund, we are currently funding seven new multi-year projects and have funded 14 overall since 2019. The three new projects will receive $10.7 million in total funding over three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556631">For instance, let us take the project from the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children at Western University. The project will see the creation of specialized resources and training for unions to inform employees of their rights and build workplaces free of harassment and violence. All of the following groups are coming together to make it happen: the subject-matter experts at the Canadian Labour Congress; francophone representatives from Quebec; and FETCO, an employers' organization comprising federally regulated firms within the transportation and communications sector. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556632">We are also providing funding through the “workplace opportunities: removing barriers to equity” program, or WORBE, to help break down employment barriers experienced by women, indigenous people, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities. Currently, WORBE has a funding envelope of $3 million every year with 11 multi-year projects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556633">Canada also participates actively in the global effort to cultivate workplaces that are free from fear and intimidation. Earlier this year, the groundbreaking International Labour Organization convention 190 came into force in Canada. Canada played a strong leadership role in the development, adoption and advancement of this convention. It is the first-ever global agreement on ending violence and harassment at work. We joined countries around the world to protect workers and make sure that every workplace is safe and respectful. It is not just a Canadian value that we have promoted. Now it is a protected right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556634">We have also made progress in supporting the mental and physical health of women at work. We are improving the well-being of nearly half a million workers who may require menstrual products during their workdays by making sure these products are treated like the basic necessities they are. Since December 15, federally regulated employers are now required to provide access to free menstrual products to their employees. This is a big step toward creating a healthier and more inclusive workplace, and we are on our way to accomplishing much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556635">In December 2021, we passed a bill to give workers in federally regulated private sector workplaces 10 days of paid sick leave. That bill passed with unanimous consent, because no one should ever have to choose between getting paid and getting better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556636">Through Bill <Document DbId="12739107" Type="3">C-59</Document>, we are proposing changes to the Canada Labour Code to create a new three-day leave for federally regulated private sector workers following a pregnancy loss. In the event of a stillbirth, employees would be entitled to take eight weeks off. For most employees, the first three days of this leave would be paid. Dealing with pregnancy loss is hard for employees who experience it and they need support. This new leave would provide employees with greater job security while they recover. It would be available to the individual who is pregnant, the spouse or common-law partner and any person who is intended to be the legal parent of the child. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556637">As everyone can see, we have been working on many fronts to protect workers and make sure that every workplace is safe, healthy and respectful. We have made great progress, but a lot more remains to be done, whether it be through training programs, efforts to eliminate the stigma that prevents workers from speaking up or better resolution processes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556638">We are all in this together: employers, unions, labour experts and different levels of government. We will continue to work hand in hand to confront, prevent and eradicate harassment and violence in the workplace. When workplaces are safe, it is a win for all of us. Workers can be at their best, employers thrive and the economy benefits. </ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278669" Type="2">Mr. Luc Desilets (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8556639">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C‑378</Document>, which was introduced by our Conservative colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278366" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556640">Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank my staff, since this is the first time that I am rising since the House resumed. Like every other MP's staff, they help us improve our work, give better speeches and better carry out our duties, but most importantly, they help us to provide very important services to our constituents when we are away from our ridings. I am talking here about my political staffers, Daniel Lavallée and Sonia St-Amand, my communications manager, Corinne Guimont, my head of representational work, Michel Kieffer, and my photography and videography manager, Vincent Yergeau. This whole team is managed by an exceptional director, Arianne Collin-Gascon. I tip my hat to them and sincerely thank them for all the work they do behind the scenes to support me in my duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556641">Back to Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C‑378</Document>, which would amend the Canada Labour Code by extending the timeframe to file a complaint for harassment or violence in a federally regulated workplace from three months to two years, even after the individual ceases to be employed. The Bloc Québécois supports this initiative to better protect workers who have suffered abuse. Extending the deadline is a significant step forward for people who may not have the strength or support they need to act quickly in the wake of incidents involving harassment or violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556642">The Bloc Québécois has always been a staunch defender of workers and always will be. We believe that this bill is a step in the right direction. The Bloc Québécois is delighted to see the Conservative Party suddenly taking an interest in workers. We hope that this is not just electioneering and that the Conservatives will continue to put workers first in the coming months. Let us hope that if they do come to power, they will be able to keep from targeting them in the cutbacks they plan to make.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556643"> In short, giving victims two years to report incidents of violence or harassment recognizes that victims of trauma may need more time before they are ready to file a complaint and take action. This is about respect for trauma victims. These people may, in some cases, need more time to finally be able to speak out. They often experience psychological and physical pain in the months following an incident of this kind, and they often do not have the strength to take action or defend themselves. Some may even need to seek medical attention, which obviously makes it even more difficult to file a complaint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556644">There have recently been some very positive developments for workers under federal jurisdiction, with the historic and unanimous vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C‑58</Document> prohibiting the use of scabs. By extending the statute of limitations, we are showing kindness and understanding towards those who have experienced these hardships. It shows concern for the victims, a sense of empathy that should always guide our decisions and legislation as legislators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556645">It is worth remembering that, in 2018, the government passed Bill <Document DbId="9220285" Type="3">C‑65</Document>, which strengthened the provisions on workplace harassment and violence. Updated definitions were added to control this kind of unacceptable behaviour more effectively. The definitions in question include any action, conduct or comment, including of a sexual nature, that causes offence, humiliation or other physical or psychological injury or illness to an employee. That encompasses all types of harassment and violence, even domestic violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556646">I would now like to raise a matter of concern to me. Federal public services and Crown corporations are the sectors where incidents of harassment and violence occur the most often.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556647">In 2023, the Department of Employment and Social Development tabled its annual report entitled “2021 Annual Report: Taking Action against Harassment and Violence in Work Places under Canadian Federal Jurisdiction”. I will talk about that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556648">The Department of Employment and Social Development identified 4,950 reported incidents in 2021. The federal public sector and the banking sector alone account for nearly half of the reported cases, which is a very significant proportion. These numbers are troubling, if not alarming. That is why it is so critical that this limitation period be extended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556649">Before I conclude my speech, I would like to talk about an article I saw in this morning's newspaper. Maka Kotto, a former Parti Québécois minister, wrote this very moving article, which aptly summarizes what is happening in the House. He talked about the sometimes disgraceful comments and gestures that are made and the totally inappropriate attitude sometimes shown by members of the House, or certain members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556650">One point he made in the article was that bringing back dignified debates, where differences are expressed respectfully, is the only way to restore public confidence in our institutions. Everyone should read this article by Maka Kotto, a former Parti Québécois minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556651">To wrap up, this bill is an important step toward greater justice for victims. It is time to recognize psychological wounds, which are not always obvious, and to take time to heal them. It is also time to recognize that federal workers deserve all the protection we can offer them with this legislative adjustment.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Mr. Gord Johns (Courtenay—Alberni, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8556652">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and honour today to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C-378</Document>, an important bill. It recognizes that the impacts of workplace harassment and violence endure after employees have left a job, and extends their ability to seek recourse and accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556653">As the mental health critic for the NDP, it is important and critical that we advocate for the rights and well-being of workers, especially their mental health. This is a critical bill to ensure we work toward supporting workers who have been impacted in the workplace, so they have enough time to process their trauma and bring forward a complaint when they are ready. This is a crucial change to that and it would allow workers more time to do that by extending the period to two years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556654"> We know that most adults spend more of their waking life at work than anywhere else. Therefore, workplaces have an essential role in the mental health of Canadians. We certainly know that here. Toxic workplaces that fail to take action to prevent or stop harassment or violence contribute to mental health problems that have an enormous cost for workers, families and Canada as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556655"> According to the Mental Health Commission of Canada, 14% of employees do not think their workplace is psychologically healthy or safe at all. About 30% of short and long-term disability claims are attributed to mental health problems and illnesses. The total cost from mental health problems to the Canadian economy exceeds $50 billion annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556656"> In 2011, mental health problems and illnesses among working adults cost employers more than $6 billion in lost productivity from absenteeism, presenteeism and turnover. According to a study by Mental Health Research Canada, 22% of respondents report being exposed to trauma at work; 20% of respondents indicate that the nature of their job involves unavoidable risk to psychological harm; two-fifths of respondents, 38%, are still impacted by their trauma, while half, 48%, have recovered from it. Clients, 46%, co-workers, 29%, and direct managers, 27%, are the most frequent sources or workplace trauma. Twenty-seven per cent of respondents indicate that people at work do not often or always recognize the importance of protecting the physical safety of employees and 45% indicate the same about protecting the psychological safety of employees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556657">We know that workers face significant barriers in bringing forward complaints regarding workplace harassment and violence, including fear of reprisal, loss of their livelihood and impacts on their career trajectory. I will talk about a couple of cases in my riding, which I heard at committee as well, in a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556658"> For some workers, it is only possible to come forward once they have left an unhealthy workplace. Therefore, it is essential to remove barriers for former workers to bring forward complaints. Otherwise, harassment and violence can continue unchecked at toxic workplaces. If there is no accountability, there is no push for change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556659">A deficiency of the bill is that it would only apply to harassment and violence, It would not allow workers to make complaints regarding other actions that may impact their psychological well-being, such as discrimination and unfair dismissal. Therefore, I am hoping that at committee consideration will be made to expand the types of complaints workers can make. However, the bill could also be improved to provide clear timelines and procedures to ensure that former employees do not have to endure prolonged stress because of delays in resolving their complaints.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556660">I was fortunate to serve on the government operations committee for a couple of years. We were in the process of going through Bill <Document DbId="11875762" Type="4">C-290</Document>, the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act. I had the opportunity to listen to witness testimony about workers who were subjected to terrible workplace trauma and a lot of mental health-related issues. I see my friend from the Conservative bench, who sat with me on that committee, nodding. We heard about the trauma experienced by Luc Sabourin, who worked for the government. Workers were literally torturing him. When he left, the process took a long time, and it is still taking time. Luc is still going through the process of recalling what happened to him.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556661"> Going through that process can take a long time, when people have been traumatized, to roll out the facts, to reassess, to seek professional support, to get the guidance they need, to ensure they get the counselling they need, first and foremost, and when they make a complaint, to ensure the complaint is just. We want justice here. That is what we all commit to when we walk into this place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556662"> Another situation that surfaced in my riding over the summer, a really difficult situation, was the lack of safeguards for temporary foreign workers and the lack of recourse for them. We found out that workers at the San mill in Port Alberni were living in inhumane conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556663"> I will read a quote from CHEK News that interviewed Joe Spears, who was working as the San Group's general manager of terminals. Workers were washing dishes in and drinking water from a creek. They literally had no drinking water in their accommodation. At one time 30 people were living in an Adco-style trailer. When the news media reported on it, 16 workers were living in inhumane, mouldy conditions. The sewer was running underneath and was leaching into one of the bedrooms. It was absolutely disgusting. It was a horrific scene.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556664">The company tried to say that it was not its problem because it was not required to provide accommodation for these temporary workers under its current permit. However, it was still charging them, $350 each, to live in this trailer. I was told that the rent was going to go up to $500. We also learned that they were not paid what they had been promised, never mind the hours that they were promised. There was discrepancies left, right and centre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556665"> These workers were enduring trauma after coming to Canada, with the lack of safeguards to protect them and the inability of government to respond to support these workers. Joe Spears, when asked by CHEK News about where they were washing their dishes, said, “This is where they chose to wash their dishes.” He went on to say, “If someone chooses to use water, maybe in Vietnam that's an acceptable practice, that's normal housekeeping.” He was alluding to the fact that these Vietnamese workers would rather use an outdoor runoff from a stream than have a running water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556666">It is unbelievable that a private sector company would put its employees through this trauma. Those workers were left with nowhere to go. The Salvation Army went in and protected those workers. It removed them from the site and found them temporary accommodation. However, it took a couple of months before they received their open work permits and were finally able to get a better start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556667">It is taking a long time to actually get the full story from these workers as more and more things are surfacing. Language barriers are contributing to the fact that we are not hearing about all the different things they endured through their working time at this mill in Port Alberni.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556668">We have to do better to protect workers. When we look at temporary foreign workers, there is no program for the federal government to respond, to find housing for workers who have been treated poorly, and nowhere for them to get the right supports. The government supports for temporary foreign workers, when they have endured harm in the workplace, are not there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556669">I was disappointed with the Conservatives. They are bringing forward this bill today, and I am grateful for that, but they were nowhere to be found when this story came out. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> was at that mill, talking about the workers and standing with the owners of the mill, but he was nowhere to be found when this terrible situation happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556670">I have to bring this to the floor of the House of Commons, because we should never allow this to happen again. I am grateful for this legislation, and look forward to it getting to committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556672"> The bill is an exceptional piece of legislation by another Conservative MP trying to enhance the rights of workers across the country. There has actually been a long history in the current Parliament, where the NDP-Liberal government has not acted to protect workers; in fact it has been Conservative MPs who have stood up to try to make sure that workers are protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556673">A number of bills have been put forward by Conservative MPs to improve the lives of workers, in addition to this fantastic bill; for example, there is Bill <Document DbId="11527631" Type="4">C-228</Document> by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278446" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, which would actually protect workers' pensions. It has been a long-standing problem in this country that a company would go bankrupt, workers' pensions would be unsecured creditors and their pensions would disappear. In nine years of an NDP-Liberal government, no action was taken on that. It took a Conservative member of Parliament to say we need to protect workers and this has to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556674">There is also Bill <Document DbId="11540871" Type="4">C-241</Document>, brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278526" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>, which would allow tradespeople to deduct their travel costs for going to work. It is common sense. If a CEO can write off the cost of their private jet, then why can a worker not write off the cost of their travel as they go out to try to earn an income. Again, during nine years of a NDP-Liberal government, this is something that had no action. A Conservative member of Parliament stood up to make that change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556675">I also want to mention Bill <Document DbId="13191956" Type="4">C-409</Document>, brought forward by the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278254" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation>. We have heard a lot from the NDP, and silence from the Liberal government, about how flight attendants were ending up working, on average, 30 unpaid hours per month. The NDP-Liberal government did absolutely nothing. The New Democrats talked a bit about it and tabled petitions and other things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556676">However, it took a Conservative member of Parliament to put forward a bill that would change the Canada Labour Code to define what constitutes work for flight attendants so they would no longer be sitting on a plane waiting for it to back up or waiting for it to take off, and not get paid. We heard horror stories of flight attendants who would show up for work but the flight was delayed and they would be there, would time out for their shift and then go home and not be paid. It was outrageous, and the NDP-Liberal government just let that go on for the past number of years, with no action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556677">This brings me right back to the fantastic bill before us that has been put forward by my colleague. This is a very serious matter. People who are the victims of harassment or violence at work are victims. They have been traumatized. The Canada Labour Code was only allowing them three months after they left work to file a complaint. These are people who are vulnerable and probably are not in a position to make that decision. Once again, a Conservative member of Parliament had to step in to make that change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556678">The Liberal government tried to make some changes under Bill <Document DbId="9220285" Type="3">C-65</Document>, where the victim could apply to extend the three-month timeline. Imagine that: Victims would actually have to apply to extend the deadline. The burden would be on the employee to make the justification for a new deadline. They would have to file an application, explain the trauma and ask for an exemption. The Liberals thought this would well serve the victims of harassment or violence, but it actually would have done nothing of the sort. Imagine having to give deeply personal details to someone to see whether they would let them file a complaint after three months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556679">It was very thin gruel for the victims. Therefore I want to congratulate again my colleague for seeing the problem, coming up with the solution and making sure that people who suffer these outrageous acts would now have up to two years to file their complaint.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556680">It is a pattern we have seen well established in Parliament, that the NDP-Liberal government talks a very good game about protecting the rights of workers, but they do not actually deliver the results that are required. Therefore it has taken a series of Conservative bills to actually make incredible differences in the lives of workers, including the bill before us here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556681">I understand that there is support for the bill to pass, which is wonderful, but it always leaves me this question: After nine years of an NDP-Liberal government, why did it take so long for it to realize this was a problem? It is because the government is really not governing the country well on this and on a whole host of other issues. As opposition members, we have a limited ability to try to clean up the messes that are left by the government, and we have done that with a series of bills that actually are going to make substantial differences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556682">We hope that the bill before us is going to be fast-tracked through Parliament. Let us get it to committee, get it studied and get it passed. We do not have a huge amount of time in Parliament left for it to pass, so we want to make sure that the piece of legislation can go to the Senate and receive royal assent. I hope it is going to pass through committee very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556683">I would also hope that when Bill <Document DbId="13191956" Type="4">C-409</Document>, the fairness for flight attendants act, comes up for second reading and a vote, it also goes to committee expeditiously, because it is an incredibly difficult circumstance that flight attendants have right now across the country, and labour has not really had the friendliest of governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556684">There was recently a section 107 referral by the government with respect to the resolution of the rail dispute. The right to strike is constitutionally protected; the Supreme Court said that in 2015, and the NDP-Liberal government said it was going to make a referral and take away the workers' ability to go on strike. Once again we have an NDP-Liberal government that claims to be friendly for workers, but it has taken—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8556688">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House this morning. This is the first time I am rising since Parliament resumed. I would like to take this opportunity to wish my colleagues a good return. The session may be cut short. We shall see what the next few days and weeks bring. We are being kept in suspense. In any case, according to the media, the suspense is rather intense right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556689">I truly hope, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278669" Type="2">Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Affiliation> said earlier, that we will be able to soften the tone a bit this fall and focus on working for the well-being of Quebeckers and Canadians. I hope we can do that. It is not easy, judging by the tone we heard all last week, but I truly hope that we can do it. I think it is possible. I think we have elevated the debate before, and I hope we can do so again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556690">Before I continue, I would also like to congratulate the candidates and winners of last week's two by-elections, in which I was an active participant. I commend all of the candidates. In this day and age, putting one's face on posters and wanting to work for the common good takes courage, no matter which party someone is seeking to represent. Not everyone here shares the same vision for the common good, but I think that most of us are trying to work toward that. Everyone who ran in the two by-elections did so with that goal in mind, and I commend them for that. I especially want to congratulate the two winners, the NDP candidate who won in Manitoba and, obviously, the Bloc Québécois candidate who won a great victory. We stayed up very late last Monday evening, until 2:30 in the morning, to find out the results, and the Bloc Québécois won. That is a great victory. I look forward to our new candidate's arrival in the House. He is a bright, intelligent young man who is full of ideas and who will rise in the House to strongly defend the interests and values of Quebeckers. I am sure that he will. We will see when he arrives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556691">I am delighted to speak to the bill tabled by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278366" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation>, for whom I have a great deal of respect. I am fond of my colleague. I am not so fond of the Conservative Party's ideas in general, but I have a great deal of respect for my colleague. I rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C‑378</Document>, an important bill to protect the rights of federally regulated workers. It would extend from three months to two years the period during which a former employee may file a complaint for harassment or violence in the workplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556692">As members know, the Bloc Québécois has always been a staunch defender of workers' rights. Before the summer break, much was said about the anti-scab bill. The NDP had tabled the bill, and it was finally passed. Obviously, we supported it. In fact, over the past 30 years, the Bloc Québécois has introduced anti-scab bills 11 times. We settled this issue in Quebec 50 years ago. This happens all the time in the House. The House has debated countless bills on issues that Quebec has already dealt with. Take child care and pharmacare, for example. Quebec addressed both of those a long time ago. However, here they are still being debated. The Bloc Québécois members often feel as though we are working to help Canada catch up with Quebec. That is what we are doing most of the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556693">Yes, we have always been staunch defenders of workers, and we firmly believe that this bill represents a major step forward in the fight against harassment and violence in the workplace. It is high time we recognized that victims of these kinds of incidents need more time to come forward, especially in cases where they are under tremendous psychological or physical stress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556694">Currently, federally regulated employees have only three months to file a complaint after leaving their job. This is simply too soon for many victims. The consequences of harassment and violence in the workplace do not disappear overnight. Too often, victims of workplace harassment or violence continue to suffer the after-effects long after they have left their job. They face emotional difficulties and mental health issues and, in many cases, are reluctant to speak out against their abusers for fear of reprisals or career stigma. This bill provides a concrete solution to that problem. Extending the time frame to two years gives victims time to heal, catch their breath and find the strength to file a complaint.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556695">Two years is a reasonable amount of time for workers who have been unjustly treated to take the necessary steps to seek justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556696">Workplace harassment and violence are not isolated problems. The Department of Employment and Social Development released a report entitled “2021 Annual Report – Taking Action Against Harassment and Violence in Work Places under Canadian Federal Jurisdiction” that revealed some alarming figures. In 2021, employees working in federally regulated industry sectors reported an absolutely staggering 4,950 occurrences of harassment and violence. The federal public service, banks and the transportation sector are among the main sectors where these incidents occur most often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556697">These figures unequivocally show that the fight against workplace harassment and violence is an ongoing process that is far from over. We need to strengthen protections for workers, and that includes allowing former employees to file complaints long after they leave the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556698">It is also important to remember that these incidents often have serious repercussions, not only on the victims' professional lives, but also on their personal lives. The physical and psychological repercussions of workplace harassment and violence can persist long after the incident, which is why this bill is so important. It gives victims more time to come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556699">Passing this bill will send a clear message. Workers in federally regulated sectors deserve a safe and respectful work environment. The Bloc Québécois has always supported measures to protect workers and guarantee decent working conditions. We are pleased to see this bill move forward, just as we were pleased to see Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document>, which bans the use of scabs, pass recently. These are historic victories for workers' rights, and we must keep up the momentum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556700">I would also like to draw a parallel with the bill I introduced with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278276" Type="2">Rivière-du-Nord</Affiliation>, Rhéal Fortin. I apologize, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556703">These two bills share a common concern: guaranteeing access to justice for the victims. The bills try to correct flaws in the legal system, flaws that, as they stand, can deny some victims the chance to assert their rights. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556704">In the case of Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C‑378</Document>, the purpose is to provide victims of workplace harassment and violence with more time to make a complaint, in order to help them overcome the psychological and administrative obstacles associated with these traumatic situations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556705">In the case of the proposal to limit the use of the Jordan decision for serious crimes, the purpose is to prevent the accused from evading justice because of excessive court delays. Jordan sets strict deadlines for trials, and it has at times allowed individuals charged with serious crimes to be acquitted, jeopardizing the safety of the victims and the integrity of the justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556706">Both bills seek to restore balance between victims' rights and legal requirements, while preventing procedural formalities from compromising justice. By extending access to justice, in the case of Bill C‑378, and by tightening up the legal loopholes arising from the Jordan decision, these two bills share a vision of a fair, effective justice system centred on the victims' needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556707">In conclusion, the Bloc Québécois is proud to support this initiative. We hope that all members of the House can grasp the importance of this legislation to this country's workers. Indeed, there can be no justice without recognition for victims' rights, which is exactly what this bill seeks to achieve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556710">I am delighted by what I am hearing today. Of course, I was equally delighted by what I heard during the first hour of this debate at second reading.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556711">I am very moved to see that Bill <Document DbId="12869960" Type="4">C‑378</Document> will probably receive unanimous support. As the bill's sponsor, I find that extremely gratifying, although the spotlight does not belong to me. It really belongs to these former workers. As things stand, they have only three months to file a complaint if they were victims of workplace harassment or violence. Three months is the blink of an eye. It is not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556712">When I was the minister responsible for labour at the Quebec National Assembly, I reviewed all of the labour standards, and I worked very hard to ensure that this aspect was reviewed and corrected in workplaces to ensure that, in Quebec at least, the time frames are the same for former employees as they are for current employees. Here, in the federal government, current employees are not held to any limitation period, unlike former employees who have only three months, which is obviously not enough time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556713">Unlike what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278669" Type="2">Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Affiliation> suggested, this is not a new-found interest for me. I am grateful for his support, of course, but he implied that the Conservatives have just developed a new-found interest in the cause of workers. That is not true at all. I can prove that this has been an ongoing interest and concern of mine over the past few years. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278504" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> also articulated that very well. Conservative members have introduced many private members' bills in the House to greatly improve the situation of workers in federally regulated workplaces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556714">I am very pleased with the unanimity we have in the House. Even though our debates can sometimes get a little heated, we are also able to share a common vision and work to keep protecting employees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556715">The government had already included the possibility of extending the time limit by three months. In other words, the government already knew that the short time frame might be challenging for the victims who want to make a complaint. We know how long it can take for a person to realize they have been a victim of harassment or violence in the workplace. Often, in the span of three months, there is not enough time for the individual to realize they were victimized. Then the deadline expires and, ultimately, the person has no recourse. Two years is patently a reasonable amount of time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556716">I will close by quoting Cindy Viau, director general of the Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harcèlement au travail for the province of Quebec, who said the following about the two-year time limit that exists in Quebec and that I want to implement here:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> In addition, at the provincial level, we note from our experience that very few people who contact us find it difficult to initiate the complaint process within the two years set out in the Act respecting labour standards. Since the time limit was changed in 2018, we have only on very rare occasions had to explain to a victim that they had missed their deadline to file a complaint.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8556718">All that to say we are on the right track. We have a good objective, a common goal to protect workers from harmful workplace behaviours like harassment and violence. It is the least we can do to give a full two years' recourse to those who have left their jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556727">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to what I believe to be very positive legislation. I suspect that, if we were to canvass a vast majority of Canadians, they would recognize that what the online harms act deals with is a very positive thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556728">I am a bit surprised at the Conservative Party's approach to the legislation. It is important to look at the essence of what the online harms bill attempts to recognize as issues. There are two categories, if I can put it that way, of what one would classify as the harmful contact specifically being dealt with in Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>. The first is intimate images communicated without consent, including sexually explicit deepfakes, and the second is content that sexually victimizes a child or revictimizes a survivor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556729">I would have thought that all members of the House would support those initiatives. I have heard Conservatives across the way talk about concerns related to them, how offended they are about the issue and the government needing to do something. Now that we have a piece of legislation before the House with which, instead of just talking about it, the Conservatives can actually do something about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556730">I was very surprised to read an editorial back in July in the Winnipeg Free Press that the Conservatives not only oppose the legislation, but also, if the legislation were to pass in the House, a Conservative government would repeal it. It would repeal the law. I do not quite understand the logic behind that, and I hope that during questions and comments, a member of the Conservative Party will have the courage to explain to Canadians why Conservatives would oppose this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556731">I will read from the Winnipeg Free Press article, an editorial that was written July 10.

The other is that they have concerns of cost, which is estimated at somewhere in the neighbourhood of $20 million a year. Even though those numbers have not been confirmed, at least from what I understand, the Conservative Party in its common-sense nonsense approach to politics has made the determination that it is just not worth bringing forward the legislation, and that, even if it passes, a Conservative government would repeal it.

              <ParaText id="8556759">Online criminal activity continues to surge, but the Liberals' response has been to push censorship bills that would force Canadians into a false choice between their safety and free expression. Instead of addressing the real issues, this Liberal legislation silences Canadians under the guise of security, creating bloated bureaucracies led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked allies. Canadians are bearing the brunt of this government's failures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556760">Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> introduces a dangerous new provision for an offence “motivated by hatred”, which could impose a life sentence for even minor infractions under any act of Parliament. This broad, unchecked provision opens the door to the possibility that mere words alone could lead to life imprisonment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556761">While the government claims that a serious underlying act must occur for this punishment to apply, that is simply not reflected in the text of the bill. Section 320 of the Criminal Code would be amended to state, “Everyone who commits an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament...is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556762">Laws to address the issues we are witnessing have been in place for decades, and the Supreme Court has ruled on them multiple times. We do not need new laws to govern hate speech. This government needs to grow a backbone and enforce the laws as they stand. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556763">Earlier this year at the justice committee, the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> openly admitted that Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>'s new hate crime offence could apply to any offence as long as it is hate-motivated. He said the bill's sentencing range covers everything from minor to serious crimes, but judges, hand-picked by this government, will make sure minor offences do not receive harsh sentences. However, by leaving this to the courts, the government is being reckless. We cannot rely on vague promises that the judiciary will fix a poorly drafted bill. Parliament needs to clearly define when a life sentence should apply, not hand over broad and unchecked power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556764">The bill risks extreme punishments for minor infractions. As stated by a political commentator, “[The] Liberals are using the guillotine for speech violations and [on the other hand] house arrest for career criminals roaming the streets exploiting a broken bail system.” Only in Canada would that bizarre statement have application. </ParaText>

Bill C-412 is designed to protect Canadians online through three key areas: protection from online criminal harassment, safeguarding our children and ensuring user privacy. Bill C-412 aims to empower victims of online criminal harassment who currently have limited options for quickly and permanently ending their harassment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556768">This legislation would allow victims to apply to a judge to identify their harasser, end the harassment and then impose conditions to stop it, as deemed appropriate by a court. It also provides legal clarity regarding when online operators such as social media platforms must disclose the identity of an alleged abuser. Additionally, the legislation introduces an aggravating factor for perpetrators who repeatedly harass anonymously using multiple burner accounts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556769">These measures are designed to streamline the process for victims to interact with law enforcement and receive effective protections, ultimately enabling law enforcement to de-escalate violence in a timely manner.

In addition, Bill C-63 fails our children by delaying protections and relying on an unclear regulatory process. In contrast, Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document> takes proactive measures by imposing a clear duty of care on online operators. The bill seeks to establish a novel set of checks and balances between the government, operators and parents to keep children safe online. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556771">Under Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document>, existing government regulators, law enforcement and the judiciary would ensure operators follow their duty of care to keep kids safe online. Operators would be formally required to ensure they keep kids safe under a clear set of guidelines. Parents, then, would have all the tools needed to understand what their kids are doing online and then make informed decisions about what types of permissions to give them for their online use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556772">It would provide parents with tools to protect their children online through non-invasive age verification methods and would enforce these protections with steep penalties for non-compliance. Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document> would specifically safeguard children against physical harm, bullying, sexual violence and harmful online content. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556773">Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document> offers a balanced solution that emphasizes privacy, preserving age verification methods, while explicitly prohibiting the use of digital IDs. Many Canadians are concerned about privacy and the misuse of digital IDs. Bill C-412 would ensure that digital identifiers could not be used for age verification. Meanwhile, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> leaves privacy concerns unaddressed and lacks clear prohibitions against the misuse of digital IDs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556774">Bill C-63's vague regulatory framework allows for excessive bureaucratic oversight, creating opportunities for tech lobbyists to manipulate the process behind closed doors.

              <ParaText id="8556775"> By failing to effectively tackle online harassment and leaving significant gaps in protections, Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> reflects a government more concerned about creating a facade of action than genuinely, actively safeguarding Canadians' rights and safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556776"> Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> seeks to reinstate section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, a provision that was removed by the Harper government and that even the Toronto Star, hardly a cheerleader for the Conservative Party of Canada, has deemed unnecessary for protecting Canadians from hate speech. Section 13, which was previously repealed for its overly broad and subjective application, allowed the government to censor speech without the need for criminal proceedings. Reintroducing this section would open the door to an extrajudicial system where vague definitions of hate speech could lead to a chilling effect on free speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556777">The new section 13 would make communication of hate speech by anyone on the Internet, or other means of telecommunication, subject to the jurisdiction of the Canadian human rights complaints mechanism with the standard of proof being not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is an extremely high standard, but merely a balance of probability, 50.01%. This is not only dangerous but deeply flawed. We have already seen the consequences when the Liberals attempted to appoint an arbiter under Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, who had previously argued that "terror is not an irrational" approach. This highlights the inherent risks in giving unchecked power to unelected individuals who may interpret free speech in ways that suppress legitimate voices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556778">Section 13 would also pave the way for dangerous precedents, like life sentences for hate crimes without proper legal thresholds. The Liberals have failed to provide evidence that such extreme measures would be effective in preventing hate when the laws we already have are not being enforced. We need to hear from legal experts and civil liberty groups to understand the unintended consequences this could bring. What we really need is action. Action today, not years from now, and not censorship, which is exactly what Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556779">The government should focus on enforcing existing laws and protecting ethnic minority groups by empowering the RCMP, INSET and NSES to work collaboratively and quickly with local police forces and share intelligence to protect vulnerable communities; directing CSIS to implement threat reduction measures and communicate threats to ethnic minority groups; and ensuring the security infrastructure program provides real, timely funding to help community centres improve security. Rather than reintroducing section 13 and limiting free speech, the government should enforce current laws and take meaningful action to protect Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556783">As shadow minister for justice, I stand firm in criminalizing and enforcing laws that protect our most vulnerable: our children. We must criminalize and enforce penalties against those who victimize children online or bully them digitally. We must punish those who induce self-harm or incite violence in minors. We must ensure strict bans on distributing intimate content without consent, including the rise of deepfakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556784">My Conservative colleagues and I believe these serious crimes must be investigated by police, be tried in court and result in a jail sentence.

A Conservative government would protect our children and punish those who prey on them, not create more red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556785">This past summer, the PBO revealed the cost of the Liberal government's online harms act. It would cost $200 million to create a new 330-person bureaucracy to enforce rules that are still undefined. That is $200 million up front with no protection to create more work for a bloated bureaucracy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556788">This raises serious concerns about transparency, efficiency and the potential impact on free speech. Even worse, the $200 million does not cover the additional workload for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which would have to manage a surge of complaints about social media posts in today's cancel culture. The government has no estimate of how many complaints the commission might receive, so it is very likely the $200 million is just the beginning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556789">To put that in perspective, the PBO's numbers reveal that the bureaucracy created solely by Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> would be about one-third larger than that of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the agency responsible for ensuring the safety of Canadians in the air and on the roads. Additionally, the PBO's analysis shows that on a per capita basis, the new bureaucracy would be vastly larger than that of any comparable agency in other peer countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556790">Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> should be scrapped just on the basis of its wasteful cost. It is absurd that while Liberals underfund the RCMP, leaving almost one-third of cybercrime positions vacant, they are proposing to dump $200 million and hire 300 staff for a vague new bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556791">Canadians are rightly concerned. In this digital age, we must strike a balance between protecting individuals from harmful content and safeguarding their rights. That is why the Conservative Party is committed to delivering common-sense solutions that would protect our children and ensure their safety online without compromising the freedoms we hold dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556792">The bottom line is that Canadians are living in fear due to online harassment and it is costing lives. They need real protection, not more Liberal delays and incompetence. The Liberals should adopt the common-sense solutions in Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document> or call an immediate election and let Canadians choose real, immediate protections or another costly Liberal censorship scheme.</ParaText>

We do have the hate speech component. The problem is that we already have laws that clearly govern hate speech in this country, which have been the laws for several decades.

              <ParaText id="8556826">Mr. Speaker, since I was interrupted twice during the beginning of my speech, I will start from the top.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556827">I am here today to talk about this very important bill on online harms and how it conveys what the online world translates into real, lived experiences for so many people across Canada. I was part of the justice committee when it started a study on online harms and hate crimes and how they translate to lived realities. I have seen first-hand, in my nine years as a member of Parliament, people being shot down in mosques and victimized in synagogues because of significant hateful rhetoric being pushed online and right-wing organizations targeting LGBT communities, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556828">This bill would have a very significant role to play in how we conduct ourselves as a country. The hon. member before me talked about the role of enforcement. We are talking about federal policy. We are talking about how we at the federal level can improve our legislation to make sure that Canadians are kept safe. All we can do is encourage our premiers to pick up the mantle and ensure that our communities are being kept safe and that laws are being enforced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556829">I will speak about two specific things in the Criminal Code. It is an enormous shame that the measures proposed by Bill <Document DbId="12913297 " Type=" 3 ">C‑63</Document> have been subject to significant misinformation and disinformation. I am extremely disappointed in the reaction of the official opposition to this critical legislation, having seen what has transpired because of online hate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556830">When the bill was put on notice but before the actual text was publicly available, we saw the Conservatives reject it immediately. They had no regard for its substance, no regard for the years of consultation with victims and with survivors of abuse, and no regard for the countless organizations that are begging the government to do more about exploitation and hatred, online and in the real world. Canadians deserve a lot better than this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556831">I am proud to support Bill <Document DbId="12913297 " Type=" 3 ">C‑63</Document>. I would like to go through some of the myths that have been circulated about the part of the bill that deals with hatred specifically. I will be explaining why I think these are unfounded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556832">Let us start with the proposed hate crime offence. It would make it an indictable offence to commit an offence in the Criminal Code or any other act of Parliament where the offence is motivated by hatred. It would have a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. This is a maximum punishment, not a minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556833">There are two important reasons for creating this specific hate crime offence. First, it would appropriately denounce the harm caused by hate crimes. Second, it would assist with data collection on hate crimes in Canada. Currently, a judge can apply the provision on hate as an aggravating factor in the Criminal Code to help determine a sentence, but the underlying offence is not categorized, for statistical purposes, as a hate crime. If this proposed hate crime offence is enacted, statistics on hate crimes would allow governments, law enforcement and victims to better understand how hate crimes are being charged, how they are being prosecuted and how they are being addressed by the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556834">Some have expressed concerns that the availability of life imprisonment as a penalty could result in unjust and misappropriate sentencing outcomes. I would like to explain why those concerns are misplaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556835">First, the law in Canada requires judges to impose a just sentence that is proportional to the seriousness of the offence and the offender's blameworthiness. Second, a maximum sentence represents just that: the highest possible sentence, to be imposed only in the most serious of cases. It acts as a ceiling for a range of sentences, with judges being required to impose an appropriate one depending on the seriousness of the crime and the responsibility of the offender.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556836"> Maximum penalties of any kind are, by their very nature, imposed very rarely, taking into account principles of sentencing as applied on a case-by-case basis. As a result, life imprisonment would only be appropriate in the most serious of cases, notably for Criminal Code offences that are already punishable by maximum life imprisonment, such as aggravated assault and sexual assault.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556842">Mr. Speaker, it seems like people do not really want to hear what I have to say, but we can count apparently. However, I am quite honoured to stand here to speak about this bill, because it is so important to communities like mine and to people like me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556843">As I was saying, another criticism that is made against the proposed hate crime offence is that it is too broad and would potentially apply to every offence in the Criminal Code and any other act of Parliament. However, this is not a novel approach for offences in the Criminal Code. For example, section 83.2 makes it an offence to commit an indictable offence in that act or any other act of Parliament “for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a terrorist group”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556844">While the proposed hate crime offence is not restricted to indictable offences, which are considered to be more serious, there is a good reason for the difference. It is to ensure that the offence can apply to all hate crime offences, many of which can be prosecuted as summary conviction offences rather than indictable offences. Specifically, the 2022 statistics for police-reported hate crime in Canada show that the largest number, which is 54%, were non-violent crimes, and of these, the majority were general mischief offences. However, 46% of crimes were violent offences, including the offence of uttering threats and common assault. Mischief, uttering threats and common assault can all be prosecuted as indictable or summary offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556845"> Just as indictable and hybrid offences in the Criminal Code should be potentially caught by the proposed hate crime offence, so too should offences where they are found in other acts of Parliament. Some have expressed concern that this would result in trivial offences being included. However, that would not happen. First, it would likely be a rare case where a trivial crime in another act of Parliament would be hate-motivated. Second, what might seem to be a trivial offence on its own could be significant when coupled with the disproportionate harm caused by hate crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556846">I will also emphasize that other acts of Parliament are not limited to trivial offences. For example, subsection 112(1) of the Firearms Act prohibits advertising a firearm in a manner that promotes violence against a person. It is a hybrid offence that, if prosecuted by way of indictment, carries a maximum punishment of two years for the first offence or five years for the second offence or subsequent offences. The new hate crime offence would capture this offence if motivated by hatred, whether it is prosecuted as a summary or an indictable offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556847">I can carry on with the technicalities of this bill, but I realize that I am running out of time. I do want to say that it is up to us to ensure that the legislative framework exists and that we partner with our provincial counterparts to ensure that it is being enforced. At the same time, we as parliamentarians have an obligation in this House to ensure that we ourselves are not inciting hatred and that we are conducting ourselves in a manner that is becoming of the multicultural society that Canada is. Recently, I have not seen that happen. I have seen some tropes, whether they are about incels, against women or against trans, gay, Muslim or Jewish communities. This bill would go a really long way to ensuring that we are setting the framework for what is a strong, united Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556848"> When I first moved to Canada, back when I was 11 years old, I wondered how Canada was such a peaceful country. It is not just because we have rules and regulations, but also because we have an ability to work together to ensure that we take care of one another. It is a constant battle. It is a constant piece of work for which we need to continue to build bridges, and this bill is one of them.</ParaText>

Our government will stop at nothing to ensure that kids in this country are safe, and this includes their online safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556873">Our children spend many hours of their day watching online videos, chatting with their friends and posting snippets of their lives. Being online is integral to their lives and offers many benefits. It is a way for them to connect, learn and find entertainment. However, the online space is not always safe for children. We have rigorous toy standards to ensure that Canadian kids do not get hurt while playing. The Internet is the most complex and riskiest toy ever invented. It must have its own safety standards to protect kids from the harms embedded within social media platforms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556874">For too long, we have tolerated a system where social media platforms have off-loaded their responsibilities onto parents, expecting them to protect their kids from harms that platforms create and amplify. Until now, there have been no safety regulations for online platforms. Parents and kids do not know where to turn to get help when things go wrong online. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556875">The bill would create a baseline standard for online platforms to keep Canadians safe. It would hold platforms accountable for the content they host. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556876">Over the last several years, we have conducted extensive public consultations. A common theme that was heard was the vulnerability of children online and the pressing need to take steps to protect them. At the same time, the consultations highlighted a desire for a flexible, risk-based approach to online regulation. Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> would balance these two objectives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556877">I am disappointed to see the Conservatives discredit the hard work of the organizers, victims and survivors across the country who were consulted on the legislation. By refusing to support the bill, they are rejecting this experience and the reality of today's world that children are not currently safe online. The bill was meticulously created to keep Canadians safe while ensuring that their rights are maintained. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556878">The online harms act introduces a new duty to protect children. It requires platforms to integrate design features that protect children on their platforms and report on the measures they are taking to protect children. The specific design features will be identified following open regulatory processes where all interested parties have a chance to be heard. This would ensure that the measures are fit for purpose and consider the latest research and evidence, as well as that they are workable for the social media services that need to implement them. We believe this approach to protecting children respects the government's position of supporting a safe and inclusive digital space in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556879">The online harms act would require operators of social media services to integrate design features that protect children, such as age-appropriate design. Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> does not opt for a prescriptive approach requiring the use of a specific technology, such as age verification; instead, it opts for a principle-based approach that can evolve with technology. The goal of age-appropriate design is to make the online user experience of children safer by decreasing the risk that they will encounter harmful content. This might include design features such as parental controls, default settings related to warning labels on content and safe search settings. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556880">Age-appropriate design is useful because it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It recognizes that a five-year-old and a 16-year-old interact with the online world differently, so they likely require different design features to improve the safety of their online experience. The digital safety commission would articulate these features through regulations after examining industry practices and available technology, as well as engaging with stakeholders and Canadians. This process would ensure that the subsequent regulations on design features that protect children are well-informed and in line with Canadians' expectations of privacy and digital expression. </ParaText>

At each step, we made design choices with freedom of expression top of mind. Under the online harms act, the risk-based approach is anchored in a duty to act responsibly that requires platforms to create safer spaces online so that users are less likely to encounter harmful content. The duty to act seeks to ensure that we have in place adequate systems by services that limit the likelihood of users viewing harmful content. </ParaText>

The bill would amend the mandatory reporting act to strengthen reporting obligations under the act to help facilitate child pornography investigations. The bill would allow for the centralization of reporting to a single law enforcement body, a response to a long-time ask from law enforcement and child advocates.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556897"> Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the people of Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry in our part of eastern Ontario. In this case it is to contribute to the debate going on today on Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, known to many Canadians, through the media or the debate on the bill, as the online harms bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556898">I want to take the time I have today to lay out a case to Canadians that I think is getting clearer by the month and the year. After nine years of the NDP and the Liberals in office, crime is up significantly in this country. It is their record and it is their actions, or in some cases inactions, that have undone what was successful in keeping our streets safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556899">When we looked at the metrics by Stats Canada before the Liberals came into office, we see that crime was decreasing across the country. After nine years of their legislation, their bills, their ideas and their policy proposals, here is what Stats Canada says is the record of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the NDP and the Liberals working together: Violent crime has increased 50% in this country. Homicides are not down; they are up 28%. Sexual assaults are up by 75%, and gang murders have nearly doubled in this country over the course of the last nine years. A crime wave has been unleashed across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556900">I make the case. Sadly, now there is not one part of this country, a province or a region, that has not heard the stories in local media or by word of mouth in communities of crime going up: violent crime, robberies, theft and car theft. Auto theft is up 46%. The <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>'s own car in fact has been stolen three times. That is how bad crime has gotten under the Liberals' watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556901">Extortion has exploded in this country under the Liberals' watch. It is up 357%. This side of the aisle, through our deputy leader from Edmonton, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278483" Type="2">Edmonton Mill Woods</Affiliation>, proposed a private member's bill that would crack down and toughen up on Canadians who try to extort others. I would suggest that when there is a 357% increase, the status quo of whatever the Liberals are doing is not working. We proposed a common-sense private member's bill from this side of the aisle that was voted down, only to continue the status quo by the Liberals and NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556902">Recently, through our work in asking questions, we finally got some answers. The Liberal government was forced to admit that 256 people were killed in 2022 alone by criminals out on bail or another form of release. It is unacceptable and speaks to the many broken policies that the government has implemented in the last nine years. It is not by accident.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556903">The province of Ontario paints a picture when it comes to the Liberals' public safety record. In Ontario, the total number of violent Criminal Code violations is up 51% to 164,723. Homicides in Ontario are up 50% to 262. Total violent firearms offences, for all the action the Liberals have claimed to have taken, and I will get to that in a bit, is up to 1,346. That is a 97% increase in violent firearms offences in Ontario alone. Extortion is up 383% in Ontario, at just under 4,000 cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556904">Theft of a motor vehicle has gone up. When the Liberals came in, there were 16,600 vehicle thefts in Ontario. It has exploded 167%. Now, under their watch with their soft-on-crime approach, including Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and so forth, it is up to 44,459 thefts of a motor vehicle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556905">That is the Liberals' record. Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> was passed and implemented by the Liberals and the NDP, who implemented catch-and-release bail policies. Despite the legislation demanded by Conservatives and by every premier in this country, it did not go far enough, and Bill C-75 is still wreaking havoc on our law enforcement and on public safety in this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556906">Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> passed, again by the Liberals and the NDP and supported by the Bloc in that case, I specifically remember as well. When it started to be implemented and Canadians saw the wacko examples of criminals of a violent, repeat nature being arrested and back out on the streets, the Bloc members tried to pretend they were not for it anymore, but they voted for Bill C-5. That bill removed mandatory minimum sentences for major crimes, ensuring again that violent criminals are out on the streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556907"> After all those numbers I took the time to lay out, that is the Liberals' record. They cannot go back and blame anybody else, but for the last nine years that the Liberals have been in office, it has been their government legislation that has allowed the crime wave to be unleashed across Canada, and here we have a <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> who is touting how great the Liberals' latest solution is with Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556908"> Rightfully, Canadians have major distrust in the current government. Its record on public safety speaks for itself by the numbers and the examples that people are living and breathing. However, it was the current <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>, on his first days on the job, who did a media interview and said he thought it was empirically unlikely Canada is becoming less safe. He said it is in people's minds; it is in their heads and is not really a problem. People are just envisioning that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556909">That just goes to show the mindset and perspective when it comes to public safety, to protecting our streets and getting the violent crime wave down in this country. That is the perspective: It is just all in our heads and there is nothing to think about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556910"> I have mentioned Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. The debate today is actually timely because it was just last week that we got an updated answer. Four years ago, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did a big stunt of a photo op and an announcement that he was going to ban assault rifles; he was going to clamp down and resolve all of this by way of the Liberals' legislation and their will. Well, the numbers are out. Four years later, after saying that, zero firearms from criminals are off our streets, and the only winner in this is the bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556911">Sixty-seven million dollars of taxpayer money has been spent on a program that is not even running, not even active and has taken precisely zero firearms from criminals and gang members off our streets in this country. That is the Liberals' record. Worst of all is that we know what the Liberals are proposing to do and the reason there are all the delays. They are rightfully being called out that it will not affect the gang members and those involved in criminal enterprises who are committing the car thefts, violent crimes and firearms offences in big cities, suburbs and rural communities alike. They are not going to be participating in this terrible program, this costly, useless program, frankly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556912">The Liberals are targeting law-abiding firearm owners, hunters, sport shooters and indigenous communities that follow the law and have never been a public safety issue. They are going to be the ones paying the price on this, and it is taxpayer money, $67 million alone, going out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556913">One of the things I have said to many folks in our part of eastern Ontario and in my travels across the country is that there are not too many prerequisites to becoming a member of Parliament and sitting in the chamber. Members are democratically elected, which is obviously the right way to go. However, I feel if there were a little asterisk of what every member of Parliament must do before debating or voting on public safety legislation such as this, it would be that the member should do a ride-along with the frontline law enforcement in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556914">We are very blessed in Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry to have the OPP, the Cornwall community police, a force in Akwesasne and the RCMP. One of the most rewarding events or annual visits I make is to those detachments, getting in a vehicle with a frontline law enforcement member and seeing first-hand and on the front lines what they have to go through day in and day out.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556915">Officers are extremely frustrated after nine years of a soft-on-crime approach, a broken justice system, a broken bail system and a Liberal government that continues to make life easier for those criminals of a repeat violent nature, which takes valuable police resources and time away from important things. Instead, they are repeatedly arresting and re-arresting many of the same folks despite being out on bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556916">I raise that today because under the Liberals watch and the broken bail system, where repeat violent offenders are back out on the streets within about 24 hours, on average, police are being redirected and dealing with the same percentage. The Vancouver Police Department said that in one year there were 6,000 police interactions, many of them arrests of the same 40 or 50 people. This means that every other day there was an interaction, an arrest, a bail hearing and back out on the street. That is a waste of police resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556917">How much longer will it take? How many more calls from the Conservatives, premiers and law enforcement agencies will it take to fix our broken bail system? Instead, today, when we talk about the broad terms of protecting folk online, protecting children, or cracking down on Internet child pornography as the bill states, the basis of this legislation is admitting failure on the part of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556918">Our court system and existing law enforcement resources are so overloaded with the increase in crime, the broken justice system and the broken bail system, that now the government is proposing a brand new federal bureaucracy, with hundreds and hundreds of federal bureaucrats, to administer what it says cannot be done through existing means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556919"> If we were able to go back to common sense, the way it was before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government came into office, we could revert and allow law enforcement and, in many cases, our existing laws to be enforced and protect Canadians, protect children, families, victims of child pornography, victims of all ages, and clamp down on the rising hate crime numbers happening under the government's watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556920"> I correlate it again to the government's record. We had legislation a couple of years ago passed under its watch, Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, an act to amend the Broadcasting Act, which I basically called a censorship act, where the government would hire hundreds of new bureaucrats at the CRTC to watch and regulate the algorithms of Internet searches in Canada. At that time, the Liberals said not to worry, that it was not that big of a deal, that it would not cost that much. It is getting very expensive, and they are just getting started in the cost of the bureaucracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556921">I am proud of our common-sense Conservative team on this side. Very early on, when the government came forward with Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, we asked the Parliamentary Budget Officer to look at what the cost of this proposal would be, an independent look to understand the true cost to administer the government's proposal. A little while ago the analysis came forward. Posted on the website, the Parliamentary Budget Officer found that would cost a staggering $200 million to establish, the government's own data provided to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, 330 new bureaucrats and a brand new bureaucracy to administer this. When does this madness stop?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556922">The Liberals keep adding new bureaucracies, new commissions and new layers, but they do not tackle the problem we have in our existing justice system and law enforcement community. Whether it be the RCMP, a provincial force or local municipal force, they are stretched thin because of the broken policies that the government has implemented. Now its proposal is to separate all that into a new bureaucracy. Worst of all, when asked, there is no time frame. A lot of the regulations and details of what it is proposing will be dealt with later, of course, behind closed doors. A lack of transparency and details, that is what the Liberals are providing to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8556923"> We know how Ottawa works. We know how the Liberals work with the NDP. They make a great, big announcement of how wonderful the legislation would be and that it would solve every problem possible. They never follow through, it is never done cost-effectively and it is delay after delay, and more and more frustration and backlog. We will see the exact same thing when it comes to the new bureaucracy proposed under Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>. For context, if we took the $200 million and invested in frontline law enforcement, if we hired more police officers, we could hire over 200 more per year to work the front lines each and every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556924">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278248" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, who has been on the file of protecting women, children and all Canadians and victims of child pornography, of exposing intimate images and, in many cases, new emerging technologies of deepfakes and AI. We need to realize that this legislation is inadequate for many reasons. She, our shadow minister for justice and the Attorney General of Canada, and many other colleagues with a law enforcement background in the legal community have spoken up against the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556925">As Conservatives, we have said that, as always, the Liberals get it wrong again. They claim that we should pass this, get it to committee and just be fine with it, because for four years they have consulted experts in the field. They have tabled legislation before that they had to pull because they got it wrong. There are still many voices in the country speaking up against the bill in its current form and what it would do on the infringement of free speech. The Liberals are making decisions through regulation, through back-channel means and behind closed doors, putting the power in the hands of way too many people who do not deserve it, for example, Meta, Facebook, other tech companies that have these massive lobbying efforts they can use to pressure this new bureaucracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556926">Instead, our common-sense Conservative private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="13241813" Type="4">C-412</Document>, would enforce the existing laws in the country when it comes to hate crimes. The laws are there, but the government lacks the political will use those tools. If we are going to modernize legislation, which it does need at times, we could go after AI and deepfakes, which is not even addressed in Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>.</ParaText>

We can look at other legislation such as their firearms confiscation program of law-abiding hunters and anglers who own firearms and so many other pieces of legislation. We can look at the Liberals' own numbers. The longer they are in office, the more they spend and the worse it gets from a financial situation, but, most important, from a public safety perspective.</ParaText>

The number of victims have skyrocketed under their watch. When he is talking to law enforcement officers who say they are overwhelmed and need more tools, it is because of the decisions the Liberals have made to be soft on crime, to have a revolving catch-and-release bail system. Being soft on crime and not following through using our existing laws is why law enforcement is being overwhelmed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556935">Let us be clear about what law enforcement officers want. They want the tools to do what they have done for decades, generations and centuries, in many cases, which is to be the front line of law enforcement and have the resources to go after criminals themselves. They do not want a 330-person, $200-million a year bureaucracy that will backlog everything. They want the resources themselves. They want some common sense from the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>, so maybe he can realize, after his car was stolen three times, that the Liberals' existing policy, their existing framework and all the things they have done in nine years have made the problem worse for law enforcement.

The NDP continued to vote confidence and to vote as part of their coalition with the Liberals for many years. Bill C-11 was an example of all these things that it was going to solve. There is the firearms confiscation program that actually does not target violent criminals. The Liberals spent $67 million and got nothing done. It has been all talk, no action.</ParaText>

It means an emotion that involves “detestation or vilification”. A message that “discredits, humiliates, hurts or offends” another, no matter how unpleasant that message might be, does not meet this high bar.

              <ParaText id="8556971">The bill will also amend the Criminal Code to create a new peace bond to prevent the commission of hate propaganda offences and hate crimes.

The maximum sentence will be life imprisonment. This offence will recognize the serious harm caused by offences motivated by hate — harm to victims, harm to their community and harm to Canadian democracy in general.

              <ParaText id="8556974">I strongly support this proposed change. It would respond to repeated calls for stronger hate crime laws in the Criminal Code. It would send a clear message that the government, and indeed all parliamentarians, strongly condemn and denounce any crime committed with a hate motive. Quite simply, harming others out of hatred has no place in our society and our laws should reflect this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556975">It would also allow us to better understand and address hate-motivated crimes by allowing better identification and tracking of individual offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556976"> Finally, I turn to the amendments outside the criminal law. This bill proposes amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act that would empower individuals and groups to obtain effective remedies against other users who post hate speech online. An improved section 13 of the CHRA would provide that it is a discriminatory practice to communicate hate speech online. Complaints would be filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which would screen them out of or into the process under the Canadian Human Rights Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556977">Respondents might recognize at this point that the content was hate speech and take it down. Otherwise, the commission would decide whether to send a complaint for adjudication to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. After a fair hearing, if the tribunal upheld the complaint, it would order the respondent to remove the hate speech. In special cases, the tribunal would be able to order compensation to victims personally identified in the hate speech and may award a monetary penalty, if needed, to ensure compliance with the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556978">In any event, the purpose of the CHRA is not to punish but to remedy. Section 13 is not criminal law and it does not establish an offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556979">Some members may recall that Parliament repealed an older version of section 13 of the CHRA a decade ago. That repeal took away an important tool for combatting hate speech online. In that time, we have seen why Canadians need this tool. We consulted widely to understand the perceived problems with the former section 13. As a result, these amendments include a number of improvements. Specifically, “hate speech” is now clearly defined and the commission would rapidly dismiss complaints that do not satisfy this definition. Complainants and witnesses may be given confidentiality where needed in order to protect them from reprisals. Further, the tribunal would have more control over litigants who abuse the process.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8556980">These amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act provide effective recourse in individual cases of hate speech, alongside the more systematic regulation of social media platforms under the online harms act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8556981">I would like to conclude my speech by pointing out that this bill also addresses the extremely worrying cybercrime of child pornography. In 2011, Canada passed An Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service. This bill will modernize that legislation to respond to the rapid societal and technological changes that impact how child pornography is created and distributed. Among other things, the law will clearly stipulate that it also applies to social media and apps.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557025"> Still hard at work, Mr. Binet's mastery of his craft is exceptional. His passion for shoemaking began when he was young. Over time, his shop became a true institution, serving clients from every corner of Mauricie. His business eventually expanded to include sewing and upholstery services along with a retail shoe store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557026">The people of Trois-Rivières feel privileged to have such a passionate, skilled craftsman as Mr. Binet in their midst. His unmatched interpersonal skills make every visit a unique and memorable experience. I recently asked him why he had not retired. He told me that if he retired, there would be no one left to make shoes. That was a good answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557027">I am extremely proud to honour Carol Binet's outstanding achievements. I congratulate him not only on his career, but also for being a shining example of resilience and perseverance. I thank him for everything he has done for the people of Trois-Rivières.</ParaText>

The fact that the report failed to disclose these members' identities raised questions and cast a pall over the entire House. As evidence to this, the member reported that on the street in front of Parliament, individuals were, “shouting, questioning and jeering [at the members of Parliament] about who the traitors may be.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557238">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege regarding the ongoing failure and refusal of a witness to provide documents requested by the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. The committee, under Standing Order 122, has the authority to summon witnesses and compel the production of documents, rights that are essential to the functioning of Parliament, as outlined in the Constitution Act of 1867. These powers are fundamental to our ability to conduct inquiries and obtain the truth, as noted in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, page 137.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557239">The witness in question, Stephen Anderson, a business partner of the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation>, was ordered by the committee on June 11 to produce phone records, text messages and call logs from September 8, 2022, but he failed to comply. Despite his appearance on July 17, Mr. Anderson provided non-responsive documents and refused to disclose the identity of the person referred to as Randy in key communications.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557240">This blatant disregard for the committee's orders violates Standing Order 108(1)(a), which empowers committees to access documents relative to their inquiries. The committee extended the deadline to July 19, yet Mr. Anderson continued to withhold the requested information. According to <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, when a witness refuses to comply, the committee may report the matter to the House, which then has the authority to enforce compliance. The committee has now done its part by adopting a motion on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557241">As <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> makes clear at page 138, when a witness resists a request for documents, it is up to the House to take appropriate action. Given Mr. Anderson's failure and refusal to comply with both the June 11 and July 19 orders, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to recognize this as a prima facie breach of privilege that could amount to contempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557242">New Democrats believe Mr. Anderson to be in contempt, and the House shall force him to answer for his actions, as well as deliver the documents he refused to produce. The House must uphold the authority to protect our parliamentary privilege in order to ensure accountability and transparency in all matters of government oversight before its standing committees.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557251">It is easy to look at food prices in the grocery store and blame the big grocers for the high cost of food, but blaming them does not get to the root cause of the problem and why food has become so expensive. The bottom line is that the NDP-Liberal government's policies and regulations are driving up the cost of food and the cost for farmers to produce food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557252">We have heard this time and time again, and I am not afraid to say it again, and I will say it as many times as I need to, that the Conservatives will axe the tax. However, in the meantime, we need to pass Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, unamended, and give farmers a reprieve from the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557253">I will give members an idea of why the carbon tax impacts the cost of food so much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557254">If we look at the supply chain from start to finish, every single step along that supply chain is facing increased costs, which can be related directly back to the carbon tax. Sometimes they are paying multiple times in carbon tax. For instance, farmers have to pay for fertilizer, and we are getting taxed right now on fertilizer. How does the fertilizer get from the fertilizer company to the field? It is trucked. We use trucks for everything in the country in order to get things from wherever it needs to be, from the farm or back to the field or from the field back to the farm. When we increase the cost of fuel for these trucks, which are not exempt from the carbon tax or from any fuel taxes for that matter, it is absolutely going to increase the cost of the production.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557255">However, we should not believe everything the Liberals tell us, or when we hear that farmers are exempt from taxes on their farm fuel. There is a slight bit of truth to that, but for the most part, on modern farms today, we are not using just tractors anymore. Yes, tractors are exempt and any equipment that does not use a roadway is exempt. However, from experience on my own farm, we use transport trucks to get the potatoes from the field back to the farm to the packing house. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557256">If we look at the prairies, farmers have to truck grain from the field back to the farm to put it in the bins for storage. What is the most economical way to get products from the field back to the farm for storage? It is using big transport trucks and taking less loads from the field back to the farm. It saves on fuel, first, and it save on costs. However, when those trucks are not exempt from the carbon tax, or any taxes for that matter, it increases the cost for doing business for farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557257"> What is the end result of that? Farmers cannot eat up all those costs. It comes off their bottom line. It comes off what they would have as extra income to invest back into their farming operations. Of course, those costs are going to get passed on to the next part in the chain, whether that is direct to the consumer or direct to a wholesaler. In my instance, I have to increase my costs. When my costs go up, I have to recoup those costs as I cannot afford to eat them. At the end of the day, consumers and Canadians at the grocery store are going to pay more because of the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557258">If folks are watching and they are from a city, they may not know where their food comes from. Out on the prairies, the fields can be 10 to 80 kilometres away from the home farm. For instance, some of our farms are 80 to 100 kilometres away from the home farm. We have no choice but to truck the goods from those fields back to the farm. Even if a farm is 10 kilometres away from the home farm, to go 10 times a day back and forth is 100 kilometres driven. Imagine how much fuel is being consumed on just transporting food from point A to point B at the farm gate, and I am not talking beyond the farm gate here. Therefore, the cost of that carbon tax on truckers is immense, and it is immense for the farmers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557259"> If we tax the farmer who grows the food and tax the trucker who ships the food, Canadians are the ones who are going to pay more for the food. It is common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557260">One of the other policies the NDP-Liberal government has put forward that will greatly impact the cost of food is its ban on plastics for fresh produce. I have talked about this in the House before, but it is worth talking about again because this would have such a profound impact on the fresh food we eat. Two-thirds of the produce Canadians eat is imported from other countries, and if we ban plastic on produce, we will see a 34% increase in the cost of fresh produce in this country, on top of what we are already seeing as high costs for food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557261">It will also reduce the availability of fresh produce to Canadians by over 50%. Members can imagine 50% less choice in the grocery store for Canadians. It will cost the industry $5.6 billion. On top of this, it will have a 50% increase in greenhouse gases on the produce supply chain because of rotting produce. It is also going to increase CO2 emissions from the rotting produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557262">I would like to say that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278501" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation> today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557263">When we talk about the 50% increase in greenhouse gases from rotting produce, that does not include the increased transportation costs to truck more food and have more trucks on the road going to grocery stores because we are going to need more food. It is going to increase the health care costs by over $1 billion per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557264">Back in my riding and across the country, when I have talked to folks, I have talked to moms who have told me they have no choice but to cut back on the food they are buying for their families. They have to find somewhere to slash their budgets. I talked to one mom in particular who told me she could not afford to buy any out-of-season produce anymore. She is only be able to afford what is on sale at the grocery store for produce and will have to buy bigger quantities. Her kids will have to go without fresh food because she cannot afford it anymore. That is terrible. We must think of the increased cost to our health this is going to have when parents cannot afford to buy nutritious food for their children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557265"> Another factor we need to take into account when considering why our prices are going to go up is the fact that the majority of Canadians live in rural and remote communities. I have had the privilege and honour, for the last five years, of representing Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, which is a completely rural community. I have travelled to rural communities across this country, including up into the north, into Whitehorse and Yukon, and there is a real issue when it comes to food insecurity and the price of food. If we see trucking costs go up, and we see less production and less availability of fresh produce, how are these people, who live in rural remote communities, going to be able to access nutritious food? They are going to have a hard time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557266">The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimates that the cost of this plastics ban will add $1.9 billion in customer costs. Nationwide, we stand to lose 60,000 jobs. We also hear that insurance rates are up due to vehicle thefts, break-ins and damages, and farmers have to pay higher insurance rates because of this. Vehicle insurance rates in Canada are up over 6% year over year. I have had some constituents tell me their insurance rates have doubled in some areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557267">If we look at the whole supply chain and all the things farmers have to do to run their business, and if the costs are up everywhere, of course food costs are going to be up. Farmers have no choice but to pass these costs on down the line, and then every step along the supply chain has price increases and they need to be passed on. The result is Canadians having to pay more for food from the store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557268">Here is another piece of common sense: no farms equals no food. Government red tape is up. Insurance costs are up. Heating costs are up. Grain drying costs are up. Taxes are up. Crime is up. Time is up. Conservatives will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime, and we will bring down food prices for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557293">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to join the debate today on the concurrence of the 18th report of the Standing Committee of Agriculture and Agri-Food on food price inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557294"> I find it very strange that the Liberal member would talk about tying up the House's time on things he thinks are not important. When I was in my riding of Regina—Lewvan and our communities all summer, one of the major topics was the price of food and how it is getting harder to make ends meet each day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557295">We know that taxes are up, costs are up, crime is up and time is up. It is time to have these discussions, and it is time for a carbon tax election. That is what Canadians want. Seventy per cent of Canadians think that the carbon tax should be axed. It is one of the major reasons costs are going up at our grocery stores.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557296"> We saw this in some of the comments made at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. As a member of the committee, I was able to partake in the meetings. Some of the comments especially focused on the carbon tax. One such comment was made by Mr. Ron Lemaire of the Canadian Produce Marketing Association. He reported that the greenhouse vegetable sector, for example, estimates that the carbon tax will have an annual cost on his operations of $22 million this year. This amount is projected to increase to as much as $100 million by 2030. What do members think that does to the price of vegetables in our grocery stores, if that is the cost being incurred by our vegetable growers across our country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557297"> Another comment was made by Mr. Keith Currie of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. He noted that the carbon tax accounts for as much as 40% of energy bills in some agricultural sectors. He called for a time-limited and targeted exemption; he would like to see an exemption from the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557298"> Another thing that a lot of stakeholders talked about in our committee was the fact that they would love to see Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> passed, and that is the exemption from the carbon tax for heating barns for grain drying. This is something that our producers desperately need. Mr. Currie went on to say something about the mental health of our producers; the member from <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> also talked about this. Can we imagine having to pay a bill that is ever-increasing and would eventually take millions of dollars out of our pockets? That is the pressure that our agriculture producers are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557299">One thing needing to be mentioned is that many members on the Conservative side come from family farms. The member who just spoke has family that has been in agriculture for generations. I grew up on a dairy and beef farm, and I have cousins who still ranch. These are not just random numbers. These are our family members and our constituents. That is why this is so important to the members on this side of the House, to the Conservative members of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557300"> For a Liberal to say that this is just fluff and does not matter, that it is just a tactic, is actually quite insulting to the men and women who produce our food and put food on the table. The member should apologize for that comment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557301">I want to talk about the pressure that our men and women are facing in agriculture. What this brings to the forefront is that it is not just the carbon tax. As I hear all the time, it is also a tax on the tax. It is the GST being paid by our producers on top of the carbon tax. The PBO has done some reports on this, which say that $486 million in GST will be paid on the carbon tax. By 2030, $1 billion a year will be paid just in GST on the carbon tax. The carbon tax is going to blow a $30-billion to $40-billion hole in our economy, and the agriculture sector is going to account for the lion's share of that money. There is pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557302">My colleague said it well, and it is worth repeating: If we tax the farmer who produces the food, the trucker who buys the food and the stores that sell the food, it only stands to reason that we are going to tax each and every Canadian who goes to the store and buys the food. This is what as common sense would indicate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557303">That is the point we are trying to get at. We know that the sellout NDP members have voted for the carbon tax 24 times. Because they were in trouble in the Elmwood—Transcona by-election, the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> had a come-to-Jesus moment and said, “No, we are not against the carbon tax.” Now he says that they want to vote against it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557304"> Now we are going to see another flip-flop because the NDP eked out a win in one of its seven safest seats in Canada, where I think they lost 20 points. That flip-flop was strictly to play politics to try to fool Canadians, just like the ripping up of the supply and confidence agreement. Can members believe that? It is two flip-flops in two days. I am surprised the hon. NDP leader did not pull something. First he was for the government and then he was against the government, and on Wednesday he will be for the government again. It is hard to keep track. Now the NDP in B.C. is also against the carbon tax. It is unbelievable how many times people have changed their minds on the carbon tax over the last week in NDP land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557305"> I have a great deal of respect for the men and women in our agriculture sector. They do the hard work of feeding Canadians and feeding the world. One thing we hear from some of the Liberal members on the agriculture committee is that we need to do more. Why do some of the Liberal and NDP members on this committee not give the agriculture sector credit for what it has done so well already? Saskatchewan, which has done so much to create environmental sustainability in the agriculture sector, uses rotational grazing for cattle and crop rotation, with different crops taking out different nutrients from the soil. Western Canada pioneered that. We have also done great work when it comes to zero tillage and straight head combining, where there is less machinery on the field.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557306">There have been so many innovations that we should be proud of as the Canadians who represent the men and women in the agriculture sector, and we should take them to the world. Imagine exporting our great agricultural practices to other countries around the world so they catch up. That would lower world emissions. If we want to tackle environmental sustainability, we should talk about some of the good things we are doing on the world stage instead of always acting like we should be embarrassed by our agriculture and energy sectors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557307">We know that right now we do not have any champions for agriculture in the current government. We have talked about this many times in Saskatchewan, where agriculture is still the backbone of the economy. Why is it that every time Liberals come into government, their agriculture minister sits at the kids' table?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557308">We know that one of the biggest problems with the government's ag policy is that it is being made in the health and environment departments, not in the agriculture department. It is being made by people who have never been on a farm. That is why we see continuous increases, whether it is in red tape, taxes or policies, like wanting to reduce fertilizer use by 35%. Do members know how much that is going to lower yields for our producers? Talk about putting more mental strain on them. We are hand-tying them on what they do best by telling them what they can and cannot put on their fields. That is reminiscent of socialist Russia, which I think some members in the Liberals would enjoy seeing. The activist <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> has said that he is a proud socialist. He would love to tell agriculture producers what they should and should not be doing with their own land. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557309">To address how we can lower food prices immediately, we can axe the tax and make sure no one is paying a tax on a tax by taking GST off the carbon tax. We can allow our producers to use technology and the great practices of farming, not tie their hands by telling them how much fertilizer to put on their fields. First and foremost, what we need is a common-sense Conservative government that will not have an ag minister sitting at the kids' table and that will bring policy forward that helps instead of hurts our producers. That is what the Conservatives will deliver to Canadians when we have the carbon tax election that 70% of Canadians want.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557336">Today, the Conservatives brought forward this motion for concurrence to talk about farmers, the carbon rebate and interest in regard to the price on food. I find it interesting that they have chosen to debate that today. If my memory serves me correctly, I cannot recall once when the Conservative Party of Canada, the far right, thought this issue was important enough to bring forward to the House for debate on an opposition day. We have had dozens of opposition days, and not once have the Conservatives raised the issue that is the focus of the concurrence report.</ParaText>

If any of the Conservatives have the courage to debate me in any university or other post-secondary facility, I would welcome it, just to show how abusive the Conservatives are when we are trying to be there in a very real and tangible way for Canadians. In fact, the Conservatives have had two members speak about the report. They are the ones who thought it was so important to debate this report. However, did either member who spoke even make reference to the response to the report that was provided by the department and the minister? No. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557366"> The Conservative Party tries to give the impression that it actually cares and wants to see action taken on the issue of food pricing. Let us do a comparison between Stephen Harper or the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>, and the government of today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557367">We have five major grocery chains in Canada. We used to have six. The reason we went from six to five is that the Stephen Harper government allowed Shoppers to be joined with one of the big five. Now we have a government that changed the Competition Act, in part to ensure more accountability with those types of company takeovers, protecting the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557368">The Conservatives might have good talking points. They might have some great slogans and bumper stickers, but the reality is, and history clearly shows it, that they are quite incompetent. In fact, when we take a look at their policy, we find that it is wanting. They talk about the carbon rebate and the carbon tax, and they are saying—</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557369">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557370">
                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Madam Speaker, I am talking about the carbon rebate and the carbon tax, and they are talking about relevance. They should listen to what their speakers had to say. That was 50% of what they spoke on. Really, they should get a life and try to understand what is happening on the floor today. I say to my colleagues across the way that they have to understand and appreciate that the Government of Canada has taken a number of initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557371">Let me give a few examples, some very tangible specifics. The national school food program, which the Conservatives opposed, is there to help potentially 400,000 children. It is an investment in children so that they would be able to have food while they learn. Where are the Conservatives on the issue? Again, we find they are offside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557372">During the peak of food inflation, the government brought in a grocery rebate to put money in the pockets of Canadians. The Conservative Party of Canada voted against that. I made reference to the Competition Act, which ensures a higher sense of fairness in the pricing of food, and how competition is so important to that industry, and again, we saw Conservatives filibuster even legislation of that nature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557373"> We could talk about the food price data hub, which is a tool Canadians can use to look at what is actually happening with the price of a number of food commodities. Because education is a budget line type of issue, we find that the Conservative Party also voted against that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557374">We talk a lot about farmers. I have had the opportunity over the last number of years, from visiting farms, to get a better understanding of Manitoba's agricultural community.

              <ParaText id="8557378">Madam Speaker, I think of the chicken industry in Manitoba. In fact, if we take a look at the chicken industry over the last decade, we will see there are close to 200 new chicken producers. People would not think this was true if they listened to Conservatives. They would think they would be seeing a shrinking of the pork industry, a shrinking of the chicken-processing industry, which is just not true. I have visited not only those industries but also our cattle industry and agriculture communities.</ParaText>

When people fly in and get under the clouds, they see golden fields with multiple colours, where all forms of crops are coming up. There is a lot to be said about the beauty of the Prairies when one sees the potential harvest there, and how that is dealing with food security not only here in Canada but abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557380">I do not need to be told to appreciate farmers and the fine work they do. I do that naturally and I have done it for many years, both as a parliamentarian and as a young person jumping on a John Deere tractor as it was cultivating. This is something I believe in and I know the government believes in it too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557381">Earlier this year, we were in the Philippines. The <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> was making an announcement for the opening of an agri-food trade office where we are going to have 30-plus other countries looking for trade. We will be using the Manila office as a place to enhance Canadian trade for agri-food products. We will all benefit by that, in particular our farmers. With the potential markets in that area of the world, there is phenomenal potential for growth. As a government, we are looking to secure that growth for our country, at the same time as feeding the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557382">Many initiatives taken by the government deal with the issue the report talks about. Unfortunately, the Conservatives have used this as a way to cause division and to filibuster government legislation. It is not about the issue for them, as I said at the beginning. It is all about how they can cause a disturbance in the chamber, and we saw some of that by the reaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557383">When Liberals met as a caucus, we talked about many different issues and concerns in Canada. There are reasons for us to be very optimistic, whether it is the 2% inflation, the downward direction of interest rates or the record foreign investment, especially in comparison with other countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557384">Last year, on a per capita basis, we were number one in the G7 in terms of foreign investment coming into Canada; in the world, we were number three. That is all good news. It shows we are moving forward in the right direction, but we do need to continue to work at improving conditions for all Canadians. That is the type of thing we discussed when we went to caucus. We talked about agriculture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557385">We can contrast that to the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s opening comments at its convention. The headline was, “Carbon pricing to cause economic ‘nuclear winter,’ [the leader of the Conservative Party] tells his MPs”. Let me tell members what he had to say.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557386">In his speech to his caucus, he said that the Liberal government's plan to increase the price would cause a “nuclear winter” for the economy. “There would be a mass hunger and malnutrition with a tax this high...Our seniors would have to turn the heat down to 14 or 13 C just to make it through the winter,” the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> added. “Inflation would run rampant and people would not be able to leave their homes or drive anywhere.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557387">This is the type of whatever we want to call it. That is how he addressed his caucus. I can tell the House that we have seen that shift to the far right.

              <ParaText id="8557388">I received an email. I do not know how I got it, but it is addressed to me. I will leave out what I know I have to leave out, the names. It says, “He's a liar. He's a fake, a phony, a fraud. He told Canadians he was tearing up his costly coalition with [blank], but he is continuing to prop up the Liberal government. Worst of all, he sold out Canadians to get his $2.3-million pension. Canadians can't trust anything he says. It's time for a carbon tax election, full stop. Chip in today to support [I cannot say the name] and the common-sense”, I call it nonsense, “Conservatives as we take on a [I cannot say costly] coalition and win the carbon tax election. [I cannot say the name] has made everything worse. Taxes up. Costs up.” We know the slogan, Madam Speaker. “[Blank] will keep lying to Canadians to keep his pension, but they won't win because we have a secret weapon.” It says me; I am a secret weapon. “We're counting on a strong and patriotic Canadian”—</ParaText>

He mentioned Manitoba pork. I had the opportunity to meet with the executive director of Manitoba Pork just a few weeks ago, Cam Dahl, who told me it has a very serious trade issue. The pork industry in Manitoba is worth about $2 billion in GDP and employs over 20,000 people. He said that the country-of-origin labelling issue in the United States is going to have a deleterious effect on Manitoba pork. I presume that since he has been researching agriculture in Manitoba, he is well aware of the issue.</ParaText>

Over the last number of years, we have seen substantial growth. I think it is somewhere between six million to eight million pigs annually, which is up quite significantly. Are there concerns? Absolutely. It is one of the reasons why, even when we went to Manila, we had representatives from the Canada Pork association.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557394">It is one of the reasons why, when we look at trade with the Philippines and other countries, I have actually made the suggestion that Manitoba Pork should have representation there. It is important to me. It is important to Manitoba. It is important to Canada. With regard to the whole country-of-origin labelling, of course, we are aware of it.

              <ParaText id="8557400">Just as an example, the letter says that “The Government acknowledges this recommendation. The Recognized Employer Pilot (REP) program, launched in Summer 2023, is a three-year pilot program designed to be more responsive to established labour market”.

              <ParaText id="8557412">Every member of the Conservative Party across the way who campaigned in the last election voted in favour of and campaigned on a price on pollution. A price on pollution is a carbon tax. In fairness, they have flip-flopped a few times on it, but in the last federal election that was their official position. It is somewhat interesting now that they are starting to criticize others who have changed their opinions. All they need to do is reflect on their own position over the years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557419">Madam Speaker, I would have liked to have the opportunity to ask my colleague one last question. Since he is still here, I will ask him anyway. Perhaps he can answer me by me asking a question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557420">He spoke about supply management in response to a question from my NDP colleague. He said that his government has always supported supply management. That is reasonably accurate. Bill  <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C-282</Document>, which is important, was passed in the House in June, not in June of 2024, but in June of 2023. The Senate will finally start examining the bill on Wednesday, September 25. My colleague said that his government supports supply management. He officially supported the bill. Even the minister at the time voted in favour of it on behalf of the executive branch of the government. Perhaps it is time to pick up the phone and ask the Senate to deal with this promptly. I am not sure it is reasonable to take over a year to begin examining a bill. That was the comment I wanted to make. If the person in question did not hear it, members can pass the question on to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557421">Today's debate revolves around concurrence in the report entitled “How Government and Industry Can Fight Back Against Food Price Volatility”. The title is important; we are talking about fighting volatility, not controlling prices. We all want food to be less expensive. We have all seen terrible inflation in the food sector, while in other sectors inflation was under control or not as high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557422">We obviously do not live in a totalitarian regime. The government cannot set food prices. It must therefore take action to try to tame the volatility. Funnily enough, supply management is one of the best methods our farmers have found to control price volatility. We always end up with prices that are reasonable and based on the average cost of production. We are therefore encouraging people to be more efficient while also letting them make a decent living. At the end of the day, the consumer pays a reasonable price. We should be looking at these models. That is why we need to pass this bill quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557423">This is the committee's 18th report. I wanted to mention the number of reports because I think that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food is exemplary. Its members work together in the interest of the common good—until recently anyway. Let us hope it stays that way. People are working to adopt measures to help the agriculture sector.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557424">This study was resumed after the call of the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, who had a meeting with the five major grocery stores. These five big grocery companies control 80% of the food market in the country. They were asked to make an effort. The file came back to us. At committee, we had already done a study on the same topic. We ended up studying the same thing twice. That was not exactly efficient, but it did allow us to be more thorough and confront the five big grocery companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557425">These sectors trample on the competition to then become an oligopoly. No matter what any executive of these companies might claim tomorrow morning, next week or in six months, when five companies control 80% of the market in a given sector, that is an oligopoly. If they are not colluding, because that is illegal, then they are at least watching each other and copying each other. We only need to look at the bonuses that were cut at the end of the COVID-19 crisis: They ended on the very same day for everyone. What a coincidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557426">All irony aside, when we heard from these companies' CEOs last spring, they all agreed to give the Competition Bureau their profit figures. The Competition Bureau had been tasked with studying what was happening with grocery prices. I personally put the question to the five representatives. They claimed that there were no big profits. They told us that they had managed to keep the same margins because of pharmacy activities or other factors. When we asked them to show us figures supporting their claims, they told us they could not comply because they were all competitors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557427">The Competition Bureau was doing more or less the same study as we were, at the same time. However, the Bureau's studies are more confidential. We asked company CEOs if they would provide the Competition Bureau with their figures, and they all said yes, with no exceptions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557428">A few weeks later, we received the Competition Bureau's report. In the first few pages, the report's authors lamented the lack of transparency and the fact that they had not been able to obtain the much-talked-about figures. When we met with the CEOs again in committee a few months later, I asked each of them the same question. I told them that, apparently, some of them had not provided their figures. I then asked them if they had. They all said yes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557429">It really is a beautiful world we live in, is it not? Somebody somewhere did not tell the truth. We just do not who it is. This example, which is a little anecdotal, I agree, is still important. It is a matter of transparency towards the government. This example shows that one of the government's responsibilities is to ensure that sectors remain competitive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557430">The committee came up with several very interesting recommendations. I see colleagues who sit on the committee with me. I am almost sure they would agree with my next statement. We have published 18 reports. We work very hard. We are serious and rigorous. When we adopt a report, it usually passes by consensus or with an overwhelming majority. We want these proposals to move forward. However, if we were to measure the thickness of the dust covering each of these reports, which are sitting on the shelf, we would be very disappointed. That is the first point I wanted to make. When I was rereading the recommendations just now, I thought to myself how good the report was. There is only one exception, one small caveat that I will get to later. Otherwise, it was a wonderful report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557431">I will return to the recommendations. The first reads as follows:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557432">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The Committee, noting the particular importance of temporary foreign workers to the agriculture and agri-food sectors, recommends that the Government of Canada reduce the administrative burden....</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557433"> This has still not been done. We are still waiting. The government has even made things worse. We suggested asking for fewer labour market impact assessments and now they are requested more frequently than ever. They used to be requested once a year, but now it is every six months. We might understandably hesitate to write anything in the next report for fear that the government will do the opposite. It is a little ironic. Sometimes we wonder whether the recommendations we adopt in committee serve any purpose at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557434">We therefore need to be careful about that. We need to keep the recognized employer pilot program going. We also need to be careful in the agri-food sector. We often talk about the agricultural industry but less often about the agri-food sector. Let us remember that what is produced must be processed before it is eaten. Agri-food is the next step, an extension of the agriculture industry. There are no limits on the number of foreign workers that can be hired in the agriculture industry, but there are limits in the agri-food sector. It is difficult to hire workers to cut up pork in a meat factory. I can tell members that. I would invite the MPs who have not already done so to visit a food processing plant. It will become obvious to them that we need these workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557435">Is it 30%? Is it 20%? Is it 10%? I am concerned about the last announcement. The cap was reduced from 30% to 20%. There was talk of reducing it to 10%. I hope that agri-food will not be affected by this 10% limit. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278348" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation> asked the parliamentary secretary about this a few minutes ago. It is important to be smart. Every time the government does something, it has to think about the consequences. It should not do something just to have a nice announcement. It needs to look at how the measures put in place will apply on a daily basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557436">I am not saying that it is wrong to lower the cap from 20% to 10% in other labour sectors. However, in agri-food, I think this will create a serious problem. I would not want to see food processing centres move elsewhere in a few years because they cannot recruit workers. We can mechanize production and make investments, but the government still needs to have a little more vision and provide incentives to modernize these processing plants. That was another one of our recommendations, but it did not appear in the report. This recommendation was included in a number of reports, but it has not yet been implemented. I would therefore invite the ministers to read the committee reports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557437">The first recommendation was to be thorough and take regional characteristics into account before making any changes.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557438">The second recommendation had a lot to do with the impact of climate change, something we have talked about. Even grocery store suppliers told us that it was sometimes hard to get supply and that they had to go elsewhere because of weather events that had impacted supply. That can create scarcity, which also leads to higher prices. All of this needs to be taken into account. That is why we need to ensure that we have local food resilience, that we are able to feed our people and keep our farmers in place. To keep them in place, we might have to support them more than we currently do, through the risk management programs, for example. That was not part of this study. We did not mention it again, but we did have discussed it at length and we have produced more than one report on the subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557439">The sustainable Canadian agricultural partnership will be renewed in 2028. I feel like we are going to wait until November 2027 to start talking about it, when the government should already be sitting down with stakeholders to see what changes need to be made. We will need to make major changes here, unless we do not want it to work. These programs need an in-depth review, better funding and, above all, a better coverage rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557440">Some agricultural producers are telling me that they no longer take out insurance because the likelihood that it will benefit them to be insured is so small compared to the high premiums they are being charged and the small payout they will receive in compensation. That does not work for a company. These people are business owners. Farming tends to be romanticized, but first and foremost, farmers are business owners. They need to balance their books at the end of the month. Things are so hard now that 44% of Quebec farmers have a second job. They work off the farm so they can balance their books at the end of the month. Is it right for the people who feed us to have to take on other work? They take the train in the morning, go to work, come home and go back to the farm in the evening. It makes no sense and it needs to be addressed. It is easy for me to go off on a tangent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557441">The only recommendation the Bloc Québécois expressed concern about was recommendation 3, which calls on the Government of Canada to pass Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C‑234</Document> unamended. We initially backed this bill because we believe in the agriculture exemption. However, when it came back from the Senate with an amendment, we suggested embracing the step forward that it represented and then determining what could be done about the buildings. The Senate had taken out the buildings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557442">Of course, decisions are sometimes difficult to make. However, I think it was the right decision under the circumstances. As a matter of fact, when the bill came back from the Senate, we could have wrapped it up in a week, finished debate, voted and accepted this proposal. That way, farmers would be entitled to the exemption for grain drying now, this fall. I remember that the first speech I made when we came back in January 2024 was about that exact aspect. It was almost a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557443">Instead, the Conservatives decided to kill time with speeches and the debate never ended. We have yet to vote on this bill because they are looking to get political mileage out of this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557444">I know that the carbon tax has become a sticky issue, politically speaking. It has been very polarizing. However, this bill would improve things in the fall for grain farmers. If any of them are watching us, I say to them that all we need to do is vote next week for the grain drying exemption to come into effect. It is not in effect at the moment. That is the end of my tangent. Obviously, when it comes to this recommendation, I was not among the majority. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the report as a whole and we adopted it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557445">I will now move on to recommendation 4. It recommends that the government review its labelling regulations. That is a great example. I will not have enough time to talk about all the recommendations since I have so much to say about each topic, but I will talk about the ones I have time to address.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557446">Regarding labelling, Health Canada decided to protect citizens and help them be healthy. If a food contains fat or sugar, that will be generally indicated on the food, but the rest of the content of the food will not. That is a fine example of a policy that was adopted quickly to make the government look good, to give the appearance of being good and kind and of having protected the public. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557447">For example, dried cranberries need a label because they have a very bitter taste, so they need added sugar. I am not saying that the package should not say that it contains sugar, but when people go to the grocery store and see that it contains too much sugar to be healthy, without seeing the rest, it takes away some of the nuance. Cranberries are very effective antioxidants. They have a whole bunch of health benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557448">I would like to return to this idea, if anyone on the government side is listening. We need to be smarter with our policies. Let us look at France, for example, which has adopted a “Nutri-Score” system, rather than just saying that a food has a lot of fat or a lot of sugar, which takes away all the nuance and means that a bunch of exemptions are needed. I have not mentioned it yet, but dairy products got an exemption. Ground meat got an exemption pretty quickly, because the same cut of non-ground meat would not be labelled, which is completely ridiculous. People figured that out fast. It took two weeks to get that exemption. I can say bravo for once, but that should happen more often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557449">France's “Nutri-Score” system assigns each food item a letter, either A, B, C, D or E. For foods like cranberries, instead of being assigned the letter E because the front-of-package label shows the word “sugar” in big letters, the product might be rated B or C, since it has other health benefits. Decisions have to be informed and carefully considered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557450">It is important to remember that labelling changes come at a high cost to the industry. The government says it wants to lower the cost of groceries, but the cost of changing the food labelling policy every two years is huge. For one thing, consider the packaging that will be thrown in the recycling bin. We need to think carefully. We need to ask what exactly it is that we want to change generally, among all the labelling features, and then make the changes once and only once, so that the industry can adjust. The industry needs time to adjust too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557451">Moving on to the report's fifth recommendation, everyone agrees on getting rid of plastics. No one disagrees. All we are saying is that we cannot ban PLU stickers, the small labels placed on fruit, with a snap of our fingers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557452">Science has begun to develop biodegradable labels. They exist. They are coming, but they are very expensive and are not widely available yet. We may lose suppliers based in foreign countries. They may stop providing us with bananas, for example, because the cost will become too high too quickly. Yes, let us make these changes, but let us be reasonable about the deadlines and then see what the alternatives are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557453">Plastic packaging for vegetables is probably the best example that I can give. Broccoli wrapped in plastic will last two, three or four times longer in the grocery store than broccoli that is not wrapped in plastic. Everyone agrees that we want to get rid of the plastic, but first we need to develop an alternative solution. Otherwise, we will put broccoli on the shelves and food waste will skyrocket. What is a huge source of greenhouse gas emissions? Food waste. I am talking about thinking things through. That is how we usually work at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557454">We talked about the nutrition north Canada program. The government provides subsidies to companies that supply food to remote areas. However, we are not sure that those subsidies are being put to good use. We put the message out there because food prices are atrocious in remote areas. It is crazy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557455">Should the formula be reviewed? Should the government support citizens directly instead? It is unclear whether that is a good idea, but we should look into how these subsidies are being used. Our job is not to increase a private company's profits. Our job is to ensure that citizens have access to affordable food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557456">To conclude, one of the major recommendations is the grocery code of conduct. It is an excellent example of what happens when we work constructively. The committee worked on this for a very long time. We put a lot of pressure on the companies. Two of them did not want to sign, but they finally did this summer. The code of conduct will be implemented. Now it will be important to monitor how it is being applied. The most important element is the dispute resolution mechanism for small suppliers.</ParaText>

He touched on a number of topics, including the fact that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food has tabled its 18th report. In the more than four years that I have sat on this committee, we have produced a considerable number of recommendations. The government, however, has implemented very few of them. My colleague mentioned a statistic earlier. He said that 44% of fruit and vegetable producers sold their produce at a loss in 2023. This was not that long ago. The committee made recommendations in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557459">Does my colleague think that improvements could be made to help our fruit and vegetable producers, since that is also part of our overall food supply system?

              <ParaText id="8557460">Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Beauce for his question. There were 18 reports, yes, and here is a little tip for those who want to run a successful campaign: They should read the committee reports. I think that, if they do, they are going to have a pretty good platform with smart, well-structured solutions. That is the end of my aside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557461">The 44% reflected producers who have to work outside, but there may be similar numbers in fruits and vegetables. I can say that because major producers in my riding were hit again this year and it is having dire consequence. I spoke earlier about risk management programs and how we manage risk. The people at the company I am talking about had a terrible summer in 2023. They filed an insurance claim, but it barely covered half of their losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557462">When they took out insurance the following year, the premium had quadrupled. This year, however, they need to file a claim again because some waterways overflowed. That is what needs to be urgently reviewed. We have to start now, because the traditional concept of risk management no longer works.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557464">One of the things that Manitoba has been very successful at, in working with the federal government, is using the local nominee program to ensure that there is stability in that workforce. It has been very successful at ensuring that the employees required to support the communities of Winnipeg, Brandon and Neepawa, in particular, are there in a very real and tangible way. What does the member think about the Province of Quebec doing likewise, if it is not already, and working with the federal government in the agricultural sector to maybe look at permanent residents filling some of these positions?</ParaText>

We can always draw inspiration. What I would not want is for the federal government to tell Quebec what to do in a skills training program. The parliamentary secretary will not be surprised to hear that I have the usual reservations. Some of my colleagues who sit on the committee may even be sick of hearing that. I always add key phrases in resolutions. It has gotten to the point where we laugh about it, but we put them in anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557466">It is important to look at other options because we need the temporary foreign worker program, and it is working well. However, as I was saying earlier, we do not necessarily oppose reducing the percentages, but let us look at which sector and what impact it will have. That is where we have to be progressive and intelligent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557467">It would not be a bad idea to see how this could be reformed and how we could stop relying on foreign workers, or at least on this scale, because it does not cost our entrepreneurs any less to hire temporary foreign workers.</ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278348" Type="2">Drummond</Affiliation> and the member for Berthier—Maskinongé say that we need to be careful because the agriculture and agri-food sector needs those workers, those employees, and cannot retrain them every year.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557471">Madam Speaker, to answer his question, what we want are intelligent measures. We do not want a populist announcement that says that we are going to reduce this by a certain percentage. That is what matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557472">The Bloc Québécois speaks out a lot about refugee claims. We want to welcome people, but our major concern is the proportion of temporary people that Quebec has to take care of. We are not just talking about workers. There are distinctions to be made, but of course, it is not always easy to do so in 30-second clips. Still, there are important distinctions to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557473">The agri-food sector is not necessarily against looking at how to reduce that, but we need to be smart about it because we do not want to break the supply chains. That is where the need for finesse comes in. My colleague talked about how he has concerns. The Bloc Québécois also has concerns. That is why we are advocating that we stop issuing closed permits and start issuing open, sector-specific permits.</ParaText>

We have come to realize that a lot of money is being taken from the middleman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557476">I want to talk about the worst example I have seen recently. A lettuce salesman delivering lettuce to a large grocer was called back a few days later, only to be told to pick up three-quarters of his order because they did not want it anymore. The conditions were that he was not to charge the grocer for transport, but simply collect the rest of the order. This is unacceptable. What was the reason? The grocery chain said it had gotten better prices from Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557477">First of all, who knows what is on the lettuce. I am going to talk about reciprocity of standards. Do not get me started. Not only did the store say it came from Mexico, but they also said they got a better price. The grower went back to pick up three-quarters of his order, then kept an eye on lettuce prices in grocery stores. Well, they never went down. A code of conduct with a dispute resolution process between small suppliers and large grocery stores is essential.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557493">Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise here today as the new NDP critic for agriculture and speak to a subject that Canadians really care about, a subject the NDP has been the leading force on in this place, and that is the rising price of groceries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557494">Groceries have gone up 22% over the last three years alone, and since food is one of the biggest parts of any family's budget, and an absolutely essential one at that, this has hit Canadians hard. The use of food banks has hit a 35-year high. Meanwhile, the grocery sector made record profits last year, raking in $6 billion. Loblaw has almost doubled its profit margin in the past five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557495">On top of that, other parts of household budgets have also soared, which impacts families, in many cases, as much as, or more than, food prices, and this has aggravated the impact of the rising cost of food. Housing costs have soared. The price of gas at the pumps has skyrocketed as the big oil companies revel in high world oil prices and rake in billions of dollars in record profits, over $30 billion last year alone. All in all, it is easy to see why Canadians are struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557496"> As I said, it has been the NDP that has really been fighting for relief from all these rising costs. We have been fighting to stabilize food prices, build affordable housing and provide relief from rising gas prices. We have been putting forward really solid ideas that would actually do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557497"> Last fall, my colleague, the former NDP critic for agriculture, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation>, tabled a motion at the agriculture committee to study the rising costs of food. The motion put forward by the member asked for a study on the recent commitments, at that time, of the government to stabilize and lower food prices. It called for the <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to appear, and summoned the CEOs of Loblaw, Metro, Empire, Walmart and Costco.

              <ParaText id="8557504">New Democrats were asking the government to force big grocery chains and suppliers to lower the price of essential foods or the government would put in place a price cap or use other measures. Big grocery chains have shown that they have control over their prices when they announce price freezes on store brands. All major grocery stores have their own brands, such as no name. A cap on prices on these items is within the control of grocery stores. If they do not voluntarily cap these prices, the government should force them to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557505"> So far, Liberals promised to, “stabilize” food prices, but they have failed to do so. For more than 25 consecutive months, as of last May, food inflation outpaced general inflation, leaving Canadians with higher bills, and the Liberals did nothing. While food inflation is at a more reasonable level right now, in the past three years, as I said, food prices have increased by over 20%. We need government action to lower the prices of essential food items. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557507">We got all excited. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. Other countries, such as France, Greece and South Korea have taken steps to lower essential food prices. Price control measures are being used right now in Canada. Many provincial governments impose limits on rent increases. Prices for most forms of energy are also regulated in Canada; obviously, gasoline, diesel and so on are not. Big grocery chains, as I said, have shown they have control over their prices when they have announced price freezes. I just want to go into more detail on what these other countries have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557508">In France, the government secured a deal with 75 major companies to lower the price of groceries for 5,000 products. If the grocery companies fail to reduce prices, the government can hold them publicly accountable. For example, the government called out major corporations, such as PepsiCo and Unilever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557509">In Greece, the government announced gross profit caps for key consumer goods and services in the food and health sectors. In practice, the policy stipulates that the gross profit per unit cannot exceed that of the profits made before December 31, 2021. To ensure enforcement of these measures, international companies can be fined. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557510">In South Korea, in 2023, the president established department-level task forces to monitor and implement food price control measures in key industries. For example, the ministry of agriculture assessed the prices of seven key food items, including milk, coffee, noodles and bread. In 2024, President Yeol adjusted his approach to establish a national-level task force responsible for implementing food price control measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557511">What, again, is the NDP calling for? We are asking the government to force these big grocery chains and suppliers to lower the price of essential food for the next six months. If they do not do that, we suggest that the government impose a price cap on those essential foods. The government could take that period to develop options of price regulation measures if big companies of the industry fail to do so. They could look at what other countries have done, as I just mentioned, and how price regulation measures could work in Canada. There are many options at the government's disposal. It could be a straight price cap, in which essential food items cannot be higher than a certain price and cannot be increased above a certain price every year. The basket of food covered could be determined by looking at what other countries have done, or we could start from the 60 items in the Statistics Canada nutritious food basket and go toward all food items that are GST-free. As some economists have suggested, the government could start by forcing big grocery chains to lower prices of their private brand products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557512">For the NDP, it is critical that any measures taken do not hurt producers or small independent grocers. I will just step back here and say that we certainly want to protect farmers, what they produce and what they make. I grew up on a small farm. I know how hard it is to make money in agriculture, and we do not want to affect them. They are suffering more than ever from all sorts of issues, but these big corporations are causing this food inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557513">The government has other tools at its disposal, such as an excess profit tax, as they have used for banks, at the NDP's bidding. In addition, the government could always implement fines if the companies are not doing what it has asked them to do. It should certainly go the route of excess profit tax on the big oil companies for the prices at the pumps. The Conservatives can talk all they want about how the carbon tax is hitting people. It is the profits of the big oil companies that are really hurting farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557514">The government should stop feeding grocery greed with corporate handouts. When the Conservatives were last in power, they cut the corporate tax rate from 22% down to 15%. It is estimated that this cost the federal government $60 billion in corporate handouts over a six-year period. The Liberals kept those corporate handouts in place. We estimate that the federal government has lost $90 billion through its inaction. Just as another aside, this is all based on the long-debunked theory of trickle-down economics, which says that if we tax corporations less, we will all benefit. That does not happen. It never has.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557515">Due to the Conservatives' corporate tax cuts, it is estimated that Loblaws, Costco and Metro have received $2.35 billion in handouts from the federal government. The New Democrats are calling for corporations to pay their fair share, and we are not alone. President Biden's 2024 budget will increase the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557516"> I would like to turn now to nutrition north Canada. This is a hugely important program in the north, where food prices have been extraordinarily high for many years. Nutrition north is designed to lower the cost of essential goods for retailers. It includes a retail subsidy for grocery stores and food producers, grant funding for local harvesters to boost local food production, and funding support for community food programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557517"> However, new studies show that the price of goods has gone down by only 67¢ for every dollar in subsidy provided by nutrition north. That is particularly concerning, as the subsidy is being delivered to corporations like the North West Company, owner of Northmart, which is bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits and paying its executives millions of dollars in bonuses and salaries. While many of these stores operate in indigenous communities, few are owned by indigenous people who live in those communities and most are found in cities like Winnipeg or Montreal. Meanwhile, families in the north cannot afford basic fresh food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557518">The New Democrats have called for an audit of nutrition north to ensure that corporate greed is not interfering in northerners' access to healthy, fresh and affordable food. No company should be bringing in millions in profits while also needing a subsidy to deliver goods to northern communities. We also believe nutrition north should be reformed to become a social program, not a corporate subsidy, so that families will have more choice in what they put on their plates.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557558">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278374" Type="2">Foothills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557559">Today, I would like to acknowledge the important work that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food has done over the past few months. I will quote in particular the 18th report, which is on food price stabilization across the country.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557560">Let me be clear, we agree with majority of the committee's report and its recommendations. However, some aspects of the report need to be highlighted, and Canadians need to be aware of the Liberal government's policies and decisions that are contributing to increasing food prices and jeopardizing Canada's food security. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557561">Unfortunately, this is a report that was done twice, which is a waste of both the House's precious resources and time that Canadians do not have to waste. Two years ago, we finished the same report and tabled our findings, but the government chose not to respond to any of our recommendations. That is a big part of my frustration. At the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri‑Food, we work very hard together, but few of the recommendations have been implemented by the government since I have been a member of that committee, which is nearly four years. I am very disappointed because we gave this a lot of thought. Our work and the recommendations we make reflect the importance that should be given to the agriculture sector and agri-food development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557562">Last year, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> wrote to the committee asking us to study this very subject as part of what I consider a politically motivated PR stunt. He did not even realize that the initial report already existed. This happened in the space of three months. The Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry said that he would stabilize food prices by Thanksgiving of 2023, but he did not keep his word. In the report, as well as the Conservatives' dissenting opinion, we find many solutions that could be implemented today to help ease the difficulties facing all Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557563">I would like to list a few of the most important solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557564">Witnesses at every meeting brought up the carbon tax. It is wiping out our farmers' revenues and forcing millions of Canadians to use food banks. The cost of farm inputs and transportation is skyrocketing, and the upshot is that more and more Canadian families are going hungry. One in five Canadians is skipping meals just to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557565">However, my “Liberal Bloc” colleagues will say that the carbon tax does not affect Quebec. How out of touch with reality can they be? Just yesterday morning, I met with people who were telling me about the impact that this tax is also having in Quebec. We do not produce everything in Quebec, and most of the products that come from Canada are directly affected. This tax also affects grocery prices. Every time a Quebecker shops at the grocery store, they indirectly pay the carbon tax, which, as I just said, is applied to goods and transportation all along the supply chain. Farmers and homeowners also pay the carbon tax directly when they fill their propane tanks with propane, which is all imported to Quebec from elsewhere in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557566">The inflationary deficit is another important point. The government has dug us into such a deep hole with inflationary deficits that future generations will have to pay the bill for years to come. Farm succession plans are in ruins, and the next generation does not even know if they will continue farming. They can thank the Liberals, the Bloc Québécois and the NDP for that. Food bank usage has never been higher. Millions of Canadians have to turn to food banks to put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8557567">In my riding, an organization called Moisson Beauce, which serves over 50 organizations throughout the greater Chaudière-Appalaches region, is struggling to meet demand. I can corroborate that information. I met with people who work at this organization just 10 days ago. It is extremely sad. I have never seen anything like it in my entire life in Beauce. These comments come from the people and the many volunteers who work at the food bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557568">Risk management programs need to be improved. As my Bloc Québécois colleague mentioned earlier, I do not know how many of the committee's studies have recommended reviewing all risk management programs and aligning them with the realities of the agricultural sector in 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557569">Considering the changing weather conditions and financial realities, such as rising interest costs, the government must take the lead and make significant changes to further protect farm families. Last year, 44% of fruit and vegetables were sold at a loss. That is an alarming number, and it raises the question as to why the government is not doing something about that. It would rather bring in produce from abroad by truck or plane while taxing farmers and causing unnecessary pollution with all these imports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557570">Revenues continue to fall. Net farm income in 2023 in Quebec fell by 42.9%, which is quite significant. One in five farms in Quebec have also reported not being able to repay their debts because of rising input costs, transportation costs and, especially, interest costs in recent years. The cost of the Liberal carbon tax is also one of the main reasons, and it needs to be axed now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557571">An important issue I would like us to look into is the fertilizer tariffs. There was the incoherent Liberal plan to charge a 35% tariff on Russian fertilizer, which is still in place today and is costing farmers a fortune just to run their operations efficiently. The government made that decision at a time when it was extremely difficult to procure fertilizer at a reasonable price around the world. Farmers are being fleeced, paying much higher than market value for the fertilizer they need to grow crops and feed the public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557572">Our party and many stakeholders have called for this tariff to be removed and the money returned to farmers, but the Liberals refuse. The <Affiliation DbId="278943" Type="96">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has even made an exception in recent months so that critical minerals from Russia are exempt from tariffs, yet she still refuses to give farmers a discount on such essential products as fertilizer. All of that to say that the government's ideological pursuit of penalizing greenhouse gas emitters through carbon tariffs and taxes without properly recognizing those who have been mitigating, eliminating and sequestering greenhouse gas emissions for years, if not decades, is short-sighted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557573">Inflationary taxes and bad policies increase production costs for businesses and farmers, contributing to higher prices. We cannot tax farmers, truckers and grocers without impacting consumers at the grocery store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557574">A Conservative government will act quickly to remedy the situation. Fortunately, all parties will have the opportunity to make a common-sense decision this Wednesday to bring down the Liberal government. Canadians will be listening, and I hope my colleagues will move in the right direction.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557587">Madam Speaker, obviously, agriculture, agri-food and processing are very important sectors in my region. We have a lot of temporary foreign workers in the agri-food processing sector.</ParaText>

It is not that we do not have a labour supply of our own, but clearly, those folks were willing to come and work in our slaughterhouses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557589">I think we just need to be careful. We are talking about our food supply. I think that, as Canadians, we need to feed Canada first. If we want to feed our own population properly, we have to be able to process products locally. Because there are not enough Quebec and Canadian workers in our ridings, we still need temporary foreign workers. The categories need to be very clearly defined.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557590">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to this concurrence debate on a Conservative supplementary report on the variance in food prices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557591">It is interesting to hear my Liberal, NDP and Bloc colleagues not really talking about the impact that the carbon tax and other Liberal-NDP policies are having on Canadian farm families and our supply chain, which in turn, are driving up prices for Canadians and consumers, who are witnessing this first-hand at the grocery store shelves. We have talked a lot over the last week, our first week back in the House of Commons, about the impact we are seeing on food security in Canada. These numbers are truly startling, when we are seeing the number of Canadians who are now experiencing food insecurity in our country, a G7 country, up 111%. That is almost nine million Canadians struggling to find their next meal, millions of Canadian parents unable to feed their kids and 25% of our population struggling to put food on the table. These are numbers that I certainly never thought I would see in my lifetime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557592">The Liberals have been saying all afternoon that Canadians have just never had it so good, and I do not know what they are talking about. The stats are startling, and they are not only the stats on Canadians experiencing food insecurity but also the government's own data on on-farm income shows that it decreased 3% in 2022. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557593">On-farm income is down $9.1 billion, from $13 billion in 2022, which is a drop of 41.7% from 2022 to 2023. Let us put this into some more specific numbers. In British Columbia, net farm income is down 36%; in Alberta, it is down 55%; in Saskatchewan, it is down 42%; in Quebec, it is down 43%; and in New Brunswick, it is down 55%. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> is saying that Manitoba farmers have never had it so good, but in that member's own province, that income has decreased 38%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557594">Why is this happening? It is because the carbon tax is costing Canadian farmers almost a billion dollars a year. It is continuing to go up year after year, but that is only what we are seeing in direct costs. They are also seeing higher costs on fertilizer, fuel, feed and every other input they are putting into their farm operations. Machinery and employment, all of these things, are seeing their prices go up. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557595">On trucking, we have just heard that the Canadian Trucking Alliance has said that the impact that the carbon tax is having on their industry alone will be $4 billion by 2030. Bison Transport is not a huge trucking company, but it is a fairly substantial trucking company in western Canada. One of its owners is a constituent. Bison Transport paid $7.8 million in carbon taxes last year. That is one trucking company. It is halfway through this year, and it has already paid $4.5 million in carbon taxes. When its year-end is done, it will have paid close to $10 million in carbon taxes. That is just one trucking company, and they are passing those costs on to the consumer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557596">It is very difficult to square the circle of the Liberals saying that the carbon tax has no impact on food prices. Give me a break. Of course it does. That does not even talk about rail. CPKC and CN also charge producers and their vendors a carbon tax on everything they haul. Saskatchewan farmers paid $17 million in carbon taxes to the railways last year. That is $17 million, and we are wondering why farm incomes are so low and why we are seeing such a stark reduction in farm income. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557597">The Canadian Federation of Agriculture has talked to all of its members about its operating expenses and their farms. Operating expenses on Canadian farms are up 19%, the largest increase since 1979. What is the coincidence between 1979 and 2024? I will let members think about that for a second. They are the Liberal governments led by the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his father, and they dump those costs onto Canadian farmers without any thought as to the consequences that will happen to Canadian consumers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557598"> Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, the pre-eminent expert on food prices and the food supply chain in Canada and a professor at Dalhousie University, commonly known as the “food professor”, said that the Liberal-NDP carbon tax increases wholesale food costs by 34% in every single category. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557599">The Liberals like to talk about the experts, the 200 economists who say the carbon tax is not increasing the cost of living. I would like to know who those experts are because the pre-eminent expert on food costs and the supply chain in Canada has clearly stated that the Liberal-NDP carbon tax increases food costs in all categories by 34%. Why is this number so different from what the Liberal government professes? Dr. Charlebois said that the CRA and Finance Canada are not properly quantifying the costs of the carbon tax for food supply or food production. I am very surprised that the Liberals would be selective on which numbers they use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557600">The Liberal member across the way has talked all day about using facts and figures. The Manitoba pork industry has never been stronger. I just told members about how Manitoba's agriculture farm income is down 38%. That is a fact. That is his own government's data. By this data, in Canada's pork industry, the number of hogs in Canada is down 265,000 head. I wonder why his numbers are so different from his government's numbers. That number is actually expected to go down another 2% in 2024. It is horrible when Liberals have to listen to the facts and the data that their own government has compiled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557601">As the opposition, we brought forward four recommendations that would address the volatile price of food and food for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557602">The first is to axe the tax. Eliminate the carbon tax, which is driving up the cost of everything consumers buy, including food. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557603">The second is to do an in-depth study of the impact of both carbon taxes. I have to admit, whether it meant to or not, the government has now done that work. Carbon tax 1 punches a $25 billion hole in Canada's economy. We now know, as a result of an Order Paper question by my office, that carbon tax 2, the so-called clean fuel standard, adds another $9-billion sledgehammer hit to our economy. Therefore, both carbon taxes make up a $35 billion hit to Canadians. That is money coming out of their pocket. It is damaging their paycheques and certainly hurting Canada's economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557604">The third recommendation is to eliminate the front-of-pack labelling policy path that the Liberal government is going down. It is a completely activist, ideological policy; certainly, no one has asked for it. It will cost the industry $8 billion. Does the government think the industry is going to just absorb those costs? That is like our NDP colleague saying that it is going to be a tax on profit. I am sure Galen Weston is going to happily take that tax out of his pocket and his profits and just not worry about it. Of course, those costs are going to—</ParaText>

It is true that the carbon tax is a pricing mechanism that is supposed to lead to people reducing their carbon. If we did not have that, we would have more carbon emissions. Here is the cost. The Canadian Climate Institute's report says that by 2030, Canada could face annual losses to real GDP of $35 billion, and that depending on whether or not we get our emissions act together, we could be looking at $78 billion to $101 billion annually by 2050 and $391 billion to $865 billion by 2100.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557629">I am pleased to rise on behalf of the people of Saskatoon—Grasswood here tonight to speak about this concurrence in committee report. Canadians have sent a clear message to the government: They are struggling to keep up with the cost of living and are not getting the support they need. In the middle of this historic cost of living crisis, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to hike the carbon tax by 23%. This is just one step in his plan to quadruple the carbon tax over the next six years, a tax that will continue to increase the cost of food for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557630">The panicking Liberals are back to resorting to every trick in the book, trying desperately to prevent farmers from getting a carbon tax carve-out for grain drying, barn heating and other farm operations. The amendment would be another blow to the wallets of Canadians. It would reduce fresh produce availability by some fifty per cent, while costing the industry a remarkable $5.6 billion. I want to talk tonight about how the government and the industry can fight back against rising food price volatility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557631">I come from the province of Saskatchewan, where people are proud to say that we feed the world. However, times are now changing desperately for producers in the province, as costs have soared under the Liberal-NDP government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557632">As chair of the Saskatchewan caucus, I can say that we have had extensive talks with SARM, which is the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities. During our talks with president Ray Orb and the entire board at SARM, they brought up the inflationary pressures from the government that are simply killing rural Saskatchewan. The carbon tax, which had increased by 23% as of April 1, led to SARM members' writing letters to every member on the agriculture committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557633">The premier of Saskatchewan, Scott Moe, led six other provincial premiers who were opposed to the government's carbon tax increase. Even in the legislature of Saskatchewan, the opposition NDP agreed with the Sask Party on the carbon tax. Saskatchewan has been joined by Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in asking for a carbon tax carve-out for the farmers and to pass Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> in its original form.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557634">We should talk about Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> because it would provide relief to Saskatchewan farmers, but let us recall it was the Liberal-controlled Senate that gutted the bill in that place. The Senate amendments would cost Saskatchewan farmers $9 million this year, and by 2030, an added cost of $96 million. That is from one bill, Bill C-234.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557635">Provinces like B.C., where MLAs once actually supported a carbon tax, have turned right around. They have turned their backs on the federal government, although we all know it is flip-flop for Premier Eby, as he knows he will probably be going down in the next 28 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557636">The Canadian Federation of Agriculture surveyed the impact of the carbon tax on crop production, livestock and greenhouse farms across this country. It found that the carbon tax accounted for up to 40% of their energy bills. In my province alone, farm efforts to sequester carbon have gone basically unrecognized by the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557637">The policies by the NDP-Liberals are simply punishing farmers. The government's ideological pursuit to penalize greenhouse gas emitters through the carbon tax, to me, is very short-sighted and inequitable. Farmers have, for years, maybe even decades, demonstrated an ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions through the adoption of new technologies, through education and through innovative practices, not through taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557638"> In Saskatoon, we hold the crop production show every January at Prairieland Park, which, by the way, is in my riding. Thousands of producers come from all over western Canada and the United States to talk about farming innovation. Then, in July, just a couple of months ago, we had Ag in Motion just outside of Saskatoon, in Langham, bringing tens of thousands of producers together from all over the world to find best practices. One could not get a hotel room within a 100-kilometre radius of Saskatoon; everything was full for that four-day show. I cannot forget about the Canadian Western Agribition show in Regina each November, as it services farmers and ranchers from all over the world, and we are innovative in our thoughts going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557639"> Farming groups are on the leading edge of innovation. We have led for years, for decades, trying to find innovative ways to produce food for the entire world. I compliment the innovative companies that have set up in my province, like Bourgault; Agtron; Brandt Industries; Schulte Industries; Bin-Sense, a new company that just started in Saskatchewan; Redekop Industries; and Wilger Industries, which, by the way, sell their product to John Deere and Case worldwide. Many other companies have surfaced in Saskatchewan. All one has to do is go to the small communities in my province. Every little town has set up something on agriculture, and that is what is keeping them alive. Saskatchewan has led the world for decades on zero tillage. It has led on direct seeding, crop rotation and rotational grazing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557640">With the Bank of Canada confirming that the carbon tax was responsible for at least 16% of inflation last October, it is no wonder that the food professor that we have talked about from Dalhousie University, Dr. Charlebois, recommended a pause on the carbon tax for the entire food industry. We in the Conservative Party also want to axe the tax. We know that it is hurting every citizen in this country. Why? Two million people are visiting food banks today in this country, with 25,000 in my city of Saskatoon, a city of just under 300,000 people. We have 25,000 people per month visiting the Saskatoon Food Bank, in a province that produces food for the entire world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557660">Madam Speaker, after nine years of the Liberal government, we know that life has never cost Canadians more. Across the country, Canadians are going hungry in record numbers. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s reckless budgeting and failed policies have caused the worst inflation in 40 years, and food prices have skyrocketed. This year alone, families will spend $700 more on groceries than they did last year, and that number keeps growing year after year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557661"> Food Banks Canada has reported a 50% increase in visits since 2021 with a record-breaking two million visits in a single month. Hard-working Canadians should not have to rely on food banks to not go hungry. However, that is the government's record. Only one in six adults visiting a food bank is unemployed, meaning they do not have a job. In other words, that means five out of six Canadians who are visiting a food bank are employed. These Canadians cannot make ends meet. Their paycheques are overstretched and they are not keeping up with the rising costs caused by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s inflationary deficits and taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557662">What is certain is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s plan to quadruple the carbon tax is only going to make things worse. The carbon tax is adding to the cost of groceries at every single point in the food supply chain. At the end of the day, Canadians will pay the price. Conservatives have said over and over again in this House that when we tax the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who ships the food and the grocer who sells the food, it is going to cost Canadians more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557663">It is not just Conservatives the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is ignoring. The Canadian Trucking Alliance recently reported that the NDP-Liberal coalition's carbon tax added $2 billion to long-haul trucking costs this year alone. That figure will go up to $4 billion in 2030. The Canadian Trucking Alliance was clear that these costs “cannot be absorbed [by truckers] and must be passed on to customers.” That means Canadians. That is moms and dads, students and seniors who are on fixed incomes. They are all picking up the bill for the Prime Minister's punishing carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557664">Food insecurity should not be a problem in a country like Canada, but more and more Canadians do not know where they are going to get their next meal from. The increased costs on farm businesses threaten their long-term viability. Our farmers produce safe, nutritious, good-quality food, but if the cost of doing business continues to increase exponentially, it will eventually put our hard-working farmers out of business. That is the threat not only to the agriculture industry but to Canadians and all those around the world who depend on the food grown here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557665">Our farmers pay retail prices for everything they buy for their farm businesses, but they sell products at cost. Farm businesses already had tight margins and the costly carbon tax is a massive hit to their bottom line. There are massive carbon tax bills and they are only growing. Saskatchewan farmers paid $12 million last year in carbon taxes on natural gas and propane to dry grain, heat and cool livestock barns, and grow their food. With this year's carbon tax hike, that number will go up to $15 million. By 2030, it is estimated that the carbon tax will cost a typical 5,000-acre farm in Canada $150,000 in carbon taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557666"> Our farmers cannot afford the carbon tax. It is absolutely critical that the government pass Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> in its original form. We cannot afford to lose our Canadian farm families. Passing Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> in its original form would also acknowledge the work that our farmers are already doing to safeguard our environment. Our farmers are global leaders in sustainability.

Our farmers care for the environment because it is in their DNA to do so. They know how important it is for their farm businesses and for future generations. It does not make sense to to punish our farmers, who are already doing so much to protect the environment, with costly and punishing taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557668">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s carbon tax is not about the environment at all. It is actually just a tax plan. If it was about the environment, the Prime Minister would recognize the sustainability work of our farmers. Taxing our farmers does nothing to help with the environment. In actuality, it harms their ability to reinvest in their businesses and adopt the latest technologies.</ParaText>

The PBO has reported that Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> in its original form would save farmers nearly $1 billion by 2030. What that really means is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants to take $1 billion from our farmers, who already have very thin and often unpredictable margins, so that he can pay for his out-of-control spending habits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557670">Passing Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> in its original form will keep those dollars in the businesses of our farmers and will help keep farming a more viable business. However, we know that the Senate has gutted Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which threatens the savings. The removal of barns and greenhouses from the carbon tax exemption and the shortening of the sunset clause fall very short of what this bill was trying to achieve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557671">These amendments were not requested by farmers or by farm groups, nor was it requested by Canadians. In fact, polling shows that the majority of Canadians support scrapping the carbon tax on farmers. Farmers across commodities were unified in their support of this bill in its original form. Shamefully, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> used Liberal-appointed Senators to gut this bill, and according to the PBO, the gutted bill will eliminate $910 million in relief to farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557672">When it comes to the carbon tax, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not listening. He is not listening to Canadians who are going hungry. He is not listening to the premiers. He is certainly not listening to Conservatives, and he is not listening to our farmers.

              <ParaText id="8557687">Madam Speaker, it is good to be back in this place after the summer, a summer, though, in which I heard a great deal from my constituents about how frustrated they are with the cost, the crime and the corruption they are seeing under the NDP-Liberal government. The government has so badly failed, and that is why tomorrow the Conservatives will bring forward a motion of non-confidence in the government, and we will see where the various parties stand. Conservatives are clear that the tenure of cost, crime and corruption over the last nine years must come to an end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557688"> We will see which parties want to allow the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to continue and which parties in this place want to make their case to the Canadian people and give the people a chance to elect a government that reflects their aspirations and hopes for what the future of this country can offer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557689">In the context of the cost, crime and corruption, we are seeing scandal after scandal that incorporate all three, scandals that involve significant cost to the taxpayer, that involve potential criminal activity that in some cases will likely lead to criminal charges that have already spawned RCMP investigations, and that clearly involve forms of corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557690">I am following up tonight on a question I asked about the arrive scam scandal, a scandal that members will recall led to Kristian Firth from GC Strategies, the principal company involved in the scandal, being hauled before the bar of the House of Commons because he refused to answer questions asked at committee. I pointed out in my question that GC Strategies got tens of millions of dollars in the arrive scam scandal for no work. It simply received the contracts and then subcontracted. It did not do any actual IT work. It did not build the app. It just received a contract and subcontracted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557691">The company was found in 2015. What else happened in 2015? That is the same year the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government took office. The Liberals came into office promising change. The only promise they fulfilled was real change; a lot of things certainly changed in the last nine years. In the same year, GC Strategies was founded. The company has gone on to do very lucrative business with the government, and its activity is staff augmentation. It receives contracts and subcontracts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557692">We have an app that could have been built in a weekend by an actual IT firm, but instead of hiring a firm with IT expertise, the government hired subcontracting middlemen who got the contract and subcontracted all the actual work. Right before Kristian Firth came before the House, there was an RCMP raid as part of an RCMP investigation into GC Strategies' activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557693">There are the costs; Canadians spent tens of millions of dollars on the glitchy app that did not work and sent over 10,000 Canadians into quarantine by accident, Canadians who met all the requirements. There is cost, waste, inefficiency, corruption and the RCMP investigation into criminal activity. The government persists in using the GC Strategies model, in wasting huge amounts of taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557694">It talks about how other parties would cut. I submit that with the waste we have seen with GC Strategies, there is a lot of opportunity to save taxpayers' dollars without having any noticeable impact on frontline services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557695">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the hon. member's question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557696">The Government of Canada shares the member's concerns about alleged wrongdoing in our procurement process, as do all parliamentarians and Canadians across the country. This is why we voted in favour of the motion to call Mr. Firth to appear in the House to answer questions, and we trust that his testimony was fulsome and forthright in responding to those questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557697">Canadians are equally concerned about what they have been hearing in the media and in the committee, and we are using many tools of inquiry and following many avenues as we seek to understand what went wrong in the case of ArriveCAN. It is frustrating that we have had to take the extraordinary measure of a public rebuke here in the House of Commons to get answers to those questions, but the government did vote in favour of doing so, and that consensus speaks to how seriously every member of the House takes the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557698"> There is a complex network of people, policies and procedures in place to ensure that government contracts proceed efficiently, with clear value for taxpayer dollars, and when something goes awry, or worse, as it appears to have been the case with the ArriveCAN contracts awarded to GC Strategies, it is necessary to act decisively to restore trust in the system. The government has taken a number of actions in response to this issue, and I would like to detail a few of those actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557699">Last November, at the request of the Canadian Border Services Agency, Public Services and Procurement Canada issued stop-work orders to GC Strategies, as well as Dalian and Coradix. This halted work on all active contracts with the CBSA while the various investigations moved forward. All departments and agencies with active contracts with these companies were asked to verify their CVs connected to those contracts and that the appropriate consent to use those CVs was obtained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557700">In March of this year, PSPC suspended the security status of GC Strategies and Dalian Enterprises until further notice, and this effectively prevents these companies from participating in any federal procurement with security requirements. More broadly, PSPC has taken concrete actions over the past year to strengthen the oversight of all professional service contracts falling under PSPC authority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557701">The department is actively engaging with client departments and agencies to ensure that these new measures are implemented quickly and efficiently, and our government is extremely troubled by allegations of fraudulent activity at a time when Canada's people and resources were in a tremendously vulnerable state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557702">We know that ArriveCAN was a useful tool to help keep Canadians safe in a time of crisis, but even in exceptional circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that public money be spent with due diligence and that all activities be properly documented. The early development of the application has been an object lesson. The government shares the member's concerns with this member and his desire to hold those responsible to account. This is why, as we continue to support the various investigations and inquiries in this matter, we appreciate all parties' support.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8557708">Madam Speaker, I am back again this evening to continue calling for a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. I am doing so, first of all, because life continues to become less affordable for folks in my community, and corporate profits have a lot to do with it. In fact, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found in January 2023 that for every dollar spent on higher prices in the last two years, 47¢ was converted into corporate profits in four industries, with mining and oil and gas leading the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557709">Lots of attention, in this place at least, has been placed on the carbon tax, but here are the facts. Much more responsible for the increased costs of day-to-day living is the gouging of the oil and gas industry. In fact, in 2022, when the carbon price went up 2¢ a litre, the profits of the industry went up 18¢ a litre. There are no rebates on that gouging. In 2022, the five largest oil and gas companies operating in Canada alone made more than $38 billion. That was after they repaid shareholders $29 billion in increased dividends and share repurchases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557710"> Meanwhile, the climate crisis rages on. Canada is warming at twice the rate of the global average, and the Canadian Arctic is warming at about three times the global rate. The impacts of the climate crisis are being felt across the country with more severe and more extreme weather events, including wildfires that consumed almost 46 million acres in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557711"> The government could both address the affordability crisis and fund climate solutions by taking a step it took with banks and life insurance companies during the pandemic, and that is introducing a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. It is what I proposed in Motion No. 92 over a year ago. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has already studied it. A one-time tax on 15% of profits over $1 billion would generate $4.2 billion, every dollar of which could go toward proven climate solutions that make life more affordable, such as, for example, public transit, to reduce fares and improve service at a time when the government is talking about the next public transit fund not starting until 2026. This money could get that going a whole lot faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557712">It is also well supported, most importantly by Canadians. In a recent nationwide poll, 62% of Canadians supported a windfall profits tax on oil and gas. It is likely why the idea has such strong support among my colleagues in different parties, including the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberal Party. It is partly why the UN Secretary-General, as another example, has called on “all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies”, like environmental organizations across the country. As the David Suzuki Foundation said, “Momentum is building for a windfall profit tax on oil and gas companies’ excessive profits. It’s easy to see why: the fossil fuel industry has made the affordability crisis harder for people while making out like bandit.” Canadians for Tax Fairness has said, “A windfall profits tax is one way to make sure that O&amp;G companies...aren't capitalizing on our affordability crisis.” Other countries have done it, like the U.K. and those in the EU. In fact, the Liberal government planned to put it in last year's budget, but pulled it at the last minute after intense lobbying from the industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557713">It is clear from the polls that Canadians want to see more from the government on affordability and the climate crisis. Why not introduce a windfall profits tax and demonstrate that it has the big ideas necessary to meet the moment we are in?</ParaText>

As we know, since 2015, our government has reduced taxes for the middle class and we take steps forward on this very seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557715"> The member knows that since I was a very young guy, I have always been an environmentalist and a staunch advocate for climate action. We have had many conversations about this and many other issues. I want to state, though, that I do not find the government's contributions and focus on things like active transportation and public transit to be trivial. In fact, they have been massive steps forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557716"> In Milton, for example, one of the first announcements I made was $4 million for a new public transit system. This is in a suburban community without a lot of density. We are just getting there when it comes to public transit being a necessity for our community, but our government has been there as a partner. Whether that is through the gas tax, or through the transfer that we do with the municipal funds, our government really has been there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557717"> Since 2015, our government has reduced taxes on the middle class twice. It has implemented a number of measures to ensure the wealthiest individuals and corporations are contributing their share, most recently with capital gains changes. Some of these things are tough. Hard things are hard. When a government decides to take steps forward to find a fairer way to deal with taxation and the services Canadians require, including child care, dental care, pharmacare and other important services that all Canadians rely on at a free or affordable rate, we know that the wealthiest people in Canada are powerful and have the ability for push-back and, yes, lobbying, as the member pointed out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557718">Therefore, we take those risks; we take them confidently and we step forward for Canadians because we know it is the right thing to do. We believe it is time to ask the wealthiest Canadians to contribute a bit more. It is true that the wealthiest Canadians have gotten wealthier over the last five or six years. We have talked a lot in this House about this K-shaped curve, which, following the pandemic, shows that Canadians who were struggling a bit before the pandemic are struggling more now and folks who had a lot now have more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557719"> Taking this step will allow us to move forward with bold actions announced in the most recent budget and to build a fairer future, with transformative instruments for housing and innovation, with respect to the clean economy and for younger generations. These major investments require new revenues and that is why we have proposed in budget 2024 to increase the inclusion rate on capital gains realized annually, above a quarter of a million dollars by individuals and on all capital gains realized by corporations and trusts, from one-half to two-thirds effective this past June 25. We expect this new measure will generate more than $19 billion in new revenues over the next five years. Thanks to these new revenues, we will be able to build better supports for those who need it most and make investments that will increase fairness for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557720">I reflect back on some of the efforts by the first Trudeau government, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to create a stronger social safety net and more non-market housing to ensure everybody had a place to live. I know a lot of MPs in this House have conversations frequently with people who are really frustrated and struggling and in legitimate need of housing. We have a lack of affordable housing in my community. In fact, I spoke to a gentleman just recently who is living in his truck and has fallen on really tough times. We need to find solutions for gentlemen like him. These measures to tax the wealthiest Canadians—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557723">If he is looking for $4.2 billion that could be invested in making life more affordable for folks in Milton, the same way it would in Kitchener Centre, and if he is wondering where we can find the wealthiest folks to make sure we redirect those funds toward those who need it the most, we have the answer: It is the oil and gas industry, with $38 billion from the top five companies alone. If we even just put a 15% tax on profits above a billion dollars, the way other countries already have, the way economic experts are calling for and the way Canadians are calling for, we could use that money to invest in the public transit I know the parliamentary secretary is a champion for and to invest in retrofitting folks' homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557724"> The question is the same: If the government pretends to understand the climate crisis and the affordability crisis, why is it not moving quickly to put in place a windfall profit tax on the excess profits of the oil and gas industry?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557725"> Madam Speaker, I take exception a little bit to the suggestion that we have not taken note of what oil and gas executives and the mega corporations have been doing. They were at the environment committee, and I demanded answers from some of the CEOs. Frankly, what I heard back from the CEOs was inadequate. It was a demonstration that they actually do not know where they are invested and the impact, particularly on the oil sands side, they are having on the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557726">It is absolutely devastating, but I disagree with the suggestion that the government has not taken all necessary actions to both combat the climate crisis and buoy our economy through what so many economists said, two or three years ago, was a certain recession. We have avoided that recession. We have balanced our priorities to make sure we have protected jobs. We have lowered our emissions. At this time, interest rates are down, inflation is down and gas prices are down.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557727">Madam Speaker, over the summer recess, I had the opportunity to speak with many constituents, as well as many local businesses. I heard first-hand how the carbon tax burden is affecting them. I was invited to tour the Virtex Grain Exchange in my riding, where non-GMO canola oil is produced. The Virtex Grain Exchange is another testament to the resilient spirit of Canadians fighting to make a living after nine years of the Liberal government's disastrous financial policies, none more so than the carbon tax, yet another example of the Liberal government quashing entrepreneurship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557728">As if it were not hard enough to start a new business under the Liberals, their carbon tax is another barrier they have implemented that stifles the growth of small and medium-sized businesses. The Virtex Grain Exchange is being pummelled by the Liberal carbon tax as the price of operation continues to rise, with no end in sight. It is currently being forced to pay over $250,000 annually on the carbon tax. For a company its size, $250,000 would go a long way toward upgrading equipment or toward research and development. Instead, the money is going to fund the out-of-control spending habits of the current government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557729">In fact it came out earlier this year that the promised rebates to small and medium-sized businesses had not been paid out, as the government was sitting on $2.5 billion of unpaid rebates. If that money had not been taken from businesses to begin with, it could have been invested in Canadian industry, allowing businesses to grow and to employ Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557730">The Liberal government refuses to listen to Canadians about the burden the carbon tax places on their personal finances as the carbon tax increases each year, artificially driving up the cost of everything. While the Liberals refuse to listen to Canadians on the issue of the carbon tax, it seems that the NDP spent the summer finally listening to its constituents and has finally pulled its support for the carbon tax after voting for it at least 24 times. However, this is too little, too late. Canadians are paying attention and will hold them to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557731">Can the government, which has lost the support of the House and of Canadians, commit to calling a carbon tax election to allow Canadians to have their voices heard?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557732">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by correcting the record. We have not lost the support of the House. There has not been a confidence vote that the government has lost. In two days, on Wednesday, there is going to be a confidence vote, and all parties have stepped up to say they are just not buying what the Conservatives are putting out there. It is based on false premises. They are, frankly, not being terribly honest with Canadians. This doomsday narrative that they are projecting does not reflect the Canadian sentiment right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557733">Canadians are struggling. It is a challenging time out there economically, but the trajectory is really good. Right now, inflation is down to 2%. Interest rates are on their way down; they are going quickly, faster than they are in the United States. Gas prices are actually extremely low, and they are about to get even lower in Ontario because of the winter gas mix coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557734">As a result, every aspect of the economy is improving. We have to flip to the back pages of the Financial Post these days to find the doomsday narrative that matches what the Conservatives are saying. We cannot take our foot off the gas pedal. We need to keep working hard for Canadians and finding solutions to improve affordability. The only policy suggestion the Conservatives have made over the last couple of years is to remove the Canada carbon rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557735">A province such as Saskatchewan, which generates the vast majority of its electricity with coal, also needs to ensure that it is ushering in innovation. In 2024, such a country as Canada cannot be relying on technology from 150 years ago to generate our electricity. We can do much better than that. The neighbouring province to my colleague's constituency in Manitoba just brought forth a really great subset of green electricity regulations. It is investing in wind. It already has one of the greenest grids in Canada and Manitoba, so kudos to Premier Kinew. However, Saskatchewan continues to boast that it burns coal to generate electricity, as we did at the turn of the last century. It is time to get with the times. We are better than that. We can be much better than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557736">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party and the failed former leader of the Conservative Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, continually suggest that programs like dental care do not exist in Canada. I am sorry. A quarter of one million Canadians have already accessed care, and 2.5 million Canadians have signed up for their dental care plan card.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557737">The Conservatives have also never acknowledged that the Canada carbon rebate even exists in the House, because it does not fit their doomsday narrative. The Canada carbon rebate has proven to be a safety net in some small way for families who are struggling through these times. Yes, gas prices are coming down, but we have been there. We have been there with new programs, with new policies and with money in Canadians' pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557738">I would encourage the member to learn a bit more about how some of the processes work in Canada. Just recently, on June 13, Environment and Climate Change Canada published the data provided to the PBO on carbon pollution pricing relative to the national and provincial gross domestic products for the 2022-30 period. That is over nine years. The data in this report does not represent a comprehensive economic overview of pollution pricing's impact. It only addresses the specific requests of the PBO. However, even the PBO has recognized that carbon pricing is the least disruptive way to reduce emissions. In fact, it was both Preston Manning's and Stephen Harper's preferred method of reducing emissions, something that we have a responsibility to do, not just with our global colleagues, but also for future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8557743">When our government took office in 2015, Canada's carbon emissions were rising fast in multiple sectors. It was not just the oil and gas industry, but it was particularly in oil and gas. Since then, they plateaued and are now starting to come down. They have been coming down for years in a row and, just recently, they were another 2% lower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8557744">As I have stated, times continue to be tough, but inflation is down to the Bank of Canada's target range of 2%. As a result, interest rates are down in Canada. That is taking the heat off of many Canadians. That means their mortgages are easier to afford.</ParaText>
