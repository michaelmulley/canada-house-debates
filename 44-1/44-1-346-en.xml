              <ParaText id="8575053">I rise for the 46th time on behalf of the people of Swan River, Manitoba, to present a petition on the rising rate of crime. Community members of Swan River are struggling with the rising rate of crime in their area. They feel the threat that this crime poses to the community's safety and economic stability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575054">Since 2015, violent crime has risen by 32% and gang-related homicides by 92%. The people of Swan River demand to be heard, since in the last five years, the town's crime severity index has increased by over 50%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575055">The people of Swan River are calling for jail, not bail for violent repeat offenders. They demand that the Liberal government repeal its soft-on-crime policies, which directly threaten their livelihoods and communities.</ParaText>

Access to cell phones is fundamental to land use. Cellular connectivity is a real social, community and economic driver for a modern society. The lack of coverage in some areas of Sainte-Lucie-des-Laurentides causes service issues for residents. Cellular connectivity enables our municipality to develop, thereby contributing to the social and economic vitality of our region. The Government of Canada has a mandate to provide cellular coverage to its citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575058">Mr. Speaker, I rise to present two petitions on different topics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575059"> The first is with respect to safety on our roads. The petitioners note that the best-selling passenger vehicles in Canada are pickup trucks and SUVs, which are characterized by tall, blunt hoods. They recognize that the increasing weight and hood height of pickup trucks and SUVs pose significant dangers to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and occupants of smaller vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575060"> The petitioners describe the increased risk to other road users based on the additional weight of these larger vehicles. They note that Canada's motor vehicle safety standards currently only assess safety for drivers and occupants, neglecting the safety hazards that vehicles pose to other road users, including those I mentioned before, like pedestrians and cyclists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575061">The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to do two things. The first is to require vehicle safety testing that evaluates risks posed by vehicles to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and those in smaller vehicles. The second is to improve safety requirements for vehicle size and weight.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575062">Mr. Speaker, we have not had much time for petitions in this place as of late, so I appreciate the additional time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575063">My second petition is one I have presented before. Some 22% of Canadians have a disability and no building code in Canada currently mandates that housing be accessible. The petitioners describe the implications this has, like hallway medicine and the forcing of folks out of dwellings. More needs to be done to ensure that folks with disabilities have better access to quality, dignified housing across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575064"> The petitioners have two very specific calls to action. The first is calling on the Government of Canada to amend the national building code to make universal design mandatory in all multi-unit housing developments across the country. The second is requiring that public funds for housing be delivered for universally designed housing and accessible housing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575069"> Mr. Speaker, there is an urgent need for an emergency debate to allow parliamentarians to address the crisis in Lebanon. Many of us represent constituents who are terrified and whose families are trapped in this conflict, and we must discuss what Canada can do to promote a ceasefire in the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575070"> On Monday evening, Israeli forces began a ground incursion into Lebanon. This follows a week of heavy bombing in densely populated Lebanese cities by Netanyahu's extremist government. Rockets have also been launched toward northern Israel by Hezbollah, a listed terrorist organization under Canadian law. The use of explosive weapons across Lebanon and Israel is causing massive civilian casualties, particularly of children. Thousands have fled for safety, and a ground incursion risks escalating this conflict further, threatening a wider regional war. Meanwhile, the genocide in Gaza continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575071">This issue is urgent and greatly distressing to many Canadians. The Lebanese community in Canada includes between 200,000 and 400,000 people, and there are around 45,000 Canadians currently in Lebanon. Canada has offered extremely limited evacuation assistance, including commercial flights, many of which have been cancelled. At least two Canadian citizens have been killed in the past week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575072"> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your careful consideration of this request. Many Canadians around the country expect the government to stand up and help Canadians abroad and to alleviate the extreme stress and trauma that so many Canadians are feeling right now.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House call upon the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that a royal recommendation is granted as soon as possible to Bill C-319, An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (amount of full pension).</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575076">He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by inviting the House to recognize the importance of the discussions we are going to have, beyond the context in which this conversation is happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575077">Bills with a budgetary component that are introduced by a party that is not in office require royal recommendation, which can only be obtained by the executive branch. That may sound like a platitude of little importance, but without royal recommendation, Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> cannot become law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575078">This bill seeks to ensure fairness when it comes to retirement pensions for seniors between the ages of 65 and 74. The government is the one that created this discrimination by increasing pensions only for seniors aged 75 and up. We will come back to the government's reasons for such a surprising decision. This bill also enables retirees to earn $6,500 rather than the current maximum of $5,000 without being penalized with respect to the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575079">The Bloc Québécois has set two conditions for propping up a government in dire straits and not pulling the rug out from under it. We made no bones about the fact that this was an opportunity to make gains for a very large pool of Quebec seniors, but also to protect supply management, Quebec's agricultural model and prospects for the next generation of farmers, once and for all. Each time a trade agreement is being negotiated, the government promises that it will not put supply management back on the table until it puts it back on the table. That has to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575080">Since 2019, the Bloc Québécois has been calling on the government to significantly increase the purchasing power of seniors aged 65 and over, who built Quebec and are behind the prosperity we are all blithely enjoying. Purchasing power, those magic words everyone uses, is all well and good until there is a price tag on it. When it costs something, suddenly purchasing power becomes too expensive. I will come back to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575081">The Bloc Québécois was asking for that in 2019, before the pandemic. When I became leader of the Bloc Québécois, we made it a priority because it was a no-brainer. Then the pandemic hit and caused a kind of pre-inflation for retirees, with everything costing more due to their isolation and vulnerability. When actual inflation struck, affecting everyone, it hit the most vulnerable even harder. Interest rates started climbing. If I may be so bold as to mention the agricultural sector, there were increased environmental concerns. The agricultural model has been jeopardized, and the next generation of farmers is facing uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575082">The Bloc Québécois put forward two solutions that are good for Quebec and not bad for Canada, which is great. Both solutions are legislative, not to mention very advanced in terms of parliamentary procedure. Within a timeline now set at four weeks, the House of Commons, the Senate and the government could go through all stages of Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> on seniors and Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document> on supply management. Both bills could receive royal assent, despite how archaic and outdated it is to think that we need the royalty to support a bill that stems from the democratic process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575083">If the fact that all the parties in the House have voted in favour of both these bills at one point or another does not get them passed within the next four weeks, we must ask ourselves whether somewhere, someone who shall remain nameless has not been a hypocrite. If nothing else, we will be able to test this out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575084">The recent sequence of events has created a fair amount of turmoil, it must be said. The New Democratic Party opted out of its alliance with the Liberal Party of Canada, although it is fair to ask whether this is actually the case. The days ahead, maybe the weeks ahead if not the months ahead, will determine the accuracy of this statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575085">
                <Affiliation DbId="311570" Type="2" />The Bloc Québécois captured the by-election in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. This seismic event shook the pillars of a temple that was not as solid as was once thought. There was a motion by the official opposition to bring down the government, all because Joe wanted to be prime minister instead of Jack, even though he might not be so different from Jack because he has no program. Naturally enough, the Conservative motion fizzled out. Next came our proposal for seniors and farmers, which we are taking up today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575086">I would remind the House that this remains a minority government. Replacing it without a program, without an election platform, failing to tell voters what they would do with the mandate they are seeking, this is not an end unto itself. It would change nothing. It means nothing and it gives people no idea about what would come after. I can never get over the fact that the most comprehensive program presented to voters by the parties in this Parliament is the one put forth by the lone party not interested in forming the government. It is so ironic, but we are simply doing our job. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575087">If the government does not accede to our terms, we will get the message and embark on negotiations, which will not necessarily be enjoyable but whose end purpose will be clear. We will negotiate with the other opposition parties to bring down a government that will have abandoned the very notion of being useful to millions of Canadians and Quebeckers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575088">A number of things were said, but they are not necessarily based in fact. The government maintains control over the parliamentary agenda. It has the power to decide which subjects will be taken up and when, and when opposition days will take place. It still has a tremendous amount of control. It might still have some kind of understanding with the New Democratic Party. The government can also prorogue Parliament. The government can send the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to talk to the Governor General for five minutes in English and an election will be called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575089">The government can also respect the clear will of a massive number of people and take into account the fact that we have not tried to turn this into a divisive issue. The Bloc Québécois has a bit of influence on the political or moral objective of this. In fact, the subject we have proposed is not controversial in Parliament. Some might have preferred this to be a controversial subject. At times there are some who hope for failure to justify their political posturing. We have more maturity than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575090">We have proposed something for our most vulnerable, who were vulnerable before the pandemic, who were vulnerable during the pandemic and who are even more vulnerable during this inflation crisis, which also has repercussions on housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575091">The government partially indexed the pensions of Canadians aged 75 and over on the pretext that they needed this more than other seniors. While not entirely false, this justifies nothing. It did not index the pensions of those aged 65 to 74. The real reason seems to be that the government, cruelly cynical in its approach, is telling people to burn through their private pension and if they are still alive once their money runs out, they will be given some more. There is something cruel about this message. It seems beneath an institution that should, above all, exhibit statesmanship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575092">That is really what this is about. The government told us our ask would cost a lot, so we are going to have some fun with this. It would cost $3 billion a year and $16 billion over five years. When we hear that, we all just beat our heads against the wall. Fine. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575093">However, during that same period, no matter how many ways they try to conceal it, Ottawa will be giving between $50 billion and $80 billion to the oil companies, who do not need it. Some of the wealthiest companies in the world, supported by one of the wealthiest banking systems in the world, are going to receive for their shareholders, who are among the wealthiest in the world, between $50 billion and $80 billion over five years. Then we are being told that seniors do not deserve to get $3 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575094">In response to that obscenity, I am telling the government to take at least $3 billion from the money it is giving to the oil companies and, through them, to the banks in Toronto, take a bit more from Edmonton and Toronto and give it to seniors in Canada and Quebec, whose purchasing power has been shrinking for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575095">Since the oil companies are the ones benefiting the most, it is not surprising that the Conservatives, the great defenders of government austerity, are mum on this lavish, excessive, wild spending that is often supported by bad science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575096">We are talking about a lot of people here. Let us put numbers to it. There are one million people 65 to 74 in Quebec that some people are saying no to. The $3 billion we are talking about for all of Canada would serve four million Canadians, including one million Quebeckers. They seem far more important to me than some oil companies and a couple hundred shareholders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575097">We could be hardheaded and cynical and look at it through an electoral lens. Just for fun, let us say no to one million Quebeckers. Let us think about it. We will be helping one million Quebeckers, and beyond that, since we are happy to help others with our motion, a total of four million Canadians, which is no small thing. The merits need to be considered, but I cannot help but think that some people's approach is more cynical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575098">We have been told that we should talk about immigration, and I would like to settle that. We originally talked about giving Quebec all powers over immigration. We even talked about holding a referendum to get them. Now we are halfway through something that we hardly know how to calculate, given that there is more than one kind of immigration and even more than one kind of temporary immigration. We still maintain that Quebec should be given all immigration powers, and we have not backed down or shrunk from our position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575099">However, if we had chosen to debate a motion about immigration, language, secularism or ending the religious exemption for hate speech and incitement to violence, the NDP would naturally have sided with the Liberals, since that is where they reside ideologically. It is no surprise, as we all know. That is not a criticism in terms of the current debate. At no political cost, the NDP and the Liberals would have voted together. That would be the best way of guaranteeing that the government stayed in power until 2025, and perhaps well into 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575100">The best way to achieve the opposite of that, of what some people claim to want, was to choose a divisive topic that offers no real gains, a topic that no one in any capital could ever claim is nationalistic. I think we made the right choice, and we are forcing everyone, all the caucuses, to really think about what they are going to do here. The Bloc Québécois has wind in its sails and has put forward a meaningful proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575101">There is another issue that we would not have solved by going back to immigration because it is just smoke and mirrors. I have yet to hear the Conservatives say they are going to reduce the Liberal target of 500,000 immigrants per year. I have yet to hear the Conservatives say that they reject the McKinsey-led century initiative, which is basically the storyline of James Bond's <I>Spectre</I>. I have yet to hear the Conservatives say they are going to cede all immigration powers to Quebec.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575102">Most of all, I have never heard the Conservatives dare say any one of these three things in English, because the cost for Ontario would be horrific. I have to say that, in this major war going on mostly in Ontario, the Conservatives are trying to please exactly the same people as the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575103">Let me get back to something simple: the actual intention, the common good and statesmanship. I assume that no one in Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton or even Quebec City thinks that $80 a month or $1,000 a year for one million people in Quebec and three million people in Canada is nothing. It is more than the government's dental care program, which interferes in our jurisdiction. No one really thinks that the Bloc Québécois is asking for nothing. Anyone who seriously thinks that needs to listen to what we are saying, so let us pay attention to the words. Words have meaning and they can also have a price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575104">Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> will immediately improve the quality of life of four million people, including those who want to help mitigate the labour shortage, which is still affecting many businesses. Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C‑282</Document> will ensure that supply management is no longer compromised in our trade agreements. All of the discussions and both bills put forward by the Bloc Québécois are currently at an advanced stage. Everyone voted in favour of them at one point or another. These bills help Quebec, and not at the expense of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575105">If these bills are not passed and do not get royal assent within four weeks exactly, we will assume that the government has rejected this opportunity to help four million people, in addition to farmers; a lot of people stand to gain from this. Given the extreme vulnerability of the government and its principal ally, we will act accordingly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575106">Make no mistake, we are prepared to do what we have to do. We have the funds, the issues, the program and the candidates. We are ready to go. It is not what we would prefer in the short term. It is not what Quebeckers would prefer in the short term. However, everyone understands that, if the government does not demonstrate its usefulness and open-mindedness very soon, we will trigger an election no later than October 29.</ParaText>

Over the past few days, I have heard people go so far as to say that playing catch up and returning some purchasing power to seniors will be terrible for young people. Quebec's young people—and I am very happy about this—have a standard of living, a level of prosperity and a level of wealth that we never could have imagined. I am not that old but, that said, I am starting to shrink a little. They have a standard of living that even the generation in between did not envision at the time.

              <ParaText id="8575134">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to address the House on such an important issue: our seniors. There are a couple of thoughts that come to mind right away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575135">Having listened to the leader of the Bloc Party, I would encourage him and his caucus to take a look at some of the policy positions they have taken on programs that are having a positive impact on seniors in every region of the country. We saw it in the form of a question in regard to the dental program, as an example, where there are tens of thousands of seniors who have directly benefited by the program, including in the province of Quebec. Let us think also of the potential of a national pharmacare program. It is something I have been a long-time advocate for. One of the biggest benefactors is our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575136"> These are initiatives the Government of Canada has taken because it is supporting Canadians in every region through providing good-quality, socially progressive programs. The programs are of great benefit to our seniors. Unfortunately the Bloc has made the decision to vote against the programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575137">It was interesting that the leader of the Bloc said that he has an agenda or a plan for whenever the election happens. I suggest the leader of the Bloc Party revisit the party's position on these social programs. The federal government does have a role to play; we have seen that in the past. Where did the old age supplement and the guaranteed income supplement come from? What about the CPP and its parallel in the province of Quebec?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575138">The government, since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took the reins and put together a cabinet with a solid caucus, brought forward programs and initiatives through the budget to really enhance life for our seniors, to be there at a time in which people are retiring, in which there are medical costs and the ability to work is somewhat more limited. This includes the age 75-plus 10% increase on OAS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575139">The programs and initiatives are not just driven by the Liberal caucus or the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are the types of issues on which all of us have received a great deal of feedback in our constituencies and have brought here to the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575140">I will be splitting my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575141"> I want to look at some of the initiatives the government took in 2015-16. One of the very first was the dramatic increase to the guaranteed income supplement. That particular initiative lifted literally thousands of Canadian seniors, the poorest of them, out of poverty. Opposition members did not support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575142">We can look from the very beginning to today at the types of things the Liberals have done. Let us think in terms of the pandemic. Stating the obvious, during the pandemic, we gave one-time payments to people receiving OAS and even more, in terms of the size of the payment, to people who were receiving the GIS. Even more than that, we enhanced many of the services that seniors receive through non-profit organizations, again as a way to support our seniors. The party, generally speaking, has been exceptionally forward-thinking in dealing with the seniors of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575143">People ask why we would do it for those aged 75 and above. A few things instantly come to mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575144">It was an election platform issue. The Liberal Party of Canada, in an election, said that if we were elected into government, we would increase the OAS by 10% for those seniors aged 75 and above. We fulfilled that election platform commitment. That is a positive thing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575145">People ask why we would only do it for those aged 75 plus. Many discussions took place at the grassroots and constituency levels. If we look at the needs of seniors, we find that, as we age and get to 75 plus, our retirement funds, our mobility and our ability to supplement our income are not as great. These are the types of reasons that drove the policy decision that we needed to ensure that those aged 75 plus would in fact receive more money. It was exceptionally well-received.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575146"> What about the individuals facing retirement? I sat in opposition when Stephen Harper, as the then prime minister, did absolutely nothing for those individuals. In fact, one of his initiatives, when he was in Davos, was to increase the age of retirement from 65 to 67. One of the first actions we took back in 2015-16 was to reverse that decision, returning the age of retirement to 65 from 67. That was something we did virtually immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575147"> If we look at the importance of seniors and the issues they are facing, such as health care, they are very concerned. If we look at what is happening in provinces today on issues such as hip and knee replacements, there is a litany of different aspects of health care that are so critically important to seniors. No government and no prime minister has made more of a commitment toward a national health care system than the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government have, with $198 billion over 10 years. That is not to mention the emphasis we have put on things such as long-term care, hospice care, mental health and the need for pharmacare; we now have legislation for pharmacare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575148">This caucus does not need to be lectured about caring for seniors. We have been caring for our seniors from day one, and we will continue to care for our seniors well into the future. If we look at the many budgetary and legislative measures that we have taken as a government, they clearly demonstrate that our government supports our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575149"> We are not alone. There are many other non-profit organizations out there that do fantastic work. For example, I think of the New Horizons for Seniors program, which is throughout all the different communities, as well as the volunteer organizations ensuring that there are all forms of activities for our seniors.

More than 80% of Canadians receive more money back from the carbon rebate than they actually pay in terms of the carbon tax. The sad reality is that the Conservative Party of Canada knows this, but that does not stop them from going out and telling lies to Canadians. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8575175">Mr. Speaker, our government's approach to seniors has been very thoughtful. In my riding, Argenteuil—La Petite‑Nation, we are very involved in projects to help seniors, whether with respect to old age security, lowering the age of eligibility from 67 to 65 or, now, the dental care program. We have also brought in the New Horizons for Seniors program. In Argenteuil—La Petite‑Nation, we have been the champions for many years and the seniors in my riding have benefited from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575176">It is important to me to speak today about some of the measures we have put in place and to remind the House of the significance of our actions to support seniors. As a government, we restored the age of eligibility for retirement to 65 from 67, preventing more than 100,000 future seniors from plunging into poverty. We also put thousands of dollars back into their pockets and increased the guaranteed income supplement by up to $947 a year. That helped almost 900,000 seniors, many of whom live in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575177">We also increased the earnings exemption for the guaranteed income supplement from $3,500 to $5,000, and extended it to self-employment income, which was not even on the agenda. We also granted an additional 50% exemption on employment and self-employment earnings between $5,000 and $15,000, and it is important to remember that the exemption for seniors, up to $5,000 of employment income, still exists. If seniors want to work between the ages of 65 and 74, they do so mostly to avoid isolation and meet people. They also want to earn a little extra money. It is a good way to stay in shape and improve their quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575178">Our government also enhanced the Canada pension plan. This was a gradual process, involving a small increase in contributions to the plan by today's workforce. That means higher benefits for these future pensioners. When I entered the labour market, many more people were contributing to our pension funds. Given the aging population, this is a concern that involves additional responsibilities for a government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575179">It is especially important to remember that we also permanently increased the old age security pension by 10% for seniors aged 75 and over. By doing so, in the first year alone, we gave $800 more to retirees receiving a full pension. Who are these people? They are vulnerable seniors, mostly women, and mostly widows. A large percentage are also people living with a disability. Some 59% of these seniors earn less than $30,000 a year. Giving seniors aged 75 and over a 10% increase was a good measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575180">If I may digress a little, I would like to talk a bit more about old age security. After all, this subject has been front and centre in our debates since 2015. Ever since I was elected we have been talking about the OAS, and we have put several measures in place. The OAS program plays a crucial role in income security for seniors, who deserve all our attention. These are our builders. They led the way in terms of the jobs we have today. The next generation also depends on them in terms of being able to do a good job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575181">OAS benefits consist of three things. First, there is the basic old age pension, which is paid to everyone who is 65 years of age and older who meets the residence requirements. Second, there is the guaranteed income supplement for low-income recipients of the old age security pension. This supplement was increased when I began my term. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575182">Lastly, there are the allowances for low-income Canadians aged 60 to 64 who are the spouses or common-law partners of GIS recipients or who are widows or widowers. As people age, they tend to have lower income and face higher health expenses, which is a problem. This can be due to the onset of an illness or disability. Therefore, seniors face increasingly difficult obstacles, making them increasingly vulnerable, since some are less and less able to supplement their income with paid employment. They run the risk of depleting their personal savings and becoming widows or widowers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575183">I was at one time the parliamentary secretary to the minister of seniors, and I had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of seniors, organizations and groups. I am aware of seniors' needs: We listened to them and, in 2022, we increased the OAS for seniors aged 75 and over, when they are most vulnerable. We know that it was a very expensive measure, but it was worth it for our seniors. We wanted to give them more financial security later on in life, when they are more financially vulberable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575184">This increase improved the financial security of 3.3 million seniors, more than half of them women, as I said earlier. This increase is an important component of the financial support for seniors offered by the old age security program. In 2022-23, we paid out $69.4 billion in benefits to 7.1 million pensioners. This includes almost $54 billion in OAS benefits, and more than $16 billion in GIS benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575185">If I may remind my colleagues, benefits are indexed four times a year. We realize these are not huge amounts, but at least pensions are indexed to the consumer price index, or CPI, every three months. That means that benefits increased by 1.3% for the last quarter of 2024, a 2.8% increase over the previous year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575186">It is important to remember that the Old Age Security Act contains a guarantee that benefits will never decrease, even if the CPI goes down. We will always maintain pension amounts based on the CPI.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575187">That is it for old age security. It goes without saying that this is a measure that makes life more affordable for older Canadians. That being said, our measures to make life more affordable for seniors do not stop there. We need to do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575188">As we all know, we put in place several other measures that have borne fruit. The grocery rebate put hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of low-income seniors. The six-month doubling of the GST credit payment provided seniors with an average of $225. The $500 payment to nearly 2 million low-income tenants, a number of them seniors, helped cover the cost of housing. This too is part of the measures put in place by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575189">There is also the Canadian dental care plan, which I was eager to talk about. This plan offers care to low-income seniors. I recently did a major tour of my riding, criss-crossing the region to meet with seniors. We are proud to have listened to them. Seniors have a pressing need for dental care. This measure, which we implemented for seniors, has been a godsend. It was a very good decision to help seniors overcome this oral health crisis. Oral health is essential to overall physical health. It works hand in hand with proper nutrition and contributes to better self-esteem. This plan has worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575190">For many years we have helped Canadian seniors integrate into their communities. This dental care plan is yet more evidence of what we are doing for seniors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575191">In fact, this year we are marking the 20th anniversary of the New Horizons for Seniors program. I championed this program in my riding, and I can assure members that seniors have benefited from it. They talk about it to this day. We are in the midst of the selection process for the program, and I am proud of this. Once again, this program seeks to help our seniors break out of their isolation. Our government is proud of this assistance. <Sup /></ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575210">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278177" Type="2">Lévis—Lotbinière</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575211">We are gathered here today to talk about seniors. Canadian society owes seniors a tremendous debt. Canadian families owe seniors a tremendous debt. Seniors are the ones who built the country we live in, a country that has unfortunately been broken over the past 10 years but that nevertheless makes us proud to be Canadian, prouder than ever, in fact, in the face of the challenges that lie ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575212">Seniors are community builders. It is thanks to them that this country is prosperous, although it is not as prosperous as it could be. We owe seniors our respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575213">Madam Speaker, I am sure it is the same in your riding. On weekends, when we meet with charitable groups, when we do the rounds in our ridings, we meet a lot of senior volunteers. Where would our country be without volunteers? It would be even worse off than it has been for the past nine years. Seniors step up. They do all kinds of volunteer work in each of our ridings. We can never thank them enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575214">That is why seniors are economically vulnerable. It has been reported that 1.6 million Canadian seniors are low-income. It is especially challenging because they are on a fixed income and inflation has been so brutal for them these past few years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575215"> That inflation was created and fuelled by this government's fiscal irresponsibility. Just a few minutes ago, I heard the Liberal member talk about taking money from here or there. The thing is he is forgetting is that this money is being taken out of taxpayers' pockets. This government has proven over the last nine years that it cannot control its spending. It spends with zero sense of responsibility and thinks that it is no big deal how much it spends, because the budget will balance itself, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> once said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575216">This government has saddled us with a chronic deficit of over $500 billion. Whenever we buy something, we have to pay the goods and services tax, the GST. Those watching this debate should know that every penny paid in GST goes purely toward servicing the interest on this government's debt. None of the GST goes toward programs to enhance Canadians' well-being. It merely serves to pay for this government's senseless, out-of-control spending. This drives up inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575217">Inflation is one of seniors' worst enemies, given that they live on a fixed income. When inflation surges, as it has over the last few months and years, it has a direct impact on seniors. The Parliamentary Budget Officer and the governor of the Bank of Canada have acknowledged that fact. That is why a government needs to be much more prudent when dealing with public finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575218">Earlier, I asked my colleague a question about dividing up seniors. Three years ago, the government tabled a budget that created two categories of seniors: people between the ages of 65 and 74, and people 75 and older. What was its rationale? Why did it divide up seniors? Why did it create one class of seniors that gets more than the other?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575219">Only the Liberals could have dreamt up such an idea. It is so sad to see the impact this has had. I am sad to say that when I chat with seniors and listen to what they have to say, because listening to them is our first duty, some tell me they thought it was very cruel of this government to create these two categories. Why would one senior deserve more than another based solely on their age? After all, they are both retirees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575220">It is very sad to see this government taking advantage of a situation. It made things worse for many seniors. If it were truly interested in helping seniors, it would have acted completely differently. However, to help seniors, one must understand their reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575221">I do not know how many times people 65 and over have approached me in a store or on the street to tell me they wish they could keep working, not full-time, but two or three days a week, so they could keep their hand in, see other people, do some work, contribute to society, and share and pass on their know-how. After spending 40 years at a job, people have knowledge they can share and pass on to the next person, the next generation. They can mentor others two or three days a week.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575222">Unfortunately, today's tax rules penalize work, so some people would rather stay home because going out to work would cost them money. These tax measures could be fixed with the stroke of a pen by a government that really valued work and that wanted to help seniors who are interested in staying active and passing on their knowledge. That is the basis of our party's approach, but unfortunately, it is what the government has been completely denying, especially over the past nine years, despite having the opportunity to do something about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575223">We need this kind of mentorship for the next generation. To be honest, when I go to a service business like a hardware store, I tend to gravitate toward the employees with grey hair. I feel like they will be better able to advise me on a purchase, to make sure I am getting the right thing. That is what seniors bring to the table. Penalizing seniors aged 65 and over who want to work two or three days a week is not the right thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575224">The same goes for fixing the tax measures. In some cases, with the GIS, people get less because they will pay more income tax later on. People often bring this up when we meet on the weekends or when they call my riding office looking for clarification. People should not be penalized. These measures can be corrected with the stroke of a pen in a budget if the will is there. Unfortunately, this government has failed in that respect. Moreover, with the stroke of a pen, it decided to separate seniors into two groups: older seniors and younger seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575225">It is a shame to see that today's seniors are struggling. Every generation has its challenges, but it is important to understand that this generation of seniors has had some very big challenges. Many of them were born during the Great Depression and went through it. They lived through the hardships of war. Although Canada was not invaded, people here still had to suffer through rationing. These are the people who built and created post-war wealth. These are the people who are responsible for the baby boom, the period when families had lots of children, who then contributed to the country's prosperity. The least we can do for seniors is to respect their choices and their lives. Too often, we have seen this government introduce inflationary measures, which have cost seniors dearly. This must be taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575226">Soon, I expect, when we have a chance to express our opinion on this government and decide Canada's future, people will remember its reckless, out-of-control spending and belief that the budget would balance itself. They will remember that it is going to take us decades to pay that off. Today, our debt has topped over $500 billion, in large part due to this inflationary government, aided and abetted by the Bloc Québécois 189 times. Each time, when confidence in the government hung in the balance, the Bloc Québécois gave the government its support. We saw it do so again recently for the 189th time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575227">Today, the Bloc Québécois will have an opportunity to vote on another confidence motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575228">I can assure you that we, on this side of the House, have no confidence in this government. We will have to wait and see whether the Bloc Québécois will give this government its vote of confidence for the 190th time, or not.</ParaText>

However, if the Bloc Québécois really wants to put pressure on the Liberal government, all it has to do is vote with us, the Conservatives, this afternoon to defeat this government. Otherwise, the Bloc Québécois will continue to be known as the “Liberal Bloc” for some time to come, if not forever. As the saying goes, heaven is blue and hell is red. There is nothing worse than the pact that the Bloc Québécois wants to make, which will hold the public hostage and keep everyone under pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575245">I would like to talk about the Canadian dream. Forty years ago, young, hard-working families were able to settle down, buy a home, start a family, eat well, buy all of the necessities required for a good life and take vacations. All of this was possible thanks to the honest work of honest people who, day after day, got up in the morning to provide for themselves and their loved ones. Unfortunately, for the past nine years, day after day, extreme policies, like the carbon tax and other tax measures, have been taking more and more money out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers. Now, the work is not worth doing and hard work is not fairly compensated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575246">People are being penalized for working, because it is costing far too much in taxes, thanks to the Liberal government's inflationary policies and the myriad of expenses that this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has incurred in recent years. Despite our best efforts, our country's debt has reached such a level that future generations will be forced to use a lot of the money they earn at work to pay the interest on the debt. All of the revenue from the GST goes toward paying the interest on the debt. That means there is a lot less money to spend on social services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575247">Let us come back to our seniors. I would like to pay tribute to all of our Canadian seniors who worked all of their lives, who worked hard to give us the Canadian society that we have now. Unfortunately, the Liberal government is undoing all of that work with its bad policies. Our seniors believed that all of the sacrifices that they made over a lifetime of hard work would mean that their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren would have a good future, a promising future, in Canada. That was the Canadian dream.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575248">Today, the Bloc Québécois is once again using smoke and mirrors by threatening to pressure the government, while knowing full well that it will hypocritically support this incompetent Liberal government yet again. The Bloc Québécois is trapped by its own promise to leave the Liberal government in power because it has issued the October 29 ultimatum. The vote on this Bloc Québécois opposition motion will probably take place on Thursday of this week, and it will not bring down this government. No need to worry, we can rest easy. Because of the “Liberal Bloc”, there will not be an election until October 29.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575249">I would like to point out that the only thing the Bloc Québécois will achieve today is perhaps grab some headlines. It certainly is not defending the interests of Quebeckers and all Canadians. I truly believe that we need a change in government, and that is in the best interests of our country. The Bloc Québécois's pernicious strategy right now is to draw attention to potential electoral gains in the coming weeks and months, unfortunately targeting a vulnerable population. Unfortunately, it still aims to achieve more in the House, but it will never be enough for it to form government. Then again, if it would align itself with the next Conservative government, we could make substantial progress for all Canadians, for the Bloc Québécois and for all Quebeckers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575250">I am reaching out as I repeat here in the House that, if the Bloc Québécois truly intends to bring down the Liberal government, I invite it to vote with us this afternoon and send a strong message that the Bloc Québécois is ready to work with the next Conservative government for all Canadians and Quebeckers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575251">The Bloc Québécois makes no secret of the fact that it is a sovereignist party. It has repeated that many times here in the House. Its real dream is to return to Quebec City, to the National Assembly, to go back to its parent company, the Parti Québécois, and work on sovereignty. We must all work together in the interest of all Canadians and the Canadian federation. The Bloc Québécois is merely a refuge for Parti Québécois members when they do not have a lot of seats in Quebec City.

              <ParaText id="8575253">The Bloc Québécois also insists on keeping this government on life support. The treatment is becoming overly aggressive. The Bloc Québécois's attempt at bargaining has very little chance of succeeding. It comes at the expense of Canadians from coast to coast to coast who are calling for real change. The Conservative Party will improve the quality of life of all Canadians, at a time when the rising cost of living is affecting every single person. We are committed to improving the lives of seniors who have worked hard all their lives and deserve to live with dignity. That is why we previously voted to move forward with Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>. However, the fact that the Bloc is now holding it out in exchange for keeping this dying government alive shows it is a political ruse with very little chance of success. If the Bloc Québécois really cared about people, it would instead support a Conservative non‑confidence motion and change the leadership of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575254">However, we in the Conservative Party support the principle that we need equality among seniors and that we have previous generations to thank for this country's prosperity. We owe them nothing less than our eternal gratitude and the means to live a dignified life. Seniors' vulnerability is therefore a very important issue, but the Bloc Québécois's strategy serves no purpose.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575257">It is high time to call an election. It is still difficult to understand why the Bloc Québécois is opposed to that. It is either because of its close ties with the Liberals or because of a strong bias against the Conservatives. At the same time, we know how many seats the Bloc Québécois had in the House when we were in power, so we can understand their reluctance. Quebec was respected and even recognized as a nation by the Right Hon. Stephen Harper in 2006. The Bloc Québécois is not unfamiliar with contradictions.

              <ParaText id="8575280">The NDP support the motion because, unlike Conservatives and Liberals, we believe that every Canadian deserves to live with dignity. This callous and cruel Liberal government does not. This patriarchal vision is how the Liberals govern. They hoard and keep resources for themselves, along with their corporate friends and allies, leaving Canadians behind. Most obvious in this patriarchal culture is the cruel perpetuation of the oppression and abuse of indigenous peoples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575281">On the day after the day to take time to reflect on truth and reconciliation, the calls for justice for murdered and missing indigenous women and girls are still unmet, and women continue to go missing. The killing of indigenous people by RCMP and law enforcement over the past months led to an emergency debate in the House a couple of weeks ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575282">Genocide of indigenous people in Canada is well documented. For women, it was about erasing them through death and enfranchisement. Their legal rights, identities and connections to their communities were targeted based solely on their gender, and that continues today. I recently raised in committee a report, which was presented to metro Vancouver-elected officials many years ago, called “Red Women Rising”. The indigenous presenters from the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver said that no indigenous woman should be homeless on her own land, yet that is what is happening today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575283">Conservatives are no better. Racist John A. Macdonald and the Conservatives created the Indian Act and residential schools. Macdonald is quoted as saying this about his Indian agents: “the agents as a whole…are doing all they can, by refusing food until the Indians are on the verge of starvation, to reduce the expense”. Reducing expense has always been the will and culture of the House when the NDP were not within it. The NDP is the only party that believes everyone is equal in this country and that everyone deserves to share in its abundant resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575284"> Women and children have always been the targets of white patriarchy and the lack of government investment. Today, when we talk about old age security, it too is rooted in the vision, shared by the Liberals and the Conservatives, of controlling and defining the family. Women are affected by low pensions because the House decided that they should stay home, should not be part of employment insurance, should not be working outside of the home, and were not able to earn an equal income to men. Now, 75 years after the Employment Insurance Act was put into place, women do not have the same rights as men. Women are affected by low pensions because they are not able to earn an income equal to that of men. They work in the not-for-profit sector and in caregiving, which pay much less. Do members know why? It is because they are women's careers, according to patriarchy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575285">I think about those caregivers, who had reduced earning potential and are now affected by a reduced OAS because they could not earn the same income as a man. I think about the 65- to 74-year-olds who the Liberals have decided do not deserve to have the same pension, do not deserve the measly $73 more that these Liberals are refusing them. They have to wait until they are 75 for that extra $73. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575286">Women took the time and off-ramped their careers to stay at home and raise their families because it was so discriminatory out there in the workforce. My own mother tells the story of when she was pregnant and working in a doctor's office. She was told to rest every day at lunch and had to go and lay down. After her tummy started to show a bump, they told her she could not come to work anymore.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575287">I think now about caregiving and how caregiving has come around. We now know that many people who are aged 65 to 75 are actually working in care homes, caring for elders, and then doing unpaid care at home. The Liberal government thinks that 65- to 75-year-olds should be at work. We did not want them at work in the forties, fifties and sixties, even in the seventies, but we want them at work now. In 2024, we want them at work. It is not acceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575288">StatsCan recently did a study of employment by choice versus necessity for seniors. It broke it up by those 65 to 75 and 75-plus. The Liberals actually did a study on why one should stay at work when one is 65. Through this study, they found that 20% of seniors aged 65 to 74 worked due to necessity. That is good news for the Liberals because now they can say that we need to stay at work, that, because they have made housing and food so expensive, they want us to stay at work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575289">For immigrant seniors, that percentage is even higher. I will take a moment here to say that the most at-risk people aged 65 to 75 are men who rent. They need to stay at work to keep their housing. It is an absolutely cruel and callous housing policy of the Liberal government's, and the Cons are worse on housing. They lost 800,000 affordable housing units and they want the power back. Forget it. We cannot afford to lose another 800,000 units of housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575290">The Cons do not care about people. They voted against dental for seniors. I was just at a dinner this weekend at a church. There was a number of people who approached me to thank me for the dental care program. They have actually been able to get their teeth fixed. The Conservatives are voting against diabetic medication. Have any of them ever had an aging parent with diabetes who cannot afford their medication? It is life-threatening, yet they vote against pharmacare. They voted to deny pensioners aged 65 to 75 their hard-earned pensions while they can take theirs at 55. These Conservatives and Liberals, sitting MPs, when they leave the House, will be able to take their pension at 55.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575291">I think about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party, who has a whole diatribe about pensions right now. That member would take pensions in the millions and has the audacity to come in the House to say that he is not going to feed kids, not going to give us any diabetic medication and not care if we live in a tent. It is not just that. This is gross and sickening: in B.C., the Conservatives are taping people living in tents and putting it out on social media for their own gain. It is absolutely sickening. The Cons want people living in poverty so that they can gain power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575292">I want to talk about this bill and the royal recommendation needed. I totally agree. The callous and cruel Liberal government would not give a royal recommendation for the Canada disability benefit. How many times have I tried to get the government to provide an adequate income for persons with disabilities with the Canada disability benefit, and it said no?

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8575324">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's important discussion, since it has to do with our country's seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575325">However, while I have the floor of the House for a few minutes, I would like to point out that the NDP, like many tens of thousands of families in Quebec and Canada, is extremely concerned about the situation in Lebanon. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> asked for and was granted an emergency debate in the House to discuss the alarming situation in Lebanon, particularly in the south, where there has been heavy bombardment in the last few days. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and forced to flee. Some days, there have been hundreds of civilian victims, among them many women and children. The situation is critical, and there is a risk of regional conflagration. The NDP will call on the federal government to do everything in its power to bring about a de-escalation and ceasefire, save human lives and put measures in place to bring Canadian citizens home from Lebanon. Canadians with families in Lebanon are extremely concerned about the fate of their loved ones and want them to be brought back to Canada for their safety. Incidentally, I spoke on the phone this morning with people from the Montreal area who are worried about their loved ones and are trying to get them home. The discussion or debate later today will be extremely important for us to find out the intentions of the Liberal government regarding the alarming situation in Lebanon for civilians, particularly in southern Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575326">The subject that we are discussing today as a result of an opposition day motion is important because it has to do with the plight of seniors across Quebec and Canada. I am pleased to speak to this subject, because this situation has been a cause for concern for years. The motion before us talks a lot about the discrimination that the Liberal government created between two classes of seniors, seniors aged 75 and up and those aged 65 to 74. This difference did not exist anywhere else before. However, in 2021, the government increased the old age security pension for people aged 75 and up. We applaud that measure. It was a good thing, given that many of our seniors are living, or trying to survive, in terrible poverty. We are not opposed to that increase, especially since I was horrified to learn that it was the first real increase in the OAS since 1973, the year that I was born. It has been a while. My beard has turned white. Apart from indexing adjustments to try to keep pace with inflation, no government had made any real increase to old age security for 50 years, so this extra help is very welcome. I even think that it shows respect for our seniors. However, what about seniors aged 65 to 74? Why has the Liberal government abandoned them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575327">There is no inherent logic to it, except perhaps a cost issue. If that is the case, then the Liberals need to say so. Is it just a matter of money, and is it just because they lack the courage to go get the money where it is in order to help our seniors living in poverty and to lift them out of it? The NDP will obviously support the motion before the House today, because we think that it is the right thing to do in the fight against poverty, in support of seniors and in a fairer and more equitable society. Then we can go back and talk about the way of going about it, which is something that we may have some doubts about. Seniors are being hit hard by the rising cost of living and rising rents. There are seniors who are underhoused, with some living in their cars, trucks or tractor-trailers because they can no longer afford housing and because there is no affordable housing left, due to the 1993-94 cuts that were never restored, and there is a lack of investment in community-based social housing and housing co-operatives. Housing is an issue that really hits home for many of our seniors, who are sometimes in practically unlivable apartments that are health hazards and can cause a whole bunch of other problems.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575328">We often talk about the cost of groceries. The Liberals' total inaction on the cost of groceries is truly appalling. I remember quite well when the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> said that he was going to summon the CEOs of the major grocery chains to give them a piece of his mind. He wanted to ask them to do something, but they did nothing. In the end, nothing changed. Then, we found out that these CEOs had gone back to their offices, said they had a meeting with the minister, but that it was not going to change their pricing policies in the slightest. As a result, we saw the price of groceries skyrocket and seniors struggling to feed themselves properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575329">In our work as MPs, we meet with many groups, community organizations and individual people. Some of these people are quite desperate and need help from all levels of government. One of the things my office does, and I believe other MPs do the same, is take part in tax clinics every year. In doing so, we really help the poorest of the poor. Along with other members of my team, I volunteer with Revenu Québec. When I sit down at a desk and look at the income of someone who receives only old age security and the guaranteed income supplement, I seriously wonder how that person manages to survive. No one can live on such a woefully inadequate amount. It is distressing that we are letting our seniors down and consigning them to poverty when there are simple, effective ways to make their lives better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575330">What I am pleased about is the fact that the work of the NDP caucus in recent years has helped seniors in a meaningful way. During the 2021 general election, we campaigned on the fact that a human being's health extends from head to toe, and that there is no reason why some parts of the body should be covered, but not others. We said that we would go to Ottawa, to Parliament, and fight for a dental care program. At first, everyone said that it would be impossible, that it would cost too much, and that the federal government would never agree to it. However, we came to this minority Parliament and used our leverage to force the Liberals to do something they had always refused to do. Before the 2021 election, they voted against dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575331"> The Bloc Québécois also voted against dental care. As for the Conservative Party, there is no telling what they would do if unfortunately they were ever to come to power. They could do away with the program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575332">Our gamble paid off, and the program is a major win for seniors. Parliament decided to prioritize them. In all three phases of the dental care program, seniors were given priority, thanks to the NDP. Today, over 3.5 million people are enrolled in the program. According to the latest figures that I have seen, 645,000 people, the vast majority of them seniors, have benefited from the program. They have been to the dentist, and their treatment has been fully or partly covered. I spoke to one lady who received two sets of dentures free of charge. I spoke with another lady who saved $2,900 on her bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575333"> That is real. We kept our promise, and that is something that I am extremely proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575334">I am also proud of the fact that of the nearly 700,000 people who have been to the dentist, 205,000 are Quebeckers. In other words, 32% of the people who have benefited from the program are from Quebec. Quebec represents 23% of the population. I find it a bit odd to hear the Bloc Québécois criticize the dental care program when it is Quebeckers who are taking advantage of it the most out of all the provinces. I would like to make a small correction: when people say that Quebec already had a dental care program, that is not true, since it is a program only for children under 10. For older people, seniors, teenagers and adults, there was absolutely nothing. We wanted that to be done, we wanted to help people in a meaningful way. We are very proud of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575335">There is also the framework for pharmacare. Too many seniors in this country are making agonizing choices between rent, food and drugs, which is having an impact on their health. People could have access to drugs and equipment for diabetes, for example. Millions of people are going to benefit. That is something meaningful that the NDP has offered to people. I could answer my colleagues' questions during the few minutes that are left.</ParaText>

The Conservatives are no friends of seniors. On the contrary, they will make cuts to seniors' services and pensions if they ever get back in power. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8575362">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that I will be sharing my time with the charismatic and charming member for <Affiliation DbId="278373" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation>, who is going to captivate us with his vast knowledge and legendary enthusiasm. Are we saving the best for last? We shall see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575363">I have so much to say. So many questions have been raised. First of all, the Liberals asked a number of times whether seeking royal assent on an opposition day is the right approach. Why not? An opposition day gives the opposition parties a chance to put a given topic on the agenda. On the one hand, we have a Liberal government that makes promises and does nothing, or does very little very slowly, promising sunny days ahead but delivering nothing. On the other hand, we have the Conservatives who want us to replace the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>. If that is meant to happen, it will happen in due course. What we want, however, is substance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575364">We looked at the current situation and asked ourselves what issues we could push forward in the coming weeks and months. We did not choose the topic of immigration because, as my leader said this morning, we knew very well that the NDP would support this vote. What we want is to deliver something and show that we will no longer tolerate this government's inaction. We need action, not just lip service. What we are calling for today, with this request for royal assent, is concrete action. It is that simple. If we do not ask for it this way, how will we ask for it? Should we accost the government members in the hall and beg? They will keep saying, “Yes, in two weeks”, hoping to put us off until Christmas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575365"> The vote following this opposition day will force the government to take a stand. That is why, in the motion, we are asking for royal assent. When I hear members say that it is ironic that the Bloc Québécois is calling for royal assent, what am I supposed to say? Until proven otherwise, we are stuck within the Canadian federal system. Rather than sitting at home and complaining as we watch the federal government act against the interests of Quebec, we thought that we could co-opt this government, go to the federal Parliament and be the voice of Quebec until Quebec is a country. That is what we are doing. However, we have to work within the institutions in place, or else we do not get any results. The Liberals can continue to poke fun at the fact that we are asking for royal assent, but that does not make us monarchists at all. There is no need to worry. On the day that we get to leave this country, we will be very happy. That day is coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575366">What is today's topic? As I said, we in the Bloc Québécois wondered what we could gain. We looked at reasonable, sensible, intelligent bills that had the support of the majority in the House of Commons. That is another important factor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575367">Earlier, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278177" Type="2">Lévis—Lotbinière</Affiliation>, if I am not mistaken—</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575368">

                <B>Mr. Yves Perron</B>: Mr. Speaker, it was him. I was right. He is applauding me, and that does not happen very often. Mark this day on the calendar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575370">Earlier, this Conservative member was criticizing us for working for gains. He criticized us for receiving media attention. There are seniors here on Parliament Hill today. The group from my riding includes people aged 72, 75 and so on. It is not just people under 75 who want to see this change, but everyone who believes in justice and fairness. These people have driven a little over three hours to get here, and I am sure there are others who have driven even further. They will drive back the way they came, which means they will have driven a total of six or seven hours. That is a lot for an older person. Why are they doing this? Why are they here? Why do they feel so strongly about this? They know that MPs work for them, so they decided to come support us. That is nice. Does that mean we get more media attention? Yes, but it is not just a photo op. It is to put pressure on the government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575371">What are we talking about today? We are talking about this vote and a possible election call in the event of a non-confidence vote. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about gains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575372">Some television commentators are saying that the amount we want to give retirees adds up to about $1,000 a year, or $1,200 for those entitled to more. Obviously, each case is different. For someone who earns less than $30,000 a year, $1,000 a year is a huge amount. It makes all the difference when it comes to choosing which size or brand of product to buy at the grocery store. It makes all the difference when setting the thermostat in an apartment. That is what it does. We are talking about allowing the people who built Quebec, who worked all their lives and who deserve a decent standard of living, to live with dignity, free from stress at the end of every month. That is what we are talking about. When it comes right down to it, today, we are not talking about the Bloc Québécois, the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party or the New Democratic Party. We are talking about seniors. Can we give those people a decent standard of living?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575373">We are not asking for much. We could have asked for a lot more, but as I explained at the beginning of my speech, we have asked for things we can get, things that are already in the works and that will really make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575374">The old age security issue was voted on unanimously in committee. The committee that studied the bill voted unanimously. Representatives of the Liberal government sit on that committee. Basically, the purpose of the motion seeking royal assent for the bill is to stop hypocrisy. The aim is to keep members from voting and saying that they support seniors, that they have always been there for seniors and that they will continue to be there for seniors, while refusing to grant royal assent behind closed doors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575375">Our decision to shine a light on this issue is not a PR exercise. We are applying political pressure to achieve a specific result. I want to achieve this. I think seniors deserve better than the stress of running out of money in the last 10 days of the month. To me, that is unacceptable. Ten minutes is obviously not a lot of time, but I could have talked about my many years of experience acting for my father under his power of attorney. He passed away last year. He rests in peace, but I want to salute him even though he is no longer physically with us. I sometimes had to make major, unexpected outlays because his independence and health were declining and his home needed to be adapted. My father worked for Canadian National and had a good pension. As a result, I was lucky enough not to have too much trouble managing his affairs. We were able to give him decent care. However, I constantly thought about people with no money. I wondered how they managed. Today we are voting on a matter of human dignity. This is not just for show. We are leveraging our opportunity to gain something. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575376">The other important gain we are trying to make is protection for supply management. I would remind members that this issue received the support of nearly 80% of duly elected members of the House. The bill in question has been languishing in the Senate since June 2023, collecting dust. This week, the members of this committee are again deciding to conduct long-term studies without prioritizing the bills duly voted on by a majority of the elected members of the House of Commons. That is undemocratic. They are just trying to hold up the bill until the election is called, so they will not have to vote on it. That is another thing we are pushing the government on, since it is the one that appointed 80% of these senators. We are asking the government to talk to them. I think it could talk to them more often and ask them to move faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575377">We are going to ask the same thing for Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>. That is why we need to hurry up, get it passed and send it to the Senate. A private member's bill that involves spending needs government approval. It needs to leave this chamber with that approval and a message to the Senate that it needs to be passed quickly. We will not wait another year and a half for Bill C‑319 to pass. We have to be serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575378">These two bills can pass quickly. Our agriculture industry needs it, and seniors need a decent standard of living.</ParaText>

The Conservatives need to get down to business and show us some content. If they are serious about their endeavour, they need to move a motion that we can support.

              <ParaText id="8575394">His question will allow me to expand on something. It is a profound injustice. Do members know what is behind this scheme? I think the government decided that it was going to increase old age security to 75, that it would cost less, that it would allow the government to give more money to its friends, the oil companies, and at the same time, that it would encourage people aged 65 who do not have enough money to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575395">That is not a good way to do it, because it is not fair. Just because someone is 65 does not mean they have not been sick and have had the same opportunities as other social classes. There are people who have worked very hard physically all their lives and are no longer able to do so at the age of 65 or 66. They need the pension. This government decision is putting them in the poor house.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575398">Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that October 1 is National Seniors Day. We could not have picked a better theme for this debate.<Sup /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575399">When I think of the issue of seniors, I always immediately think back to 1980. Members will recall that on the eve of the referendum campaign to counter René Lévesque's Mouvement souveraineté-association, the Canadian health minister at the time said ad nauseam that seniors would lose their pension if the “yes” camp won. She even threatened to immediately make $4 billion in cuts if Quebec became a country. At the time, the government was led by the Liberal Party of Canada, which was led by a Trudeau.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575400">We see that in 2024, while Ottawa refuses to increase the pension for all seniors in a context where their purchasing power is plummeting, it is our presence in Canada that is threatening the dignity and quality of life of seniors. We will remember. We have to face the facts, and they paint a grim picture indeed. The population is aging. There are now more people 65 and over than children under 15. An estimated 25% of the population will be 65 and up in 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575401">According to the most recent statistics, 52% of old age security pensioners aged 65 to 74 and 60% of those aged 75 and up have an income of less than $30,000. The gap between the median income of seniors aged 65 and the rest of the population has quadrupled in 20 years. That means that, over the years, seniors' income growth has not kept pace with workers' income growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575402">When we add the context of inflation to this bleak picture, the situation becomes dire. Between September 2021 and September 2022, the price of food went up by 10%. Food prices rose faster than the generalized cost of living index, which rose 7% year over year. That is the tragedy of a world where inflation is wreaking havoc upon us like a vengeful spirt. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575403">It is not true to say that only older seniors have more expenses. Younger retirees have to pay for housing and home maintenance, and they often own cars while they are still in the workforce. The cost of medication is the same whether a person is 18, 65 or 75. The same goes for the cost of groceries. Leisure activities and medical needs can also cost a lot. It is a gross generalization to say that only people aged 75 and up have more expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575404">Ottawa, the capital where inertia and indifference intertwine in a macabre synergy, has responded with shameful mediocrity and employed nothing but ad hoc measures. Budget 2021, as members will recall, included an OAS increase, but only to seniors aged 75 and over. Consequently, the vast majority of seniors, who are between 65 and 74, were left behind. It took two years for the Liberals to finally follow through on this promise, which dates back to 2019. In August 2021, a one-time cheque for $300 was sent to seniors, again only to those aged 75 and over. This was on the eve of the September 2021 elections. Barring a rather providential coincidence, the stunt was as crude as it was disgraceful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575405">Fortunately, it is possible to take matters into our own hands, on two fronts. Our Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> emerges as a beacon of hope amidst this darkness. To offset rising debt levels, a growing number of seniors are returning to the workforce. We therefore need to improve incentives for those who wish to return to work, especially in the context of labour shortages. Bill C‑319, which does not just propose to increase pensions, would enable seniors who would like to work a bit to do so without being penalized by increasing from $5,000 to $6,500 the exemption for income from employment or contract work taken into account in calculating the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575406">The best-known part of the bill is the pension component. We also have a responsibility to provide the best possible financial security to our seniors who are choosing instead to take a well-deserved rest.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575407">That is why Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> amends the Old Age Security Act to increase by 10% the amount of the full pension that all pensioners aged 65 and over are entitled to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575408">These two fronts should be able to provide these builders with a little breathing room. However, that is only if Bill C-319 passes. Furthermore, it still needs to receive a royal recommendation. These words have an inherently negative ring to my ears and to those of my Bloc Québécois colleagues. As my colleague said, we have no choice, since we are still part of this system; it is not as though we enjoy it. Besides, if anyone finds it particularly ridiculous that we are asking for a royal recommendation, then they should have voted with us when we proposed to abolish the monarchy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575409">Personally, I dream of a country, ours, the country of Quebec, the only country where we can feel fully ourselves, and the only one where we are fully ourselves. It will never leave anyone behind, young or old. I dream of a country that will provide the builders of yesterday, who, by the way, have yet to make their last contribution to our homeland, with the full support that they deserve. Between now and our urgent and necessary independence, we need to provide seniors with some comfort, which is what Bill C-319 proposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575410">It is not clear what the Liberals will do when they vote. We now need the rest of the members. That is the beauty of a minority government, recently brought back to minority status. I call on the Conservatives, the New Democrats and the Greens to show Ottawa the direction that it needs to go in, the only direction that makes sense, that of respect for our seniors.</ParaText>

It did not get a royal recommendation because it would affect the fiscal purse. The same goes for this one. We cannot blindly ignore the rules by which the House has to govern.

It seems to me that, based on another parliamentary practice, royal recommendation is granted much more quickly when a bill comes from the government.

              <ParaText id="8575427">Mr. Speaker, it is very important to speak to a topic of great importance for Canadians from coast to coast to coast and the many seniors who I have the privilege of representing in the riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575429">Before I begin talking about some policy measures and so forth, I would like to give a big shout-out to the seniors in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge and the city of Vaughan. Many of them come from the Italian-Canadian community. They immigrated to Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. They came here and worked extremely hard. They sacrificed for their kids so they could have a brighter and better future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575430">I see many of these seniors at picnics in the summertime and when I am out in the community. They are our labourers, carpenters, bricklayers, electricians, road builders and construction workers. The Italian-Canadian community has contributed to building our country to be the greatest one in the world, in my humble view. I owe them a debt of gratitude and I thank them. I get to interact with them, share a few laughs with them and, most important, I get to listen to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575431"> My parents, Rocco, who is in his late eighties, and Vincenza, who is in her early eighties, are doing very well. They worked very hard to contribute to building our country. They also worked very hard so their three boys could have a bright future, which all three of us do. Canada chose us. It selected us to come to this country, and I always keep that in the back of my mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575432">When it comes to seniors, all seniors are owed a secure and dignified retirement. I think about the measures we put in place as a government to help seniors, such as the Canadian dental care plan. We reversed the Conservative policy and restored the age of eligibility for old age security and guaranteed income supplement back to 65 from 67. We increased the old age security by 10%, or $800 a year annually, for over three million seniors aged 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575433">We enhanced the Canada pension plan to increase the CPP maximum payment by 50%, or to over $1,800 a month, for future retirees, coming together with all the provinces in our initial term. We increased the guaranteed income supplement for single seniors, our most vulnerable seniors, the majority of which are women, up to $1,000 annually, which is benefiting a million seniors and lifting tens of thousands out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575434">We increased the GIS earnings exemption from $3,500 to $5,000 and a partial exemption of 50% for earnings between $5,000 to $10,000. Again, this is another measure that direct helps Canadian seniors across our beautiful country, ensuring that all seniors live in a dignified and secure retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575435">On the Canadian dental care plan, I am so happy that over 70,000 individuals in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge, over 20,000 in the city of Vaughan, have now received coverage under this plan. Those numbers represent primarily seniors. If there is one measure that I know is transformational for seniors, it is the Canadian dental care plan. Many Canadians no longer have dental coverage when they retire. This fills the gap. We need to be proud of this measure and support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575436">We, as a government, made a promise to restore the age of eligibility to 65 from 67 for old age security and the guaranteed income supplement. We kept that promise and we delivered for Canadian seniors. If that measure had been kept in place by the opposite party, seniors would have lost over $17,000, in today's dollars, in old security income for those two years. That was a wrong measure to do at the time. We fixed it. We will always have the backs of Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575437"> Increasing old age security by 10% for seniors aged 75-plus benefited over 3.3 million seniors and represents $800 annually. This was not a small fiscal measure. It is $3 billion annually that comes out of the fiscal purse to support our seniors. It was the right thing to do because, as we know, when our seniors age, the cost pressures on seniors increase, their retirement savings tend to diminish a little bit, their partner may pass away and so forth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575438"> In enhancing the Canada pension plan, the former finance minister came together with the provinces because we needed to get the provinces' agreement to sign off on changing the Canada pension plan. The Liberals did it; we delivered. Now, future retirees will go from one-quarter coverage of their earnings to a maximum pay of 15%, but it is really one-third of their earnings that will be covered under future retirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575439">The other measure we promised and we delivered on was increasing the guaranteed income supplement by 10%, or nearly $1,000, for individual seniors. This assisted one million of the most vulnerable single seniors, lifting tens of thousands of seniors out of poverty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575440">We have accomplished much for Canadians, but there is always more work to be done. The Canadian dental care plan is another step in that direction, and so is the GIS earnings exemption. We know that many seniors wish to stay in the labour market. We want those seniors to flourish and to work. We increased the exemption amount on their earnings from $3,500 to $5,000 and the partial exemption of 50% of earnings between $5,000 and $10,000. These are concrete measures that we know help seniors. All these measures combined have strengthened Canada's retirement system, which we know depends on: pillar 1, the Canada pension plan that we all work towards and contribute to both as an employer and employee; pillar 2, the old age security and the guaranteed income supplement, which we know benefits millions of seniors; pillar 3, which tend to be RRSPs and TFSAs that seniors can contribute to; and pillar 4, private pension plans, which many Canadians receive, including my parents, who both worked for private sector unions, and that help Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575441">That is our retirement system, but there is always more work to do. I always welcome new ideas. We have done a lot, but we also know seniors across Canada have been impacted by global inflation. It impacted all countries around the world. We know a lot of seniors face pressures. With regard to delivering more help to seniors, we know the carbon rebate assists seniors. They receive much more than what they consume, in terms of GHG emissions and so forth. We know that has helped.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575442">I rose last week and said Canada is the best country in the world. This is Canada's decade. Not only because of our economic policies but because of the social policies we put in place, such as the Canadian dental care plan, the Canada child benefit, our early learning and national day care plan, and the Canada workers benefit. Our social fabric has been strengthened. Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, Canadians have been pressured by global inflation, which now is back down to 2%, the bank's target rate, which, in my humble opinion, will allow the Bank of Canada to further reduce the interest rate in the months to come. It has gone down 75 basis points. I hope to see much more, and as an economist, I think it will. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575443">We continue to do the right thing. Equally important, we continue to do it within a fiscal framework that maintains our deficit-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest in the G20; maintains our credit at a AAA rating; maintains the finances of the country in an envious position throughout the world. We know it. We know what the economists, the IMF and the World Bank say about Canada's fiscal position. It is a strength. Anybody who has worked in the global financial markets, like myself, would know that and would say that we maintained it. We will continue to maintain it, and we are going to continue to move forward to help all Canadians, whether it is families, seniors, workers or businesses. It is great to see all these small businesses popping up and growing in the city of Vaughan. I have attended probably about a dozen new small-business openings. It is wonderful to see that confidence back. Yes, we have gone through some hard times. We had the global pandemic. We have war in Europe for the first time in 80 years. We had supply chain blocks. We had global inflation. Nonetheless, Canada is strong, and its best days are ahead of us. I know that. I believe in that and I cannot wait to keep going forth and advocating and putting forward policies that will continue to strengthen our country.</ParaText>

The reversal of the age for old age security, which was put at 67 and announced in Davos, Switzerland, is back to 65 and done, putting $18,000 in the pockets of seniors. Increasing old age security for seniors 75-plus with $800 a year, benefiting 3.3 million seniors, is done. Increasing the guaranteed income supplement by up to $1,000 for a million of the most vulnerable seniors in Canada is done. Increasing the guaranteed income supplement from $3,500 to $5,000 and then 50% from $5,000 to $10,000 is done. Sitting down with the provinces, showing leadership and enhancing and expanding the Canada pension plan for future retirees is done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575453">We will always have the backs of Canadian seniors. They deserve the utmost. They deserve a secure and dignified retirement, much like my parents have, and have earned, because they worked and sacrificed, and much like the community members in my riding, the seniors who came here and helped build this country. We will always have their backs of the LiUNA 183 members, the LiUNA 506 members and all the private sector construction workers. We will always have their backs, and I will always fight for them day in and day out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575454">Mr. Speaker, we are debating supports for seniors here today. Seniors, especially on fixed incomes, are struggling, but I just came from a human resources committee meeting where we were talking about people with disabilities. We have the new Canada Disability Benefit Act that was rolled out by this government. It is only available for maybe one-third of Canadians with disabilities, and it is only $200 a month. It is really a slap in the face to the people with disabilities who really need supports to get out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575455">We heard from witness after witness today that this needs to change and that we have to fix these disability supports so that the people who need them really can access them.</ParaText>

When I am with Ethan, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law, I fully comprehend what they go through on a daily basis, as well as the services and support they need, not only from society and government, but from the family.

I see my little nephew, and I see what my brother-in-law and sister-in-law do to fight for him, what they have to go through and the obstacles they face.

              <ParaText id="8575459"> Mr. Speaker, it is good to be here. I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278684" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation> for his great speech and for sharing his time so that I too can participate in the debate on the motion brought forward by the Bloc on supporting seniors. I will also be talking about the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575460">Before I get into it, I want to share a bit about what constituents in the riding of Waterloo are sharing with me and sending to my inbox. I have had a range of emails come through, which I have really appreciated because it demonstrates that people are watching. The good people of the riding of Waterloo are watching the calibre of debate in this House. They are listening to the words being exchanged. They are noticing that they need to be concerned and that we need to have these tough discussions. Oftentimes, they talk about things that are important to them, and planning for tomorrow, the future, is always of utmost concern.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575461">One thing that has been brought to my attention, which I have been trying to raise today on the floor of the House of Commons, is discussions on processes to advance legislation, whether it be a private member's bill or government legislation. When it comes to spending and the need for a royal recommendation, people might not recognize what a royal recommendation is for. A royal recommendation is needed when there is an expenditure the government needs to be aware of. For a private member's bill, if there is an expenditure the government needs to be aware of, it has to give a royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575462">Today's opposition day motion calls on the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that a royal recommendation be granted as soon as possible, and a private member's bill is referenced that would amend the Old Age Security Act. This is concerning. As I have been asking in the House, is this the proper mechanism for receiving a royal recommendation?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575463">Under former prime minister Stephen Harper during the decade of darkness, the Conservative government was notorious for using the backdoor, as we say in this place, by advancing private members' bills on the floor of the House of Commons that oftentimes would threaten the rights and freedoms of individuals, hard-fought rights and freedoms. The Conservatives would do it through the backdoor, through a private member's bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575464">A private member's bill requires only a limited amount of debate. It is prescribed; there is no adding to the debate. It can even become less by way of UC motion, but it cannot increase. Often, the former Conservative government compromised members in this place, and Canadians from coast to coast to coast, by using that backdoor. Today, my concern, which I am raising on behalf of some of my constituents, is about that: Is an opposition day really the right way to advance a private member's bill? Is it the right way to receive public dollars to advance a benefit?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575465">I will never challenge the work that seniors and the people who have come before us have done. They are instrumental. Today is National Seniors Day and I am very grateful to the people who have broadened my horizons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575466">My grandfather is not alive today, but yesterday, we went to go visit a dear friend of his, Ruprayankul, who is like a grandfather to me. I have a few people who, when my grandfather passed away way too early, came up to me and said, “Bardish, you still have a grandpa in me.” Jathra Hujadadajee is another person who is near and dear to my heart. I really value seniors. I really value the work they have done. When it comes to ensuring that seniors have adequate resources, that is important to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575467">What seniors are sharing with me is that this government, under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has done a very good job of ensuring that benefits are means-tested. This means people who need the benefit are receiving the benefit, and people who do not need the benefit are not receiving it. I will give an example: the Canada child benefit. It was a taxable benefit under former prime minister Stephen Harper. Every family with a child 18 and under would receive $100 per child, and then at tax time, that benefit would be taxed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575468"> With the one hand, the government of the day under former prime minister Stephen Harper was giving this benefit to help Canadians raise their kids and give them the things they needed, and with the other hand, it was being clawed back, taken back. That did not make sense, because families that needed the benefit spent it to help raise their children, so we came forward with the Canada child benefit. What we said is that families with children who needed the most would receive the most, and families with children who had the most, often the wealthiest 1% of Canadians, would not receive the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575469">I will say that the first year was tough. People really felt like the government of the day was taking something away from them. However, within a year, the good people of the riding of Waterloo said that if their neighbours were doing better, they were doing better. They appreciated that. They understood the benefit of having it be means-tested. This brings me to today's conversation. I know that certain people, especially seniors, are saying they always need more, but can we at least, as a government, ensure that people who need the most get the most?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575470">As for the opposition day motion, I have not figured out how I am voting. I am reading my inbox and constituents' mail, so I am participating in this debate because it is important to me, but what I am hearing from some constituents is that they do not need this additional money per month. Sure, I could challenge them and say that if they do not need it, they can donate it, give it to somebody else. However, what they are saying is that this benefit needs to go to the most vulnerable. People who need this benefit should receive this benefit. People who do not need this benefit should not receive it. I thought that was quite compassionate and caring of them. It reminded me of generations before and the people who have been kind and generous enough to provide people like me opportunities. They have taken me under their wing to ensure that I, the child of immigrants, am able to maximize my abilities to contribute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575471">There is a concern over the tool being used to advance a royal recommendation. It is of concern to me because we have already seen the dysfunction, frankly, in the House of Commons. It has been spotlighted too many times. At some point, we need to ensure that the government of the day is held fiscally accountable, and randomly granting royal recommendations is probably not the way to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575472">I want to talk a bit about the Canada pension plan. Some might ask why. It is because it is one of the top-ranked public retirement plans in the world for seniors. For seniors in Canada, it is vital, and I would be remiss if I did not reflect upon past decisions that have been made, especially during the decade of darkness under former prime minister Stephen Harper. Not only did he close Veterans Affairs offices, but he also decided that it was necessary to raise the retirement age.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575473">Seniors have simply never been a priority for the Conservatives. Today, they have come back to talk about their common-sense plan, but I would be remiss if I did not remind Canadians, especially people in Ontario, of former premier Mike Harris and his “common sense revolution”, which brought about Walkerton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575474">What else his “common sense revolution” did was shut down our hospitals. People talk about our housing issues and the crises that the country is facing today, but it was actually under former premier Harris that hospitals were shut down, including centres with support for mental health and illness. Former premier Harris, a common-sense Conservative premier, thought it was wise, rather than providing supports to these individuals, to put them in the streets and allow that to be their place of existence. We do not agree with that. We know we can do better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575475">The Conservative Party talks about common sense, but common sense would be supporting dental care for seniors. Common sense would be restoring the retirement age to 65. Common sense would be working to ensure that Canadians do better, not through slogans but by having respectful debate and dialogue. Those are all measures the Conservative Party does not support, and it is interesting that the Bloc also voted against them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575476">Today is a challenging day with this debate. I do not believe that Quebec should separate, which is one thing that I will always differ from the Bloc on, but I do know that the Bloc follows the rules. That is why asking for a royal recommendation this way is challenging for me. I just wanted to put that on the record.</ParaText>

I see seniors as a tremendous asset. Seniors enable communities to grow, thrive and develop a deeper sense of solidarity. Seniors create solidarity.</ParaText>

We are seeking a royal recommendation for Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>. We are devoting an entire opposition day to debating this matter because we want the government to understand how important it is to grant a royal recommendation so we can end discrimination between two classes of seniors. Today is a special day not only because October 1 is National Seniors Day and the Bloc Québécois's opposition day featuring Bill C‑319, but also because seniors are demonstrating on Parliament Hill. Some 200 seniors from all over Quebec were on the Hill today to lend their support to Bill C‑319. Their demand was clear: an end to discrimination between two classes of seniors.

              <ParaText id="8575504">Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member took fiendish delight in calling me on that. Maybe he wants to be the whip in the next Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575505">The debate we are having on this opposition day is very important. The Bloc Québécois did not conjure this out of thin air. As everyone knows, this has been one of its priorities since 2019. Just this morning, our position was endorsed by the president of the FADOQ network, the Fédération de l'âge d'or du Québec, which represents nearly 600,000 Quebec seniors. There is also the Association québécoise de défense des droits des personnes retraitées et préretraitées, the AQDR, which advocates for retirees' rights. I am pleased to say that two delegates from the Valleyfield-Suroît branch of the AQDR, Lucie and Benoit, came here today to speak out against this terrible injustice on behalf of their organization.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575506">The Bloc Québécois cannot understand how the Liberals across the way do not see this as an injustice. When people turn 65, they pay the same rent as when they turn 75. They have the same basic expenses as 75-year-olds, be it at the grocery store or the pharmacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575507">Not everyone 65 and over has the ability to work. I am very active in my riding and I meet a lot of seniors in a year. They all talk about the rising cost of living. They all tell me that they are having a tough time making ends meet and that they have to make tough choices. They do not understand this government's decision to increase OAS by 10% for people 75 and up, but not for people aged 65 to 74. In Salaberry—Suroît, nearly 20% of the population is 65 or up. They do not all have the privilege of having a private pension in addition to the payments from the Quebec pension plan and old age security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575508">There are seniors who worked hard all of their lives, without missing a day of work, and it was not always under the best conditions. I am thinking of Ghislaine, who worked all of her life at La Lanterne restaurant in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. She started young and stopped at 65. Both her knees and hips were finished. Her body was tired from working so hard, but she worked. Even so, she had to find a little job to make ends meet, because her pension was not enough, and neither was the guaranteed income supplement. When we call for fairness among seniors aged 75 and up and seniors aged 65 to 74, this is not just something that we pulled out of a hat.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575509">I am also thinking of Normand, who turned 65 and who works as a packer at the Ormstown grocery store to make ends meet. Normand battled cancer. When a person earns a small salary and receives a small pension and then they have to stop working to fight cancer and they do not have enough money to pay their bills, it is very stressful. It can even interfere with their recovery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575510">When I think about the condition that our seniors, who built our nation find themselves in, I think of an old adage that says one can judge a society by the way it treats its seniors. Lucie Mercier asked me to talk about this in my speech. According to Judith Gagnon of the AQDR, how well we look after our parents, our ancestors, our predecessors, our most vulnerable citizens and those who built our nation defines who we are and where we are going, and an aging population only reinforces how important the proverb is.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575511">We hope that all parties in the House will do the right thing and support Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>, and that the government will take responsibility and get a royal recommendation so that it can be passed and enacted. This means that all seniors aged 65 and over will have the same amount on their old age pension, and the income that can be earned per year before GIS benefits are reduced will increase from $5,000 to $6,500.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575525">My question is about the best way to do it. The Bloc Québécois wants to increase the old age security base amount, which provides benefits with little variability to seniors who earn of up to just over $148,000 a year. While the guaranteed income supplement is intended to provide seniors with monthly geared-to-income support, low rates still leave many people living in poverty at a time when the cost of living is rising.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575527">Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague, who is always so thorough in the way he asks questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575528">There are many other ways to support seniors. I think that the Bloc Québécois, in its last election platform, also suggested tax incentives, among other things. I think that when someone purports to run a progressive or social-democratic government, choices also have to be made. What we understand about the current government is that it has deliberately chosen to lose billions of dollars to tax evasion and invest billions of dollars in the Trans Mountain pipeline. These are difficult choices that the government has made, but they are still choices. We are responsible for the choices we make. Right now, we are not calling into question the universal old age security pension plan. I understand that my colleague would agree with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575529">What we are saying is that Canada can afford to provide seniors aged 65 to 74 with the same monthly old age security pension. We know it can, but this means making the right social-democratic choices. I have a feeling that it may not necessarily be prepared to support our motion being debated today. This makes me really sad because this means that it is making it loud and clear that it is abandoning the most vulnerable seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575530">Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today on a matter of fairness, justice, and respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575531">Being a senior in Quebec and Canada simply should not mean living in poverty. Although history is forever repeating itself and is almost always worse, let us look at the history of the old age security program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575532"> The program was created in Canada in 1927. The Liberal government of Mackenzie King, the man who spoke to ghosts, set up the program in that dismal year, and it would expand significantly in the decades that followed. In an attempt to counter the constant criticisms of the Conservatives, who opposed the welfare state, successive governments have, from the start, tried to restrict access to pensions as much as possible. Humiliating measures known as the means test were implemented way back in 1927.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575533">Here are some of the bright ideas the government had at the time. To qualify for assistance, parents had to prove that their children could not support them financially. Government officials even went so far as to encourage some elderly parents to sue their children for maintenance. Recipients' eligibility could be withdrawn once they began receiving other pension payments. Payments were even recovered through claims against the estate of dead recipients. Fortunately, these measures were abolished. However, the back-and-forth between expanding the plan to fight poverty and implementing measures to restrict access in order to reduce costs continued throughout the 20th century.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575534">Why am I going over the complex history of the old age pension program? Because that back-and-forth continues to this day. Hounded by those who oppose all spending and have zero interest in fighting poverty, the Liberals came up with an all-new approach. They created two classes of seniors. People might be surprised to hear a sovereignist remind the party in power about what is in the Constitution, but under section 94A of the Constitution, old age pensions are indeed a federal responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575535">I would like to focus on the issue of jurisdiction. Canada was first created as a confederation. In a confederation, the provinces hold most of the power. Quebeckers were told they could govern their province in peace, without too much interference. Later, a federation was imposed on them without asking their opinion. Just like that, the Canadian federation was born, with a nice lie told at the starting gate so the francophones would not rise up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575536">In English Canada, however, the measure did not meet with unanimous approval. Why make concessions to the losers? The Constitution of 1867 was therefore based on a lie designed to reconcile the irreconcilable: on the one hand, the Quebec people's desire for self-determination, and on the other, the desire for unity of the citizens of British origin. That is the whole history of the federal system in a nutshell: a tug-of-war between those who believe the real power is in Quebec City and those who believe the real power is in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575537">It is ironic that a separatist MP has to remind the House yet again of how the Canadian Constitution works, whereas the government never misses an opportunity to remind us that the Constitution must not be touched and to say that all the issues related to it do not matter to Canadians and Quebeckers or that Quebeckers do not care about jurisdictions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575538">As it turns out, the Liberals are no longer federalists because they no longer believe in the federation and the separation of powers. Everything the Liberals and the NDP said all morning was about interference. They said they support dental insurance and programs that interfere in our jurisdictions. As my <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> says, interference plus incompetence equals the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575539">Here are a few examples of incompetence and interference. When the figures are adjusted for population growth, Canada now has 25% more federal civil servants per capita than eight years ago. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, total spending on employee wages has grown by $21 billion since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to power. The most recent figures pegged it at $60 billion. Another nearly $15 billion per year went to consulting firms. We know that consultants are needed to provide expertise that the government lacks. However, it makes no sense to increase the number of federal employees to that extent while giving tens of billions of dollars to consulting firms.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575540"> After that, they say there is no money for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575541">Among other recent examples is the more than $13 million doled out to GC Strategies alone for the ArriveCAN app. Another $190,000 was spent on food and planes for the government's Indo-Pacific tour. Impressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575542">When it comes to the economy, there was the 10-year, $13‑million subsidy to Volkswagen. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> chose to help a foreign company with profits of $34 billion, up 12.5% in one year, yet he remains unmoved by the 37% rise in bankruptcies among fully Canadian companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575543">Another example of mismanagement is the fact that net debt has risen from approximately $700 billion to $1.3 trillion as of February 2024. Federal debt has risen from 31% of GDP to 42%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575544">As for the environment, in July 2019, when Project Reconciliation presented its first proposal to then finance minister Morneau, the estimated cost of building the Trans Mountain pipeline was over $7 billion. Since then, the bill has ballooned to $34 billion, according to the latest documents filed by the Crown corporation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575545">According to Environmental Defence, the federal government allocated over $20 billion in subsidies to the oil and gas industry in 2022 alone. We are currently studying this issue in committee: $167 million was invested in projects that were either ineligible or in a clear conflict of interest within Sustainable Development Technology Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575546">I have tons of examples like that. I could spend all day on them without even going into detail. This is a case of mismanagement, incompetence, and serious interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575547">Once again, the Liberals and the NDP insist on talking about dental insurance. Why does it take a sovereignist to remind us what the Canadian Constitution says? Dental insurance is not a federal jurisdiction. For once and for all, can we put that to rest?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575554">I invite the member to reread the Constitution. Jurisdiction is a simple matter. It refers to the sandbox in which the federal government can work. The best example is that, in the case of dental insurance, the government could have saved $2 billion by simply transferring the money for dental insurance to Quebec, which already has its own program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575555"> If it wants to increase dental insurance coverage, if that is the priority, then that is fine. However, in that case, the government should transfer the money unconditionally and let the Quebec government manage its health care plan as it sees fit, with the program that already exists, not go through a private company that will ultimately provide inadequate service, because we know that it is going to be inadequate. Instead, the Quebec government needs to be given the money to manage its own jurisdictions. The Liberals need to stop talking about dental insurance and look at what they have done. This is a very good example when it comes to the economy. I have given tons of them, but this is the best one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575556">The government needs to prioritize the issues that are within its sandbox. Within the sandbox, there are many things that could be prioritized. However, despite the priorities within the federal government's sandbox, it decided it would rather give money, billions of dollars, to the oil companies. That is the truth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575557">What are the Liberals going to prioritize? I am asking them today, in this debate, whether they will continue to prioritize the oil companies or will they finally invest in seniors, people who have worked their entire lives and who deserve not to have to go to food banks to be able to eat. I am asking the Liberals to remain focused on their areas of jurisdiction, to increase old age security for people aged 65 to 74, to honour their own Constitution and to be consistent. They need to either honour the Constitution or reopen it, and we will see how Quebeckers respond.</ParaText>

We have a progressive tax system, so it is not true that some seniors do not need it. Yes, there is a segment of seniors who receive old age security who may need it less than others, but they receive a smaller amount. It is called a progressive tax refund. Everything is already taken into account. That problem does not exist.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575575">It is important for Canadians watching at home to remember that such motions are not binding on the government. That said, it is important to discuss the measures in Bill C‑319 and the Bloc Québécois's other demands. As everyone knows, this is once again a minority Parliament. We usually go vote by vote, and the Bloc Québécois has made two requests. As a member of Parliament who is not a member of the Privy Council, I will share my perspective on what I believe to be the best way forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575576">I want to begin by sharing a thought. I represent the small riding of <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, where the issue of supply management is extremely important. My riding is home to largest concentration of supply-managed farmers east of Quebec. I was rather surprised to see that the Bloc Québécois motion did not include any measures or considerations regarding the importance of supply management. I was also rather surprised to hear the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> raise this important point last week. He also talked about how important it is for all parliamentarians and the government to protect the supply management system. It is very important for our farmers, but also for our food security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575577">Personally, I have some concerns about the U.S. presidential election and the position of the next U.S. Congress on the issue of supply management. I was in Washington this summer. It is not just one American party. It is not just the Democrats or just the Republicans. Representatives of both parties will have the opportunity to raise the issue of greater access to the Canadian market. It is very important for our parliamentarians to educate themselves and to resist this idea, because our supply management system is more important. The Conservatives are taking a very weak position in this respect. Many Conservative members voted against Bill <Document DbId="11829353" Type="4">C-282</Document>, which sought to protect supply management. All of the other MPs, especially the Liberals, were in favour of the bill and of protecting supply management.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575578">I want to remind farmers in my riding and other ridings in Nova Scotia that it is important to keep an eye on the Conservatives.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8575579">In the past, Conservative governments have allowed cuts to accessing the system, willingly, without necessarily negotiating it away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575580">There are a lot of seniors in Kings—Hants. They are important, and they are the type of seniors, by and large, who are blue-collar workers. They are seniors who have worked in forestry. They have worked in agriculture. They have worked in the type of industries where they may not have large pensions, unlike people in other areas of the country and maybe in bigger urban centres.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575581"> I have taken great pride, over the five years I have had the privilege of being the member of Parliament for Kings—Hants, to try to be an advocate in this space, because we do have to make sure that our seniors have a dignified retirement and that we are taking measures to support seniors across the country, including indeed, for me, right at home in Kings—Hants. Our government has been there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575582"> Our government has been there, and there are a few things I want to point out to my hon. colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575583">When Mr. Harper was in government, he was proposing to actually move the retirement age up from 65 to 67, such that seniors in Kings—Hants would not have been eligible for old age security or the guaranteed income supplement until age 67, had the Conservatives had their way. Of course our <Affiliation DbId="310517" Type="4">Minister of Seniors</Affiliation> has pointed out that Mr. Harper made that decision and policy choice at the World Economic Forum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575584">However, we are the government that actually brought the retirement age back to 65. We have invested in old age security for those who are age 75 and up, and I know that is part of the conversation piece, representing over $3 billion a year in new investments for seniors. We have also supported long-term care facilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575585"> We have invested in dental care. I had the opportunity to talk to some of my constituents, who have said to me, “Look, I haven't had the opportunity to have my teeth cleaned in over five years. I haven't been able to visit a dentist, because I just can't afford it.” Our government, with the support of the majority of members of Parliament, actually created a program where now close to 80% of dentists across the country are participating. That is extremely important, as it is a measure that supports not only health care for seniors but also affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575586"> The members who voted against the measure, namely the Conservatives, like to talk about seniors, but when it comes to the measures that actually support them, they vote against them. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> talks about pensions and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">Burnaby South</Affiliation>, yet he is not willing to support seniors' dental care in my riding of Kings—Hants or anywhere else in the country. He says it does not exist, but almost a million Canadians now have benefited from the program, notably our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575587">Let us talk about the threshold before there are clawbacks. Our government has been increasing the amount of money that a senior can earn before it is clawed back on the guaranteed income supplement or on their old age security cheque, which is important. We had moved that from $3,500 up to $5,000, and now it is 50% more, from $5,000 to $10,000. That is great; however, I would like to see the government do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575588">Hopefully in the fall economic statement, in the budget, we can see it go even higher, because for seniors who are still able and wanting to contribute by working, we do not want there to be an impediment to their doing so because they are worried about losing their seniors' benefits. Therefore we need to go higher, and I believe that the government has the ability to do so and will do so in the days ahead. We will see where our other hon. colleagues stand on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575589">Let us talk about the health care investment. When I talk to seniors, I hear that they worry about health care. We have been there as a government to step up. However, the Conservatives voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575590">The point I want to make is that, as it relates to seniors, I am proud of the record the current government has. We have one of the lowest poverty rates of seniors in the world, which matters. This is not just a feeling, an emotion, but a fact. Are there challenges out there that we have to continue to address? Absolutely there are, and I may not agree with the entirety of the motion before the House here today as it relates to doing something to support seniors between 65 and 74.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575591"> However, I think that particularly for our lower-income seniors between ages 65 and 74, we have to be there to make sure we can support them. In fact it is in the Liberal platform to make sure we can identify those seniors who would be on the guaranteed income supplement, to support them in the days ahead.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575592">When we look at the Bloc's voting record on support for seniors, it immediately becomes clear that they do not really care about seniors' needs. The Bloc voted against dental care for seniors, against lowering the retirement age, and against increasing the GIS.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575593">Generally speaking, the initiatives in this bill are good, but it is important to understand that, with regard to the motion that the Bloc Québécois is moving today, it is very difficult and very rare for a government to grant a royal recommendation.</ParaText>

Today, we celebrate seniors across our country and acknowledge the significant contributions they have made to our families, our communities and society at large. From fighting for our freedoms to building the railroad, highways, schools and hospitals, as well as creating vibrant community centres and gathering places, seniors have helped build the great country Canada is today.</ParaText>

The CSLA is a group of provincial associations across the country that advocate for seniors on a national scale to address their issues. I say congratulations to the Canadian Senior Living Association on its launch and happy National Seniors Day to our seniors. I thank them for all they have done and continue to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575668">Next week is the anniversary of October 7, a day Hamas attacked Israel, slaughtered over 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of others. Then a wave of anti-Semitism swept across the world, people here at home telling Jews to go back to Poland, firing shots into our schools, yelling hateful slogans outside our community buildings, setting up encampments on university campuses and attacking our support for Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575669">I pray this new year is a better one. I pray for a world where Israel can defend itself from Iranian and Hezbollah missiles without being condemned, and one where it can live securely in peace with its neighbours. I pray for a Canada where Jewish Canadians can feel safe again, as all governments take real action to confront anti-Semitism.</ParaText>

Critically, those agreements include, for the first time, common indicators so we can see progress in data and see how provinces are doing. Obviously, there is work to ensure that hundreds of thousands of seniors get dental care, as well as what we are doing with pharmacare.</ParaText>

The lack of mental health support, treatment, recovery and harm reduction services is causing irreparable harm. The Liberal government has failed to deliver the urgently needed supports, and young and older people are paying the price. Indigenous people continue to die at a higher rate than non-indigenous people. This is not reconciliation. Action is needed now.</ParaText>

Canada's lawyers are saying,“Canada does not owe any legal obligations or duties to operate [first nations] water systems.” They even say that when ministers make promises, it is just context-specific and can be ignored. This is the Liberal approach to reconciliation: promise clean drinking water to first nations and then direct lawyers to fight first nations in court on clean drinking water.</ParaText>

Since we have taken office, we have lifted over 145 long-term boil water advisories and prevented well over 200. We are going to continue that hard work.

The source of the comment was not immediately apparent to the Chair, nor was it to the editors of the Debates, who attributed them to “an hon. member”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575874">After question period, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278619" Type="2">Edmonton Griesbach</Affiliation> rose on a point of order, claiming that the comments were clearly homophobic, and asking the Chair to look into the matter. Several other members referred to this specific situation the following day, on Thursday, September 26, pressing the Chair to rule on it. At some point, accusations were made directly toward the member for <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation>, who was suspected to have said the alleged words.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575889"> We have all taken extensive training in sexual harassment. One of the key parts is that intent does not play into findings in those proceedings, but it is how someone receives them that matters, even though someone says that they have no intent. Therefore, I would like the Speaker to reflect on that to see whether the workplace sexual harassment policy applies in the chamber or whether it applies just outside the chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575890">It is a genuine question, and you can take time. I do not know the answer to it, but we did sit in many sessions with respect to sexual harassment training. I think the hardest thing for me to get in my head was that I might say something that I do not think causes offence, but if it is heard that way, then I need to own it. I just do not know whether that actually applies in the House or not.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8575909">Madam Speaker, today we are discussing a very interesting and very important topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575910">We are touching on two important issues. The first is the situation of our seniors. The second is the state of our public finances, especially when the government is dealing with certain constraints that might limit what it can do with the programs it wants to develop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575911">In all honestly, I do not think we can accuse the Bloc Québécois of being opportunistic about this. We can accuse the Bloc Québécois of a lot of things. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278398" Type="2">Honoré-Mercier</Affiliation> often used to say, we can accuse the Bloc Québécois of picking fights, but in this case, we cannot accuse the Bloc Québécois of being opportunistic. It has been calling for this for quite some time now. It has been consistent about these demands. However, and I will come back to this later, I think we can accuse the Bloc Québécois of improvising a bit on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575912">As for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, in my opinion, she comes across as truly sincere. Seniors are certainly very important to her. She is a strong advocate for them. She stands up not only for seniors in Quebec, but also for those in Canada as a whole. In fact, she is very supportive of seniors from the rest of Canada. We might wonder if that support could one day lead to support for federalism. Who knows? I remain hopeful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575913">The first thing I want to point out about the Bloc Québécois's position is that the Bloc knows very well that age 75 was not chosen arbitrarily as the threshold for the OAS increase. It was not picked out of a hat. There is a certain logic behind choosing 75 as the age when the OAS is increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575914">There are exceptions, but the situation of people 75 and over differs from that of people under 75. For example, the data show that people 75 and older are more likely to outlive their savings, to be unable to work, to be widowed and to have greater health care needs. One telling statistic is that half of seniors over 75 have a serious disability, 57% are women and four in 10 are widowed. In short, the situation of seniors 75 and over is, as a rule, different from that of seniors under 75. We try to be precise when setting a threshold, but it is tough. There are always exceptions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575915">The retirement age was set at 65 a long time ago. One might even say that it is a bit of an arbitrary number. Why not 63, 62 or 60? It is hard to be absolutely precise about everyone's situation, but decisions still have to be made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575916">It is also important to note that old age security is not the only program where the amount of benefits changes with age. Take, for example, the Canada child benefit, which decreases at age six. Obviously, the government decided that this benefit would decrease starting at age six, not at age five or seven. Setting a threshold at which a benefit changes is not unprecedented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575917">Yes, the OAS could be increased for those under 75. Many programs that are very important to the well-being of Canadians could also be enhanced, such as the Canada child benefit, which I mentioned. It is a program to reduce child poverty. In a world with no budget limits, of course we would always want to do more for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575918">The Canada disability benefit could also be increased. The maximum has not been reached. The government just introduced this new benefit, and we are working with the provinces to ensure that, if it is enhanced, the provinces will not reduce their investments. We have to be fairly strategic with the provinces, but ultimately, the goal is to provide a much more generous benefit. We could achieve this more quickly and aim for an even higher maximum. This is another program that could be improved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575919">The child care program could also be improved. Why should child care cost $10 instead of $7, $6 or $5?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575920">Federal health transfers could also be increased. The Bloc Québécois always accuses us of underfunding Canada's health care systems. It blames the federal government for not doing enough. However, a study published two or three weeks ago compared the rate of growth in federal health transfers to the rate of growth in provincial health spending, and it found that federal spending was growing faster than provincial spending on health, so I think we are already doing a lot, but obviously in a world with no limits, we could do more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575921">The other thing to understand is that seniors have always been the government's priority. Our government has done a lot for seniors. We introduced a dental care program that greatly benefits seniors. I regularly receive emails from seniors thanking our government for introducing this program. We are also going to introduce pharmacare, which will also greatly help seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575922">It is about balance within a limited financial framework.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575925">My colleague spoke about health transfers. What was called for was $280 billion over 10 years, not $46 billion in new money over 10 years. Sun Life incurs $2 billion in administrative costs for its dental care program. They cannot say that they do not have any money. The money is there: $83 billion for the oil companies and $34 billion for Trans Mountain. It is all about priorities.</ParaText>

I wonder if that is why 65- to 74-year-olds are being forced by the Liberal government to stay at work, so their taxes can come off the federal debt. Is that why the Liberals have a two-tier system? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575935">The government did its homework. It did an analysis of the demographic situation facing seniors. There were some hard facts about how life changes quite drastically in some ways after the age of 75. For some people, it would not be at age 75, but at age 74. For others, it would be at age 80. We are looking at a general rule here that things become a little tougher for seniors after the age of 75, and the government is just trying to help those who need a little extra help.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575936">Madam Speaker, I want to begin by answering the member for Lac‑Saint‑Louis by paraphrasing what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="311570" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard—Verdun</Affiliation> said: True power is independence. I wanted to remind the member of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575937">I am not sure how to approach this issue any more, because, since we came to the House in 2019, the Bloc Québécois has been talking about the importance of equity among seniors and the importance of increasing the old age security pension for all seniors, not just for those aged 75 and up. That is what seniors in our communities are asking for. We are simply being consistent with who we are and what we have been saying in the House for more than four years now, nearly five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575938">First, I will remind the House of the Bloc Québécois's position on seniors. For the past two summers, I have been listening to people's opinions and travelling all over Quebec as part of my work on Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document>. I will conclude my remarks by explaining what has led us here today, why we are having this opposition day that seeks to increase pressure on the government and remind it that it absolutely must give this bill royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575939">I also want to apologize to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278407" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>. I got carried away thinking about my colleague's speech earlier and forgot to say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Abitibi—Témiscamingue. I apologize for that. I know that someone is listening carefully to my colleague from Abitibi—Témiscamingue today. I will come back to that. As I said, I am not handling this portfolio alone. The Bloc Québécois leader and member for <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">Beloeil—Chambly</Affiliation> decided to make this issue a priority, but the entire caucus is helping me wage this fight for fairness for seniors. I would not be able to do this without my colleagues' help and support. I want to sincerely thank them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575940">As I said, we have been trying, since 2019, to hammer home the idea that old age security is a universal program and that there must be no gaps in it based on age. Those who are 67 must be given the same amount as those who are 77. People have been talking to us about this issue since we arrived in office. As early as January 2020, groups, like FADOQ, that we met with during pre-budget consultations were telling us why it was important to increase the old age security pension for all seniors, not just for those aged 75 and up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575941">We then made that a priority when each budget was tabled. For each budget, we made it clear to the government that we would not vote in favour of the budget if it did not meet this expectation of the groups on the front lines. Even though there may have been other worthwhile measures in the budget, we would not vote for it if it did not contain this measure, which local seniors' groups call for. That is one of the reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575942">We have set other priorities at other times. I would like to once again mention supply management, which is now a priority, but has been before too. We have also mentioned the environment. We have mentioned other concerns, but the issue of seniors came up in our pre-budget requests for every budget. Since we did not get a response from the government, we did not vote in favour of the budgets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575943">In early 2021, I met with representatives of SOS Dépannage, a food bank located in Granby, in the riding of Shefford. I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work of this organization's employees. Representatives of the food bank called me in to their office to show me the numbers they were seeing and alert me to the fact that more seniors were applying for food assistance because they were having trouble making ends meet on a fixed income. I also want to say that, no, seniors were not going to food banks to request medical assistance in dying. That is not why the people at SOS Dépannage had me come in to their office. It was to make me aware of the difficult financial realities seniors were facing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575944">The first petition that we presented came from Samuel Lévesque, a young man in his 20s. As a believer in intergenerational equity, he felt that it was unfair to separate seniors into two classes. He understood very well what was at stake, and he hoped that when he retired, there would be no gap, no two classes of seniors, and that he would receive the same amount as seniors aged 75 and over. Two other petitions were presented following this one. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575945">Last year, SOS Dépannage even came to support me at the launch of my tour. We held a press conference at its office. Its representatives explained why they thought Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> could help seniors seeking food assistance. One senior even came on behalf of Eastern Townships community groups to seek support for Bill C‑319. At the press conference we held to launch the second year of my tour on Bill C‑319, the volunteer centres providing services to seniors came to explain why they so desperately needed this bill to receive a royal recommendation and royal assent. I would also give a nod to other colleagues. I toured everywhere. I remember having a lovely meeting over coffee with a group of seniors in Rouyn-Noranda in 2021. They had made me aware of the issue of the two classes of seniors. They were very open and spoke to me frankly about their financial situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575946">In 2023, we also organized a conference. The bill did not exist yet in February 2023, but it was the fruit of that conference. My caucus colleagues and other colleagues took part in that day of reflection. People involved in a research chair on inequality came to talk to us about seniors' needs and the growing gap between the least fortunate seniors, who were getting poorer. They did a good job of explaining who can live with dignity on $22,000 a year. Roughly a third of seniors live on fixed incomes alone, in other words, old age security plus the guaranteed income supplement. OAS is the universal program. What is being done for all those who are just above that threshold, for those who do not receive the GIS or extra help because their income is just above $22,000? They are not rich, and a 10% increase could improve their situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575947"> In the summer of 2023, I travelled to a dozen ridings across Quebec, covering more than 10,000 kilometres. I got out there to find out what seniors needed. I heard about housing. I heard about food. I heard about the need for a decent social life, the need to get out a little. After that, I also did some tours on the margins of the pre-session caucuses. I visited Sherbrooke last fall and Chicoutimi at the beginning of the year. Each time, I heard about the need to correct the unacceptable inequity created by the government, that is, these two classes of seniors. This summer, I travelled to 11 ridings, covering over 8,000 kilometres. All this is to say that we are able to prioritize the bill because it has made progress, because at some point along the way, it has been supported. At the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, it received the unanimous support of the parties on the committee, and at second reading, the majority of members in the House voted in favour. It has gone through many stages already, and it is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575948">We saw it this summer. Seniors are struggling so much that the smallest cuts to the GIS are really affecting their life choices. They are struggling to eat properly. We are talking about basic needs. This bill is receiving support from across Canada. I get emails from seniors in Ontario who are concerned about their financial situation. I am getting emails from everywhere from Saint John's to British Columbia. I see that support as confirmation. We have prioritized an issue that was making good progress in the House and that meets Quebec's expectations, and so much the better if seniors elsewhere can also benefit from it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575949">I want to say one last thing. This past weekend, a researcher on aging confirmed to me that seniors need this bill, that this 10% increase should be given to all seniors aged 65 and over, and that we need to think about how seniors can work with fewer obstacles in their way. Support is coming from everywhere, including community groups, civil society and researchers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8575952">Madam Speaker, I would say this to my colleague. What is the retirement age, in the Liberals' view? Is it 65 or 75?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575953">We hear that some seniors have a harder time working. Not everyone can work. The retirement age was set at 65. It is a universal program. Creating two age categories and two separate amounts in a universal program is called a loophole and age discrimination. It is called ageism. Let us not forget that OAS is taxable. Those who need it the least will pay taxes. That is how the program works.</ParaText>

I invite all my colleagues to consider the importance of a royal recommendation for Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>, which seeks to amend current legislation to increase the full pension amount. By asking the government to act quickly, we are affirming our commitment to our seniors by ensuring they receive the financial support they need to live with dignity and respect. It is time to make their voices heard and take action for a better future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575969">This Bloc Québécois demand is reasonable and in the best interests of both Quebec's and Canada's seniors. We have received dozens of emails from seniors across Canada thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> for her hard work in restoring fairness for those who built our society. I would also like to thank her personally. Passing this bill will improve seniors' quality of life. We will see the impact of this measure very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575970">One of our initiatives back home, and also a campaign promise, was to set up an advisory committee with seniors. We then held a series of public consultations with these seniors to identify the challenges and, at the same time, seek their support. My colleague, the member for Shefford, met with seniors, particularly seniors from Amos and Rouyn-Noranda, to hear what they had to say about her bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575971">I am rising in the House on behalf of seniors to stop the injustice against them and to do the right thing. I proudly salute the work of the important people by my side in a cause I hold dear. I would like to mention one of them by name, Gérard Thomas, who is here in Ottawa at the moment. He is a member of my advisory committee and executive team, and he has come all this way today to help send a strong message to the government. He wanted to be part of the demonstration that took place in front of Parliament. He is a man of action, devoted to a cause. He wants things to change. He does not accept the status quo. This was particularly evident during our discussions with seniors. He accompanied me to several of these public consultations to hear what people had to say. I thank him for his commitment. It really motivates me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575972">On that note, it is time to address the real issues. During our tour to meet with Abitibi-Témiscamingue's seniors, we travelled from Témiscamingue to Pikogan, via Sainte‑Germaine‑Boulé, Authier‑Nord, Rouyn‑Noranda, Amos and La Sarre. We visited all four regional county municipalities in my riding, including both towns and villages. We met and listened to people in the communities. I would like to share some of their conclusions with the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575973">Before I get into that, however, maybe I should give members some background information about seniors in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, a region where we are fortunate to be able to count on an organization called L'Observatoire. This vital organization provides statistical data on the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. Frankly, supporting this type of organization is crucial, and the federal government should commit to funding it, but that is a debate for another day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575974">Currently, one in five people is over the age of 65, and of these, 60% are between 65 and 74. This means that the majority of seniors in Abitibi-Témiscamingue will be affected by the Bloc Québécois's bill. In recent years, our towns and villages have started celebrating their 100th anniversaries, meaning that many people were born and raised here. These people broke the land and cleared the way for Abitibi-Témiscamingue. They settled here. It is a very different picture from that of seniors in other regions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575975">Did my colleagues know that 38% of seniors in our region do not have a degree? That explains why the average income is lower for seniors in Abitibi‑Témiscamingue. This also explains why services should be better adapted to this clientele. We have to go back to what my father called compassionate management. We have to manage relations with seniors at a human level and go back to listening. This does not end with a period or a comma. That is something we heard a lot from seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575976">There are clear differences in income between men and women. That is still absolutely shocking today. A man's income is roughly $43,000, while a woman's is $30,000, for a difference of $13,000 annually. Fully 58% of senior women depend on government transfers.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8575977">According to the figures obtained by L'Observatoire, the average pension received by women in Quebec is $400, compared to $650 for men. Increasing OAS also directly addresses this problem, especially when we know that one in four seniors in Abitibi-Témiscamingue lives below the low-income threshold. One strong message from seniors that makes me proud is the desire to stay and remain in the community. We heard that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575978"> Two years ago, as part of my riding newsletter, I sent out a petition about supporting Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document> before it was introduced. It called for an end to inequity and demanded equity for seniors aged 65 to 74 by increasing the old age pension. It would have amounted to about $110 a month. In response, I received not a dozen or a hundred, but more than 5,000 leaflets in the mailbox at our office. The first few days, we were pleased with the success of our initiative, but every day we got more in the little green boxes we have in the office. There are seven boxes, which hold about 5,000 petitions. It is heartbreaking, because people are not living in dignity. People are living in poverty, and that needs to be addressed. Once again, I tip my hat to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> for prioritizing this message.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575979"> The people in Abitibi-Témiscamingue are proud. Whether it is Barraute, Sainte‑Germaine‑Boulé, Authier‑Nord, Chaze or Béarn, every village inspires pride. Statistics show that 78% of seniors in Abitibi-Témiscamingue have a strong or very strong sense of belonging in their community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575980">One of the issues that was raised during my tour was aging at home. This takes additional income, because everything costs more these days. Local health care services are also going to have to adapt in order to allow seniors to age at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575981">The purpose of this motion is simple. We want concrete, rapid results that have a real impact on the lives of over one million people across Quebec, real people. Across Canada, it is nearly four million people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575982">It is exhausting to see so much public money going to bad corporate citizens, while seniors have to live on fixed incomes that are no longer enough. The government's choices do not always align with the needs of seniors and the general public. As I have said several times in the House, the government needs to stop taking seniors for granted and trying to put square pegs into round holes. Seniors are not numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575983">One program that comes to mind is New Horizons for Seniors. Volunteer organizations, many of which are supported by seniors, are required to come up with proposals, submit applications and fill out dozens of pages of forms and paperwork. That is very commendable, but instead of increasing funding so they can do what they do better, they are expected to take on an incredible amount of accountability. Things need to be simpler. That is what seniors tell us. That is also one of my heartfelt pleas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575984">The Bloc Québécois chose seniors. I want to mention three things that emerged from my analysis of public consultations with seniors in my riding: seniors' working conditions, family caregivers and public transit solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575985">This government could look closely at a number of other things. The current labour shortage is an opportunity. Right now, the employment rate for seniors in my region is 10%. Seniors want to work. They want to take on low-key jobs, but when they do, anything they bring in with one hand they have to shell out with the other. Nobody wins when that happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575986">People need to pass on their knowledge. If we increase seniors' income, obviously without affecting their pensions, it could help them remain more active. I am convinced that everyone would come out ahead. At the same time, it would also enhance the dignity of seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575987">Another big problem is the caregivers who support seniors. Employment insurance does not adequately meet their needs. Home care is the future, yet once again, health transfers to Quebec are insufficient, if not a mere token: $1 billion instead of $6 billion. This is not working. It is time we got down to brass tacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8575988">To wrap up, seniors' living conditions merit special attention. That is what the Bloc Québécois is proposing with the bill sponsored by my fellow member from Shefford. It will be a major step forward for the people of Abitibi—Témiscamingue. She can count on my unwavering support.</ParaText>

We need to support everybody who is in need, who has a shortage of income in their retirement, but why give the same benefit to the rich seniors?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576007">Madam Speaker, today, October 1, is National Seniors Day. I wish all seniors in Canada and around the world a very happy day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576008">It is a real privilege to rise in the House to talk about our government's work to make life better and more affordable for Canadian seniors. Seniors are a growing segment of the Canadian population. It is therefore important that governments reflect on how our policies and approaches can best meet the needs of a rapidly changing demographic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576009">We have a wide variety of needs and desires in life. However, at the end of the day, we all want much the same things in our golden years: to maintain our independence, to stay connected to our friends and loved ones, and to age in place as long as possible. That is our government's commitment to Canadian seniors. No matter where they live, all seniors in this country should be able to age on their own terms, with dignity and choice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576010">Since 2015, despite opposition from the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois, our government has taken significant steps to strengthen the financial security of this country's seniors, including restoring the age of eligibility for OAS and the GIS to 65, after the previous Conservative government raised it to 67 in Davos. Our government also increased the GIS to give low-income single seniors up to $947 more per year, despite opposition from the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576011">The rising cost of living and global inflation are affecting all Canadians: seniors, students, young families, everyone. That is why, when we took steps to put money back into the pockets of Canadians, we made sure to take into account the specific needs of our seniors. We doubled the GST tax credit for six months and sent $500 payments to nearly two million renters to help them cope with the cost of housing, despite the relentless efforts of the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois. Once again, they voted against these measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576012">We implemented the Canadian dental care plan for over 750,000 Canadians, starting with seniors. It is frightening. The Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives would have deprived 750,000 Canadians of the dental care that they need. That is the hypocrisy we are witnessing in the House today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576013">Bloc members—sovereignists, separatists—want a snap election so that a Conservative government can take power. According to the Bloc, a Conservative government will create the winning conditions needed for their sovereignty project to see the light of day. What kind of impact would their project have? First, it would threaten OAS for all seniors in Quebec. What the Bloc Québécois does not want to admit to Quebec's seniors is that their sovereignty plan and their opportunistic little plot would hurt Quebec's seniors. Such is the irony of today's debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576014">The changes we have made have truly improved the lives of Canadian seniors. These changes remain true to the retirement security systems we have relied on for many years. It is not a question of blowing them up in an attempt to find new solutions, but of strengthening them and ensuring that they keep on meeting seniors' diverse and ever-changing needs. This includes strengthening one of the cornerstones of Canada's public retirement income system, old age security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576015">Old age security gives Canadian seniors peace of mind in their retirement years. It provides essential income security to millions of Canadians every year, particularly low-income recipients of old age security who are also entitled to the guaranteed income supplement.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576016">As I said earlier today, $71 billion will be transferred to seniors' pockets over the next five years through the increases and enhancements from the Liberal Party of Canada. We know that the older seniors get, the more financially vulnerable they become. Their incomes decline as they age, and they often have to spend more to cover their health costs. They also face greater financial risks due to an increased risk of health problems, the loss of a spouse or partner, and the possibility of outliving their savings. This financial vulnerability only worsens when seniors have a reduced ability to supplement their income through paid work. This is particularly true for seniors aged 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576017">When we increased the OAS by 10% for seniors aged 75 and over, it was the first permanent increase since the 1970s. It was a historic change aimed at meeting the financial needs of some of the most vulnerable seniors in our communities. Providing full pensioners with an $800 supplement in the first year alone strengthened the financial security of 3.3 million seniors, 56% of whom are women. It was an important step in making life better and more affordable for Canadian seniors. We know, however, that there is still work to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576018">It is rather cynical of the opposition parties, including the Bloc Québécois, to accuse us of having a two-tier system when we used evidence and data to improve old age security. There needs to be greater improvement for those with greater need. This was proven by studies, statistics, sources of information. This decision was made based on evidence and data and with the greatest compassion. It is absolutely absurd to hear the Bloc Québécois say that it is a two-tier system. We are the party that has improved and secured pensions in Canada the most. What has the Bloc Québécois done? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576019">Whether on the guaranteed income supplement, housing or dental care, we have systematically met with resistance from the Bloc to support seniors, including the most vulnerable seniors in Canada. That is hypocrisy. They should be ashamed to rise in the House and talk about a two-tier system. Never has a Canadian government been there more for seniors than this government formed by the Liberal Party of Canada. Today the Bloc Québécois is being mistrustful, cynical, hypocritical and opportunistic.</ParaText>

Investment in our pharmacare program will help one in four Canadians and one in five seniors living with diabetes, so they can monitor, test and treat their diabetes without worrying about the cost. They would have to worry about the cost if the Conservatives and the Bloc got their way; those parties would be against that too. Investment in our dental care program, opposed by the Conservatives and the Bloc Québécois, has not only helped over 750,000 Canadians get the care they need but will also support 200,000 Quebec seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576022">The uptake on this new program has been nothing short of phenomenal. In just five months, 750,000 Canadians and counting have gotten their teeth cleaned by a hygienist for the first time in years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576023"> They have gotten new dentures after wearing old ones for decades. They have had that toothache looked at after simply living and suffering through the pain. They have gained the confidence to smile again after avoiding the dentist's office down the street because they needed to put food on the table for their family. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576024">Those are real numbers. Those are real statistics, but they mean little to the Conservative Party and to the Bloc Québécois; it is just an abstraction. They mean a lot to the people who are benefiting from them. These folks over here want to fool and deceive Canadians out of getting the care they deserve, but they will find the Liberal Party in their way. We will be sure to keep reminding folks to sign up and get the care they are entitled to. As long as we're here, dental care is a reality in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576025"> However, the things so many of us seek in our senior years, such as independence and staying connected to the people around us, are not just things that health care programs alone can solve. That is why I am so proud to see funding from the New Horizons for Seniors program reach senior-serving organizations and communities across Canada every year. New Horizons helps seniors fight social isolation, be included in their communities and live enriched lives. From curling clubs in Prince Edward Island to senior centres in the Yukon, the program helps seniors to be more connected and active members of their community. As more and more seniors have also chosen to age in their own homes, we have also launched the age well at home initiative.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576033"> These two programs make a real difference to seniors, and they are helping make Canada a better place to live, grow and age. That is why they are so important. After what we saw during the pandemic, we know that Canadians are looking to governments to step up and make sure our long-term care system is delivering high-quality, safe care and treatment to our seniors. That is why we transferred $1 billion to the provinces and territories in 2020 to immediately work to protect people living and working in long-term care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576034"> However, we need longer-term solutions; our $200-billion health care deals with provinces and territories are squarely focused on that. That is why, as part of these agreements, we also signed unique aging with dignity agreements with provinces and territories to make sure our health care systems meet the needs of an aging population and the workers who make it all possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576038">All of these supports for health care and community services are based on our government's core beliefs. We need to meet Canadian seniors where they are. We must not only be there to serve seniors today; we must be there for them tomorrow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576039">This requires planning. We need a thoughtful economic policy that takes into account the needs of people in the short, medium and long term, and not guesstimate policies that run counter what the numbers tell us. That is what our government did when it decided to increase old age security for seniors over 75. It was a data-driven choice, as I said earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576040">Our 10% increase in the old age security pension aimed specifically to address the increased vulnerability of seniors as they age. The facts are clear: seniors over 75 are more likely to to have significant health problems and, accordingly, have higher health care expenses. In fact, health spending for seniors over 80 are on average $700 a year more than that of people 65 to 74.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576041">Seniors in this age group are also more likely to live with a disability. In 2017, 47% of seniors 75 and up suffered from a disability, compared to 32% of seniors 65 to 74. Since only roughly 15% of seniors 75 and up continue to work, or less than half of those 65 to 74, these seniors living on a fixed income need support to cope with these increased expenses. That is why a larger proportion of these seniors is already eligible for the guaranteed income supplement and benefiting from it, according to the numbers from 2020.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576042">We raised old age security for seniors 75 and up to increase their financial security when they need it most. Far too many seniors fall into poverty after losing their spouse or partner. The loss of a loved one is more than just a devastating time for these seniors, the majority of whom are women. Often it can also lead to a significant decline in their quality of life. In 2016, the proportion of widows who did not remarry was three times higher among people 75 and up than among people 65 to 74. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576043">These conversations about how we can better support Canadian seniors are important. They are important because the future of aging in Canada is really everyone's future. We welcome these discussions. We welcome these kinds of debates. We welcome dialogue with all the opposition parties to discuss how we can do more to help seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576044">However, when any reasonable measure that puts money in seniors' pockets is consistently met with opposition, we can only conclude that it is cynicism, and that the Bloc Québécois and the Conservative Party of Canada are playing politics at the expense of the most vulnerable seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576045">However, Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> does not reflect the reality facing Canadian seniors. Our government is committed to investing in people, whether it is with child care or school food programs for children, skills training for young people entering the workforce, or dental care and pharmacare for seniors. We know that there is always more work to do, but I am proud of what our government has done since 2015, especially when it comes to advancing the interests of Canadian seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576046">Ultimately, the discussion today is not just about seniors. It affects us all. This is about the future of aging in Canada and the future that every Canadian deserves in their retirement years. After a lifetime of hard work, Canadian seniors deserve to age with dignity and choice. As a government, we will make this future a reality for every senior in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576080">In light of what I just heard from the recently appointed <Affiliation DbId="310517" Type="4">Minister of Labour and Seniors</Affiliation>, I would appreciate it if he could stay a few minutes. I might get angry; I might get indignant. At the same time, I am worried. I think our minister is in a very vulnerable state. As a nurse by profession, I think he has a bit of a health problem, given the speech he just made. His whole speech worried me, because it was full of untruths, lies and partisanship the likes of which I have never heard before. That reminds me, we still have not received his new mandate letter. I am guessing that the speech he delivered today was part of it. He must be a good ambassador for the inertia of the government, his government, when it comes to federal social policies and programs. It is rare that we have the opportunity to talk about exclusively federal social programs that we are asking to be strengthened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576081">Usually, as we just heard and as we hear in the answers we are given during question period, the government members just talk about their exploits implementing programs that have nothing to do with the federal government, but rather are the responsibility of the provinces. Take the dental care program, for example. The Bloc Québécois is being accused of being against dental care. That is not true. For seniors and young people alike, a dental care program is a good idea. We voted against the bill not because we are against dental care, but because it was another example of crass interference in a provincial jurisdiction. This program is going to cost $2 billion and be administered by private insurance companies, while Quebec's dental care program is administered by a public system. That is the Liberal government's hypocrisy, in the falsehoods it denounces. That is why we stand firm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576082">There is one thing to take away from today's debate on our bill, which has been defended with such passionate determination by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, and has the support of my political party and all the seniors we met with in the field. The one thing to remember is that we demand fair treatment. Of course, the issue concerns dignity, but fair treatment is also at stake.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576083">The equation is simple. The federal government introduced a program in the early 1900s called the old age security pension. It was a universal pension, with certain conditions, that started at age 65. The plan was intended for all seniors aged 65 or over, for whom OAS was viewed as a social safety net. In fact, it was praised as an important social policy at the time. Where does Canada stand today as far as the overall program goes? Canada ranks 13th in the OECD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576084">Restoring fairness is the purpose of our bill and the reason we are requesting a royal recommendation. What the government did for the first time ever was to make a distinction between people aged 65 to 74 and those aged 75 and over, in a universal plan that should apply to everyone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576085">That is the gap we want to correct with Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>. As I said in another speech, seniors are not all facing the same situation. People aged 80 and over may be living a different reality from those aged 75 and over or from those aged 70 to 75. That is not the real issue here. The question is whether the federal government believes that there are now two OAS plans: one for seniors aged 65 to 74 and one for seniors aged 75 and over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576086">That is nonsense because it is a question of equity. In committee, when we talked about OAS, I heard people say that seniors 65 and up have money while those 75 and up have less. People seem to lose sight of the fact that as of age 65, many seniors, including 30% or more in Quebec, start living on a fixed income. For many seniors, that is their only income. For many people in both Quebec and Canada, single women in particular, OAS provides an income that barely allows them to live in dignity. It is their only income. To cut them off from an increase is to make them poorer and even more insecure. It is also to ignore the fact that if we want to improve seniors' situation and quality of life, then we need to act now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576087">If we support an increase in OAS as of age 65 that allows for an adequate standard of living, as the bill proposes, we will improve these seniors' quality of life and, at the same time, the quality of life and living conditions of people 75 and up. The equation is simple. As my colleague said, there is no evidence proving that age-based discrimination in the application of a universal system will make the government understand how poor and vulnerable our seniors are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576088">During question period, we ran out of ways to say that the cost of living is the same whether one is an 80-year-old senior or a 65-year-old living on a fixed income like old age security. Many people are struggling to pay for clothing, housing and food, with a bit left over for leisure activities. They are avoiding that, because they do not have the money. For 10 years of their lives, they will be worried because they may have had a little nest egg, but no private plan or supplementary pension plan. They only get old age security. It is unfair to say that they can go back to work to get by, instead of saying that, out of fairness, old age security will be increased for everyone, as it should be, as it was intended to be, which would be the fair approach. A number of witnesses appeared before the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities to talk about this. The Liberal government members on that committee unanimously supported this bill.</ParaText>

The rationale behind our 10% raise for those over 74 was obviously because seniors are living longer, their money is running out and they have more health needs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576108">Madam Speaker, I have rarely heard so many ridiculous speeches in the House. Quite frankly, this minister's constituents deserve better. I was wondering why there were problems between the federal government and Quebec regarding meals on wheels, when there were never any issues before this minister came along. I can see that he is making the situation a lot worse with his partisanship. I am talking about interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576109">The minister is saying that it is appalling that the Bloc Québécois is plotting to put the Conservatives in power in order to achieve sovereignty. It seems as though the minister has not reviewed the history of Canada and Quebec. By definition, it is the current Liberal government that has implemented programs that interfere in provincial jurisdiction in a way that we have not seen in a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576110">Take the dental insurance program. We support the idea of dental insurance for seniors. Why did the government not engage in discussions before announcing it? They scribbled it on the back of a napkin to keep themselves in power until 2025. Instead of immediately taking partisan action to stay in power as long as possible—since the polls show that things are not going well—they should have sat down with a province like Quebec. Quebec runs a program that does not cover seniors, but it did cover a certain number of people and was administered by a public agency, the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, or RAMQ. Now, they are scribbling it on the back of a napkin. Quebec is asking for money to improve its dental insurance program. Seniors would be covered, but we would not have to pay $2 billion in administrative costs to a private company. How can the government take pride in setting up a so-called public dental care program when it is forking over $2 billion to a private company? Not to mention all the problems dentists have had. We have heard dentists say that it does not make sense, that they do not even know if they will be reimbursed. They see all these patients and then get denied by Sun Life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576111">In short, it is nonsense to claim that the Bloc Québécois is here strictly for its political purposes to stir up trouble. When I arrived in the House in 2015, we called for the GIS to be automatically given to people who, when they filed their tax returns, were eligible for it. Before that, according to the statistics we commissioned, there were a lot of people who were entitled to it, but the Canadian government did not tell them. People had to apply. That was when Minister Morneau, the finance minister at the time, agreed to put it in place, but in 2018. It was the Bloc Québécois that fought for the GIS in the early 2000s, and yet, this program falls strictly under federal jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576112">Now we are being told that it is going to cost far too much. We are talking about $3 billion to make a federal program fair for seniors. There is no money for that, we are told. On the other hand, we had money for Trans Mountain, to export oil, to make oil companies richer. We had $34 billion. The government also had $83 billion to give tax credits to the five big oil companies, which raked in $220 billion in profits. I would add to that $2 billion in administrative costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576113">It is not at all a matter of cost. It is about priorities. The government interfered in programs with costly redundant structures. It now has to be careful because that will come back to haunt them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576114">The government had no business getting involved in that. If it wanted to get involved, it should have sat down with the Government of Quebec and respected the will of the Quebec National Assembly. That is also what we represent in the House. The government should have created something that would make sense, at a lower cost, and that would cover everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576115">When the Bloc Québécois voted against this program, it voted with the unanimous support of the National Assembly. When the minister lectures us about being hypocrites, it should come as no surprise that he does not have good relations with Quebec and the Government of Quebec. In fact, it has such poor relations with the Government of Quebec that the Premier of Quebec is meddling in federal elections. However, every time we ask a question in the House, the Minister of Health or the Minister of Justice rises to tell us that the government has a very good relationship with the Government of Quebec and the National Assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576116">We tabled all sorts of motions. One of them said that the National Assembly was opposed to pharmacare. Quebec wants the money, with full compensation, to manage its own programs. When a minister stands up and tells me that we are against seniors and that we are opportunists because the government is in a minority Parliament, this is ridiculous. Not only is it ridiculous, but it insults the intelligence of our seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576117">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> has done extraordinary work on this issue. Now the minister is saying that all the groups that support us across Quebec and Canada do not know what they are talking about, that he knows better than they do what is good for them, and that he does not have the money for it. He tells them to look at everything the government has already done. If everything this government has already done was really enough, I do not think that so many seniors who are currently living below or just above the poverty line would support this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576118">When seniors can have a bit left over in addition to surviving, they do not get as sick. Ultimately, health care costs less. It is cost-effective for everyone, because these people do not have a nest egg. They are going to spend that money. From an economic point of view, what the Liberals are thinking does not make any sense. However, having the <Affiliation DbId="310517" Type="4">Minister of Labour and Seniors</Affiliation> speak and listening to this government's response, I understand very well that our support for this government is over. We have never had—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576125">In his intervention, the member referred to events described in the 12th report of the committee, presented to the House earlier that day. The report alleged that a witness, Mr. Stephen Anderson, failed to answer questions and refused to produce specific documents ordered by the committee following the adoption of two distinct motions. Specifically, Mr. Anderson repeatedly refused to provide the name of an individual he had referred to in his testimony. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576126">The member made reference to a question of privilege he raised on March 20, 2024, concerning the 17th report of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates and the subsequent finding of a prima facie case of privilege, noting its similarities with the current situation. He added that this incident goes further. In addition to failing to respond to questions, Mr. Anderson also disregarded orders of the committee for the production of documents. The member argued the current situation also constitutes a prima facie contempt of the House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576128">The Chair also considered carefully the committee's report. After presenting the sequence of events and describing the attempts made to receive the requested information, it concludes with, and I quote, “having not received the documents requested from the witness, and, most significantly, the name referenced during the committee meeting of Wednesday, July 17, 2024, continuing to be withheld, [the] committee feels it is their duty to place these matters before the House at this time so that the House may take such measures as it deems appropriate.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576129">The Chair notes that two privileges enjoyed by committees have allegedly been breached. These are rights fundamental to the proper functioning of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8576130">With regard to answering questions put by members of a committee, it is worth reiterating that witnesses are obliged to provide answers to questions from the committee. According to <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, at page 1081, “refusal to answer questions or failure to reply truthfully may give rise to a charge of contempt of the House, whether the witness has been sworn in or not.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576131"> In terms of ordering the productions of documents, Standing Order 108(1)(a) delegates this power from the House to its committees. Indeed, as Speaker Milliken stated in a ruling from March 9, 2011, at page 8841 of the Debates, and I quote, “the power of committees of the House to order papers is indistinguishable from that of the House.”</ParaText>

At the heart of it is the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton, who was found out to own 50% of a business while he was serving in the cabinet. It was believed that he was directing the operations of that company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576146">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said, of course, that it is another Randy. We heard from members of the Liberal caucus that perhaps it was “Randeep”. We heard from the witness, Mr. Anderson, that he could tell us only if we held an in camera meeting, a private meeting of the ethics committee, so that he could reveal it to us. The committee rejected that. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If the Liberals have nothing to hide, they should show us who the other Randy is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576147">It gets worse. In the multiple appearances at committee, of witnesses on the strange story of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton and his business dealings, we learned of course that the NDP-Liberal government did award a contract to the Liberal minister's business while he was serving in cabinet. That is outrageous. Of course, it is not allowed under the conflict of interest regime we have in this country. Said another way, it is illegal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576148">We heard from the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, when he first appeared at committee, that he had not been in touch with his business partner, Mr. Anderson, in 2022. He was explicit that he had not. The thing about the company and about everyone who seems to be involved in it is that it is pretty sketchy. That sketchy company is involved in a massive lawsuit that alleges fraud of half a million dollars. An unexplained but suspicious warehouse fire targeted only the inventory at the Liberal minister's company's warehouse. Through the legal system, we are learning, through the disclosures, that there was in fact contact, which is in direct contradiction to what that Liberal minister said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576149">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said that he had not talked to his business partner in 2022. He then had his ministry talk to the media and say that it was impossible for the minister to have communicated with Mr. Anderson on the days in question, when he referenced Randy nine times in text messages. Mr. Anderson claimed, obviously not believably, that these were nine autocorrects, though he could not tell us what was being autocorrected. The recipient of the messages of course never challenged him on who the other Randy was, because he was always represented as the business partner, the individual who owned a 50% share in the business, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576150">The <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s staff said that he could not have communicated, because he was in cabinet; he was locked up. He flew into Vancouver, and before he got there, they must have taken his phone and put it in a box, and he did not get it back for weeks. He did not talk to anybody. They said it was impossible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576151">However, we then demanded his phone records. He provided them for only one phone. We know he has another one, so we had to issue another demand for phone records and text messages. Guess what we found out: While the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>'s business partner was telling the victims of the fraud worth about $500,000 and saying that Randy was in Vancouver and needed answers, the minister from Edmonton was in Vancouver at that time. Although his office said that he could not get the messages, there is testimony from the last time that he testified at committee.</ParaText>

The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> from Edmonton's business partner put up a handful of Porsches and Land Rovers as collateral in the hours before they incorporated the business together, but the Liberal minister said he had no idea. That seems as unbelievable as pretty much everything the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said at committee, because we now have the receipts and the records to show that what he said was not true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576158"> We cannot believe what he is saying, which is very often the case.

Now there is a <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> who is just saying one thing when another is the truth. This is not acceptable in a parliamentary committee. It is contemptuous in and of itself. In a courtroom, it is perjury. Had the minister been asked to swear an oath, it would be perjury. Perjury in this country is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576166">The Liberals do not see the forest for the trees. Today there was a common-sense Conservative motion recognizing that after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, with taxes up, costs up and crime up, its time is up. Why is there no government legislation on the floor of the House? The Liberals are trying to get as many opposition days out of the way as they can, and now they are stuck dealing with matters that stem from corruption, like the matter that is going to be dealt with tomorrow in the House, the billion-dollar green slush fund.

It was government disinformation produced, with taxpayer-funded resources, by the Liberal House leader. She spun a tale about Canadians' rights being trampled on because a majority of members of the House, all democratically elected, ordered the production of documents from the government about its corruption. However, Liberals say it is an erosion of Canadians' rights that is too great to bear.</ParaText>

However, he blocked them. He used cabinet confidence, whose purpose is not to provide a get-out-of-jail-free card for the Prime Minister, but that is what the Liberals used it for.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576198">Mr. Speaker, accountability really gets in the way of a good Liberal grift. Am I right? Liberals want anything but taking a minute to talk about how they are lining the pockets of their well-connected buddies while Canadians are lined up at food banks in record numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576199">Food banks in my community and in communities right across this country have seen their use double. They are having to expand their hours so they can serve people their groceries in between shifts at two jobs. One in four Canadians is saying they are going to need to use food banks. That is not the unemployment rate, so these are people who are working but cannot afford to feed themselves and their families after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government. Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576200"> It is because of $60 million to two yo-yos in their basement in the arrive scam. It is $1 billion in the green slush fund with the hand-picked Liberal chair. There is example after example. It is $21 billion to their buddies in the consulting class in one year alone. That is what the Liberals are spending their money on. We need to expose that, because we need to stop it. We need to get Canadians their money back, because they need it. They need every single penny.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576207">Not to brag but to let members know where I was coming from, I already had the opportunity to say, during another question of privilege last week, that I taught ethics for 30 years. I have some political experience from two legislatures. I fail to understand the situation that we find ourselves in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576208">Parliamentary committees are not supposed to be a leisure activity for members who are looking to spend their time. Working on parliamentary committees is our job. We are paid to participate and to do thorough, serious work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576209">I have already had the opportunity to say in the House that job number one of a member is to hold the government to account. Many questions have been asked about the situation that we find ourselves in today. I could call my speech “Finding Randy”, like the game that we played as children. However, it is pretty serious to see a government—I think that it is typical of a government on its last legs—not being able to respect the institutions and the institution, trying to get around the rules and not respecting the requests of the House and the committees. This is a matter of transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576210">I am sure that if my colleagues on the other side of the House were on my side, they would be saying the same thing I am saying. In fact, for many of my constituents, blue or red is the same thing. They have become cynical. They would rather look at the sky and vote light blue because they find it more inspiring. However, what they have noticed in the history of this Parliament is that when members change side, they start cutting corners and stop being reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576211">Quite simply, the committee is asking for documents and for its order to be followed, and the Liberals are acting as if they do not get it. That is a serious problem, because if democracy cannot happen inside Parliament—some may think I am naive, but I believe in parliamentary democracy—and it does not happen through representatives of the people like us, it is bound to happen on the street. When it does, the law of the jungle prevails. Quite often, contempt for democratic institutions leads to totalitarian regimes. We see that in some countries. When a leader somewhere decides to take over a national government and to impose untested values, people do not acquire a democratic mindset.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576212">I do not understand the government's attitude. With regard to the Sustainable Development Technology Canada scandal, we have just heard a ruling on a question of privilege where the government does not want to provide the reports and documents in a transparent manner so that we can make up our minds. Now, once again, things are getting out of hand at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576213">I get the impression that members on the other side of the House do not take our committees seriously. That is what I have seen. I have seen unanimous motions and reports tabled in the House and then shelved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576214">Then, the government wants voters to believe in the work that we do here, to believe in us, to continue to not be cynical and to continue to say that they have dedicated representatives who do their job and who meet their expectations. I think that we are far from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576215">I see the members opposite hanging their heads and I understand that. I would be ashamed to have to endure such situations over and over again. This is a situation in which a serious ethical error has been made. Regardless of the government stripe, we cannot put up with a lack of transparency. We cannot allow the government to prevent MPs from doing their job of holding the government to account by calling into question potential conflicts of interest. That seems to go without saying. One day, we will see the members opposite sitting on this side of the House. They will be ranting and raving and saying the same thing as me. Likely, the members on this side—</ParaText>

When we ask for documents, they are completely redacted. What is the government afraid of? When one seeks a mandate to sit in a chamber like this one, and when one party manages to get enough representatives elected that it can form government, the least it can do is be worthy of being in government and respect the work of all parliamentarians on all sides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576220">Parliamentarians must be able to do their job, which consists of demanding transparency form the government and holding the government to account. The government must be willing to meet these demands. This government will quite often try to hide behind partisanship. It will try to undermine the merits of the request. Basically, it will try to say that, on this side, we are not being entirely fair and equitable, that it is ill-intentioned to show up and demand accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576221">In this particular case, I hope that no one on the other side would dare say that Mr. Anderson must not provide what he must provide. I hope the government feels responsible for that. They may be trying to protect a minister. It is possible. I am asking the question: When someone has made a mistake, when someone has shown a lapse in ethics, when someone has crossed the conflict of interest line, should that person be this fiercely defended and protected? I would say the answer is “no”. People are watching us. Some have lost trust in this institution. I do not think that most people here deserve such a loss of trust.</ParaText>

I think of the standing committees of the House; we have standing committees that meet and do a lot of good work. There is no doubt about that. I suspect that if we did a history of the standing committees, we would find that, unfortunately, witnesses might actually be exaggerating or misleading the committee at times, with respect to the many different issues that are out there. Does the member believe that, whenever an incident of that nature occurs, the most appropriate action is actually to call that individual, whomever he or she may be, to come before the bar of the House of Commons or to continue to pursue the issue through a standing committee? I am not aware of this, and maybe he can let me know: Is the member aware of others who were brought to the bar in previous administrations?</ParaText>

One example is the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health, which prepared a report on a study of the harms associated with breast implants, with unanimous recommendations. The House was told that breast implant illness had to be recognized. This government has done nothing with this except to remind us that, while the Food Drug Administration recognizes this illness, Health Canada and the government believe that there is no reason to consider it to be real. Committee reports are being shelved.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576248">Mr. Speaker, I think that my colleague has put his finger on the problem. As he just said, we have a government on its last legs, a government of neglect. We can see that this government is not too bothered by the fact that a minister could have dipped into the fund and given contracts to his own company through the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576249">In this specific case, I think that they have crossed the line. There were a lot of jokes this summer about the two Randys. The problem is that it is true. Somewhere, there is a Randy who either does or does not exist. Perhaps it is the same person. That is where we are at with this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576250">Exactly eight years ago, my colleague and I sat together on the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Let us not forget that the Liberals got elected in 2015 by saying that they were going to change the electoral system and that it would be the last time that Canada would vote under a first past the post system. In 2016, after criss-crossing Canada and consulting hundreds upon hundreds of Canadians, the Liberals finally said that they were leaving it alone. That is a broken promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576251">A political party that changes its mind once in government, that is something. It is not good, but it breeds cynicism. In this case, does the member agree with me that what is currently happening with the two Randys is much worse than a broken campaign promise?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576252">Mr. Speaker, we may agree on the substance, but I do not think that it is all that different. I think that this kind of broken promise and the lack of transparency related to conflicts of interest both fuel cynicism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576253">I am a little surprised by my colleague's question because it is as though the Conservative Party was waiting for this reform when they were against it, if memory serves, and I think it does. The Liberal Party wanted reform as long as the voting system that it favoured and cherished was to its advantage. Therefore we are still dealing with partisanship and the public's lack of confidence in elected officials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576254">In closing, I would like to say that people across Canada told us that what they were enormously upset with was the party line.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576255">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576256">I was there when Stephen Anderson appeared as a witness before the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. I was able to see first-hand his attitude toward the requests that had been made. We knew all along that promises would not be kept. His dismissive attitude was disturbing and must be discussed today. Parliament is built on trust. We have to trust each other. The public trusts us. People elect us and put their trust in us. We need to live up to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576257">Trust means that you do not have to provide evidence. In this case, not only do we need evidence but the promised evidence has not been provided. The bond of trust has been completely broken. We are bordering on what my colleague referred to earlier as shame. Personally, I would go even further; I think that when we look at some of the debates at committee or even in the House, there is a cruel lack of decency. Decency is something that exists when people have some kind of social contract that leads them to do the right thing. Beyond that, what we are seeing is nonsense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576258">Mr. Anderson came to committee and told us that he could not provide the information right away. He promised that in a matter of days—I forget how many days—he would provide us two things: the phone records and the identity of “Randy”. We gave him the time to gather his evidence and do his things. Then, we were buried under the phone records. It practically took a team of investigators to find some sort of path. One thing is for sure, what was missing was the ability to determine who “Randy” was. We did not find out. Does “Randy” exist? I do not know. Is he the same Randy? I do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576259">One thing is certain, Mr. Anderson's attitude was, in my opinion, shameful. It is unacceptable, and I advise my colleagues across the way not to try to defend the indefensible, because that only makes matters worse. Everyone in life can serve as an example. Mr. Anderson is a bad example. It is not a good example. It is not an example of what should be done in committee. The committees are not a court, especially not the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, because we see all sorts of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576260">Committees are a place where we often look for solutions to clearly defined problems, like disinformation or social media. Conflicts of interest are also an issue under our purview. I am not someone who would take legal action unnecessarily or make allegations out of obligation, but frankly, it was impossible to believe Mr. Anderson. It is not complicated. He even seemed flippant about the fact that he was a bad example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576261">As a responsible parliamentarian, I will support my colleague's motion. Responsibility is the ability to answer for one's actions. Mr. Anderson promised to answer for his actions, but failed to do so. In light of this attitude, we have no alternative but to say there must be consequences. Even though he said it was not his intention, the consequences are part and parcel of the underlying intention. Enough is enough. Actions have consequences, and the two cannot be separated. Therefore, Mr. Anderson must be held accountable for his actions and face the consequences. My language may seem harsh, but he left us no alternative. Unless we impose consequences for Mr. Anderson's actions, we will be left with a Parliament that lacks any credibility, where mistrust and chaos prevail. This is the decadence of a government on its last legs, as mentioned earlier, a kind of complacency that lulls people into believing that nothing is wrong and that everything will be fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576262">Mr. Anderson is like the tree that hides the forest. In that sense, this matter must be brought to its conclusion. I will fight a headwind if I have to. This is contempt of the House. Again, these are not meaningless words. These are strong words. It does not look very good on a resumé. Mr. Anderson must therefore answer for his actions and come before the bar, because the credibility of Parliament is at stake.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576263">To anyone who opposes my position, I would say that Mr. Anderson perhaps had it coming. He did everything he could to be treated this way. Mr. Anderson has taken indecency to a whole new level. I therefore believe that Mr. Anderson's appearance at the bar is inevitable. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. Public trust in parliamentarians is at stake. At a time when cynicism toward politicians is at an all-time high, we must take action and bring Mr. Anderson before the bar.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576264">Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with many different Liberal scandals right now, but this is, in many ways, the most ridiculous. We have a person testifying before committee with text messages that suggest a minister of the Crown was actually involved in the operation of a company he was not supposed to be involved in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576265">The defence of that apparent involvement of the minister of Crown in the operation of a company, that was, in fact, also getting government contracts, was to say the person referred to in the text messages was a different Randy. This is a tiny company where the partner happens to have that same name, and yet the claim was made that this was a different Randy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576266">We then have a partner come back to the same committee and say that he lied about it being a different Randy. He admitted that it was all made up. He then said the references to Randy in the text messages were the result of autocorrect. There were multiple different text messages, I think, over nine times. It is just the repeated tragedy of autocorrect causing so many problems. Members should know to disable autocorrect on their phones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576267">More seriously, this is obviously adding to a litany of Liberal scandals, but it is the most absurd, most comical and most ridiculous. If one were writing a story, one would not put these details in because they are so obviously absurd. No one would believe them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576268">Does the member have any explanation for why the Liberal government would have tried to cover itself in such an obvious way?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576269">Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a comment before responding to my colleague. The witness admitted in committee that he had lied to the journalists when he told the story. Believing a liar, in my mind, is not exactly a win.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576270">The Liberal government seems to have this kind of self-defence deeply rooted in its DNA. We only have to look at how many times the Ethics Commissioner has levelled allegations or issued verdicts against this government. Questioning the integrity of someone like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, for example, is bad enough. Now we are constantly questioning the integrity of ministers of the Crown, when something like that should only happen on rare occasions. It shocks me. As an ethicist, downplaying these kinds of things is not an option. I think it is habit in part, perhaps as a result of being in power for so long, but it is also a kind of entitlement, and that is unacceptable.</ParaText>

He was elected in 2021, so he has been here for three years. To put it mildly, he has been earning his keep over the past three years. I think that he has had a lot of work to do when it comes to ethics, and the House too, for that matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576272">He talked a lot about how Mr. Anderson's example is not one that should be followed. Earlier, my colleague from Alberta mentioned the famous autocorrect defence. He said that almost nothing about Mr. Anderson's testimony made sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576273">Was there anything specific, a specific statement or unanswered question that really struck the member for Trois‑Rivières for him to say that this is what we should be teaching people not to do before parliamentary committees?</ParaText>

We know that the Conservatives are only interested in Liberal scandals. The Liberals are only interested when there is a Conservative scandal. According to the federal Department of Finance, the NDP is the only party that stands for sound fiscal management. That includes transparency, which means getting to the bottom of things. That is why we are supporting this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576279">In the few minutes I have, I should flag some of the scandals I mentioned earlier, in which the Conservatives are only interested in the Liberals' scandals and the Liberals are only interested in the Conservatives' scandals. I was in the House when Conservatives refused to have any sort of investigation into any of their scandals. The following is just a partial list, which I will be able to elaborate on when this matter comes back before the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576280">There is the ETS scandal, which was $400 million, and the Conservatives shut down any inquiry into what happened with that money. There is the Phoenix pay scandal, which we are still afflicted with, and it represents $2.2 billion. The Harper regime and the Conservatives were part of that. There is the F-35 procurement scandal, which I am told is worth billions. There is the $3.1 billion for anti-terrorism funding, and we simply do not know what that was spent on. There is the billion dollars that went into the G8 gazebos and other funding for the G8. In every single case, Conservatives shut down any sort of inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576281">The NDP is supporting the motion to bring Mr. Anderson before the bar. This is extremely important. These are the tools of Parliament that should be used, and in a minority Parliament, we can use them. However, it is important to note that, every single time during the Harper regime, Conservatives refused to get any sort of information out to the public. They refused any sort of transparency. To boot, they cut back on funding for the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer, two independent officers of Parliament whose jobs are to ensure transparency in the use of public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576282">I find it a bit hypocritical that Conservatives are saying they want to get to the bottom of this when they never want to get to the bottom of it when it is a Conservative scandal. Frankly, when we look at the amount of money the Conservatives misused in their terrible decade in power, it is much more than what has happened under the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576283">We are going to support the motion, but we are also going to call the Conservatives to account.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576289">Today, I rise with a heavy heart to amplify the voices of Edmonton Strathcona constituents, the Lebanese-Canadian community and Canadians from across the country who are devastated by the escalating violence in the Middle East. Canadians believe in justice and fairness in a world where innocent lives, all innocent lives, are protected. We have a history of being peacekeepers, of convening others and of making diplomatic efforts that not only kept peace, but also built peace. However, now, for months, people have been telling me that that is not what they are seeing from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576290">A Canadian citizen of Lebanese heritage told me just this afternoon that she feels as though she does not belong, as though the government has turned its back on her and her human rights. Another individual told me that it is the double standard that is so horrifying to him. He asked me how the government can feel such empathy for Ukraine, and he was very clear that it should feel that empathy for Ukraine and for what is happening in Ukraine, but he questions why there is so little empathy for those who are from Palestine or Lebanon. This breaks my heart. The citizens of this country feel as though the government does not see their humanity, and this goes against everything we believe in as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576291">Tonight, we will speak to the crisis in Lebanon. We must. We must also speak to what happened today just hours ago. Iran launched missiles at Israel, further escalating this global crisis and threatening Israeli civilians. Every member of the House must unequivocally condemn this horrific escalation by Iran. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576292">I want to be crystal clear: Civilians in Israel, in Gaza, in Lebanon and in the wider region are paying the price for the failures of world leaders. The world is on the brink of further violence because we have not been holding political leaders to the standards of international law, we have collectively tolerated the erosion of rules-based international order, we have not done enough to de-escalate and we have not countered the warmongering and the hate that is too prevalent among the powerful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576293">There is no military solution to this crisis. War crimes must not beget war crimes. If we continue down this path, there is nothing but death. For one year, we have witnessed the horrifying violence of Netanyahu's genocide in Gaza, which followed the terrible Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. For one year, our party has appealed to the Canadian government to do the hard work to secure a ceasefire, to implement a real arms embargo, to get Palestinians to safety, to return the hostages, to de-escalate and to save the lives of so many, including children and vulnerable people, especially Palestinians in Gaza, who are bearing the cost of political inaction and the betrayal of international law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576294">We are now here to discuss a new escalation of violence, the violence and aggression that may cost even more lives, including the lives of Canadians. All of us in the House have constituents who have loved ones in the Middle East. The Lebanese community in Canada includes hundreds of thousands of people. Around 45,000 Canadians currently live in Lebanon, and we already know that two have lost their lives. While Canada has offered limited consular services in the form of seats on commercial flights, we know that many people cannot reach the airports due to air strikes. There is no power. There is no Internet. There is chaos, and Lebanese Canadians have told me that they do not know where to turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576295">Over the past several days, a thousand people have been killed in Lebanon, 6,000 have been wounded and one million people have been displaced from their homes as a result of Israeli air strikes. Israeli is bombing densely populated cities, and Hezbollah, a listed terrorist organization under Canadian law, is launching more rockets toward Israel. Tonight, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel, another frightening development that threatens Israeli civilians, who, like everyone else, deserve peace and to live in security. We know this could lead to a wider war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576296">There is retaliation after retaliation, and the escalation is terrifying. We are on the brink, and it is our duty, as parliamentarians and as Canadians, to not just call for a ceasefire, but to use every tool possible to bring about peace.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576297">I want to be clear. Hezbollah is a listed terrorist organization under Canada law that has committed very serious crimes over the decades. Hezbollah and its leaders should be brought to justice, just as the Iranian regime, a sponsor of Hezbollah and Hamas, should be brought to justice. New Democrats have worked hard to ensure that Canada listed the IRGC as a terrorist organization. We worked hard to bring a motion to the House calling for the Toomaj sanctions against Iranian leaders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576298">However, the Iranian people are not the Iranian regime. The people of Lebanon are not Hezbollah. The people of Palestine are not Hamas. The people of Israel are not Netanyahu.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576299">International law clearly states that civilians are never a target, not in Palestine, not in Lebanon, not in Israel and not in Iran. International law states, clearly, that wars have limits. The fundamental rule of international humanitarian law in conflict is that all parties must distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians. What we have seen over the past year with Israel's genocide in Gaza is that the Netanyahu government is ignoring its obligations under international law. There is no consideration for civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576300">Giving people a 30-minute warning that their homes are going to be bombed when they have nowhere to go does not absolve it of its responsibilities. That is not how international law works. Civilian protection is absolute. To suggest that these civilians do not matter or that they are collateral damage, whether they are Palestinian or Lebanese, is racism. It is deplorable. It is dehumanization, and it is intolerable. </ParaText>

The people of Lebanon are still dealing with the worst economic crisis they have ever seen. They have not recovered from the explosion in the Port of Beirut. Their hospitals are short of medicine. The people of Lebanon do not want war. Children will bear the brunt of this war just as children in Gaza have borne the brunt of the genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576302">Just yesterday, Oxfam reported that more women and children were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military than in any other recent conflict in a single year. Thousands have fled for safety. Children are traumatized, and homes have been destroyed. I am grateful to the many humanitarians, medics and helpers who are doing everything they can to save lives and help the one million who have been displaced, but this is a political problem, and it will require a political solution.</ParaText>

There must be an arms embargo, including closing the loopholes that allow weapons to go through the U.S. We must put sanctions on Netanyahu's extremist government. It is clear that over the past year, none of the actions have made Israelis safer. We have spoken to many Israelis who are marching in the streets, opposing the government's violence, calling for a hostage deal and a ceasefire. Arab leaders, such as the Jordanian foreign minister, have stated clearly that Netanyahu is not a partner for peace. There are partners for peace in Israel, people who reject the dehumanization of others, people who yearn for peace and justice for all, but Netanyahu is not one of them.</ParaText>

She has been an incredible advocate and fighter for so many people who need a voice in this place. I am so grateful for her advocacy every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576329">I want to acknowledge the extremely disturbing and unacceptable recent attack in my community that targeted Muslim women who were wearing hijabs in front of their children and family members. I continuously want to say that I cannot believe this happened in my hometown, the place I grew up in, but I cannot say that anymore. This level of hatred has reared its ugly head in my hometown far too often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576330">Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian hate are on the rise across our country. Londoners have endured so much. They saw the tragic killing of our London family. They have watched their family members being killed in Israel, Sudan, Gaza and now in Lebanon. We all need to recognize how our the words we say in this place on what is happening in the Middle East can turn to horrible acts at home. The vilification of Muslims, Palestinians and Jewish people is fuelling the rise of hate and the dehumanization of our fellow Canadians. They need all parties in this place to come together and fight for justice and peace in the Middle East.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576331">Almost a full year ago, the NDP fought for a ceasefire. We called for the release of the hostages, a de-escalation and the protection of innocent civilians from Israel's siege on Gaza. The Palestinian community was repeatedly told that this would be a short incursion to defeat Hamas, but nearly one year later those bombings have only increased. We have seen over 40,000 Palestinians killed, including many children. We have seen the indiscriminate bombing of Palestinian schools and hospitals. We have witnessed the occurrence of war crimes. We have watched in horror as a short incursion turned into a genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576332">Now there is a ground incursion into Lebanon. Lebanon has already suffered the deadliest day of war since 2006, with hundreds of rockets attacking it. Lebanese Canadians are worried sick for their loved ones, many of whom are trapped or fleeing their homes and are seeing the communities they love destroyed. My constituents have directly told me again and again that they do not want war, that the people of Lebanon deserve to live in peace and to rebuild their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576333">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278368" Type="2">Edmonton Strathcona</Affiliation> stated, which I think bears repeating, tonight we are here to speak to the crisis in Lebanon, but only hours ago, Iran launched missiles at Israel, further escalating this global crisis and threatening more civilians. We unequivocally condemn this. Civilians in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and the wider region are paying for our political failures. She said this very clearly. We have seen an escalation of violence because we have not held up a universal standard of international law. We have tolerated the erosion of the rules-based international order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576334">Lebanese Canadians deserve the full protection of our government. The <Affiliation DbId="300003" Type="4">Minister of Defence</Affiliation> said that he is not confident the Canadian Armed Forces could do mass evacuations of Lebanese Canadians. This is unacceptable. These Canadians are fleeing an invasion by a country Canada describes as an ally. There have already been reports of Canadians dying in Lebanon, and the government is still not coordinating a military evacuation. It is shameful that these Canadians are being told to evacuate by commercial flights on their own dime. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576335">Lebanese Canadians are worried about getting their loved ones back after seeing how the Liberals have handled the special measures immigration program for Palestinians. A recent report by Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East shows that the temporary resident visa program for Gazans was intended to fail. Despite increasing the shameful racist and arbitrary cap from 1,000 to 5,000, no one has been able to come to Canada. Palestinians who have been able to arrive have done so on their own with no help from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576336">Let me be clear. Canada can stand up for Lebanese Canadians and their loved ones, can stand up for international law and can stand up to Israel's horrific war crimes, but the government lacks the courage to do so. This is something I have heard repeatedly from my constituents. They have a continual disappointment in the Liberal government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576337"> The Canadian Armed Forces has a presence in the region. It is stationed. It could be called upon to assist in the evacuation of Lebanese Canadians. We can stand up to Netanyahu's extremist government, clearly stating that we will not diplomatically support Israel's ongoing genocide and will not support its invasion and bombing of Lebanon, and we can sanction its war cabinet. We can stand up to the Israel Defense Forces by implementing an immediate arms embargo on Israel. We can stand up to the United States, making it clear that we will review the U.S.-Canada defence production sharing agreement and not allow Canadian-made arms to be used in war crimes by Israel. However, the government refuses to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576338">Today, we need to call on all parties to recognize an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon. The war between the extremist Netanyahu regime and Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, has led to 1,000 deaths, 6,000 wounded and more than one million displaced in Lebanon. War crimes must not beget war crimes. We need to stand up for Lebanese civilians who do not want to see their country face another war. They have struggled for so many years to rebuild their country, to rebuild their systems and to rebuild their infrastructure. Lebanon is already facing the worst economic crisis in history, endured because of the largest non-nuclear explosion ever recorded. Lebanon needs our support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576339"> The Government of Canada must work with the international community to ensure that UN resolution 1701 is implemented in Lebanon in full and immediately. We need to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon are respected. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon has clearly stated that “any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity” and is a violation of resolution 1701. It urges “all actors to step back from such escalatory acts which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed”. The price of continuing the current course of action is too high. Civilians have to be protected, civilian infrastructure must not be targeted and international law has to be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576340">I cannot imagine what it must be like for someone to watch news reports of their country of birth being bombed, to see their home destroyed, a home they had grown up in, and to see all the memories wiped away. Staff in my offices are impacted by this. Staff here in this place are impacted. They do not know where their loved ones are. They cannot get a hold of them. I cannot imagine that terror and witnessing friends displaced and desperate. They are literally holding their breath in fear, hoping desperately they will not get bad news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576341">To all of those people, I am so sorry that Canada is not the strength that it needs to be. These people, who have given so much to this institution, to the work that we are supposed to go forward with, cannot rely upon this country, where they have made their home, for the support they need for the family members, friends and neighbours still there. I have held countless constituents while they cry about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576342">However, I say that we can stand up, that Canada can be a force for peace. We can be. I ask this place to do that, for my constituents and for all Lebanese Canadians, Israeli Canadians and Palestinian Canadians. We need to do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576358">Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking the New Democratic Party for bringing this topic forward for the emergency debate this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576359">There must be no war in Lebanon, full stop. This most recent outbreak of conflict is part of a long-standing cycle of violence in the Middle East. History has taught us that civilians always bear the heaviest price of senseless violence. The continued attacks on Israel by Hamas, a terrorist organization, are unacceptable. Hezbollah, another terrorist organization, has been launching rockets at Israel for nearly a year. Moreover, today's attack on Israel by Iran, a state sponsor of terror, is devastating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576360">We have reports of hundreds of long-range ballistic missiles from Iran, some of which have hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. We unequivocally condemn this unprecedented escalation, which has forced millions of Israelis to take shelter. We reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself. These attacks only serve to destabilize the region further. Canada will continue to do everything in its power to hold Iran accountable for its role in funding terrorist organizations. We urge all parties involved to respect international humanitarian law, protect civilians and humanitarian workers, and avoid any actions that could ignite a regional war. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576361">We are gravely concerned for civilians in Lebanon, including thousands of Canadians. The safety and security of our citizens at home and abroad is our top priority. Thus far, we have been devastated by the deaths of two Canadians, Hussein and Daad Tabaja, who were killed by an IDF air strike while fleeing Beirut. All they sought was to live in security, peace and dignity. The <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has spoken to the sons of Hussein and Daad. While extending her deepest condolences on the passing of their parents, the minister also made clear that she would do all in her power to ensure that Canadians in Lebanon are kept safe. The potential for wider conflict across the Middle East has not been more imminent for decades. The costs of inaction are far too great. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576362">I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278266" Type="2">Mississauga—Erin Mills</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576363">We owe it to the people of Lebanon, Israel and the region to make tangible progress towards peace and stability. Canada is exploring every possible avenue to ensure a diplomatic solution to the crisis between Hezbollah and Israel. Immediate action to stop the violence is urgently needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576364">Canada is committed to continuing its work with the international community to help advance peace in the region. Alongside our allies, we have endorsed a diplomatic settlement and call for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israeli border to provide space for diplomacy. We are also pushing for full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the cessation of all hostilities in Lebanon. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576365">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has engaged leaders from across the region in search of a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. In the past days alone, the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to discuss the situation between Hezbollah and Israel with the Prime Minister of Lebanon and the King of Jordan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576366">Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> was in New York to attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly. While there, she called on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately. In the past days, the foreign minister has also met with the Prime Minister of Lebanon, the foreign minister of Lebanon, G7 foreign ministers and Arab foreign ministers; she has also been in contact with the Israeli foreign minister. The message is consistent and clear: We must see a de-escalation of tensions at the border between Lebanon and Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576367">In response to the worsening conditions in Lebanon, Canada is stepping up its humanitarian efforts. On Saturday, the government announced an additional $10 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of civilians affected by the conflict. This funding will provide food, water, emergency health care, protection services and other life-saving aid to the more than one million people believed to be newly displaced. This contribution is in addition to the $10 million already allocated by the United Nations central emergency response fund, bringing Canada's total humanitarian assistance for Lebanon in 2024 to $37 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576368">Since October 2023, we have been advising Canadians in Lebanon to leave. As the security situation along the border between Israel and Lebanon has been deteriorating, we have been clear with Canadians that now is not the time to travel to Lebanon. The Beirut international airport remains open to commercial flights.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576369">We have already helped secure the departure of hundreds of Canadians through commercial means. Today, we announced that we will increase the capacity for commercial flights out of Lebanon by securing an additional 800 seats for Canadians, permanent residents and their immediate family over the course of the next three days. There is a flight scheduled to depart today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576370">It is critical that Canadians in Lebanon leave now. If they have not registered with the registration of Canadians abroad, or ROCA, they should do so now. Canadian consular officials and embassy staff will use this system to communicate and transmit instructions to those in danger. If they are offered a seat on a commercial flight by ROCA, they should take it as soon as possible. Canadians looking to leave Lebanon should also make sure that their travel documents and those of their spouse and dependent children are up to date and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576371">We will continue to work with industry, international partners and like-minded countries to coordinate contingency planning efforts to respond, should the situation deteriorate further. In the past months, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> has visited the region several times to secure agreements with like-minded countries for use in the event that a large-scale evacuation of Canadians in Lebanon is necessary. We have also increased our diplomatic, consular and security capabilities in the region, such that we can respond more quickly and effectively as the situation continues to worsen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576372">We will exercise every tool at our disposal to ensure that Canadians, permanent residents and their immediate families in Lebanon are safe. We call on all parties to accept the temporary ceasefire.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576373">Should any members of the House require support in providing consular services to their constituents, they should encourage them to reach out to the emergency watch and response centre. Furthermore, they should not hesitate to contact me or Global Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576374">The situation in the Middle East is an unspeakable tragedy. Civilians in Lebanon and Israel, as well as across the region, must be protected and cannot bear the cost of this conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576375">Canada is committed not only to ensuring the safety and security of its citizens but also to reaching a diplomatic settlement in this conflict. Canada has joined allies in calling for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border. All parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, must endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately. Of course, at the same time, we continue to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576376">Canada is committed to the pursuit of peace. We will continue to work with our international partners to advance stability in the Middle East, and we will do everything in our power to protect civilians, hold bad actors to account and push for a peaceful resolution to this conflict.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576390">Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a really heavy heart, but understanding how important it is for us to have this debate today to shed light on what is the living reality of millions of people in the Middle East. As we announce $10 million in humanitarian aid for Lebanon and as I watch our government work really hard to try to make sure there is de-escalation and that we are finding a way forward to peace, I cannot help but think about a town hall I held in my riding over the summer. It was a round table on anti-Palestinian racism. Throughout the summer, I have continued to meet with Canadians of Middle Eastern decent, of Jewish decent. Throughout this whole process, one thing has stood out to me. It is the fear expressed by some residents, who are not Palestinian, that this war would escalate and draw in other nations in the Middle East, and that soon, no one would be safe. We are witnessing that escalation right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576391">These indiscriminate attacks against the people of Lebanon, regardless of the intent to target terrorist Hezbollah, will only bring more war and more death to the region. They will endanger the lives of the people of Lebanon. Netanyahu's violence is now bringing retaliatory strikes that will lead to injury and death of the people of Israel as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576392">Next week will mark an entire year of watching Netanyahu's campaign of violence against the people of Palestine in Gaza and the West Bank. It has been one year of death and violence and famine for over a million innocent Palestinian people. It has been one year since a raid by the terrorist group Hamas killed over 1,000 Israeli people and took hundreds hostage, some of whom have died, while others remain in captivity. What we have watched in the year since is a disproportionate, brutal and inhumane slaughter of innocent lives. It is not a targeted strike, but collective punishment for an entire culture for the actions of specific, extremist people. We have seen, and Netanyahu's regime has made it clear, that they do not see any difference between a terrorist aggressor and an innocent child playing in the street. There is no difference between the terrorist and the innocent and that all must be eliminated. This is how they spoke of Palestine and now how they speak of Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576393">We do not tolerate this type of behaviour from any nation. We must hold our friends to that same standard. Freedom of speech and freedom of expression and protest are protected, but we must ensure that we do not conflate fair criticism of the actions of Netanyahu and his regime in Israel with how it manifests within communities in Canada. Constituents in my riding have told me quite frankly that this concept of de-escalation through escalation is nonsense. It is warmongering, plain and simple. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576394">I stood in the House six months ago and said that Canada is a friend to the people of Israel, but that does not mean that we must support or defend Netanyahu and his regime's horrific actions. Since then, Netanyahu has continued to slaughter Palestinians in Gaza and invaded the West Bank settlements and has now forged ahead another war with the people of Lebanon in the name of destroying terrorist Hezbollah.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576395">This endless cycle of violence and attack has lasted 75 years, and it has achieved nothing. The people of Palestine still live under oppression. The people of Israel and Lebanon still live in fear of rockets and air strikes. Extremism continues to grow and inflict terror, and we are no closer to peace in the Middle East. This way has not worked for 75 years and is not going to start working now.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="30">(1930)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576396">Canada has to be a voice for peace, because this constant war, fear of attacks and inhumane living need to end for the good of the people of Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and all those who call the Middle East home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576397">As I said, I spent the summer talking to my constituents and learning from them. One of the biggest, most tragic moments I experienced was learning about immediate family members who have suffered. My constituents have lost their loved ones to this indiscriminate punishment. They are not terrorists. They are innocent people trying to live their lives. Entire generations have been wiped out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576398">I want to share some of the emails I have received from my constituents about this. The grief, dismay and anger are very real. Everybody in this chamber understands how they would feel if their loved ones were going through the same situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576399">A constituent wrote, “Words are not enough to capture my sadness and disappointment when hearing about Israel's escalation in Lebanon that has already killed hundreds and injured thousands more. Through nearly a year of genocide in Gaza, we have learned that Israel does not value civilian life or infrastructure and instead wants to make its border regions unlivable for all Arab peoples.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576400">Another email stated, “My concerns are amplified when I hear that Canada continues to allow weapons transfers to Israel despite its war crimes and violations of international law in both Palestine and Lebanon, as well as its assassinations in Iran. To date, Canada has only suspended 30 out of over 250 active permits for weapons being shipped to Israel. This comes on the heels of the disturbing revelation that many Canadian companies are sneaking weapons to Israel through the U.S.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576401">There are a lot of concerns from constituents, not just mine but from across the country, who share their viewpoints on all sides of this. People are sharing how afraid they are of this war manifesting here within our communities in Canada. We are obligated, as Canadian parliamentarians, not just to ensure that Canadians are getting the correct information but also to ensure we continue to build bridges, to work hard and to make sure Canada lives up to its record and reputation of being a peacekeeper at home and abroad. We are a multicultural society, a mosaic that believes in diversity being our strength, and it is our strength.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576402">The common ground between all of us is that we are all human. It does not matter what religion we are part of. It does not matter what creed we are or what colour our skin is. At the end of the day, human life is human life, whether it is in Israel, Palestine or Lebanon. We, as Canadians, need to do more. We need to ensure we build those bridges among Canadians and also among the world at large.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576403">As I have done over the past couple of months, I will use my last minute to ask my constituents and all Canadians who are in Lebanon right now to please come home. It is not safe. We are here to provide support. I encourage those who are watching to reach out to their local members of Parliament, including me, to ensure they understand and have the support they need in this really difficult time we are all facing, not just as Canadians but as human beings all around the world. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576408">Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone wants us to engage in partisan rhetoric tonight. This is an emergency debate on how we can have an impact on peace in Lebanon, but I think the main issue is how we can repatriate Canadian citizens who are in Lebanon. Many of them are Quebeckers, since Quebec is home to a large Lebanese community. I think that is what we should be talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576409">What matters most to me in this emergency debate is to help people of Lebanese origin who are caught in this conflict get out of the region. What is the government's response to that? How are we currently helping people get out of that conflict zone?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576419">Mr. Speaker, since the Peace of Westphalia was concluded in 1648, the international system has developed into modern nation states and international law. In the almost 400 years since those treaties were established, the world has created nation states that conduct relations based on international law. That international system further developed after 1945, a period during which Canada was instrumental in creating the current rules-based international system that has ensured our relative peace and security here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576420">Our forebears here in Canada well understood the need for a rules-based system, because Canada paid a high price in the Great War and in the Second World War in defence of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Some 60,000 Canadian soldiers died during the Great War. Some 40,000 Canadian soldiers died during the Second World War. Over 100,000 Canadian soldiers gave their lives in two world wars. Hundreds of thousands more were injured physically and mentally, came home and suffered for the rest of their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576421">As a result of that suffering, our forebears understood the need for a rules-based international system that would ensure not only the peace and security of Canadians here at home but also the peace and security of all humanity abroad. That rules-based system, which we have enjoyed for 80-some years, has given us relative peace and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576422">I want to highlight some very stark statistics to illustrate what I am talking about. There is no doubt that millions of people around the world today have suffered and are suffering. However, that pales in comparison to the bloodshed and the suffering before 1945. Life before 1945, for the vast majority of humanity, was nasty, brutish and short. In the First World War, the Great War, some 40 million people died. In the Second World War, some 75 million people died.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576423">That scale of human misery, suffering and death has largely been avoided because of the rules-based international system that Canada was instrumental in founding in 1945. The deaths from the two world wars were the smallest part of total deaths before 1945. In the period before 1945, people suffered not just because of conflict and war; hundreds of millions more suffered and died because of extreme poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576424">Two-thirds of all humanity before 1945 lived in extreme poverty. Today, only about one in seven people on the planet lives in extreme poverty. In fact, the number of people living in extreme poverty today is not only much smaller as a proportion of the planet's humanity, but it is also smaller in absolute numbers of people suffering, compared to prior to 1945. This is despite the massive growth, the trebling or quadrupling of the world's population, in the last half-century and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576425">The rules-based international system for trade and investment has significantly reduced suffering and increased prosperity. It is the rules-based system that has led to a huge drop in extreme poverty and a massive increase in prosperity for peoples around the world. It is the rules-based system that has led to a significant drop in deaths and suffering from war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576426">It is a system that states such as the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran want to dismantle. They do not want this system. They have been very explicit about this in their speeches and their declarations. They would rather have us revert to a pre-1945 world where power determines relations between states. None of us should want to return to that world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576427">An essential part of the international rules-based system is international humanitarian law, otherwise known as the law of armed conflict. International humanitarian law is the heart of what we are debating tonight in the House: whether actors in the conflict in the Middle East today are acting in accordance with international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576428">Under international humanitarian law, states have the right to defend themselves. On October 7 of last year, a Liberal democratic state was attacked by Hamas. On that day, two and a half thousand Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, breaking through the sovereign 1949 armistice border and killing over 1,100 innocent civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576429">These 1,100 civilians were not killed inadvertently or accidentally. They were not killed incidental to the targeting of armed combatants or military objectives. The innocent civilians were the target. The 1,100 innocent civilians were deliberately and systemically targeted and murdered by Hamas in what constituted a massive war crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576430">They were gunned down execution-style, just like with the mobile killing squad of the Nazis, the Einsatzkommando, which executed some 1.5 million Jews during the Aktion campaign in 1941 in eastern Europe. On October 7 last year, whole families were executed, innocent babies were killed in their cribs and the dead were mutilated. Some of the dead were paraded through the streets of Gaza. There were Canadians among those people deliberately killed, and there were Canadians among those who were deliberately taken hostage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576431">Since Hamas began its attack on Israel last October 7, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran have joined in. Hezbollah has launched some 8,000 rockets at Israel over the last 12 months, forcing the displacement of some 60,000 civilians from the north of Israel to the south, essentially making northern Israel a vacant zone for civilians. These civilians have had to leave their homes and their communities, and the government of the State of Israel has had to evacuate them out of Israeli territory to the south. Today Iran launched yet another attack on the State of Israel by launching some 200 ballistic missiles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576432">All states have a responsibility to defend their citizens and to defend their territory. The State of Israeli is no different. Israeli is at war. This is a legal war under international humanitarian law. The war the State of Israeli is conducting against Hamas, against Hezbollah and against the Islamic Republic of Iran under international humanitarian law is a justifiable war against two terrorist groups and a state that sponsors terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576433">Israel has the right to prosecute this war under international humanitarian law and to prosecute this war to its conclusion that the State of Israel has so determined and ensure that Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran no longer threaten the citizens of its state or its territory. Canada did the same thing during the Second World War. We defended our citizens and our territories against a hostile threat, and the State of Israel has the right to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576434">Millions of civilians are suffering because of the war in Gaza, in Lebanon and in Israel, and we mourn the loss of innocent civilians, particularly women and children. The combatants in this conflict need to ensure that they distinguish between combatants and civilians, and take all feasible precautions in the targeting of military objectives to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576435">Ultimately, the solution to the conflict and the war in the Middle East is for Hezbollah and Hamas to lay down their arms to protect innocent Lebanese and Palestinians, who for too long, for decades, have been subject to these brutal terrorist entities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576436">For too long, Palestinian, Lebanese, Syrian and Iranian civilians have been the victims of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic regime in Iran. For too long, these regimes have suppressed democracy, human rights and freedoms, and the rule of law through brute force. For too long, millions of Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Iranians have suffered. If there is any ray of hope in recent events, it is that they mark the end of the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and the beginning of the end of the Islamic Republic of Iran's hold on much of the region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576437">Canada is a western liberal democracy. What is going on in the Middle East is a clash between a rising authoritarianism, backed by states such as the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and democracies, such as Taiwan, Ukraine and the state of Israel, and in that clash between a rise in authoritarianism and democracies, there is no question on which side of the line Canada should stand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576438">Canada must stand for democracy, Canada must stand for human rights and freedoms, and Canada must stand for the rule of law as it is articulated in international humanitarian law. Conservatives support the state of Israel. The state of Israel is a liberal democratic state. It is also the homeland of the Jewish people. It has the right to defend itself. It has the right to use all legal means necessary under international humanitarian law to ensure its peace and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576439">Israel, like Ukraine and Taiwan, is at the front lines of a clash that is unfolding before our eyes: a clash that we did not anticipate a decade ago, that has unfolded over the last several years. In that rising clash between two very different models of governance, there is no doubt where Canada's interests and values lie.</ParaText>

For example, if we are talking about the world order that was established after the Second World War, that order clearly must have had some grey areas, or we would not be seeing what we are seeing today. Perhaps that is because it was built at the expense of other development models that could have been put in place, but we could have a whole other debate on the history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576442">However, we cannot just say today that this is a democratic state and that we support it, period. Obviously, Israel has the right to exist. That is fundamental. Obviously, Israel is a democracy, and obviously, Israel is a state that has the right to defend itself. Now it is a geopolitical flashpoint in the region. Because it is a democracy, there are debates and people are not unanimous. Benjamin Netanyahu's policy is not the same as Yitzhak Rabin's was.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576462">Mr. Speaker, I want to start by sharing how much I agree with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> on the importance of the rules-based order. I appreciate his focus on international humanitarian law, and I agree with him on condemning Hamas for its terrorist attack of October 7. However, my question to him is about all parties following international humanitarian law. He was looking for examples earlier, and I will cite some for him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576463">From Amnesty International, January 2019: “Israel's policy of settling its civilians in occupied Palestinian territory and displacing the local population contravenes fundamental rules of international humanitarian law.” That was prior to October 7. If the member is looking for post-October 7, on January 26, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to take six actions to prevent acts of genocide. Clearly, we would agree that is against international humanitarian law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576464">Is the member going to call for international humanitarian law to be followed by all parties or only some?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576465">Mr. Speaker, the International Court of Justice did not find that Israel had committed genocide; it just asked the State of Israel to comply with the 1948 Genocide Convention, which Israel is in the process of and has been doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576466">With respect to Amnesty International's interpretation of international humanitarian law, I disagree with its interpretation of the facts on the ground. At the end of the day, there have been no credible reports that I have read that indicate the State of Israel has committed war crimes or has had grave breaches of customary international law. What I do know is that the terrorist group Hamas, in taking some 250 hostages last October 7, did commit war crimes; that is obviously a war crime. Also, Hamas, in executing and targeting some 1,100 innocent civilians, committed war crimes. Those are findings I think the international community has agreed to that adhere to Hamas, for which it should be held responsible. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576469">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by mentioning that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278393" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576470">In this evening's debate, I think that certain observations are absolutely in order at the outset. First of all, this evening, no matter how carefully we comb though the causes of the conflict that started on October 7, one thing cannot be denied: Lebanon is currently in a war zone and, despite all the requests made in the House, despite all the positions taken by the various parties, whether or not they were consensus based, and despite the calls made by elected officials and communities, the situation is escalating. Nothing that we have done, asked for or wished for in the past is going to change anything that is happening now. The conflict is spreading across the region, and now there is a state of emergency, hence the need for this evening's debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576471">Another observation is that, despite the fact that relatively few Canadian nationals in Lebanon have availed themselves of the options to leave the country so far, we must not forget that Canada has certain obligations towards its citizens. We cannot begin to judge the reasons why a Canadian citizen or national would choose not to leave Lebanon or choose to head to Lebanon from Canada. We also cannot assume that, since there are currently 45,000 Canadian nationals in Lebanon, we need to get 45,000 out of there. We will not be able to pick people up from their homes. Some may have specific reasons for staying where they are. We cannot criticize or judge those reasons. We do not know everyone's story. We do not know who has a sick mother who is not a Canadian citizen and who they need to stay with. We cannot know when a father will decide to come back because he is starting to realize that if he stays, he will leave two orphans at home. Canada's obligation is to be ready to respond as soon as a Canadian national asks to leave Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576472">Another observation that must be made is that, unfortunately, Canada has had a less-than-stellar evacuation record as of late. There are lessons to be learned from the past, and tonight, many questions remain. Consider the evacuation that took place in 2006. Canada was criticized when messages sent to expats did not reach them after the power cuts because there was no Internet service and the telephone network was only accessible on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. It is good that the government moved relatively quickly and with increasing insistence in July and August to call on Canadian nationals to leave Lebanon. For the future, however, there are still many questions to be answered, and that is what I am going to focus on this evening. Unfortunately, we do not have all the answers, but there are many questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576473">I am going to start with a brief overview of the situation. Based on current estimates, between 40,000 and 45,000 Canadian nationals are in Lebanon. We know that about half of them, or 20,000, have registered with consular services. About 4,000 have registered with Global Affairs Canada to be kept informed of their options for leaving the country. We know that flights currently chartered by Canada are not 100% full, not at maximum capacity. We know that some people are going in the opposite direction, leaving Canada to go to Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576474"> As members of Parliament, we likely have a lot of questions. After all, we do not have the same expertise or knowledge of the terrain as Global Affairs Canada or the Canadian Armed Forces may have. I hope that what I am going to speak to this evening will elicit a reflection and bring forward factors we had not considered before. So much the better if tonight's debate raises additional questions or sheds light on blind spots that we may not have known about.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576475">I was talking about the issue of the channels of communication. Is there a contingency plan in the event of telephone or Internet outages? Has any thought been given to getting media outlets that are still active on the ground in Lebanon to inform Canadian nationals about the options that are still available for leaving the country?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576476">What is happening with the Canadian embassy in Lebanon? As we know, in Kabul, the government was quick to close the embassy, which left many individuals without access to important consular services. What is currently happening with the embassy, and what are the plans for the future?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576477">What is being done for Canadian nationals whose travel documents or whose family member's documents are not up to date? Are there any options for fast-tracking these applications? We know that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is not exactly the most efficient machine in the world. Has any thought been given to a contingency plan for people who might not have travel documents?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576478">As I mentioned, at the moment, the supply of charter flights exceeds the demand, but this could change. Is there a contingency plan for increasing the number of charter flights if necessary? Is there any flexibility? Above all, is there a list of people who will get priority for flights if the situation changes and demand ends up exceeding supply? As we saw with the Afghanistan evacuation, the issue of prioritization became a problem that we will be talking about for the foreseeable future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576479">Do we know whether the cost of airline tickets is stopping some families from flying out? We know that Canadian citizens are being asked to pay about $445 to board. Payment plans are available, but how effective are they? We know the economic situation in Lebanon. Does a family of four, for example, have four times $445 at their disposal to buy airline tickets right now?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576480">Right now, commercial flights are less and less available. More and more flights are being cancelled. Is there a contingency plan in case there are no more commercial flights? There is the possibility of a maritime evacuation. That was raised. However, what is the current state of the port of Beirut? We know that there have been many logistical problems since the explosion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576481">Are the plans for a maritime evacuation to Cyprus, which took in approximately 60,000 people in 2006, ready?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576482">We went from 50 soldiers on the ground to 200, but is it enough? Do we have the capacity to deploy more troops if necessary? For example, the United Kingdom has currently mobilized 700 people to potentially evacuate 4,000 to 6,000 British nationals who are in Lebanon. We see that the U.K.'s proportion is much higher than Canada's. Is our mobilization capacity adequate?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576483">Are permanent residents and Canadian citizens the only ones who can leave the country? For example, would someone who has a mother, a spouse, or a child who is not yet a citizen be allowed to leave the country with the rest of their family? This could affect their decision to leave the country. How much is Canada co-operating with other countries? Australia, for example, already has a maritime evacuation plan and the capacity to transport 1,000 people a day on commercial cargo ships. Do we have partnerships with these countries, or with France, for example, which already has military ships in the region and has had an evacuation plan for several months, but has just not issued an evacuation order yet? Is Canada working with these countries?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576484">Finally, not everyone still has family or a home base in Canada or Quebec. Is there a plan in place to welcome these people who have left their country? This can also affect their decision to leave a country in a state of war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576485">In short, many questions remain unanswered. In the meantime, I would like to remind the House of the Bloc Québécois' attitude on this issue. On the one hand, we support the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>' calls for Canadian nationals to leave the country. We are asking citizens to do so as much as possible while they can. We pledge not to play needless partisan politics on the evacuation issue. Our speeches tonight show that we will keep a very close eye on this issue. We hope that we have offered some food for thought regarding what still needs to be done on the evacuation front. Right now, we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg, and unfortunately, the situation may deteriorate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576486">Above all, we would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our best wishes to the Canadian nationals and Lebanese population as a whole who are currently living through an appalling situation that they are not responsible for and that may deteriorate considerably in the days to come.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576496">Unfortunately, this goes back to what I was saying earlier. Civilians are usually the first to be affected in a conflict. We have heard about the fact that the strikes are not surgical, and not just in Lebanon. There is always collateral damage. The term “collateral damage” used in the context of war is a euphemism. Unfortunately, the situation will likely escalate in the future. Conflicts harm the innocent and non-innocent alike. </ParaText>

The connection between those events and these events, and frankly much of the violence we see around the world, is the role being played by the Iranian regime, which is seeking to expand its control. It is now terrorizing the people of Lebanon through Hezbollah and the people of Palestinian territories through Hamas. It is terrorizing the people of Iran through its continuing control of Iran. It is present in Iraq, Yemen and many other places. We should have acted much earlier.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576502">Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as eloquent and relevant as my colleague from Saint-Jean. She gave a bit of a preview of what the Bloc Québécois will be talking about this evening. We really want to set aside all partisanship in tonight's debate. This is an emergency debate on how we can have an impact on peace in Lebanon and on the populations affected there. I commend my colleague on her speech. I will try to live up to what she has just said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576503">I will begin this speech by expressing my sincere and profound thoughts for all the families and people affected by the conflict we are discussing this evening. Our thoughts are with the people affected, who are all too often the first victims of these armed conflicts. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278372" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> said just before me, the situation in the Middle East is alarming and getting worse by the minute.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576504">Following a week of heavy Israeli bombing, Israel has just launched a ground offensive in Lebanon, a targeted offensive as we understand it. Thus far, Israel's air strikes have reportedly killed nearly 1,000 people and wounded more than 2,770 people as of yesterday. Earlier today, the deaths of two Canadian nationals were reported. That is what we feared the most, that the conflict would flare up at the regional level. That obviously seems to be happening. Once again, the federal government is failing to show any leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576505">I will explain. As my colleague from Saint-Jean said a little earlier, in 2006, the federal government evacuated approximately 15,000 Canadians, mainly by sea. At the time, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 Canadians in Lebanon. This intervention by the Canadian government was criticized, not for the nature of the evacuation, but for the way in which the federal government contacted and informed nationals. In 2006, the Government of Canada relied on telephone lines and Internet messaging, while a large part of the country was without power. As for the telephone lines, we were told that they were in operation only on weekdays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is bordering on indecency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576506">This poor choice of communication channels seems to be a recurring problem at the federal level when an international crisis is developing, be it an armed conflict or a natural disaster. We need only think of Haiti in 2010. It is as if the government does not learn from its mistakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576507">The situation sadly unfolding before our eyes today is very similar to the one we saw during the evacuation of Afghanistan. I was on the Special Committee on Afghanistan in 2022. My fear is that Canada has not learned from its mistakes, as I just said. Once again, we are witnessing Canada's lack of leadership on the international stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576508">At the risk of repeating myself and at the risk of repeating what my colleague said, I would like to say that last May, the Bloc Québécois proposed 10 measures to the Canadian government regarding the conflict in Gaza. They are as follows: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576520">We add our voice to those of the G7 countries that support the ceasefire proposal put forward by the United States and France, in the hope that a break in fighting will enable a diplomatic path to be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576521">That said, this will require a sustained effort from Canada. The conflict is currently spreading to Lebanon, and Israeli air strikes are reaching as far as Beirut. Israel is scaling up its attacks and, according to many, is preparing for a ground invasion. Not only is it preparing, but it has already begun, albeit in a targeted manner. Even so, Israel is conducting ground operations in Lebanon. It is an alarming situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576522">Many airlines have suspended their flights to Lebanon, which has greatly reduced the opportunities for many people, including Canadian nationals, to leave the country. According to Global Affairs Canada, there are 45,000 Canadian nationals in Lebanon, and evacuation efforts so far appear to be modest. Canada is apparently content to reserve seats on commercial flights. The federal government reported that it has reserved 800 seats on commercial flights, while, as I mentioned earlier, several airlines have cancelled their flights to Lebanon for obvious security reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576523">The Canadian government has reportedly negotiated an agreement with an airline to keep flights going, but if the airport becomes dysfunctional, I do not see how it will be possible to continue evacuating people by air. What is more, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278372" Type="2">Saint-Jean</Affiliation> said, Canadian nationals will have to pay full price for the reserved seats. Given the economic situation in Lebanon, that will not necessarily be easy, especially for large families. Since the Beirut airport is the only major airport in Lebanon, I am worried that many people will have to pay a lot of money and will still not be guaranteed a flight back to Canada. People will have to take the risk of paying and perhaps not being able to leave, which may make them reluctant to book flights to leave the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576524">We also know that evacuation by ship could be an alternative, but only when ships are available, and we do not have any information about that. To make matters worse, Lebanon has been in the midst of an unprecedented socio-economic crisis since 2019. On August 4, 2020, an explosion devastated the city of Beirut and destroyed Lebanon's biggest port, which was also the main point of entry for the country's food imports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576525"> I therefore have serious doubts about the ability to safely evacuate nationals by sea, given that the situation has only worsened since then. In a country already facing economic insecurity and a refugee crisis, now there are also air strikes and ground attacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576526">As I said at the start of my speech, the situation is alarming and, as we have seen throughout the day, it has been steadily deteriorating. As these events unfold before our very eyes right now, my thoughts and, I believe, the thoughts of everyone in the House and those who are not here, but who sit here, are with the people who are currently living in fear, real fear. These are people who are all too often and sadly the first victims of armed conflict and who deserve to see us do everything in our power, as parliamentarians, to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576527">I urge all the parliamentarians taking part in this debate tonight to try as hard as they can to imagine a family currently hunkered down in an apartment in Beirut. I ask them to imagine a father and mother trying to protect their children. I doubt that they are aware that we are having this debate tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to think about these people and perhaps set aside some attacks that might let them score political points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576528">Rather than do that, I sincerely call on all my colleagues, and without any animosity, to think of these people who fear for their children's lives. I think that we can answer some of the questions asked by my colleague from Saint-Jean today if we really want to. Can we work productively with these people in mind and try to have even a small impact, even if we are thousands of kilometres away from this conflict? Are we able to sit down together, work together and save lives? That is basically what should be our greatest concern tonight. I urge my colleagues to think this way and to think of those people who are currently fearing for their lives.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576536">Mr. Speaker, a few months ago, I had the opportunity to connect with people representing the “we want to live” movement. This is a movement that should have gotten, and should still get, more attention and publicity. They are Palestinians living in Gaza who are opposing Hamas. In the summer leading up to October 7, there were significant protests of Palestinians speaking out against Hamas as part of the “we want to live” movement. They are saying that they do not want their lives to be instrumentalized in this violence. They want to be able to have normal lives where they are not constantly being instrumentalized in this struggle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576537">They have asked for the opportunity to not be under Hamas' oppression, to have safe spaces where they can start to build an alternative infrastructure of governance, without Hamas' oppression. I would be curious about this member's comments on that. Are there ways we could support these movements by supporting efforts to rid Palestinian territories of terrorist organizations such as Hamas?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576545">In light of today, I want to start my comments tonight by stating that Canada unequivocally condemns Iran's reckless attack against Israel. This attack demonstrates yet again the Iranian regime's disregard for peace and stability in the region. It has put civilians at risk, forcing millions across countries into bomb shelters in search of safety, and it only seeks to further escalate the conflict. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people. Canada fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against this attack, and we call for the safety of all civilians in Israel and Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576546">We are only a few days away from the one-year anniversary of October 7, the day of the deadliest attack on Israeli soil. We continue to feel the immense pain and grief experienced by so many on October 7, and in the devastating 361 days since, when eight Canadians lost their lives at the hands of Hamas. We mourn their loss, not only as a Jewish community, but also as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576547">For 361 days, daughters, sons, sisters and brothers, mothers, fathers and grandparents have been held hostage in Gaza by Hamas. Their families, and we all, demand for them to come home. There can be no resolution without the return of the hostages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576548">On October 7, that tragic day, 1,100 lives were lost, and the loss of life every day since has been horrific. So many families have suffered in so many different parts of the world and in so many communities, including here in Canada. As Jon Polin, father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a member of my home community in Jerusalem, said so well, “in a competition of pain, there are no winners.” There is only the loss of loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576549">We continue to call for all hostages to be released, for Hamas to lay down its arms, for international law to be respected, for civilians not to be used as human shields and for the escalating violence in the region to end. The escalation of violence today and over the last several weeks does nothing but further perpetuate the cycle of violence that harms everyone in the region. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576550">The violence and attacks perpetrated by Hezbollah on Israeli soil are unacceptable, but we must remember that this is not a new front to this war. Lebanon has been held in the grips of Hezbollah for decades, impacting the lives of Israeli and Lebanese civilians for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576551">Hezbollah is a terrorist organization backed by Iran. This horrific war and its escalation did not happen in a vacuum. Within days of October 7, Hezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel, escalating the conflict, creating a two-front war and resulting in more than 70,000 Israelis being displaced. This escalation served to upend the lives of Lebanese civilians who live along its border. It created devastation and continues to disrupt the lives of Lebanese and Israelis alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576552">It is not enough to say that the violence has to stop and that there needs to be a ceasefire, because if, at the end of this ceasefire and the cessation of violence, Hamas and Hezbollah are still armed, then we have gotten ourselves no closer to ending this cycle of violence. This is why a two-state solution is imperative. This is why recognizing terrorist organizations for what they are is critical to understanding that, in a multilateral world, these are not militias or state actors. These are terrorist organizations that do not play by the rules of what we recognize as a rules-based order. They put civilians at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576553">The cost they exact on civilian populations for their own agenda is what we need to recognize and fight against. They use the lives of civilians, of children and of families. They use their lives and the infrastructure in the homes they live in to wage a war of terror on civilians across the region. That the value of civilian lives is irrelevant in the terror they exact is what we need to recognize and address. The people of Lebanon deserve to live in peace and security, free from conflict and from Hezbollah's Iran-backed terrorism, as do Israelis and Palestinians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576554">The populations of the region deserve nothing less than our collective support as an international community to end this conflict. The only way forward is a safe and secure future for Israelis and Palestinians and a lasting two-state solution. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, let us take pause in understanding what needs to be demanded in the context of a ceasefire. It is not as simple as demanding for the violence to stop. It is about ensuring that, in the days after, Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace, security and dignity because all civilians have a right to live within their homes and in their communities. </ParaText>

Unfortunately, in the intervening time, we have seen the further expansion of that regime's influence, the further empowering of terrorist organizations, which have continued to victimize people throughout the region and, in fact, here in Canada. We never got an answer from the government throughout that time on what its plans were. </ParaText>

He is playing politics with the gravest threat in the Middle East's security in a generation. He is playing politics with the biggest challenge to Canadian religious freedoms since the Holocaust. Let me tell members how he does it. He sends one group of MPs to say one thing to one community and sends another group of MPs to say something else to another community.</ParaText>

Meanwhile, members like the one for <Affiliation DbId="278213" Type="2">Scarborough Centre</Affiliation> call for an unequivocal embargo and actively parrot anti-Israel talking points. Two different MPs give two different messages to two different communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576622">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sends ministers to denounce UNRWA and announce that the Liberals stopped Canadian funding, but then they quietly resume funding just months later with millions of tax dollars. They cannot even take a stand to condemn the immunity for UNRWA employees who participated in literal terrorism. Let us not forget their impeccable timing to reaffirm their unwavering support for UNRWA, just as UNRWA publicly admitted that Fateh Al Sharif, the Hamas leader in Lebanon, was also running an UNRWA school and heading its school union. He was just buried in Hamas regalia, in case anyone missed it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576623">At what point does the Liberal government move UNRWA from the willful ignorance column to the willing co-conspirator column and stop sending Canadian tax dollars that are funding terror? The Liberals are doing so because they lack the courage. Like I said, they lack the conviction to do what is right instead of doing what is popular.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576624">They lack the fortitude to stand with our allies through fire and water instead of just freeloading as usual. They lack the moral clarity to stand with the Jewish community, not just when it is easy but also when it is difficult. There is a steep price to pay for this and for our reputation abroad as it continues to crumble in the face of another equivocation, another reversal and another backtrack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576625">We were once the country that took Juno Beach, that served in Korea and that brought peace to countless nations. We are the country now that cannot even honour its basic commitments and that sends a <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign minister</Affiliation> who has a basic understanding of the threats in the region to any podium where the people in the audience are not questioning her own capacity and the words coming out of her own mouth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576626">It is a steep price to pay for those living in the Middle East as they continue to live under the thumb of oppressive regimes like Hamas and Hezbollah, as they continue to wait for their loved ones to come home and as they continue to yearn for peace and freedom. However, it is also a steep price to pay for the people living here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576627">It has not been this hard to be a Jewish Canadian for a very long time. How could it not be when one cannot hang a mezuzah on the door of their home or the door of their university dorm? Frankly, in almost every Jewish neighbourhood, that is happening. How could it not be hard when one cannot wear a kippah without being followed, verbally harassed or even spit on in this country? How could it not be when one goes to synagogue and finds out, again, that it has been vandalized? How could it not be when one sends their kids to a Jewish school and cannot trust that they are going to come home at the end of the day? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576628">These are not just attacks against the Jewish community; they are attacks against everyone. When the inherent rights of religious freedom, speech, assembly or just plain dignity are denied to one group, it is very easy for people to deny them to another group. When we turn a blind eye to injustice happening here at home, it persists and it gets worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576629">My parents came to this country for freedom, and I am so glad they did. Millions of others came to this country for freedom. However, if they saw the anti-Semitism here today, I wonder whether they would make that same decision, because it has been taking place in this country for far too long. It is not hyperbole; it is a real thing that is happening, and the other side better wake up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576630">I get emails from constituents telling me, “I want to stay in Canada, but I don't know if I can anymore.” They tell me that freedom, the very essence of our country, is in great peril. They are actually scared, in 2024, as Jews in this country. When we lose freedom, we lose something much bigger than ourselves. It is not too late to get it back, but it is going to take far more effort than the window dressing and the posturing that the government has put forward so far. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576631">Since the members of the NDP have become unrecognizable in their pursuit of division in this country and their lack of respect for western democratic values, and since they are unable to muster even the courage to stand on the side of allies' broader requests to discuss the carnage in Lebanon, with barely a mention of Hezbollah, let us go through a timeline so they can join us in the real world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576632">October 7, 2023, was Hamas' attack on Israel, the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hezbollah immediately escalated the aggression, launching more than 9,000 missiles, rockets and drones on northern Israel, which has been evacuated for the better part of a year. After doing the bidding of the terrorists, on July 27 an attack on Druze children by Hezbollah occurred in the northern Golan Heights. A rocket fired by Hezbollah struck a soccer field where children were playing; it killed twelve teenagers and injured dozens more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576633">In response to these attacks, Israel has now launched the largest military campaign against Hezbollah since 2006. The operation targets Hezbollah's military infrastructure, aiming to significantly degrade the group's capabilities. We used to be on the side of fighting terrorism, and in this part of the House, we still are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576634">That brings us to the elimination of one of the most prolific terrorists that ever was, ending a 30-year reign of terror when he dragged his country into one war after another. He was indiscriminate in his terror against Israelis, Americans and thousands of Lebanese and Syrians during his bloody rule, and he enjoyed very little support from his Arab neighbours, the Arab League, the U.S., the EU and Canada, which designated him and his group as terrorists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576635">To watch the flags fly in the streets without a peep from any member of the House is, frankly, unforgivable. To watch members of the House stand in rallies alongside Hezbollah flags is unforgivable. No one wants to see the loss of life anywhere; it is why we are here talking about this. However, it must be said in this debate that the rulers of Hamas and of Hezbollah, and the tyrants in Tehran, are the cornerstone of suffering, and they must come to an end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576636">The people of Lebanon, the people suffering in Gaza, the hostages still in the grips of the barbaric terror, and the brave Iranian people who have taken to the streets to weaken the regime should be the people we seek to fight for. This regime is responsible for stoning women in soccer fields and for throwing gay people off roofs. To watch members of Parliament line up at rallies where its flag is being flown is, frankly, unforgivable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576637">We should not be focused on appeasing the tyrants, not here and not anywhere. We should not be worried about placating the violent, spiteful mob of dictators, murderers and the forces of hatred in power in the Middle East. However, it is what this country has come to; that is what we are doing right now. It is a shame, and it will change the day we elect the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> as the next prime minister of this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576672">Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278131" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576673">Just over 11 months ago, we had an emergency debate on Gaza, and now here we are again in another emergency debate as this conflict continues to escalate, from Gaza to the West Bank and now to Syria and Lebanon. I said it then and I say it again now: There must be a ceasefire. The violence must end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576674">This is a very dangerous moment in world history that threatens to pull in more countries and put more innocent civilians at risk. I am very worried about this continuing pattern of escalation. From the start, my heart and my worry has been with the innocent civilians. The innocent civilians in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon and in Israel want no part of this war. They just want to be able to live their lives, to make a living and to raise their children without the fear of bombing, rockets, missiles or ground invasions. This should be the right of every person, no matter where they live or call home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576675">I visited the West Bank in January, and I met small children who go to bed every night fearful of sniper bullets. I saw the bullet holes near their bedroom windows. No one should have to grow up like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576676">Scarborough Centre is home to a vibrant Lebanese population, and I have been on the phone and at in-person meetings with them nearly constantly over the past week. They are beside themselves with worry for their loved ones back in Lebanon. Communication with them has been spotty and unreliable. As these members of my community watch the news of days of Israeli bombing that has killed hundreds, they hold their breath, waiting for a message from their loved ones to know if they are alive or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576677">No one should be forced to live with this fear. No people, in any country, deserve this. Community members told me of one family in Lebanon who drove from the south to Beirut with their baby and small children, looking for safety. Israeli bombs hit the road ahead of and behind them. They say the children will forever be scared by this experience. They tell me schools are being used as shelters, with people gathering mattresses, food and water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576678">With the news of today's missile attack by Iran, the pattern of escalation continues and the danger for the innocent people of the region increases. I condemn all attacks that target innocent civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576679">This conflict did not begin 11 months ago. These are not the first bombings of Gaza or Lebanon. These are not the first rocket or missile attacks against Israel. The roots of this conflict are deep, and they must be addressed substantively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576680">However, what must be abundantly clear is that Israel's actions are not making anyone safer: not the people of Palestine, not the people of Lebanon and not the people of Israel. Instead, this widening conflict is only making everyone more unsafe. The pattern must end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576681">In December, Canada called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Last week, Canada joined the United States, the European Union and nine other allied countries in calling for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Unfortunately, last week's call for a ceasefire has been ignored, as was the one in December. Repeating the same thing that has failed again and again, and expecting different results, is a strategy proven to fail. It is time to move beyond statements; it is time for action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576682">Canada must implement a clear and unambiguous two-way arms embargo. No Canadian-manufactured weapons should be used to kill any innocent civilians, and there must be no loopholes, such as shipping weapons via the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576683">I welcome the recent comments by the global affairs <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> regarding an arms embargo, but I am asking the government for a clear statement that brokers no confusion: a clear and unambiguous two-way arms embargo with no qualifications, exceptions or asterisks for existing contracts.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576684">We must go further still. Calling for a ceasefire and an arms embargo is the least Canadians expect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576685">Let us look at the on-the-record, public comments of Netanyahu and his cabinet, who have a habit of saying out loud what would ordinarily be kept quiet. On Israeli TV, education minister Yoav Kisch said Lebanon and Hezbollah are indistinguishable, “Lebanon will be annihilated” and the people of Lebanon will pay the price. That was the latest in a pattern of disgusting and dangerous comments by ministers in the Netanyahu cabinet. Deputy Speaker Nissim Vaturi made a call to “wipe Gaza off the face of the earth” and added that “Gaza must be burned.” He went on to say, “There are no innocents there [in Gaza]”, and, referring to the Palestinian people, he said, “I have no mercy for those who are still there. We need to eliminate them”. These are just a few of many examples. These are not the words of a government that Canada can call a friend or ally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576686">Canada cannot accept pro-genocide comments by any government. Officials advocating for genocide must be banned from entering Canada and there must be sanctions against a Netanyahu government that refuses to even consider peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576687">Last week at the United Nations, Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said Arab and Muslim countries would guarantee Israel's security if Israel agreed to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The proposal was dismissed outright by Netanyahu. He has shown no willingness to achieve a just peace that will bring safety and security for Palestinians, Israelis and Lebanese.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576688">It is past time for Canada to recognize the Palestinian state. It does not need to be studied at committee. The government can stand up today, in this House or outside it, and declare that Canada recognizes the Palestinian state. This would show that Canada believes in the right of self-determination for all people, and it would send a clear message to Netanyahu's ministers who want to “wipe Gaza off the face of the earth”: Canada will not stay silent in the face of genocide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576689">I also worry deeply about the impact this conflict is having on people here in Canada. It is tearing communities apart. I see the rising incidents of anti-Palestinian racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and I worry about the walls being built between Canadians. This cannot continue. It is very important that we make sure this conflict does not further increase anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Semitism or Islamophobia here in Canada. This summer, I heard from Canadians, from Scarborough to Vancouver, on anti-Palestinian racism, and I heard very clearly that this needs to end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576690">I want peace for the people of Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. I urge Canada to use all of its diplomatic tools, including sanctions, to exert pressure for an end to this conflict. Too many innocent civilians have already paid with their lives. If this is allowed to continue, many more will die as well. It needs to end. We need to make sure innocent civilian lives are protected. We have seen enough.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576695">Madam Speaker, at least 1,000 Lebanese people have been killed by Israeli bombs in the last few days. One million people have fled their homes. Almost 45,000 Lebanese Canadians currently live in Lebanon. They are worried and terrified. They want Canada to stand up and protect them, but where is Canada? It used to be a champion of peace and justice, including in the Middle East. Instead of that, it has been part of the problem, failing to stand up to Netanyahu's far-right, genocidal government. The Liberals have been speaking from both sides, playing politics with communities and people's lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576696">Why has Canada failed to call for a permanent ceasefire now and to bring in a full, two-way arms embargo that does not include loopholes? Why has it failed to apply sanctions on Israel to the fullest extent and refused to recognize a Palestinian state? Why is it dithering while Lebanon is invaded and bombed? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576704">Madam Speaker, I rise tonight with sorrow and pain, and with a heavy heart, to join in this emergency debate and to use my voice. There is a political, social, economic and humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, my beloved homeland, a place that many thousands of families in my community have ancestral ties to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576705">As we stand here today, many fear that this is the beginning of a full-scale invasion that will lead not only to further loss of life in the Middle East but also, possibly, to a third world war. We are witnessing the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Many civilians have died, including two Canadians; their sons say they were fleeing to safety on a congested highway. I grieve alongside their family and loved ones. These are unnecessary, avoidable deaths. These people should be with us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576706">According to Lebanon's acting Prime Minister, the number of displaced Lebanese people is nearing one million, the largest number the country has had to handle. We know that there are tens of thousands of Canadians in Lebanon, and that is why the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and the Government of Canada have been urging Canadians to leave Lebanon for almost a year now. I do not know how many times I have repeated that call in Halifax and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576707">The escalation of war in the region would be catastrophic. Lebanon already has the largest number of refugees per capita in the world. The Lebanese people are at risk of losing their lives, livelihoods, sovereignty and independence. Canada must do what it did in 1956 and be a leader in establishing an international force to stabilize Lebanon and the region, act as a peacemaker and help address the displacement of people in the region. I presented a petition last week from hundreds of Lebanese Canadians calling upon the Government of Canada to do just that, and I know many thousands would echo them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576708">I have been clear and consistent in my own position, and this informs the advocacy I have been doing, particularly over the last number of months. We must call, and continue to call, for all parties to de-escalate. War will not help anyone achieve their objectives. We must protect civilians, the elderly, children and women. We must safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, a beautiful, diverse and proud nation that we should remember is smaller in size than Prince Edward Island, at 10,452 square kilometres. That number is etched in the hearts and in the minds of all Lebanese people. Growing up, we used to buy, necklaces that have those numbers on them. We still do. This is our Lebanon; nothing less.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576709">I have been seeing posts all day today from people in my riding and people I know, and they break my heart. There are posts saying, “In Lebanon, we survive in pieces, yet somehow remain whole” and “It's why we think of Lebanon as the land of heartbreak and hope intertwined.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576710">I was fortunate enough to live a number of years in Lebanon and attend elementary school there. In 1975, the fighting started, and then it escalated. Schools closed, medication and food started to get scarce, people were killed, roads were destroyed and the airport closed. My family was one of those who ended up escaping in the summer of 1976. It was devastating, and the journey was tough and rough; however, we were some of the lucky ones. Once we eventually reached Halifax, we had a home and my parents had an existing business. The trauma was real, but we were safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576711">I learned the English language and, years later, was one of the top students as I graduated grade 12. I was a young girl of 10 years and 11 years of age at the time, and I blocked out a lot of the trauma in my older age. However, every time I heard about the deaths, the destruction and the hostilities in the region, the pain was there.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576712">In 2006, I was a mother of four children ranging in age from five to 18. We had planned for over two years to take a family trip in July to see our family and homeland. Two to three days into our trip, missiles and bombs began to drop. As Canadians, we were terrorized. What would happen? How long would it last? We had work to return to. The kids had school. We had commitments. Countries called their nationals and told them, “Come, be evacuated by sea.” We were registered with the Canadian embassy and received the call. I will say, it was a nightmare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576713">That is the truth that I and many survived. This is the lived experience that informs me in this moment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576714">Canada has a duty to use every tool in our diplomatic tool box to prevent this destruction of lives; indeed, Lebanon is a country we have had strong relations with for over seven decades. We must make all diplomatic contacts possible to mobilize the G7 to respond to this crisis. We must facilitate negotiations at the UN Security Council. Canada must pressure all sides not to bomb the airport in Beirut, the port and the critical infrastructure that people there depend on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576715">In the face of a dire shortage of medication, Canada must respond with humanitarian aid and match donations to trusted organizations, such as the Lebanese Red Cross. The Lebanese ministry of health has released a list of needed medications, and I believe we must do everything we can to help ensure that supplies are provided and distributed as quickly as logistically possible. Over the weekend, new support was announced for Lebanon; I am grateful to the <Affiliation DbId="300012" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and his team for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576716">I know better than most how disastrous an evacuation could be for Canadians in Lebanon. According to the Canadian embassy, Canadians are the largest foreign community in Lebanon. We must do everything we can to avoid reaching that point, but we must prepare for the possibility as well. I also believe we have a duty to streamline IRCC processes in order to assist Lebanese citizens who are currently in Canada but cannot return to their home country at this moment. These are all points I have made in my conversations in the last several weeks, and I am grateful to have had the chance to discuss them personally with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="263835" Type="20">Deputy Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and many colleagues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576717"> As an MP who has publicly called for a ceasefire in Gaza for almost a year now, I was deeply relieved to see Canada stand with many of our allies to call for a 21-day ceasefire at the Israel-Lebanon border. This is a recognition of a growing consensus. Too many civilians have suffered because of the violence in the region, and it must stop. Lebanese and Israeli people deserve nothing less than peace and security. A ceasefire is the only way to reach that goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576718">I would tell Canadians in Lebanon that they should please prioritize their safety. They should leave while flights are available; it is the safest and easiest way to do so. While Canada is not evacuating Canadians in Lebanon at this time, we are helping Canadians who want to leave to take advantage of available commercial flights. I recognize there are some who may not wish to leave. Canadians in Lebanon should register with the registration of Canadians abroad at our embassy in Beirut to receive critical information. We know that some airlines have temporarily suspended service, and that is why the Government of Canada has assisted with seats on airplanes. If people register as wanting to leave, they will get a call and have all that information. There is assistance if they need travel documents and cannot find them. There is a line to assist with the required electronic travel authorizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576719">In closing, I want to thank the member who called for tonight's debate. I want to say that the people of Lebanon do not want war. They want peace and security. May God bless Lebanon and this country.</ParaText>

There are stories of so many people losing their eyes and different limbs that the hospitals cannot cater to all of them. There are many crises where medication is needed. Food is becoming scarce and many people from the south have now started to move to other areas in parts of Lebanon. I have seen on Facebook, even in an area where I grew up, that churches everywhere have opened. They are bringing people in and collecting food, just like we do here as Canadians, but it is happening now throughout the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576741">It would be nice, for once, for Israel not to be blamed for being shot at. It would be nice, for a change, for Israel not to be labelled a villain for protecting itself. It would be nice if the House stopped living in a perverse inverted reality where Israel is framed as bad. It would be nice if Liberal members would stop saying one thing to one community and something completely different to another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576742"> It would be nice if the House recognized that as a liberal democracy, Israel is on the front lines of protecting western values and our way of life. We should do all we can to help in this pursuit or, at the very least, not make it more difficult for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576743">On October 7, 2023, the evil death cult Hamas invaded Israel without provocation. It attacked multiple communities, as well as the Nova music festival. It targeted and murdered 1,200 innocent Israelis and took 250 more hostage, which is a war crime to be sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576744">Since that time, Israel has been drawn into a conflict it did not seek and it did not want. Shortly after those attacks, the Iranian-backed terrorist group, Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, began raining down rockets on the people of northern Israel, over 11 months ago, forcing 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576745"> These innocent Israelis were made refugees in their own land. I ask members to imagine if this happened in Canada. Imagine if tens of thousands of Canadians could not go back to their homes because of attacks like this by an invading force. How long would it take our government to respond? Would it be a day, a week, a month? Israel has waited patiently for almost a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576746">Any sovereign nation has an obligation to protect its citizens, to protect its territory, to safeguard its security, and to defend itself and its citizens. Israel is no different. For this conflict to end, the aggressors, Hezbollah and Hamas, must immediately stop attacking Israel and lay down their weapons. Hezbollah is a terrorist group backed by the tyrants of Tehran.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576747"> The truth is, the Iranian regime, through its proxy, Hezbollah, is holding Lebanon hostage and deepening the suffering of its citizens. Canadian citizens have been warned for months to leave Lebanon immediately while commercial options exist. Conservatives reiterate that call and encourage Canadians to please get out now. As long as Hezbollah is raining terror down on Israel, as long as it is causing suffering among the people of Lebanon, it is not safe to be there. We call on the government to immediately provide a full and transparent update on the contingencies in place to evacuate Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576748">At home, since October 7, we have seen an unprecedented rise in anti-Semitism in Canada. B'nai Brith reports in its anti-Semitic incidents report that anti-Semitic incidents have increased by 109.1%. In 2022, there were 2,799 reported incidents, and in 2023, that number was 5,791, which is a staggering increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576749">We see it in our streets. There are anti-Semitic mobs calling for death to Jews and death to Israel. Synagogues and schools have been shot at and vandalized. Jewish-owned businesses have been targeted, only because their owners are Jewish. Hospitals founded by Jewish communities have been targeted. The anti-Semitic Hamas death cult fan club has been going into Jewish neighbourhoods and demonstrating outside of seniors' homes. This madness must come to an end. It is just not the Canadian way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576750">What have the Liberals done to help? They have done nothing. In fact, they have made it far worse. When the conflict first began, they publicly scolded the IDF for ostensibly bombing a hospital in Gaza, when it did not do so.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576751">The Liberals voted for and passed a motion in the House that punished our democratic ally Israel by blocking arms sales and rewarded Hamas by reinstating funding to UNRWA, even though its employees participated in the October 7 attacks. When that motion passed, they got up and gave themselves a standing ovation. They were proud of what they had done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576752">It should go without saying that Canadian tax dollars should not be funding terrorism. The Liberals voted for a one-sided, anti-Israel motion at the United Nations. Even after Iran launched a direct attack with hundreds of missiles and drones, they did not remove the arms ban. Just today, Iran attacked Israel once more, but will they remove the arms ban? No, of course they will not. They say that Israel has the right to defend itself, but then they deny Israel the means to defend itself. With friends like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who needs enemies? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576753">All of these actions taken together signal to the anti-Semitic mob that the government gives them the green light. UNRWA directly contributes to the radicalization of Gazans. It has been known for years that UNRWA school material promotes the hatred of Israel and Jews and the culture of violence that has poisoned the minds of young Gazans and made a lasting peace so much more difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576754">What was not expected is that employees of UNWRA, which is part of the United Nations, participated in the slaughter, killing and kidnappings on October 7. Canada gives tens of millions of hard-earned tax dollars to UNRWA each year. Knowing about the anti-Semitic school materials alone should have been enough to cut it off, yet we are still paying. Just last week, a senior Hamas official in Lebanon was killed. He was also the head of the UNRWA teachers' union. A high-ranking UNRWA official participated in the October 7 slaughter, yet we are still paying. UNRWA should not be receiving tax dollars from Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576755">Last November, I travelled to Israel with some of my colleagues. I had the opportunity to meet with family members of those who were murdered and those who were taken hostage on October 7. I had the opportunity to see Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the communities that was attacked. I saw the burnt up, shot up blackened homes, a sight indelibly and forever etched in my mind. I promised those families that I would bear witness to their plight. I am doing that here right now, so I say that ours is a promise to keep, to bear witness and to work until every hostage is home and every Jew, no matter where they live, work or go to school, once again feels safe.</ParaText>

This is the same party that has had members of caucus stand in front of Nazi flags.

However, there has never been so much talk about everything happening in the Middle East.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576767">First of all, I must say that I very much appreciated the speech tonight by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation>, our foreign affairs critic. I do not want to repeat his entire speech, but I invite Canadians and Quebeckers to take a few minutes to listen to it. He reminded us what it was like for Canadians who lived through the two great wars. Countries were forced to take up arms to defend themselves and, more importantly, their people against deadly attacks from authoritarian states.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576768">As I said, I do not often get a chance to talk about the conflict. The conflict is not a simple one. Many of the constituents I meet ask me to explain what is really going on in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Iran, and what the roots of the conflict are. I do my best to answer their questions. It really is a lot more complex than it appears at first glance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576769">A year or so ago, I could have provided the beginnings of an explanation about the situation in the Middle East, but on October 7, 2023, that explanation broke down. The horrors of October 7 will be etched in the memories of Jewish communities around the world for a long time, as well as international rights advocates and all those who are directly or indirectly interested in the rich history of the Middle East. It will be etched in my memory for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576770">On October 7, a liberal, democratic state came under attack. Israel was attacked by the terrorist group Hamas. Israel was invaded by 2,500 Hamas terrorists, who crossed a sovereign state border established in 1949 to kill more than 1,100 civilians. Over 1,100 people died. These poor people were not killed by accident or as collateral damage. They were systematically, deliberately targeted and murdered by the terrorist group Hamas. They were slaughtered. On October 7, entire families were executed, innocent babies and children were killed, together with mothers, fathers and young people. Imagine parents in Canada sending their children to a big festival attended by youth groups, where the only goal is to have fun and enjoy life. Now imagine the festival being targeted by a terrorist attack, and most of the participants being hunted down and killed by terrorists. Imagine the horror. In fact, it is impossible for us to imagine it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576771">On top of that, some victims were paraded around the streets of Gaza. Their mutilated bodies were displayed like trophies at a parade. Canadians were among those who were deliberately murdered or taken hostage by Hamas. Some hostages are still being held captive a year later, those who have not already been killed by the terrorists, that is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576772">That is the origin of the war we are talking about and witnessing right now in the Middle East. It was a brutal terrorist attack on the sovereign land of Israel, and these terrorists are responsible for the situation we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576773">Unfortunately, other groups have decided to join Hamas. Ever since Hamas launched its attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran have deliberately chosen to commit terrorist acts against the people of Israel. Since October 7, 2023, Hezbollah has launched some 8,000 rockets at Israel over the past 12 months, forcing the displacement of 60,000 people. These 8,000 missiles filled with explosives were fired for the purpose of killing civilians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576774"> All states have a responsibility to defend their citizens and their territory, and the State of Israel is no different. Israel is at war. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278408" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills</Affiliation> said, and I quote: “This is a legal war under international humanitarian law. The war the State of Israel is conducting against Hamas, against Hezbollah and against the Islamic Republic of Iran under international humanitarian law is a justifiable war.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576775">I agree with my colleague that war is never pretty, but it is sometimes justified. This war against terrorist groups and a regime that sponsors terrorism is justifiable. Israel has the right to defend itself against the 8,000 rockets that Hezbollah has fired into its territory over the past year. Israel has the right to defend itself against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which launched hundreds of missiles into its territory just last night. Israel has the right to pursue this war against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran to protect itself and, above all, its citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576776">Imagine for a moment what would happen if Canada were attacked by terrorist groups. There is no doubt that all of us here would agree to defend our families and our children, and to use whatever means necessary to do so. That is what Israel is doing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576777">However, we have to recognize that war is war. Millions of innocent civilians are suffering as a result of the war in Gaza, Lebanon, and Israel. Obviously, we mourn the loss of innocent civilians, especially women and children. All combatants in this conflict must be careful to distinguish between fighting forces and civilians. Every possible precaution must be taken to minimize the harm caused to civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576778">To end this war, Hezbollah and Hamas must lay down their weapons to protect the innocent Lebanese and Palestinians who have been subjected to these brutal terrorist entities for decades. The citizens of Israel are not the only victims of these terrorist groups and regimes. Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Iranians have been and continue to be victimized by Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576779">Allow me once again to quote my colleague from Wellington—Halton Hills: “For too long, these regimes have suppressed democracy, human rights and freedoms, and the rule of law through brute force.... If there is any ray of hope in recent events, it is that they mark the end of the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and the beginning of the end of the Islamic Republic of Iran's hold on much of the region.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576780">I share my colleague's opinion and I wish from the bottom of my heart for these peoples to find a lasting peace, free from these authoritarian terrorist groups and regimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576781">In Canada, we value the freedom that our democracy affords us. It may not be perfect, but it safeguards our freedom and the rights of every citizen of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576782">Unfortunately, what is happening in the Middle East is a battle between our liberal democracies and authoritarian states and groups, such as the People's Republic of China, which is baring its teeth at Taiwan, the Russian Federation and its illegal attacks on Ukraine, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which supports terrorist groups against the State of Israel and which has just taken up arms against it. What do Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel have in common? They are democratic states, like us, that are being threatened and attacked by the authoritarian regimes I just mentioned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576783">Canada must defend democracy, human rights, freedoms and the rule of law as set out in international law. To end the war, the hostages must be released. Hamas must release the hostages. Hezbollah must stop its attacks on the people of Israel. However, more is needed. These terrorist organizations must be dismantled. They must cease to exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576784">The Conservatives support the State of Israel. Israel has the right to defend itself and to use all of the legal means necessary under international humanitarian law to ensure its peace and security. Clearly, when there is a choice to be made between authoritarian and democratic states, Canada should have no trouble choosing what side we are on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576788">They keep talking about not giving weapons to Israel. Does the member understand the way the arms trade treaty and Canadian law work? Canadian law says that we are not able to send weapons to any country that may be perpetrating a genocide. The International Court of Justice has said there is a plausible case that genocide is being perpetrated, so it is against the law for Canada to send weapons right now to Israel. It is against the Canadian law. He should know that.</ParaText>

We hear all the time here that we want to have a ceasefire, but I never hear from the Liberals or the NDP about the government in Lebanon. Why can it not stop Hezbollah? Why does the Palestinian authority not stop Hamas? They have not been able to, so that does not leave any other option to the Government of Israel but to go and defend themselves and protect themselves, which means that they actually have to go and hunt out the terrorists who are attacking their country and their citizens.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576803">As we know, Lebanon is the country of cedars, often referred to as the “Switzerland of the Middle East”. Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations and was represented at the time by Charles Malik within that organization. It is a country of builders and an active member of the international Francophonie. This beautiful country invented the alphabet and built the first ship in history to better export its knowledge and share it with the rest of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576804">Canada, its parliamentarians and the international community cannot remain silent in the face of the bloody conflict in the Middle East.

              <ParaText id="8576805">A week ago, on the first day of this conflict in Lebanon, when the pagers exploded, in one single day there were 600 dead. Among them were doctors and nurses who worked in the medical field at hospitals. More than 2,000 were wounded and the hospitals were not able to meet the needs of those patients. The day after, there was another explosion of walkie-talkies, which caused more than 400 deaths and a couple of thousand injuries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576806">In the operating room at the hospital, there was a doctor who is an ophthalmologist and president of the University of Balamand. I know him very well and I spoke with him. In an interview with BBC News, he said, “Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes.” Dr. Elias Warrak added that more than 60% to 70% of the patients ended up with at least one eye removed. He said, “Some of the patients, we had to remove both eyes. It kills me. In my past 25 years in practice, I’ve never removed as many eyes as I did yesterday” in one single day. That kills me too. I am sure if any of my colleagues in this chamber witnessed such a situation, it would kill them too.</ParaText>

They are people who deserve to live in dignity, to live in prosperity and to have everything they need in their daily life. I believe the best and quickest solution is to apply United Nations Resolution 1701. It was agreed to on both sides in 2006. That resolution must be applied and respected by both parties to the conflict. That would put an immediate end to this war and let peace prevail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576808">I condemn the killing of any human being. I am not a religious man, but I was born and raised in the church as a Christian, and I respect all religions in the world. I respect Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and all human beings. Our Christian religion orders us to love even our enemies. How can someone ask me to approve a killing? I have a deep feeling that it is criminal, it is terrorism, when any human being, politician, leader, prime minister, president or state kills or orders the killing of a human being. We do not approve of that; we have to condemn it. We have to work together and see peace prevail.</ParaText>

I would like to appeal to our government and every government in the world to send the money directly either to the Red Cross or to NGOs that are registered with, approved by and reporting to the United Nations in order for the money to reach the people who are in need.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576825">Madam Speaker, there is one party that does want war. It is the Islamic Republic of Iran. This summer, I was in Argentina. It was the 30th anniversary of the bombing of the AMIA, the Jewish community centre in Argentina, which was the deadliest attack on Jews between the Holocaust and what happened on October 7. That attack in 1994 killed 85 people and wounded 300.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576826">Who was the attack carried out by? An Argentinian court ruled this year that the attack was directed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and carried out by Hezbollah, an organization that has killed and terrorized people around the world, not only in Israel, where millions of Israelis are being terrorized by the Hezbollah rockets being fired on their country on a repeated basis, but also in other countries as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576827">Why does Iran want this? It is because Iran wants division. Iran wants its horrible regime to be able to get away with human rights violations in its own country, so it creates chaos abroad. One of the ways that it creates chaos is by attacking what it calls the “Zionist regime”, a regime that the supreme leader of Iran believes should be eradicated. Iran finances terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, to rain rockets on Israel and to do things like the massacre of October 7, where over 1,200 people were murdered, hundreds were injured and hostages were taken, many of whom are still in tunnels in Gaza. That is the situation that Israel faces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576828">I do not think that there is anybody in the chamber, in any party, that has a monopoly on virtue. Everybody cares about the civilians who are going to be harmed in any country, whether it is Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Gaza or Iran. Nobody wants harm to happen to civilians. The issue is the moral clarity of saying who is responsible for what is happening. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576829">There has been an attempt this evening by some speakers to blame Israel for all of the events that have happened, when Israel was attacked on October 7 last year and has had, for years, missiles fired upon it by Hezbollah from Lebanon, because the Lebanese government, which may very well be of good faith, is unable to fulfill its obligations under a UN resolution saying that Hezbollah has to vacate south Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576830">Israeli civilians would be killed in drastic numbers if it were not for Iron Dome. We keep forgetting that. We keep pointing to the mass casualties in one place and not another, but the reason for that is the Iron Dome. Israel is fighting terrorist organizations on every single front. It is not a country that has just suddenly decided to start bombing here and start bombing there. The idea that we can assign all of the blame in a conflict that has started more than any of our lifetimes ago, and not even in 1948, as it started before then, but let us say, going back to 1948, to one side is absolutely irreconcilable with factual history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576831">I decided to come back to speak tonight because I wanted to make sure that, on this side of the House, there were some people who would say that because it is not right to claim that Israel is entirely responsible for what is happening. In fact, I think it is pretty clear that Iran has a huge amount of responsibility for what is happening. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576832">I also wanted to say in this debate that we all hate hate. Hate is a horrible thing against any group, whether it is against Muslims, Jews, gays, Christians, people of colour or anybody, but it has to be said that, over the last 11 months, the Jewish community in Canada has faced hate in epic proportions, which has not been seen in any of our lifetimes. Jews constitute about 1.4% of Canada's population, while more than half of hate crimes, in some cases up to 70%, are against Jews. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576833">It does not make sense that we have people in our streets who are yelling support for and flying the flags of terrorist organizations, and who are telling Jews to go back to Poland. That is horrifying. The fact that the police are not enforcing the law when they see people crossing that line, flying the Hezbollah flag and screaming at people to go back to Poland, is absurd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576834">I want to propose some solutions that would make it a lot easier to say that governments at all levels are combatting hate because right now no government in the world is combatting anti-Semitism enough. In Canada, the federal, provincial or municipal governments have not done enough to confront the epidemic of anti-Semitism in our midst. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576835">Policing is a municipal jurisdiction. Enforcement of the Criminal Code is a provincial jurisdiction. It is not right to blame the federal government for all this happening, as some are trying to do. However, that does not mean we cannot show leadership. It does not mean that the federal <Affiliation DbId="299997" Type="21">Attorney General</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> cannot convene the provincial ministers of public safety and attorneys general to have a discussion about hate and anti-Semitism, to say that we need specific hate crime prosecutors who are geared toward hate crimes, to ensure that police have proper training, to ensure hate crime units are set up across the country, to ensure that police know that politicians at every level in the country, federal, provincial and municipal, will have the backs of the police when they enforce the law. That is what we need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576836">We need the Samidoun and the Houthis to be designated as terrorist organizations, the same as we have designated the IRGC. We need the Parliament of Canada to create a new intimidation offence, what I would call bubble legislation, to say that, if someone were to try to block people from entering or leaving a school, community centre, community building or a place of worship, they would be breaking a very specific provision of the Criminal Code. Again, that does not mean it would not be better done by the provinces. The provinces and municipalities could easily create buffer zones around these buildings. It is a shame they have not done so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576837">Over the last summer, university campuses were my priority. Since last June, I have been talking to universities across the country. I worked with Deborah Lyons, Universities Canada, the U15 and university presidents to set out a group of things that universities needed to do. We worked together to make sure that universities are committed to enforcing their codes of conduct and ensuring Jews were included in DEI programs so that anti-Semitism programs are to be given by groups that are representative of the mainstream Jewish community and support the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. Even though it is a provincial jurisdiction, our justice committee has gotten involved. We have done hearings. We are going to do a report. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576838">There are things that we can do to confront this problem. I call on all of us to work together to make sure that we have a fair understanding and balance of what is happening in the Middle East and that we confront anti-Semitism and hate in Canada.</ParaText>

I have been listening closely to the debate tonight, and I have appreciated the comments from hon. members on both sides of the House. This is a serious issue for us to discuss, and we are all concerned about the devastation in the Middle East and for Canadians who are in the region. I urge them to get out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576857">Like all Canadians, I am extremely concerned for those caught in the maelstrom of violence, particularly in Lebanon, where people are only looking to live their peaceful lives. However, there are other inhabitants of Lebanon as well, those who do not have this same purpose. Their purpose is one of destruction. Their purpose is to destroy Israel. I am speaking of the militant terrorist organization Hezbollah.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576858">Hezbollah exists with the aim of destroying Israel. Let us be clear on this: Hezbollah is not the Government of Lebanon, nor does it represent the Lebanese people. What it represents is hate. It is an evil proxy for the Islamic Republic of Iran and it carries out its heinous wishes. It is a terrorist organization, working in league with Iran, with an aim of eliminating our ally and friend Israel. Hezbollah has been raining rockets on the people of northern Israel for over 11 months. Hezbollah has forced 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes. Hezbollah, through its actions, has made life miserable for people across the Middle East, and it must be stopped.</ParaText>

Remember, it was Hamas that made its incursion and raid into Israel almost one year ago today. That barbaric raid, which has been unequivocally condemned by all civilized humans, included the massacre of 1,200 people and the capture of 251 civilians, of whom 101 are still in captivity, not all amongst the living.</ParaText>

This is a shame. </ParaText>

In today's question period, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> asked if the government would declare that Israel has the right to defend itself. After all, the Islamic Republic of Iran sent some 200 missiles into Israel.

Instead, she said she had merely been in contact with her Israeli counterpart. Yes, she condemned the attack by Iran, which is the obvious thing to do, but the rest of her answer could hardly be construed as a robust support for our ally.</ParaText>

The people I represent have told me that their kids are afraid to go to school, they do not feel safe in our streets and they are saddened and horrified by the repeated violence in the Middle East. There are some who stand against Israel, or at least the Israeli government. That is to be expected in a pluralistic society, but they are all united in their want of peace, their wish for a world without terrorist. A ceasefire is what they want, then peace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576873">To that end, I would like to invoke the words of our former prime minister, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney, as I conclude my remarks. He too was a steadfast defender of Israel. As recently as last year, he said, “I think that Canada could have only one position—complete, blanket support for Israel and unrelenting denunciation of a jihadist criminal group, namely Hamas.” We can certainly add Hezbollah to that list as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576874">Let me be clear: No one wants war, no one outside the Islamic Republic of Iran, as we heard earlier tonight, but no one wants to be left open to the terrorism of Hezbollah either. These terrorist organizations have brought destruction and devastation across the Middle East for decades. It is time for them to end their attacks. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576885">The member asked earlier in the evening about the arms embargo that New Democrats have been calling on the government to undertake. There is arms trade treaty legislation in this country because we are signatories to the genocide convention, which says that we are in fact not able to send weapons to any country that may be engaged in a genocide. The international justice system has said there is a plausible case for genocide. The genocide convention does not require proof of genocide; it requires a plausibility or a likelihood of genocide, so it is against the law for Canada to send weapons to Israel at this time.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576889"> Madam Speaker, as I rise tonight, millions of Israelis are watching the sun rise after spending their night in bunkers after the criminal region in Tehran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at them. I am here to argue for our duty as Canadians in this conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576890">First, it is our duty to support and proclaim Israel's right to defend itself. There is no ambiguity in this fact. Israel is the indigenous homeland of the Jewish people, and the state of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people. This is an unambiguous fact. On October 7, the terrorist regime in Tehran and its proxies violated international law and started a war in the Middle East. It was they who broke the ceasefire and chose to keep the conflict alive. The only groups who deny this fact are extremist regimes that want to see the destruction of the Jewish people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576891">Second, it is our duty to acknowledge that the suffering, instability, death and destruction in the Middle East are caused by terrorist entities: Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the IRGC. They reject the right of Israel to exist, seek the death of the Jewish people and seek the end of democratic nations. These are groups responsible for the deaths of countless Israelis, Canadians, Americans and people from around the world. This is also an unambiguous fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576892">Third, it is our duty to acknowledge that even though we are a world away here in Canada from the physical reality of this conflict, we are nonetheless in its orbit. Resisting the genocidal regime in Tehran and all its terrorist proxies, like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others, cannot be left to Israel alone. These terrorist groups do not want to negotiate or de-escalate this position. They want to kill Jews and end Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576893">It is dangerously naive to believe that these groups, which have for the entire history of their existence killed Jews and subjugated women and sexual minorities, will somehow now, because someone asked politely, change their goals. These terrorist groups know that de-escalation is a modern-day euphemism for appeasement. They know that appeasement has never before stopped a Jew-killing regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576894">As the wife of a combat veteran who has a military family in more than one sense, and a shout-out to CVMA OK-1, I know this fact all too well. I know this in my heart, and I know this in my family. These regimes will not stop if we ask nicely. This is also an unambiguous fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576895">Fourth, it is so easy for us here in the comfort and safety of our country to revel in our decadence and to take academic positions on this conflict. We do not sit in bunkers or have to fear for the lives of our families, that they will be murdered, kidnapped or raped by terrorist organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576896">We must support those who are fighting against this terror, those who support the right of Jews to exist in their indigenous homeland and the freedom that democratic values of human rights bring. That is because to do otherwise is the antithesis of Canadian pluralism. If those in this place are not willing to fight against murderous terrorist regimes that want to end our democratic values and kill Jews, then I fear for more than the state of Israel. I fear for the sustainability of Canada's own sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576897">Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, we must call for an end to the crass politics with which the federal government has approached this conflict. Canada has a diverse pluralism of people from around the world and from every faith, but instead of projecting a national identity that would knit this nation of many people together, the Liberal government has long purported that there is no such thing as a national identity and no common values for the people who live on these lands to rally around. I reject that notion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576898">The Liberals have attempted to wedge the various diaspora groups of this country apart. This conflict has shown the lengths to which the Liberals are willing to go to achieve this political goal. Instead of instantly condemning the atrocities of the criminal regime in Tehran today and their proxies against the Jewish people and the innocent civilians living in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, they wait. They wait for a very long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576899">The Liberals take hours to test the waters and have focus groups to see which group they can curry the most favour with. Then they send out backbench members of their caucus to take diametrically opposite positions. That is not fair either. Then the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign minister</Affiliation> makes a weak statement, sometimes inferring that Israel does not have the right to defend itself. Only then, hours or days later as the case may be, does the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> weigh in with a sanitized statement that leaves so much room for interpretation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="25">(2325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576900">Why do the Liberals do this? They do this because they are failing in the polls and they have lost the ability to inspire Canada with a stand that takes a courageous position. They do this because their caucus is divided behind a failed and feckless <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> and their <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> who is planning a leadership bid to replace him. She first considers the calculus of how many memberships she can sell within diaspora groups, as opposed to doing what is right for any of the people affected by this conflict: Palestinian, Lebanese or Israeli alike. It is disgusting. There are names for the type of people who do what the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> are doing right now. None of them would be considered parliamentary language.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576901"> The net effect of this Liberal fecklessness has been felt by minority communities here in Canada. In Calgary, my home city, the federal government's inability to stand for what is right is a clear reason and it is the reason for the rise in anti-Semitism in this country. If the federal government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> continue to say that it is okay to give a wink and a nod or turn a blind eye in moments when courage is needed, when they turned a blind eye to the genocidal regime in Tehran and their proxies, then what is to stop those who hold extreme beliefs here and act upon them here in our own country? The answer is “nothing”, and that is exactly what we are seeing on the streets across this country and it is why, as the Calgary Jewish community goes into the high holidays tomorrow night, instead of being able to focus on their Jewish new year dinner with friends and families, they need to focus on efforts of security to ensure their community can go to synagogue and gather safely. It is why university students in the Calgary Jewish community say that they do not want to promote Jewish events on campus for fear of retribution, in Calgary. These people should be allowed to be proud to gather as Jews as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are upon them, without feeling the hate and fear that has constantly surrounded them for the last 11 months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576902">Therefore, I stand here in proud solidarity with them to demand the following: that the federal government recognize that the suffering of the Palestinian, Israeli, Lebanese, Iranian, Syrian and Yemeni people is directly and solely due to the murderous actions of the genocidal terrorist regime in Tehran and its proxy groups; that the federal Canadian government demand the immediate release of Israeli hostages and that the regime in Iran and its proxies immediately lay down their arms and cease their attacks against Israel; that the Canadian government support unequivocally the right of Israel to defend itself, which means unambiguously rejecting calls to end arms support to Israel; that the Canadian government unilaterally reject the anti-Semitic boycott, divest and sanctions movement; that the Canadian government publicly recognize the failure to enforce UN Security Council resolution 1701, which was designed to disarm Hezbollah and prevent its re-arming, which it has clearly failed to do; that the Canadian government reject recognizing a Palestinian state while Hamas, a terrorist organization responsible for the death and destruction of countless people, reigns, and without condition; and that the federal government immediately cease funding to UNRWA, whose workers took part in perpetrating the October 7 massacre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576903">This afternoon, someone I know in Israel sent me a picture of her and her daughters in their bunker. What struck me was the eyes of her girls, filled with normalization of daily assaults on their nation, their ethnicity and their faith; but also embedded in their eyes was a look of defiance and confidence. That look in the eyes of the Israeli people is an ember of hope; not just for Israel but for the entire world and every one of us in this place. In their eyes, I saw peace born in strength. May each of us see the same.</ParaText>

Then it said, no, we still want to kill more Jews and we do not want Israel to exist. Their supporters, including those here in Canada, mourn.

Time and again we have witnessed crises engulfing the Middle East escalate and consume countless innocent civilians. Many Canadians, some with family ties to the region, are paying close attention to the current crisis and are rightly demanding that our government take any action and all diplomatic action to de-escalate the conflict, to collaborate with other members of the international community to secure an immediate ceasefire, and to ensure that all Canadians and their loved ones in the region are assisted to safety.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576919">Madam Speaker, the minister said, “The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” Given the missile attacks launched by the Iranian regime today, I think we can agree that the minister's statement was prescient and accurate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576920">The minister also went on to add, a few days ago, in the same address to the UN, “We are concerned that a war between Israel and Hezbollah would have devastating consequences, while adding to the already severe humanitarian, economic and political crises in Lebanon.” The minister was also prescient on that particular point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576921">Over the past week, over one million people have been displaced in Lebanon. In addition, we have also witnessed tens of thousands of Israelis having to evacuate their homes in the north of Israel. The suffering on all sides needs to end. All parties must respect UN Security Council resolution 1701. The UN's Blue Line buffer zone has been violated, and it is integral that Israel and Hezbollah agree to an immediate ceasefire that would allow Israeli and Lebanese civilians to return to their homes and live in peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576922">Such a humanitarian situation is clearly unsustainable. The longer the conflict rages, the more innocent lives will be scarred by it and the deeper those scars will be. At a time like this, we must all take a moment to reflect on the devastation we have been watching in the region over the past year after the heinous terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's invasion of Gaza that followed. We should all be horrified to see innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians pay the ultimate price for the failure of a much-needed ceasefire. We have been watching extremists on all sides dictate the course of the conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576923">Over 100 Israeli hostages have yet to return home from captivity at the hands of the terrorist entity Hamas. In addition, the fighting has displaced practically the entire population of the Gaza Strip. If there is one lesson to be learned from the experience of the past year, it is that innocent Palestinians, women and children, should not have to bear the price of defeating Hamas. By the same token, Lebanese civilians should not bear the consequences of Hezbollah's terrorist actions. Rather, the Lebanese should have the right to live in peace and security throughout Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576924">Therefore our government must remain steadfast in affirming our wholehearted commitment to an immediate ceasefire and to ensuring that we are taking concrete diplomatic steps to achieve the same. This includes leveraging our influence in the region to pressure all sides to de-escalate. We should all remain committed to humanitarian relief and medical aid for all displaced civilians in the region. Canada should never aid and abet violence. We owe it to the Lebanese—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8576929">I start out tonight by saying that there are few countries that are closer to my heart than Lebanon. There have been few people closer to my heart than the Lebanese people since my very first trip, when I spent time there in 1982, and experienced the war with people in Lebanon. The most recent outbreak of violence that has happened there is part of a long-standing cycle of some 50 years of chaos, interruption, war, civil conflict and international conflict, which has continued to plague the people of Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576930">October 7, however, was a watershed moment. The attack by Hamas on Israel and Israelis was a heinous, horrendous crime against humanity and a crime against the people of Israel. Hezbollah, its sibling terrorist organization, has been launching rockets at Israel ever since. Today's attack on Israel by Iran, a state sponsor of terror, is devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576931">We have reports of hundreds of long-range ballistic missiles, some of which have hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As a government, we unequivocally condemn this new and unprecedented escalation, which has forced millions of Israelis and Lebanese, as well as Palestinians, to take shelter. We want it to be absolutely clear in the House that we affirm Israel's right to defend itself within international law. Attacks by Hezbollah, Hamas and Iran against Israel kill not only Israelis but also civilians in other countries; they destabilize the region, and they risk turning this into a wider regional war.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576932">Canada will do everything in its power to continue to hold Iran accountable for its role in funding terrorist organizations. We are one of five countries that have named the IRGC as a terrorist organization. We urge all parties involved to respect international humanitarian law, to protect civilians, to protect humanitarian workers and to avoid any action that could ignite this war further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576933">We are gravely concerned about civilians in Lebanon tonight, thousands of whom are Canadians. The safety and security of Canadians at home and abroad is our top priority. This does not mean we value one human life over another; rather, as a government, we have a particular responsibility to protect Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576934">We were devastated by the death of two Canadians, Hussein and Daad Tabaja, who were killed by an IDF air strike while fleeing Beirut. All they sought was to live in security, with peace and dignity. We will continue to help Canadians escape Lebanon, to ensure that they reach safety and peace and to give them advice and warnings to get out of the country as quickly as possible, before this conflict spreads even further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576935">This is a conflict that has been going on, as has been said in the House, for decades. We owe it to the people of Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and the region to make tangible progress towards peace and stability. How do we do this? It is more than words, but we begin with diplomacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576936">War kills people, not ideas. Diplomacy allows people to change their minds, for ideas to develop; ultimately, diplomacy does lead to peace. This past year, Canada has been exploring every possible avenue to ensure a diplomatic solution to the crisis in the Middle East, and it will continue to help solve the problem between Hezbollah and Israel. Immediate action to stop the violence is urgently necessary. We are committed to working with the international community to help advance peace in the region. Alongside our allies, we have called for a 21-day ceasefire along the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy and conversation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576937">We are also pushing for full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the cessation of hostilities in Lebanon. Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been working this issue, working the phones and having conversations with leaders around the world, in search of a diplomatic solution. In just the last few days, the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to discuss the problem between Hezbollah and Israel, as well as the attack on Israel by Hezbollah, with the Prime Minister of Lebanon and the King of Jordan.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="45">(2345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8576938">Last week, our <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> was in New York for the 79th United Nations General Assembly. She called upon all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse a temporary ceasefire immediately. We are dealing with terrorist organizations, so diplomacy is particularly challenging, but rhetoric in this place does not change that reality. We still need to use all the tools we have in the diplomatic tool box to find a solution to a long-standing, generation-after-generation conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576939">Our <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> continues to talk to the Prime Minister and foreign ministers of Lebanon, the G7 foreign ministers and the Israeli foreign minister, and her message has been consistent and clear: We must see a de-escalation of tensions at the border between Lebanon and Israel, and we will continue to defend Israel's right to protect itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576940">While we have been doing this diplomatic work, we have also been engaging in humanitarian assistance. The conditions in Lebanon are worsening every day. We have been working in a way to try to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. We are continuing to work in the West Bank, we are continuing to work with women, particularly victims in Israel, and we will continue to work in Lebanon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576941"> On Saturday, the government announced an additional $10 million in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of civilians affected by this conflict. This funding will provide food, water, emergency health care, protection services and other life-saving aid. In addition to the $10 million already allocated by the United Nations central emergency response fund, Canada's total humanitarian assistance for Lebanon in 2024 is $37 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576942">We are working at this diplomatically with conversations every day. We are working at this in defence of Israel and working to combat terrorist organizations, which are a scourge on this planet. We are also working with Canadian citizens to help get them out of Lebanon. We have done that in Gaza with great difficulty. We have done that in Israel. We have done that in the West Bank, and we are now trying to do that in Lebanon. It is not easy with a terrorist organization like Hezbollah, but we have been very clear with Canadians that they should get out while commercial flights are available. We have announced an additional 800 seats today over the course of the next three days that Canadians, permanent residents and immediate family have access to. There is a flight scheduled to depart today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576943">We will continue to work through every possible channel for the safety of civilians in Israel, West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon. The situation can deteriorate, so we will continue to provide diplomatic solutions and offer the best that Canada has to offer to ensure that we find ways for this conversation to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576944"> There are no easy solutions to this problem. There are no easy answers to it. There can be rhetoric, there can be name-calling and there can be blaming, but rest assured that everyone on this side of the House, and I believe on that side of the House too, believes in Israel's right to defend itself within international law. We believe in the right for civilians to have safety and peace and humanitarian assistance and the right to live a good life. We all share that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576945">This conflict will not be solved by this debate tonight, but what can be solved tonight is to find a way to bring Canadians together to look at the needs of every person living in the region and to understand that we have to find a way to do that. Rhetoric that divides will not help. Rhetoric that brings us together will help. We will continue to do that.</ParaText>

Today, during question period, a very simple question was put to the <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>. The Minister of Foreign Affairs refused to answer it during question period, so I would like to give my hon. colleague an opportunity to do so. It is a very simple question: Does Israel have a right to destroy the terrorist organizations that have attacked it? In other words, does Israel have a right, in the government's view, to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah?</ParaText>

The reality is that Israel has a right to defend itself, and there are international laws that they also need to follow. Israeli citizens tell me that every day.

              <ParaText id="8576952"> Madam Speaker, so many Lebanese Canadians are watching what is happening, and when I spoke to some this afternoon, they were telling me how horrified they were that there were components and military goods still being shipped from Canada. There is still a need for an arms embargo on Israel so that those weapons cannot be used against innocent civilians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576953">I believe the member wants to stop the bloodshed, stop the war and work toward peace. However, the <Affiliation DbId="278529" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> has promised an arms embargo, yet she has still not made public a notice to arms exporters. I am wondering when Lebanese Canadians and all Canadians can expect to see that posted. It should take about 30 seconds for the minister to put that online.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8576961">Madam Speaker, I just want to point out how disappointing it is that a government that tries to present itself as an ally of the only democracy in the region, of standing shoulder to shoulder with a people and a country that have been subject to the worst attacks that human beings have been able to conceive of, will not unequivocally and clearly state that the country, Israel, and its people have a right not only to defend themselves, but to destroy those who attack it over and over again. We are not talking about squabbles over natural resources or where borders should be drawn. We are talking about terrorist organizations that deny Israel's right to exist at all, and that state in their charter that they not only want to dismantle the state of Israel, but they want to end Jewish lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576962"> When this member, this <Affiliation DbId="278918" Type="4">foreign minister</Affiliation> and this government cannot unequivocally state that, when faced with those types of threats and attacks, Israel does not have the right to destroy terrorist organizations is to deny to Israel what every other state in the world would claim for itself. Let us make no mistake, if Canada or our NATO allies were continuously subjected to terrorist attacks, rocket launches and missile launches, not only would we defend ourselves, but we, as a people, would demand that our government destroy those who are perpetrating such acts of terror. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576963">However, this is a pattern from this government. We saw this when the head of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, was eliminated. World leaders around the globe, who have a wide range of views on the conflict in the Middle East, were all united on the idea that Nasrallah headed up a terrorist organization, that he was responsible for the loss of many innocent lives, including 240 American lives and dozens of French lives, and the list goes on and on. We do not have time in the short amount of time left to us to enumerate all the atrocities that Hezbollah has committed and all the innocent lives that were lost at its hand. However, this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> basically put out a statement, which was probably was written by AI or copied and pasted from Wikipedia. It made no mention of the justice that was done and the relief that many people felt that this terrorist leader had finally been eliminated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576964"> I grew up in Ottawa, and there is a very significant Lebanese population in Ottawa. I have known many people whose families fled here after Hezbollah started to destabilize that country. Lebanon had a long history of a wonderful quality of life and relative peace and security. Beirut used to be called the Paris of the Middle East until IRGC-backed terrorist entities like Hezbollah started to infiltrate Lebanese society, weaken the Government of Lebanon and basically act as a parallel state, handing out its own form of perverse justice to those who opposed its radical agenda and perpetrating crimes against its own people. Hezbollah and Nasrallah himself aided the genocidal and psychopathic regime in Syria that had committed so many war crimes against its own people. Yet, we see this moral equivalency from the government after the news of Nasrallah's death was made public, and we see it again tonight on display here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8576965">In closing, I will just basically say that it is very clear that on this side of the House, we stand for human rights, we stand for the rule of law and the rule of international law, and we recognize Israel's right to exist and Israel's right to dismantle those entities that have their stated purpose as the elimination of Israel and the death of Jewish people. On that side of the House, we have a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who says one thing to one group of people and another thing to a different group of people, because he will not take a principled stand. That is the choice that Canadians have, and we know where the Canadian people stand. They stand on the right side of history, they stand on the side of innocent human beings who are just trying to defend themselves, just trying to carve out a small place on the planet where the Jewish people can live in peace and security, and that is where the Conservatives stand as well.</ParaText>
