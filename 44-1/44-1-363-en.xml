            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8660528"> Mr. Speaker and colleagues, as we approach Veterans' Week and Remembrance Day, I stand before the House a very grateful Canadian. We come together to recognize the remarkable Canadians who have served and proudly worn the maple leaf on their shoulders, including some of my colleagues here in this place today. This upcoming week is not only an opportunity to commemorate their sacrifice, but a chance for all Canadians, young and old, to reflect on the freedoms and rights we enjoy today thanks to the service of these brave individuals.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660529">Every year, especially in November, people across the country gather to pay tribute to those who have served or are still serving Canada. From the hills of Beaumont-Hamel to the Persian Gulf and the skies above it, from the mountains of Afghanistan to places right here at home, our veterans have demonstrated unwavering courage and resilience. Their stories remind us of their strength and the profound impact of their service.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660530">This week, as we close Women's History Month, I am thinking of women veterans and what so many of them have had to overcome in the service of our country. Over the past year, I have had the privilege to meet many of these women, who have shared moments with me of their time in the military. They have shared stories of pride in service, of hardship and of how they fought and continue to fight through it all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660531">Although women only began to serve in combat roles during the Persian Gulf War, the legacy of their service to Canada is much longer: as nursing sisters during the First World War, as decoders and “Wrens” during the Second World War, and, to fast-forward to today, as captains leading combat missions, flying squadrons and even leading the entire forces as the chief of the defence staff. I encourage all Canadians to learn more about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660532">This year also marks the 60th anniversary of Canadian peacekeepers joining the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus, and the 50th anniversary of the 1974 war, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. As we mark this anniversary, I am thinking of the group of veterans who are preparing to return to Cyprus to rekindle memories with their fellow service members and to share this history with Canadians. I am reflecting on the service of the 36,000 Canadians who participated in Operation Snowgoose, and those who remain there today in what is one of Canada's longest overseas military commitments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660533">Many veterans continue to live with physical and psychological scarring from their time in Cyprus and in other operations around the world. We cannot ignore the heavy toll service takes on the men and women, and also their families, who sign up to serve no matter the risk. This Veterans' Week, I ask each of us to pause and reflect on what service means to us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660534">This Veterans' Week, I encourage all Canadians to participate in local activities, volunteer their time and reach out to veterans in their community. Simple acts of kindness, such as a conversation, a shared meal or even a friendly ear, can go a long way.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660535">We have a collective responsibility to educate future generations about RCMP and CAF veterans and their families. By sharing the stories of those who served and what they gained from their experiences, we foster gratitude, pass on history and, most importantly, leave them with lessons that have endured for more than 100 years. As the air force motto says, “Through adversity to the stars”.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660536">Let us also take the time to recognize the contributions and sacrifices of equity-deserving veterans, such as indigenous and 2SLGBTQI+ veterans, as well as those of people who have served in non-combat roles. I have met so many veterans from these groups over the past year, and all of them are very proud of their military careers and their contributions to maintaining peace and security around the world.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660537"> This Veterans' Week, let us be united in a common goal to be there for veterans and their family members. Above all, let us make sure they know and that Canadians know how much we value their service and contributions to our country. Together, we will never, ever forget their sacrifices.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660538">Mr. Speaker, I, along with a full delegation of Canadians, recently visited Normandy, France, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. I had the honour of standing on Juno Beach with some of the heroes who stormed that beach on June 6, 1944. They were the heroes who saved the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660539">Those brave young Canadians who stormed the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago were the greatest generation. One of those heroes was 102-year-old Charles Davis of Windsor, Ontario, who arrived in Normandy on D-Day plus four and was part of the campaign inland as Canadians and our allies liberated Normandy from the Nazi invaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660540">Canada is home to many such heroes, heroes who endured conditions unimaginable to most of us. They are heroes like Samuel Sharpe, then a Conservative member of Parliament who rose up a battalion from his riding and led them in Europe during the First World War. They are heroes like Lloyd Hamilton, a Métis soldier who once acted to save 80 Korean children from an orphanage during the Korean War. They are heroes like Nicole Langlois, who was part of the first deployment of female soldiers in a frontline role. They are heroes like Rick Mohr, whose surviving family was the first to receive a Memorial Cross awarded to a Persian Gulf veteran related to illness linked to his service. They are heroes like Jess Larochelle, whose courage while severely wounded in Afghanistan saved many of his fellow soldiers. Although awarded the Star of Military Valour, Jess tragically left us last year before ever seeing his government recognize him with the Victoria Cross that many feel he deserved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660541">They are heroes like the 66,000 Canadians who laid down their lives during the First World War. They are heroes like the 44,000 who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Second World War, the 516 who gave their lives in Korea and the 158 Canadian Armed Forces members who lost their lives in Afghanistan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660542">Let us never forget that these are not just numbers or statistics. They represent real people who laid down their lives for our freedoms. They were young men and women who had hopes and dreams that will forever go unrealized.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660543">They did it for all of us, so that we could continue to live in freedom. They did it voluntarily, in the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice. It is a debt we can never repay.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660544"> In much the same way, there is never enough that we can do or say to thank those who served the country and came back forever changed. Whether their injuries are physical or psychological, they leave deep scars, often having a lasting impact on their relationships, on their families and on their futures. We owe it to them to ensure that what they fought for is never taken for granted.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660545">We pay tribute to their loyal service and sacrifice. It is a great honour for me to be here today to express to them, on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, all common-sense Conservatives and all Canadians, our gratitude, our admiration and our deep respect, and to promise them that we will always be there for them, as they have been there for us.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660546">My wife Carmen and I recently welcomed our little baby daughter Jade into the world, and when I think about the Canada that I want her to grow up in, it is one where we have heroes like Charles, Samuel, Lloyd, Nicole, Rick and Jess defending our freedoms and values. It is the Canada that tens of thousands who made the ultimate sacrifice gave their lives for. It is the one where those heroes and their families get the respect and appreciation they deserve, because the freedom for which they spilled their blood, the democracy for which they suffered and the sovereignty for which they died are not the property of this generation to surrender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660547">Let us all teach our children, as we will teach Jade, about these heroes and their bravery, about the constant battle of good versus evil, about freedom over tyranny. If we ask those veterans to tell us the single most important thing we could do to repay them, I know they would all say the same thing: to never take for granted that which they fought for, our freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660548">Please join me and my colleagues, Canada's common-sense Conservatives, in making that commitment today. We pledge to uphold those freedoms. It is how we will honour their memories, thank them for their service and show our respect for their sacrifice. Freedom came at all costs, and at all costs we must ensure it is maintained.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278669" Type="2">Mr. Luc Desilets (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8660550">Mr. Speaker, thank you for granting me the right to speak, which I consider extremely important, especially in light of the current international situation. Today's global geopolitical climate is fraught with tension among the major nations of our planet, among our major powers, and various conflicts are unfolding on a global scale.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660551">War is not limited to the 1914-18 war, the 1939-45 war or the Korean War. It encompasses a host of conflicts that are making headlines in our daily newspapers and opening our eyes to concerns of global or planetary proportions. In this context, the significance of November 11, Armistice Day, becomes very real. As I see it, this day carries an even more important and powerful message about the need to educate the younger generations about the consequences of war and the importance of peace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660552">Remembrance Day is a time to commemorate the victorious end of World War I, but above all to remind ourselves of the value of peace. Over the years, the day has also become an opportunity to show our immense gratitude to those who manned the front to defend our liberty, our democracy and our peace, and who paid the ultimate price, sacrificing body, mind and soul.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660553">We must also pause to acknowledge and thank veterans of all wars, not only the two world wars and the Korean War. I am referring to the operations in Cyprus, the conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the war in Afghanistan, not to mention the Somme, Pas-de-Calais, Vimy, Dieppe, Hill 355, Sarajevo, Kabul, I could go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660554">In all of these battles, soldiers from Quebec fought under the Canadian flag. Women and men exhibited unstinting bravery and dedication in some of the most difficult and complex circumstances imaginable. The sacrifices these military personnel made earn them equal recognition to those who fought in other major wars, by which I mean the First World War of 1914 to 1918, the Second World War of 1939 to 1945 and the Korean War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660555">In fact, for a Quebec sovereignist such as myself, this commemoration uniting 54 countries of the British Commonwealth is a chance to recall that our national project builds on the values defended by these heroes and on the ironclad solidarity we maintain with our historical allies. We have countless reasons to be proud of their acts of bravery. I think it is essential and our duty to promote the values of reconciliation and solidarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660556">Wearing the poppy over the heart from the beginning of Veterans' Week until Remembrance Day may be a small gesture, but the symbolism behind it could not be larger. In doing so we proudly recognize the value of peace and recall the sacrifices they made for us and for our democracy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660557">This great ritual dates back to the armistice of 1918, with the cessation of hostilities on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month marking the end of 1,651 days of total war that left over nine million dead and unaccounted for. More recently, the ritual has broadened to include the veterans of all wars. Today I invite all parliamentarians to take a few minutes to reflect on the significance of this day, on the significance of peace and on the consequences of these wars.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278631" Type="2">Ms. Rachel Blaney (North Island—Powell River, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8660559">Madam Speaker, as the NDP critic for Veterans Affairs, I am honoured to work with many veterans, who have served our country bravely and who endure many challenges once they enter civilian life. I want to acknowledge that, as we walk into the week of remembering veterans, I have stood by many graves, both in our country and other countries, and read many of those names. They are the people who made the ultimate sacrifice. One of the most painful moments is when we see those who were not named and we know there is a family that still does not know where their loved one is. Today, in this place, we hold their memory up in remembrance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660560">Veterans tell me that recognition of their sacrifices, and those of their family members, means so much to them. Therefore, it is my honour today to stand in this place and recognize the Canadians who serve in the military, past, present and future, to remember those who lost their lives in the line of duty and to show respect for those who continue to serve in war, in peace and in protection of our rights and freedoms. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660561">The cost of war is high. There is far too much conflict in our world right now. We continue to send Canadians into danger, be it going on peacekeeping missions, going to areas of international violence or helping at home to fight forest fires and pandemics. It is how we support the military members when they return home after their service that confirms our act of remembrance, our promise to take care of them. This is so important. Canada must stop failing to uphold this promise. Commemoration of military service is not only about building monuments or holding ceremonies on remembrance days. It includes those things, but it also means much more to veterans. Nevertheless, many Canadian veterans do not feel well supported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660562">Indigenous veterans who fought bravely for Canada in the 20th century were stripped of their status when they returned home, facing poverty, inability to go home to their communities and racist attitudes. They were really dismissed, even though they provided the greatest service to Canada. Today, Canadian indigenous veterans continue to work towards the acknowledgement of that and of their current service. They continue to tell the stories of their heroism and leadership, lifting up a history that Canada has too often forgotten. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660563">In the eighties and nineties, 2SLGBTQ+ veterans were purged from service because of an oppressive policy of heteronormalization. A terrible historical wrong was done to thousands of Canadians, who were victimized solely because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660564">Persian Gulf veterans are still fighting for the government to recognize them for having served in a war so that they can receive the same benefits as those who came before them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660565">I think of the women veterans who fought for their country in equipment that did not fit and suffered horrendous injuries to their body and their reproductive system. They had to endure sexist attacks, with huge impacts on their mental health, as well as verbal and physical attacks from their colleagues and commanders; they had no recourse to justice. Those women are still fighting. This time, they are fighting their government for their rights and benefits. I am so honoured to know them. They are fierce, and they will not stop. That is what bravery looks like. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660566">It is incredibly tragic to consider that women veterans face dangers not just from deployments but also from within the military, because of archaic and sexist attitudes. They were made to feel invisible and were often mistaken for the wives of the military instead of being recognized for their service. I say to the women veterans of Canada that I see them, I hear them and the New Democrats support them. They are no longer invisible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660567">There are many veterans who need trauma-informed care and support. When they contact Veterans Affairs for help, they are forced to deal with an overly bureaucratic and complex system. They are threatened with removal from programs if deadlines are not met; moreover, they experience multiple denials of service attribution and endless delays in receiving benefits. Sometimes, years go by and veterans receive nothing. My office has helped one such veteran who lived for four years without an income, even though he was entitled to receive one from the government. A member of Parliament should not have to intervene for a veteran to receive his diminished earning capacity pay. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660568"> The system of benefits of Veterans Affairs must be transformed to offer services through a lens of trauma-informed care. It is so important that the veterans of this country be recognized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660569"> In closing, I just want to say that it is important to Canadians that veterans are acknowledged and remembered. Let us normalize thanking them, not just during Veterans' Week and Remembrance Day, but each and every time we see a person who is currently serving or has served. That is the very least we can do to acknowledge their service. </ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660578"> I want to speak briefly. I certainly echo the words of all my colleagues, particularly the very detailed enumeration of the number of wrongs done to our veterans. I offer a huge thanks to all past members of the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as those currently serving in uniform for Canada, of course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660579">I just want to reflect very personally. As we gather every November 11 at a cenotaph in our local community, we all notice the missing. As the years go by, there are veterans who are increasingly frail and slip off this mortal coil. In the last year, we lost two such heroes. It was a little more than a year for Charles “Chic” Goodman. In my community of Sydney on Vancouver Island, we know of the heroism of Chic Goodman as one of those Canadian soldiers who helped liberate the Netherlands and who helped liberate people who had been held in Nazi death camps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660580">We think of Peter Godwin Chance, a hero of many campaigns, who died this year at 103. Every year, including November 11, 2023, he stood unaided, making his way to the cenotaph while carrying a wreath. As we think of these veterans, we remember members of our own family. My husband's father, Kendal Kidder served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy; he was in command of one of the landing crafts at Normandy on D-Day. My closest friend, Farley Mowat, served in Italy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660581">We used to be able to hear the stories of these people and hear what it was like for them. In many cases, they were not young men as soldiers; they were boys. I think of the words of Joyce Meyer, who said, “Courage...is fear that has said its prayers and decided to go forward anyway”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660582"> There was tremendous courage, but there were also very young men, boys really. In every war, they go forward and they die. We must do everything we can to recommit ourselves to respecting their service, to ensuring their care, to ensuring that they know our gratitude and to ensuring that we cease sending young people into war. I know the word “fight” might not sound right in this context, but we must fight for peace.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660587">Madam Speaker, I move that the second report of the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, presented on Wednesday, February 15, 2023, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660588">Today, I am starting off the debate on the report on medical assistance in dying that was presented in February 2023. It is entitled “Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada: Choices for Canadians” and was presented by the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, which was struck in May 2021. The report was presented a year and a half ago. I am bringing this debate back to the House because, as reported in the news, Quebec began authorizing advance requests for people with degenerative and incapacitating diseases yesterday. The answers the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave us yesterday suggest to me that he does not understand the issues at all and has not given them any thought since May 2021. That is unacceptable to people who are suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660589">Today, I would like to take a moment to remember all those we have lost, as well as those who are currently disappearing into the abyss of dementia. They are slowly but surely and irreversibly becoming prisoners of time, of each moment that fades away as it is lived. The present moment is gradually erasing the people they once were, and they are losing contact with the things that gave their existence meaning, things like joy, sorrow, the ability to have relate to others and share their experiences, consciousness, and the ability to make others happy and plan for the future. This terrible disease is robbing them of all the things that make life what it is, that make up the experience of life, the human experience, until their life is reduced to a mere biological process. They are irreversibly losing their physical, social, mental and moral autonomy, in every sense of the word. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660590">Wherever you are right now, I am thinking about you, Mom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660591">I am also thinking about Sandra Demontigny, who is suffering from early-onset dementia. She is fighting for patients who have this debilitating, incurable, incapacitating disease to have the right to self-determination. She is fighting for them to have the right to make an advance request for MAID after being diagnosed. People with dementia want to live as long as possible. They do not want to shorten their lives by requesting MAID while they are still mentally competent. They want to be able to receive it once they have become incapacitated, once they have reached their limit. They are seeking assurance that we will have the compassion needed to respect their final wishes. Fortunately, Quebec decided not to wait for the federal government to wake up. It passed a law, which took effect yesterday, that allows people to make an advance request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660592">I commend Sandra Demontigny for her courage, her determination and her efforts to assert patients' right to self-determination. That is what we are talking about. The principle of lifelong self-determination is enshrined in law. No one can violate a person's integrity. That being the case, why, at the most intimate moment of a person's life, the moment of their death, should the government get to decide what is best for them? I would remind my colleagues that the government's job is not to decide what is best for a patient. The government's job is to create conditions that are conducive to making free and informed choices. People need to be free to make their own choices.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660593">The Liberals champion the freedom to choose when it comes to abortion, when it comes to a woman's right to control her own body, so how they can question a patient's prerogative to exercise their right to self-determination in a decision as personal as that of their own death? The Liberals are dithering and are still hesitant to amend the Criminal Code to make advance requests legal. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said yesterday that it was a deeply personal decision. If he recognizes that, why can he not put some substance behind his statement? I think I have demonstrated that this is indeed a deeply personal decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660594">Why shelve the report of the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying? Why set up joint committees made up of senators and elected representatives, ask them to come up with a key recommendation, and then shelve their report? The committee even managed to convince a Quebec Conservative who agreed with these proposals. The government is finally waking up a year and a half later because it was waiting to see what Quebec would do. The government took a wait-and-see approach so it could see how Quebec would proceed. It was a good idea to look at the example of Quebec, which took a unanimous non-partisan approach. Ottawa could learn something from what happened in Quebec's parliament, which spoke with one voice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660595">The government is now refusing to amend the Criminal Code, even though we have made it easy to do so. The government is not the one that has been doing the work since 2021, or for the past year and a half. The Quebec National Assembly passed the Act Respecting End-of-Life Care on June 7, 2023. It is now November 2024, and this government is telling us that it needs to have conversations. Who does the government want to have those conversations with? We heard from many experts, groups and citizens. We received many briefs. Despite all that, the government feels it must continue to wait, wait until people are suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660596">The committee report states the following, and I quote:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660603">This prompted the committee to say that the Carter decision needed to be respected. Under Carter, the government must not violate sick people's right to life with legislation that would force them to shorten their lives. We saw this in Carter, and it was reiterated in the Beaudoin decision. These people do not want to commit suicide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660604">That is what Sandra Demontigny told us. She said that she wanted to make the most of the years she has left, knowing that when she reaches her limit of suffering, she will be taken care of and will not have to go through the same appalling decline as her father. Until that moment comes, she wants to live. She does not want to commit suicide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660605">Is that clear? Who is more vulnerable than a person making this heartfelt plea? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660606">When people say they want to strike a balance between preserving the autonomy of self-determination and protecting the most vulnerable, unless they have fallen down the rabbit hole of believing that everyone in the health care system is evil, it is impossible not to hear this plea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660607">Why is the government applying a double standard? This report was tabled in February 2023. The government ignored the key recommendation, but, because Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C‑7</Document> contained a Senate amendment regarding mental disorders and a deadline, the government did accept the committee's recommendation to take another look at the issue after experts had studied it for a year. The government then recommended waiting, because it does not believe that the entire country is ready for this. It accepted the recommendation and applied it, and the result was Bill <Document DbId="12840488" Type="3">C‑62</Document>. However, in the past year and a half, no bills have been drafted based on the committee's key recommendation on advance requests. If that is not an example of lacking courage and shirking responsibility, I do not know what is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660608">The <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is unable to understand that an advance request cannot take effect until a diagnosis has been made. It has been six months since the Quebec law was passed. I do not know what world I am living in. This is certainly not a sign of competence. He clearly finds the issue complex because he keeps inventing problems that should not exist. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660609">We are not only criticizing. We went so far as to table a bill. Bill <Document DbId="13099542" Type="4">C‑390</Document> offers the government a solution, because we are in suggestion mode, not just in opposition mode. This bill allows the provinces to pass their own legislation once they have debated the issue. Quebec has been juggling this issue, reflecting on MAID and doing something about it since 2009. Now, in 2024, it can start accepting advance requests. There is a law in Quebec. We have adopted a legislative framework. If the federal government thinks advance requests are too complicated, maybe it should look at Bill C‑390, which says it should go at the provinces' and legislative assemblies' pace. This is a debate that should be undertaken by each legislative assembly, by citizens and their representatives. Once they have debated the issue and established a legislative framework, they will then be able to accept advance requests for MAID. That is a very reasonable suggestion. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660610">This is not preferential treatment for Quebec. It is an additional safeguard for the government. The idea is to amend the Criminal Code to simply say that, once a legislative assembly, a province, has adopted a legislative framework and a law, it can move ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660611">The administration of care is a matter for the provinces. End-of-life care is a matter for the provinces. The Criminal Code is a federal statute, and the federal government does not need to describe how things should be done. Furthermore, we are setting an example for all the other provinces. According to every poll conducted over the past three years, 83% to 85% of Canadians support advance requests, so I have to wonder where the political risk is. I feel like this government is afraid of its own shadow. It lacks the courage of its convictions, assuming it even has any convictions left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660612">I thought that freedom to choose was a cardinal Liberal Party belief that set it apart from the Conservatives, but no. I can criticize the Conservatives, but I will say one thing about them: We know where they stand and why, so we are able to position ourselves accordingly. As for the Liberals, there is no way of knowing what they think. They are dilettantes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660613">How can they be so unconcerned when it comes to an issue like this, an issue of human suffering? What are the Liberals waiting for? I can answer that question. What were the Conservatives waiting for in 2015, when the Carter decision forced Parliament to take a stand and an extension had to be sought? This Parliament has never been able to deal with the MAID issue except under a court injunction. The court had to order the government to change the law and the Criminal Code. Parliament has never taken the lead or even listened to patients and the public. Since 87% to 90% of Quebeckers support advance requests, it seems to me we should be moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660614"> Why is there a problem today? There is a problem because the Canadian Medical Protective Association has always said that physicians will be protected so long as they follow the most restrictive law. At certain times, Quebec had the most restrictive law, after the passage of Bill <Document DbId="10875380" Type="3">C‑7</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C‑14</Document>. In Canada, there is no law like Quebec's. Quebec applies the Criminal Code and the regulations that explain how to proceed. Quebec ended up having to ensure that people like Ms. Gladu and Mr. Truchon could not access MAID. Bill C‑7 would have allowed this, so Quebec had to tweak its law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660615">I am appealing to people's sense of duty and humanity. I hope that my colleagues will set aside government paternalism and get on the same page as the people of Quebec and Canada. I suggest that the government take Bill <Document DbId="13099542" Type="4">C‑390</Document> and make it a government bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660616">Today, the government is claiming that a national conversation is needed. I thought that forming a special joint committee of senators and members from both chambers in a parliamentary democracy gave those committee members the standing to make recommendations that reflect what the public thinks. </ParaText>

They are then taken in hand by a care team that sees them through to the end of their journey, as hard as that may be.</ParaText>

We debated that with Bill <Document DbId="12840488" Type="3">C‑62</Document>. My goal today was to reignite the debate because the government refused to implement the the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying's key recommendation, which was to move forward and accept advance requests. Not only did it refuse to implement the recommendation, but it did not even start thinking about it because it thinks it is too complicated. Only now, after a year and a half, does it want to start talking to people. My goal today is to focus on the issue of advance requests and the Liberal government's inexplicable inertia. The government should be ashamed to have left such an important report to gather dust.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660634">Madam Speaker, the member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie is absolutely right. Family doctors in Quebec have been providing MAID since the Quebec legislation passed. Right now, given the rule that says that, when there are two different laws, the most restrictive law applies, these doctors are now wondering how they will defend themselves in the event of a civil suit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660635">The government can say that it will not challenge Bill 11, but doctors know full well that they are not immune from lawsuits. The Attorney General of Canada can issue a directive, but what is a directive really worth in a state governed by the rule of law if the Criminal Code remains unamended? That puts a damper on things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660636">Every time a new case concerning advance requests comes up, there is always resistance. There is even still resistance in the case of people in the terminal stages of cancer. We can therefore assume that there will be pockets of resistance, with some doctors refusing to offer their patients the option.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660640">Madam Speaker, I mentioned that in my questions to the government this week. I asked if the government was aware of the current political situation. We need to be able to analyze it. The political situation in Canada is that, if an election were triggered tomorrow morning, we would find ourselves with a Conservative government. Conservative governments have always been against all forms of MAID, so the current government is playing Pontius Pilate and washing its hands. It is leaving it up to another government to settle the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660641">That is what I mean when I say they lack political courage. I thought that the Liberals had political courage.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8660642">Madam Speaker, before I get under way, I would like to comment on the member's last statement. He pointed out the Conservative Party's resistance to the issue. I believe it is Bill <Document DbId="13099542" Type="4">C-390</Document> that the Bloc is advocating for and advancing, which attempts to deal with the issue. This is the first time I am hearing it on the floor of the House. I would have thought Bloc members would have raised the issue with the leadership teams in the hope that we might be able to work together on Bill C-390 and, at the very least, how it might be incorporated into some of the consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660643">There is absolutely no doubt this is a very important issue. Since 2015, when the Supreme Court decided on the issue, it has been a hot topic for parliamentarians on all sides of the House. We have seen a great deal of compassion and emotion, and understandably so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660644">Before I get into the substance of the report, I want to refer to why we find ourselves again talking about this concurrence report. For issues of the day that are really important to caucus strategies, or the desire to have a public discussion, we have what we call opposition days. We need to contrast concurrence reports, including the one today that the Bloc has brought forward, with opposition day motions that are brought forward. We will find there is a stark difference. The Bloc is not alone. It will bring forward a motion or a concurrence report and say how important it is that we debate it, yet it is never given any attention on opposition days, when not only could the concurrence report be debated, but the opposition day motion could instruct an action of some form or another. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660645">Why are we debating it today? I would suggest it is because of an action taken a number of weeks ago. We need to ask ourselves why there has been no discussion on Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, the Citizenship Act, which we started the session with. Everyone but the Conservatives supports that act. There is Bill <Document DbId="12960457" Type="3">C-66</Document>, where sexual abuses taking place within the military could be shifted over to the civil courts. My understanding is that every political party supports that legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660646">There is Bill <Document DbId="12062671" Type="3">C-33</Document> regarding rail and marine safety and supply lines, which is very important to Canada's economy. There is Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document>, the online harms bill. Last night, members talked about the importance of protecting children from the Internet, and yet the government introduced Bill C-63, the online harms act. We are trying to have debates in the House of Commons on the legislation I just listed. It does not take away from the importance of many other issues, such as the one today regarding MAID. MAID is an important issue, and I know that. We all know that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660647">Yesterday, a concurrence report on housing was debated. Housing is also a very important issue, I do not question that, but we have well over 100 reports in committees at report stage. If we were to deal with every one of those reports, not only would we not have time for government legislation, but we would not have time for opposition days either, not to mention confidence votes. I am okay with that, as long as we get the budget passed through. We have to ask why we are preventing the House of Commons from being able to do the things that are important to Canadians. That can be easily amplified by looking at the behaviour of the Conservative Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660648">The Conservatives will stand up today and talk about MAID, as well they should; I will too. However, there is no doubt that they are happy to talk about that issue today only because it feeds into their desire to prevent the government from having any sort of debate on legislation, let alone attempting to see legislation pass to committee. The Conservative Party is more concerned about its <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party agenda than the agenda of Canadians and the types of things we could be doing if the official opposition party would, for example, allow its motion to actually come to a vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660649">We are debating this concurrence motion because the Conservatives have frustrated the other opposition parties to the degree that we are sick and tired of hearing Conservatives stand up repeatedly, over 100 of them now, on the privilege issue, preventing any and all types of debate. So, as opposed to listening to Conservatives speak on something that is absolutely useless, we are ensuring that at least there is some debate taking place on important issues, such as MAID and housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660650">Members of all political stripes need to realize the games the Conservatives are playing come at great expense to Canadians. The motion of privilege is to send the issue to PROC. Every member in the House supports that except for the Conservatives, yet it is a Conservative motion. They are filibustering and bringing the House to standstill, unless we are prepared to think outside the box and bring in a motion for concurrence. The concurrence motion, no doubt, is better than listening to the Conservatives continue to repeat speeches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660651"> I attempted to address their speeches in great detail weeks ago. It is time we change the channel. It is time the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> started putting Canadians and the nation's best interests ahead of his own personal interests and the Conservative Party of Canada's interests. We need to start talking about issues that Canadians want to hear about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660652">I was pleased when the member from the Bloc made reference to indications that the Province of Quebec wants to move forward on this issue. My understanding is that the province is even taking substantial actions towards it. Advance requests for MAID have been on the table and been discussed. We need to recognize it is not only Ottawa that plays a role in regard to MAID and its implementation. Our primary role is with the Criminal Code and how we might be able to make changes to it. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660653">Members, no matter what region they come from, have to appreciate that Canada is a vast country in which there is an obligation to consult with the different provinces, territories, indigenous leaders, community advocates, health care professionals and Canadians. There is an obligation to do that, especially around the type of legislation the member of the Bloc is trying to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660654"> I was hoping to get a second question from the member, because he made reference to Bill <Document DbId="13099542" Type="4">C-390</Document>. I am not familiar with its background. It is probably completely related to the advance requests for MAID. The member, in his question to me, could maybe expand on what exactly the bill is proposing. I would ask, in regard to it, to what degree the member has done his homework. Doing the homework means going outside the province of Quebec. All provinces have something to say about the issue. Many people who were born in Quebec live in other jurisdictions, just as many people who were born in other parts of the country now call Quebec home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660655">We have an obligation to not take legislation dealing with issues like MAID lightly. Just because one jurisdiction is advancing it more quickly than another jurisdiction, or because one jurisdiction is demanding it, it does not necessarily mean Ottawa can buy into it at the snap of its fingers. That is not to take anything away from Quebec. On a number of fronts, Quebec has led the nation. I could talk about issues like $10-a-day child care, a national program that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and government, with solid support from the Liberal caucus, have advanced and put into place, and every province has now agreed to it. The MAID file is a good example where Quebec is probably leading, in pushing the envelope, more than any other province, as it did with child care. Other jurisdictions take a look at other aspects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660656">Health care, today, is a national program that was implemented by a national Liberal government, but the idea that predated it came from Tommy Douglas. Its practical implementation was demonstrated in the province of Saskatchewan. As a government, we continue to support health care in a very real and tangible way. By contrast, we can take a look at the Conservatives on health care and the concerns we have in terms of a threat to health care. We have invested $198 billion in health care. That ensures future generations can feel comfortable in knowing the federal government will continue to play a strong role in health care. Why is that relevant to the debate today? For many of the individuals who are, ultimately, recipients of MAID, it is an issue of long-term care, hospice care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660657">When my grandmother passed away in the 1990s, in St. Boniface Hospital, it was a very difficult situation. We would have loved to have had hospice care provided for her, but it did not happen. That does not take anything away from the fantastic work that health care workers provide in our system, but there she sat in a hospital setting, which was was questionable in terms of dying with dignity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660658">Health care and long-term care matter. With respect to my father's passing, it was Riverview and it was a totally different atmosphere because it provided hospice care. Health care matters when we talk about MAID. What the Government of Canada is bringing forward is recognition that we cannot change things overnight, but at least we are moving forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660659">Back in 2015, when the Supreme Court made a decision, former prime minister Stephen Harper did absolutely nothing in terms of dealing with the issue of MAID, and the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was a major player during that whole Stephen Harper era. It put us into a position where, virtually immediately after the federal election, we had to take action, and we did. I remember vividly when members of Parliament shared stories in Centre Block. I remember the emotions. I remember many of my colleagues sitting on the committee that listened to Canadians from across the country with respect to the issue. We all talked to constituents and conveyed their thoughts in Ottawa. We were able to bring in and pass legislation, the first ever for Canada, that dealt with the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660660">In 2021, we actually updated the legislation that dealt with persons whose death was not reasonably foreseeable. We are making changes, but it has to be done in a fashion that is fair, reasonable and responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660661"> We want to hear from Canadians. We want to hear what the different provinces, territories, indigenous leaders, stakeholders, doctors, nurses, those who are providing that direct care and the families have to say. This is a very personal decision that people have to make at very difficult times in their lives. We should not be taking it for granted in any fashion whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660662"> That is the reason, once again, we have another special joint standing committee that hopefully will be starting its work in November, with the idea of doing something tangible over six or eight weeks, whatever it takes, so it can bring something back to the House to deal with advance requests for MAID. That seems to be the focal point of what the Bloc is talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660663">I want to come back to some of my other comments in regard to the government's recognition of the importance of the issue of MAID. We have done that since 2015. We continue to recognize it and work with Canadians and the many different stakeholders, and we are committed to continuing to do that. It is unfortunate that because of the games being played by the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and by members of the Conservative Party of Canada, the government is not able to continue to have important legislation debated, legislation like the Citizenship Act, the issue of military court to civil court with respect to sexual abuse, online harms act and the rail and marine safety act. All of these are so important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660664">I am asking the Conservative Party of Canada to stop focusing on its <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s best interests and to start thinking of Canadians' best interests.

His government is the architect of a MAID regime that serves as a warning to governments around the world that are contemplating perhaps implementing a MAID regime of what not to do. The world is taking notice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660712">These are the headlines in the U.K. over the past two weeks about Canada's MAID regime: “Poor, depressed or lonely in Canada? Why not let us kill you”, “Assisted dying ‘abused’ in Canada, admits group that helped legalise it”, “I went for a mastectomy and they offered me assisted dying, Canadian cancer patient reveals”, “Poor at risk of being coerced into assisted dying in Canada”, “Canada's assisted death rush is a grim warning”, “Euthanasia doctors in Canada struggle with the ethics of killing vulnerable patients”, “Dark lessons from Canada” and “Once 'assisted dying' is legal, the boundaries of what is permissible expand”. These are out of the Telegraph, the Times of London, the Independent and The Critic, over just the past two weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660713"> UN experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, have condemned the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s MAID regime. Here at home, virtually every disabilities rights organization has been sounding the alarm for years that the lives of persons living with disabilities are uniquely at risk after the government recklessly removed any connection between the foreseeability of death and eligibility for MAID. For years, there have been credible reports of widespread abuse, non-compliance with the law and persons who were administered MAID under highly questionable circumstances, to put it mildly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660714">In the face of those credible and disturbing reports, the response of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was to accuse those who were sounding the alarm that vulnerable persons were falling through the cracks as being blinded by ideology. How callous on the part of the Prime Minister and how ironic, because it is not those who are calling the alarm who are ideological but the Prime Minister himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660715"> If there was any doubt about the credibility of those reports of abuse and non-compliance, those have surely been put to rest in the face of the bombshell report of two weeks ago from the Ontario MAID Death Review Committee, out of the Ontario Coroner's Office. I emphasize that this is a committee composed of medical professionals and legal experts, as well as MAID assessors. The report found that vulnerable persons face potential coercion and undue influence to seek MAID. The report identifies a number of cases in Ontario where persons received MAID who likely did not qualify under the law and where there was evidence of elements of coercion leading to their deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660716"> I will cite a few examples. One was a 40-year-old Ontario man who received MAID after his psychiatrist suggested it. The MAID practitioner who administered MAID drove him out to a location to administer MAID. The committee, in its report, said that that may have “created pressure and gave rise to a perception of hastening a person towards death.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660717"> Another Ontario man received MAID. He had, only a year before, attempted to end his life. He suffered from ulcers, had suicidal ideation and severe personality disorder. In all likelihood, he did not qualify under the law but he received MAID. In another case, an Ontario man was convinced that he had suffered from a vaccine injury. He received MAID. A post-mortem, however, found no pathological findings in that regard. There is the disturbing case of a 50-year-old London, Ontario, woman who received MAID due to a lack of adequate housing for her to live in a home having regard for her symptoms of multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome. There are many other disturbing cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660718">Alarm bells should be going off at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice but instead these shocking findings have been met with silence on the part of the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. It is as if they do not care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660719">The report found that among those who received MAID, who were not terminally ill, they disproportionately came from Ontario's most deprived communities, leading the committee in its report to suggest that “MAID could be the option of least resistance and be used to end lives when social policies have failed them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660720">The report identified widespread doctor shopping, persons who were turned down and who went to another medical practitioner until they got the result that they wanted. On that point, it should not come as a surprise, given that doctor shopping has been a well-known loophole in the law. It is a loophole that the government has failed to close and it is a loophole that has become the standard to be abused, abused by none other than CAMAP, the body that is supposedly responsible for developing training for MAID assessors, a body that has been tasked by the government to develop the MAID curriculum and a body that has received millions of taxpayer dollars from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660721">At a CAMAP seminar, radical and infamous MAID activist Jocelyn Downie actually encouraged doctor shopping. She said, “You can ask as many clinicians as you want or need.” At another seminar, she said, “Disagreement doesn't mean you must stop.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660722">Those are chilling words and illustrate how embedded abuse is in the system after nine years of the Liberals. Over the past nine years, the Liberals have failed to establish robust safeguards to protect the vulnerable. What safeguards they have put in place, they have systematically dismantled over the past number of years, all while turning a blind eye to reports of abuse and non-compliance, rendering the government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> complicit in that abuse and non-compliance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660723">As a result of the government's recklessness and negligence, the lives of the poor, the disabled, and, if the Liberals get their way, soon the mentally ill have fallen and will continue to fall through the cracks. MAID, after nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is the very antithesis of what is humane and compassionate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660740">That was underscored by the expert report that the government commissioned in 2018, which found that the biggest risk with advance requests is that someone who might not wish to die would have their life terminated. That is a serious risk, so there needs to be widespread consultation to ensure that it can be done safely and that there are appropriate safeguards in place.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660744">I am a Conservative well known in Quebec for my position on medical assistance in dying. My Conservative colleagues know that. Everyone knows that. It is no secret. However, we should not be told that we lack courage or compassion just because we are not like him or because some people in the House do not think like him. That is not the way to convince all parliamentarians and political parties to move forward on this issue.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660746">It is true that, as of yesterday, advance requests are allowed in Quebec. If it was so important to the member for Montcalm and the Bloc Québécois, why did the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> not use the leverage he had when he held the balance of power?

              <ParaText id="8660751">Why did the Bloc Québécois not take this opportunity, knowing that it would change things in Quebec? They know it would. The Bloc introduced Bill <Document DbId="13099542" Type="4">C‑390</Document> on May 22, 2024. However, it waited until the day after this measure was implemented in Quebec to alert everyone and accuse us of being heartless. What the Bloc Québécois and its leader put up as bargaining chips is a bill on supply management and a bill on pensions. If the member is unable to convince his own leader to move forward and he is unable to convince him of the urgency, what makes him think he can hastily convince us to move forward with this today? It is a fantasy. It is totally irresponsible. I invite the member to tone it down, stop insulting us and take a look in his own back yard. What is the Bloc Québécois's strategy for moving its Bill C‑390 forward?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660752">This eminently sensitive and complex issue touches on individual values. I was a member of Parliament in Quebec City when the debate started back in the early 2000s. I was present when the vote took place, and I voted in favour of it. I was also there when MAID was implemented. The debate was not over in a day. It simply got the ball rolling. People sat down together, thought things through together and talked together. A multi-party committee was struck. After that, people reached a position and decided to move forward with MAID. Parliament had spoken. Some people in my own political party in Quebec City voted against it. That was all right, because this debate touches on deeply entrenched and personal beliefs, and matters of conscience. I think that is important to highlight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660753">In politics there is partisanship. The Conservative Party gets blamed for a lot of things, so I am going to correct a few points. As far as health is concerned, my colleague the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> rose to say how bad and dangerous we are on issues of health. I would like to remind the House of another event I witnessed. When Prime Minister Harper was in charge, it is thanks to him that Quebec had its first asymmetrical agreement with the federal government. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278177" Type="2">Lévis—Lotbinière</Affiliation> was there. I was in Quebec City and I saw that. The Conservative Party is a party that listens to the provinces and has demonstrated over the years its concern for respecting and accommodating the provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660754"> Throughout my career, I've had to make some decisions that were much easier than others. For example, as labour minister, I changed labour standards and the Labour Code. That was a huge undertaking, but it was easier for the government than moving forward with medical assistance in dying. Nobody said this was an easy file. What I am saying today is that we need to be careful. Rushing this will get us nowhere fast, and we have no right to be anything less than thorough as we consider such an important issue. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660755">At the end of the day, what do Canadians expect us to do? They expect us to make good decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660756">Had we acted quickly and thoughtlessly, we would have gone along with the current Liberal government's haphazard approach and ended up in the unbelievably absurd position of allowing MAID for people whose only illness is a mental disorder. Faced with that, we raised a red flag and insisted on waiting because we were not ready. We studied the issue and convinced the government not to bring it into effect on March 17, 2023, as set out in the act. We managed to extend the deadline by one year, to March 17, 2024. In the end, the decision was made to wait three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660757">In conclusion, it is always better to take a little more time than to make irreversible mistakes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660772">I would like to take 30 seconds at the beginning of my speech for something more personal. Today is October 31. A year ago, my partner's mother, Debbie Djevahirdjian, passed away. Today is the anniversary of her death. I just wanted to highlight her life and all the love she gave to her family and loved ones. We still miss her dearly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660774">Alice had a very difficult start to life, and she also had an extremely difficult end of life with Alzheimer's disease.

We all have stories of people who have experienced the end of life of someone they loved very much and who, over time, ended up unable to recognize their spouse, husband, children or friends. It is extremely painful and extremely difficult. To witness this, even as a child or teenager, is something that leaves a mark.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660776">This means that one day, in our own lives, we would like to have the opportunity to influence this, whether in research, science or medicine in general.

              <ParaText id="8660777">Today I have the opportunity to rise in the House to talk about it. It is such a fundamental issue because it affects the dignity of human life. We know that we are all going to die one day. We hope it will be in the best conditions with as little suffering as possible, surrounded by our loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660778">The law currently does not allow advance requests for medical assistance in dying. MAID has been the subject of great debate in society, in Canada and in Quebec, for many years now. In Quebec, there is a certain consensus on the fact that this assistance was a way to help people, to respect their will and respect their wishes to leave this world in dignity and with as little suffering and humiliation possible. For example, Alzheimer's disease or other degenerative diseases can be extremely difficult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660779">Not everyone is going to want to ask for medical assistance in dying. It is a choice that is extremely personal, that involves the will of each person and how they see life according to their own values, religious or otherwise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660780">I mentioned my wife's mother earlier. Debbie had a good friend named Janice who had MS. Janice always wanted to live right up to the end. For her, asking for medical assistance in dying was never an option. We need to respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660781">Science and medicine have evolved when it comes to this issue, as has the societal debate. Now, we can say that people are beginning to agree that medical assistance in dying is acceptable and that we need to respect each person's decision. To date, medical assistance in dying has been allowed when the person's death was foreseeable in the very near future. It has not been allowed in the case of cognitive degenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660782">The Quebec government has decided to authorize advance requests. A person of sound mind who has been diagnosed with a serious and incurable illness will be able to sign a document outlining their wishes and establishing the criteria, timing and symptoms that will indicate when they are no longer capable of making a decision because they have reached a level of advanced cognitive impairment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660783">Now, we find ourselves in an absolutely impossible situation because, as of yesterday, Quebec law allows advance requests for MAID, which contravenes the federal Criminal Code, all because the Liberal government has failed to act for months and years. It is mind-boggling to see that the only thing the Liberals want to do on this issue is align themselves with the Conservatives by saying that they are not going to do anything, not going to move forward. It takes the Supreme Court to force them to make decisions and change laws. It takes the Quebec Superior Court to force them to make decisions. I have never seen a government with so little leadership on such a fundamental issue that affects every Canadian, every family in this society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660784">Now we find ourselves in this absolutely absurd situation. Because of their ineptitude, their inertia and the fact that they are dragging their feet, we are stuck in limbo. This Liberal government's response is to say that consultations will be held and that a major national conversation is needed. However, the Quebec law has been in force since yesterday. What are we going to do about it? The Liberals have known about this for months. A joint House of Commons and Senate committee has studied the issue and made recommendations. What did the Liberals do? They did absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660785">Now we find ourselves in this impossible situation, while the Quebec law is giving people hope, the hope of having a dignified end-of-life experience that respects their wishes. People do not want to see themselves waste away. I understand that completely. I would not want to see myself waste away like that either. I think most people probably feel the same, and we have to be able to respect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660786">There is someone in Quebec who has become something of a spokesperson for people who receive this kind of diagnosis and want to decide for themselves when to depart this world and on what terms. Her name is Sandra Demontigny. She has been very active in the media and has touched a lot of hearts. Her message is that we need to move in this direction, and she hopes that the Quebec Government's legislation will spare her the worst when she reaches the end of her life. Ms. Demontigny, who has a genetic type of early onset Alzheimer's, has been advocating for this right for a long time. Naturally, she was very pleased by Quebec's decision. Her wishes are clear. According to an article published yesterday in La Press, she said the following: </ParaText>

Guidelines have been established to support health care professionals in their discussions with patients who have received a diagnosis and, under the law, those professionals can only authorize MAID under very specific circumstances. MAID is regulated and scientific. Professionals, witnesses and third parties the person trusts are involved. It can be administered only when the patient has specific symptoms and when the disease and the person's conditions have progressed to a certain point, so I do not see why the current Liberal government is incapable of taking action. It is putting Quebec doctors in an impossible position right now. Their concern that they could be sued for abiding by the Quebec law and the patient's wishes is a legitimate one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660806">Madam Speaker, let me begin by saying how sad I was to hear my colleague from Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie talk about that sorrowful anniversary. Everyone who has participated in this debate has shared some extraordinarily difficult stories, and I will be no exception.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660807">We are talking about such a difficult issue, end of life. Medical assistance in dying is part of the end of life. I am just as frustrated as my colleague from Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie about the Liberals' failure to take action, even though we have been discussing this extremely personal and often extraordinarily difficult issue for 10 years now. The government is refusing to take action and show leadership on this issue. That is very sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660808">This is not a partisan issue. It is about human life and respect for people who are in the final stages of their lives. In many cases, these people are in incredible pain. As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to be there for them and make the necessary decisions. We need to show leadership on this. In my opinion, the fact that this issue has been dragging on for 10 years reflects parliamentarians' inability to respond appropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660809">That is why we are having this debate today. I welcome this debate. It is important, and we need a concrete outcome. The decisions made by the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying are recommendations that must be implemented as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660810">We all have profoundly painful memories when we talk about medical assistance in dying. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, shared with us his extremely difficult anniversary. Tomorrow, we will be entering November. That is a very difficult time for me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660811">Three years ago, my father, Terry Julian, passed away. He passed away in an extraordinarily painful time. He was in the palliative ward of Burnaby Hospital for two weeks before he died. He was in immense pain. The family rallied around. We tried to be there 24 hours a day during that period. It was extraordinarily difficult and heart-wrenching. When he finally passed, my sister was with him. I am incredibly grateful for that. My spouse and I were racing to the hospital, as were other members of the family. We were with him around the clock in his pain and in his final moments, but I was unable to arrive in time. If I could turn back the clock so that he did not experience those unbelievably difficult weeks before he passed, I would. It was heart-wrenching, as it is to all of us, to see him live through that difficult time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660812"> A year later, my mother went through the exact same thing. It took two weeks for her to pass. She was in the palliative ward at Burnaby general hospital. It was an extraordinarily difficult time; again, we tried to be there 24 hours a day. The fact that my father had passed meant that my mother was simply not the same. They had been married for over 70 years, so the pain of a broken heart was obviously too much for her. I was with her when she passed. I held her hand, and I said prayers in her final moments. I was grateful for that privilege, that blessing to be with her. It was, again, extraordinarily difficult. If we could have changed the situation in some way so that she did not have to live through those two weeks of intense pain before passing, we would have given everything to do so. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660813">These are heartbreaking moments. That is why the issue of medical assistance in dying is so important for us to consider. In each of our families, with our loved ones, many of us have experienced the pain of losing a loved one and the pain of seeing them suffer. Medical assistance in dying is designed not only to give those people a choice but also, as much as possible, to take away from the intense suffering that the person who is dying, the loved one, lives through. The entire family suffers from it as well when they are in the hospital ward at three or four in the morning, wondering what they can do to end the pain and suffering the loved one is going through. We do not want to see them suffer anymore; in a sense, their passing is a relief in one way. Yes, it is incredibly painful to know that they have passed on, but it is an end to their suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660814"> In a civilized society, we try to make sure that people do not suffer unnecessarily. That is why this issue is such an important one. I think we all come from the same place. We have all, in the House and right across this country, lived the same difficult, terrible, extraordinarily painful experiences. As parliamentarians, we need to make sure that this suffering is relieved as much as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660815">I want to address a particular issue in the report, recommendation 10, which states that we need to support persons with disabilities. This is a fundamental part of the debate we are having today. When we look at those across the country who are forced to go to food banks to make ends meet or are homeless, more than half of them are people with disabilities. This country has failed people with disabilities; of that there is no doubt. We have seen some minor improvements in how people with disabilities are treated, but the reality is that this recommendation particularly strikes me as something we need to implement as quickly as possible. It will help ensure that people with disabilities are not faced with that terrible choice between MAID and a life in which they simply are not provided with the supports that are so essential. We have seen the number of times in which people with disabilities have chosen MAID because they have not gotten these supports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660816"> We have pushed for a disability benefit that provides for a guaranteed livable basic income. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278288" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> brought forward a bill that would provide those supports for people with disabilities so that they are not forced into that unbelievably difficult choice. However, to date, we still do not have in place a guaranteed livable basic income that applies to people with disabilities, which would provide them with the dignity and respect they deserve and should expect from their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660817"> This is a fundamental issue that absolutely has to be resolved. This is a country that has provided enormous resources to the banks and big businesses, with a trillion dollars in liquidity supports to the banking sector over the last 15 years. We have given wealthy Canadians untold amounts, tens of billions of dollars a year, in the form of overseas tax havens. We have the resources to put into place a guaranteed livable basic income for people with disabilities now. I hope that, as part of this debate, we choose to do that. Every Canadian deserves dignity.

              <ParaText id="8660827">Madam Speaker, I have three things to say about my colleague's heartfelt speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660828">First, on the issue of improving the quality of life of people with disabilities, it is important to remember that disability is social and impairment is individual. In that sense, we have a responsibility to improve the quality of life of these people socially. That is why we made recommendation 10. However, if it had been said that people with disabilities do not have the right to medical assistance in dying, that would have been discrimination. I hope my colleague agrees with me on that. These are two totally different issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660829">We need to make sure that even when people request MAID because their quality of life is diminished and their social autonomy is affected, this does not mean that their request for MAID will be approved, contrary to what my Conservative colleague thinks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660830">Furthermore, on the issue of freedom of choice, it is important to remember here that, even if a person lives to the end of their days, that is what they have chosen. Freedom of choice is part of every instance of medical assistance in dying. People who have doubts and are anxious about making an advance request do not have to fill out a form. They can make a free and informed choice because it is the role of the government to preserve that free and informed choice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660836"> Madam Speaker, it is an absolute honour, as always, to stand here in the House of Commons to debate things that are of critical importance to Canadians. Certainly, having had the opportunity to serve on the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, I think it is important to have the ability to stand here today and allow Canadians to understand some of the difficulties that exist and why Conservatives put forward a dissenting report, which is easy for Canadians to find.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660837">Much of the deliberations at the special joint committee were related to mental disorder as the sole underlying medical condition, so-called “mature minors”, persons with disability and advance requests. Clearly, the plight of Canadians under the NDP-Liberal government has increased the usage of MAID in this country, and I will go on to cite several examples of that as we go through this. I think that it is absolutely and incredibly important to look forward to. If I may, I will read a bit from the dissenting report.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660838">We acknowledge that medical assistance in dying is a complex and deeply personal issue on which reasonable and well-intentioned people can disagree. However, there are serious problems with Canada's MAID regime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660839">Vulnerable people are being put at risk because of the Liberal government's failures. Regardless of one's views on MAID in principle, these issues cannot be ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660840">After nine years of increased poverty and despair under this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canadians are turning to MAID because they cannot afford to live with dignity.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8660841"> I would say that this statement is incredibly important in allowing Canadians to understand that, as far as Conservatives are concerned, those Canadians who are well intentioned and well informed are about to speak about this incredibly emotionally charged topic in a hopefully non-partisan way on behalf of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660842">As a former practising physician, these are issues that came up multiple times when I was practising medicine. Medical assistance in dying is something that came about during my time in practice. When I first started practising, medical assistance in dying was not out there to be considered. That being said, I certainly feel it is something that I can provide some insight on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660843">I think one of the other things that is really important for Canadians to understand, and I know my colleague spoke a bit about this, is how Canada and the Canadian regulations around MAID are perceived around the world. I will quote the American Journal of Bioethics. The title of this particular article is “When Death Becomes Therapy: Canada’s Troubling Normalization of Health Care Provider Ending of Life”. It is a telling commentary on how the regime here in Canada is perceived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660844">I will quote a bit from the article: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660845">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Undeniably, a strikingly higher number of people die with direct health care provider involvement in Canada’s euthanasia regime, euphemistically termed “Medical Assistance in Dying” [MAiD], than under a California-style assisted suicide system. Daryl Pullman rightly identifies several key reasons: the fact that in about all cases it involves a lethal injection by health care providers, rather than assisted-suicide with self-administration of medication; the law’s vague and broadly interpreted access criteria; “acquiescence and […] indifference of federal and provincial authorities, the courts, and medical associations”; and, briefly mentioned, the failure to treat ending of life as a last resort.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8660846">When I think of those incredibly emotional words, because they are incredibly emotional, I often wonder how we realistically got to a spot where we are in a culture of death and we believe in the ability to simply hand over our essence of life to a health care practitioner. How did we get there? How have we failed as a society to simply say, “Life is no longer worth living. Just go ahead and kill me.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660847"> I can remember when the debates on this first began and everybody talked about the slippery slope argument, saying that we would never go down these roads and that this would simply be for those with a reasonably foreseeable natural death. Canadians, in their heart of hearts, because of who we are, really believed that the expansion of MAID would never happen. I have heard my colleagues in the House today speak a lot about how it is people's right to die. What about their right to live? Once again, this is a country that is incredibly developed with great riches and wealth. This is the golden age of Canada, if one were to use that term. How did we get to the point where it is not about caring about each other, but about saying, “Yes, I agree with you. Just go ahead and end it because your life is not worth living.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660848">As we begin to contemplate those things as a country, I do believe that it is incredibly important to value human life and to say that it is important. Are there folks out there who are suffering? There absolutely are, and I certainly will come back to that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660849">Before we talk about some very sad examples, the other important thing to talk about is the state of palliative care in Canada. I had the opportunity as a physician to witness an incredible change in how palliative care is delivered where I live in Nova Scotia. It was absolutely life-changing to have a driving force behind a palliative care program where I live that enabled care, which had historically been delivered by family physicians, to go to a quality team of palliative care providers that was able to provide a much more nuanced way for people to continue to live a life, even though it was difficult. I might be so bold as to say that my great friend Dr. David Henderson was the person leading that charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660850"> Historically, where I had the opportunity to work in our hospital in Truro, Nova Scotia, palliative care was provided by family physicians. Realizing that many symptoms during the end of life and the dying process were very difficult to control, this great physician, Dr. Henderson, came along and was able to begin to educate all of us family physicians who were delivering care to make us better providers. As time went on, many folks began to realize that they were not very good at palliative care, which not everybody is good at, if I can use that terminology. They also began to realize that there were certain skills, not just in determining which medications to give at which time but also in speaking to patients to understand what their goals and desires were. Was it that they simply wanted their pain and suffering to be alleviated at all costs, or did they want to be more functional in their abilities? Those are incredibly important conversations to have with patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660851">Dr. Henderson also realized that delivering care at people's homes was an essential part of palliative care because, of course, folks often feel much better when they are able to stay in their own homes and have the distressing symptoms alleviated there. Dr. Henderson was a great advocate to say that we also needed to have nurses trained in palliative care who can then be the extenders of physician care at home or in the hospital. Dr. Henderson has been a wonderful advocate for the palliative care program in Nova Scotia and, indeed, across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660852">The sad state of affairs is that good-quality palliative care such as I have described does not exist across the country. I would suggest that colleagues here in the chamber give that a good thought because I do believe if good-quality palliative care existed across the country, perhaps some of the conversations we are having now would be quite different.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660853">I also think it important that we understand that seven million Canadians do not have access to primary care. Of course, that does affect the quality of care overall in terms of how Canadians are able to manage symptoms of their illness and understand their illness, because of course in Canada, primary care is the way we access the system. Once again, the demise of our much-cherished health care system has certainly accelerated at the hands of the NDP-Liberal government over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660854">As I mentioned, a recent report from CIHI lays out clearly that 5.4 million adults do not have access to primary care, which we know translates into about seven million Canadians without access. This means they are unable to get lab work, diagnostic imaging or referrals to specialists unless they are in walk-in clinics or they are visiting emergency rooms, which we know then creates an entire other type of problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660855">Those things being said, I do want to get to some examples about MAID in particular. There are several quotes about MAID in Ontario. For example, PBS reports, “in Ontario, more than three quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn’t imminent required disability support before their death in 2023”. A professor of health in the Netherlands has stated, “Canada seems to be providing euthanasia for social reasons, when people don’t have the financial means, which would be a big taboo in Europe.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660856">We begin to again unpack those types of things. A report just this morning outlined that 40% of Atlantic Canadians have difficulty paying for the basic necessities of life. The article cited food, rent and home heating. That is a disturbing feature when we hear what the professor in the Netherlands said. Of course, the Netherlands has had a MAID regime for quite some time now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660857">The other statistic we need to be aware of is that it would seem poverty is a contributing factor in Ontario's MAID provision: “People in the lowest ‘material resource’ category represent 20 per cent of the general population, but they make up 28.4 per cent of Track 2 MAiD recipients, compared to 21.5 per cent of Track 1 recipients.” When we begin to understand some of these statistics, not to be foolish about it, but as we might say, “Houston, we have a problem.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660858">The impact of the housing crisis seems to be a factor. Persons identified as having housing instability made up 48.3% of track 2 MAID deaths in Ontario, an absolutely staggering figure. Isolation is also a definite factor in track 2 cases: Ninety per cent of track 1 MAID recipients provided the name of an immediate family member, spouse, sibling or child as their next of kin, compared to 73% of track 2 recipients. People who accessed MAID via track 2 safeguards were more likely to have provided the name of a friend, extended family member or other person, such as a caseworker, lawyer or health care provider.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660859">As I started off my remarks with, here we are in this incredible country in which we live, and people are socially isolated. They are unable to afford housing and access services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660860">The other disturbing trend, of course, is the significant increase in MAID in Canada. In 2019, there were 5,631 cases of MAID reported in Canada, accounting for 2% of all deaths. The total number of deaths marked a 26% increase over the number of MAID deaths in 2018. In 2020, there were 7,595 cases of MAID reported in Canada, 2.5% of all deaths, and the toll represented an increase of 34.2% from the year prior.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660861"> In 2019, as I mentioned, 5631 cases of MAID were reported, and by 2022 there were 13,241 MAID deaths reported in Canada, accounting for 4.1% of all deaths nationwide. This is a year-over-year growth rate in the 30% range. The total number of medically assisted deaths reported in Canada since the introduction of the federal MAID legislation is 44,958 Canadians. It can therefore be projected that the number of MAID deaths, as well as the share of these deaths represented in the annual death toll, will increase in 2024 and may reach up to 5% of the national total of deaths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660862">As we begin to look at these things, we see that this is a very disturbing trend. I do want to quote a couple of disturbing cases that I think we all need to be aware of. They are readily available in open-source literature.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660863">Christine Gauthier, a disabled veteran and former paralympian, was offered MAID by a caseworker from Veterans Affairs Canada during a phone call in which she discussed her deteriorating condition. Gauthier had for five years been seeking to get a wheelchair ramp in her house. As a veteran myself, this is particularly disturbing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660864"> We know that there are other cases of veterans who called Veterans Affairs for help, simply for their mental health, and of course were offered MAID as part of what the individuals at Veterans Affairs thought was appropriate in terms of offering treatment to veterans. It is appalling that folks who sign on the dotted line to serve our country, to uphold our values elsewhere and potentially, of course, to put their lives on the line are offered death as opposed to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660865">In another case, Normand Meunier, a former truck driver who had been paralyzed from a spinal cord injury in 2022, was forced to spend 95 hours on a stretcher after being admitted to a hospital in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec, with a respiratory virus in January 2024. This led him to develop a severe pressure sore that eventually worsened to the point where bone and muscle were exposed and visible. Mr. Meunier, in terrible pain for the ensuing two months, opted to end his life, and he passed away on March 29.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660866">When we look at these stories, we see that they represent a failure of a health care system, as I quoted from a report, “when death becomes therapy”, as opposed to understanding that we need a health care system that is responsive to the changes that have been foisted upon us by the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660867">I think it is also important to talk about the blue seal program for Canadians that the next Conservative government will put forward. It would allow international medical graduates to have their qualifications and experience recognized quickly as they come to this country and want to serve Canadians and to have a better paycheque in order to be able to look after their families as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660868">That will be something, of course, that a Conservative government will be able to put forward, as we have had multiple discussions with the stakeholders and decision-makers at both provincial and national levels. I think it is incredibly important we give Canadians hope that there is help on the way and that the way things are is not the way they need to be forever. Change is possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660869">We also know that understanding exactly how the MAID regime works is important on behalf of Canadians. Consultation needs to be had, and we need to be able to replace the hurt that Canadians, sadly, are now experiencing with hope for the future so they once again can be prosperous in the dream and the contract of being a Canadian: If we work hard, we will be able to achieve a job with a reasonable paycheque, put food on our table and a roof over our head, live in dignity in this country, and not have to worry about death being the therapy for all that ails us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660882"> Madam Speaker, there were a few things there. This is a serious topic, but it is interesting how the long legacy of Mr. Harper lives in the heads of many in the NDP-Liberal party. That being said, I know very clearly that the Harper government increased the value of transfer payments to 6% on a year-over-year basis, which is more than any government had done previously. During a press conference, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and I made it clear that we would honour commitments that have already been made to provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660883"> The other interesting part of this is that there are many opportunities for the federal government to show leadership, which the NDP-Liberal government refuses to take, to get folks on board, such as with the blue seal program, which would allow international medical graduates with experience to apply their trade in our great country, providing a service to Canadians who desperately need it. I have mentioned many times that seven million Canadians do not have access to primary care under the failed NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660884">Then, of course, there is the ability to get the appropriate stakeholders and decision-makers together to support the provinces so they can unfold the mandate that is so essential to what they are trying to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660885"> It is a shame that the New Democrats continue to prop up the Liberal government. They say the house is burning down, but they are Nero on the wall playing the fiddle.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660887">I want to ask him about the recruitment of doctors and health care professionals and their participation in the MAID regime. In my life, I know several people who used to work in the health care field and have now moved out of that field because of concerns about their conscience rights. We have seen entire hospices get shut down across this country because they are unwilling to participate. I do not think this was the intended consequence of the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660889">Madam Speaker, this is interesting. I have the exact statistics somewhere in my mound of paperwork on this particular topic, but it would appear that year over year, in Canada, many more physicians are participating in the MAID regime. It is a sad reflection on society that those physicians could easily be trained to provide better palliative care. We know there is a call for patients across the country to receive appropriate palliative care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660890">Many folks in the chamber may think of palliative care as simply giving people more medication to end their physical pain. However, we know clearly from those who provide good-quality palliative care that it is about having conversations with families, partly about providing medication, talking about the lives they have had and talking about the difficulties they may have suffered. It is also very clearly, with its patient-centred approach, about what their goals of care are and how to meet those needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660891"> That often takes a very specialized team of people. However, if we look at the number of physicians choosing to provide MAID who are not providing palliative care, there is an obvious ability to recruit those physicians, in the appropriate circumstances, to provide good-quality palliative care for folks who are not able to receive it. Again, this exists in many rural and remote places across Canada. It is a real travesty when that situation exists.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660892"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country. I will be splitting my time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660893">I rise to speak in a concurrence debate that was put forth today regarding the report of the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, MAID. Conservatives have put forth a dissenting report on this. I will speak from the perspective of the shadow minister for disability inclusion and will speak to the impending Liberal government law on MAID eligibility, coming into effect after the next election, which will include mental illness as a sole underlying condition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660894">The Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying heard from a range of experts regarding MAID, including clinicians, psychiatrists, disability advocates and mental health experts. Many expressed the same concern regarding including mental health as the sole underlying condition for MAID eligibility. Many experts are saying it is impossible to clinically determine if a patient will be able to recover from a mental health challenge. Dr. John Maher, a clinical psychologist and medical ethicist, told the committee, “Psychiatrists don't know and can't know who will get better and live decades of good life. Brain diseases are not liver diseases.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660895">Abandoning people with mental illness to turn instead to medical assistance in dying is wrong, and experts in the field agree. The Ontario Medical Association surveyed Ontario psychiatrists in 2021 and found that 91% of respondents opposed the expansion of MAID for mental illness. Only 2% of respondents supported it. This speaks volumes to how wrong the Liberal government is on this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660896">Disability groups are now sounding the alarm over the drastic negative effects MAID can have on those with disabilities and concerns over looking after the most vulnerable. Recently, the Disability Rights Coalition put out a release detailing how those with disabilities are affected by MAID. This coalition includes major disability advocacy organizations, including the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, Inclusion Canada, Indigenous Disability Canada and DAWN Canada, among others. These are organizations whose missions are to support the vulnerable, and we need to consider their concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660897">In a release, the Disability Rights Coalition stated, “MAID has resulted in premature deaths and an increase in discrimination and stigma towards people with disabilities across the country.” Krista Carr, the executive vice president of Inclusion Canada, stated, “We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty, and lack of essential supports”. Heather Walkus, the national chairperson of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, stated, “Instead of providing the support and resources we need to live, our government is offering death.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660898">This release comes after a letter was sent to the justice minister in 2022, signed by 50 disability organizations that called for the expansion of MAID for mental illness to be stopped. In this letter, the signatory stated, “To legalize MAiD for mental illness would pour gas on a fire that is already out of control.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660899">How can we trust the Liberal government with expanding MAID to include those with the sole underlying condition of mental illness when its record on this issue has been so troubling? There have been numerous reports detailing the increasing prevalence of Canadians seeking MAID for circumstances for which it was never intended. Multiple Canadian military veterans who fought for our country and were seeking help from Veterans Affairs were pressured by Veterans Affairs staff to consider medically assisted dying. One veteran, a Paralympian trying to get a wheelchair ramp, testified that a Veterans Affairs employee offered her assisted dying instead of addressing her concerns. A food bank manager from Mississauga reported that clients asked about assisted suicide without a special physical illness. We also heard testimony at the human resources committee from witnesses who were talking about persons with disabilities considering MAID due to the cost of living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660903">This is where we are in Canada after nine years of the Liberal government. We have all these issues, yet the government continues, undeterred, in proceeding with expanding MAID for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. Experts in mental illness and those who support and advocate for persons with disabilities have come out against this, citing concerns for abuse and concerns over protecting the most vulnerable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660904">I have been very touched by some of the correspondence from residents in Kelowna—Lake Country who have shared their concerns with me. Judith, from my community, wrote to me with her concerns after hearing about the delay in the planned expansion of MAID for those with mental illness as the sole underlying cause. She acknowledged that many people have brought forth many concerns to the government, and she was surprised that the Liberals were now delaying the expansion and not stopping it altogether. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660905">Not every community has the same mental health services, especially in rural and remote areas. I previously spoke to a young woman who was movably shaken by the thought of medical assistance in dying being made available to individuals whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. His deceased mother had struggled with mental illness, and he was extremely angry to hear that the Liberal government had not cancelled outright the option for people to seek MAID under these parameters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660906"> People were rightly concerned about protecting the most vulnerable in our society. It is because of this that the reckless expansion was paused, but it was not halted and stopped altogether. The public outcry and concern are what forced the government to take the first step on the MAID delay for people with the single underlying cause of mental illness. Unfortunately, the pause in this expansion is only that, a pause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660907"> Parliament would be better served in our responsibility to Canadians, particularly vulnerable Canadians, to altogether abandon the expansion of MAID to those with mental illness as the sole underlying condition. We cannot give up on people experiencing mental illness. We must ensure that support is there for help and treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660908">I do not want to give up on people. There are so many people in my riding of Kelowna—Lake Country who suffer from a mental health issue, and it is heartbreaking to think that the government's solution to these issues is offering assisted death. It is the government giving up on those experiencing mental illness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660909"> We must focus on giving people help and hope. We must focus on treatment for mental illness rather than assisted death. The Conservatives do not want to give up on people. Medical assistance in dying cannot be the most accessible solution for individuals with mental illness or for those seeking palliative care that may either not exist or be very limited in the community where someone lives. There are multiple recommendations with respect to palliative care and persons with disabilities in the joint committee's report we are discussing today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660910"> Also, instead of bringing forth changes to expand MAID to persons with mental illness, the Liberals should be focusing on proposals to bolster mental health support for Canadians, many of whom are facing challenges given the last nine years of the Liberal government, which has made life so hard for so many. We have to remember that it was the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation> who spearheaded the three-digit suicide prevention hotline, 988, in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660911"> As I mentioned, the Liberals did not bring in legislation to cancel the implementation of MAID for those with the sole underlying condition of mental illness; they just delayed it. Instead of these misplaced Liberal policies, building the mental health support systems that Canadians need to live full, fulfilling lives should be the top priority. This is a top priority for the Conservatives in this Parliament and in a future Conservative government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660912">People suffering from mental health issues need resources to help them. Recovery is possible, and we must never give up hope on anyone. The Conservatives will always stand on the side of the most vulnerable, their loved ones and those who support them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8660923">Madam Speaker, it is with a great deal of emotion that I rise today to speak to this report. We are talking about it because advance requests for MAID are a topical issue in Quebec, which implemented its legislation yesterday. It was a big day. It took a year for the act to pass, and it came into force this week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660924">This is a great day for Quebeckers. From now on, people diagnosed with an incurable, neurodegenerative disease will be eligible to submit advance requests. Obviously, they are under no obligation to make a request, but the option is theirs. They are free to state their wishes after being diagnosed with a disease that would eventually rob them of any ability to make decisions as they become incapacitated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660925">All day long, I have been listening to speeches questioning the idea of medical assistance in dying. I felt like I had gone back in time. We have already had this debate, and even though it is not over for some people, patients can now request MAID anywhere in Quebec and Canada. In Quebec, we had a fairly broad and lengthy public debate. I think we are ahead of the curve when it comes to discussing this in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660926">Medical assistance in dying is not an end in itself. A Quebecker who receives a diagnosis and requests MAID has a number of choices available to them. They can decide to request palliative care, palliative sedation or a lethal injection that allows them to choose when they will die. This debate has been quite clear in Quebec for the past 10 years or so. We are quite advanced in our approach to this freedom of choice, this freedom to make an informed decision, with the support of a professional team, about leaving this earth for the great beyond, if I may use that expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660927">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278281" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>, whom I greatly admire for his expertise, diligence and professionalism, explained to us in his speech that a joint committee was established in 2021 following legal decisions by a court asking us to reflect on this issue. A committee was struck, consisting of members from all the parties, including the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party and the NDP, as well as senators. Honestly, I would say that they did monumental work. For nearly two years, they heard witnesses from Quebec and other provinces, and from international experts; all of them, either for or against, shared what they knew. The breadth of everything they were able to learn and understand is impressive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660928">As a parliamentarian, I value the work that has been done. It has not always been easy, because this is a sensitive issue. Advance requests and the other points we agreed to study are not easy topics. It was often emotional, given that it involves personal values. This led to some good discussions. In the end, the committee members agreed on some of the many recommendations, and I should repeat that there were Conservative members on the committee. They agreed on two recommendations that I would like to read, because it appears that, somewhere along the way, we have forgotten what we are debating today. On the Bloc Québécois side, we wonder why, despite an exhaustive, professional and very rigorous study, the government is not taking note of the report, particularly recommendations 21 and 22, which deal specifically with advance requests.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660929"> Recommendation 21 states, “That the Government of Canada amend the <I>Criminal Code</I> to allow for advance requests following a diagnosis of a serious and incurable medical condition disease, or disorder leading to incapacity.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660930">Recommendation 22 states, “That the Government of Canada work with provinces and territories, regulatory authorities, provincial and territorial law societies and stakeholders to adopt the necessary safeguards for advance requests.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660931">These are two great recommendations that, in 2023, urged the government to get to work because the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying had reached a consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660932">The government did nothing. It dragged its feet on this very important component of medical assistance in dying, knowing full well that Quebec would legislate and that a law would come into force in Quebec. We knew we would find ourselves in the position that we are in today. A province has taken the time to think things through and to pass legislation that reflects what Quebeckers want. However, the federal government ignored that legislation, shelved the report and failed to put any effort whatsoever into determining how it should move forward with the entire debate on advance requests, given that Quebec has its own law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660933">Now, we are in a situation where doctors have the right to offer medical assistance in dying to people who make an advance request. Some will likely do so. However, others will still be afraid to provide this care, and that is what worries us. I would encourage the government to get to work as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

These cruise ships generate significant amounts of pollutants that are harmful to human health, aquatic organisms and coastal ecosystems.</ParaText>

The petitioners are drawing the attention of the House to the work of the late Canadian lawyer David Matas and a former Canadian secretary of state for Asia-Pacific, the late and great David Kilgour, who conducted an investigation in 2006. They concluded that the CCP regime and its agencies throughout China have been putting to death a large number, in the tens of thousands, of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience and their vital organs have been seized involuntarily for sale at a high price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660950"> The petitioners are also drawing the attention of this House to the fact that the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning organ harvesting abuses in China. They are asking the government to publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China, amend Canadian legislation to combat forced organ harvesting, and pass a resolution to establish measures to stop the CCP's systemic crimes against Falun Gong.</ParaText>

I also want to follow up on a petition in support of Falun Gong practitioners who are being persecuted in China by the Chinese Communist Party, like Gao Lijuan who is a prisoner of conscience. Because she is a Falun Gong practitioner not allowed to practise, the government has thrown her and many others in jail, which is disgusting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660952">However, as we all know, talking about the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, over 1.5 million people have signed petitions to stop this disgusting and barbaric practice of using political prisoners in China as sources of organs that are then sold around the world. This was brought to light, as was mentioned, by our former colleague David Kilgour as well as by David Matas, a human rights lawyer based in Winnipeg.</ParaText>

Many residents in the cities of Dawson Creek, Fort St. John, Prince George and surrounding communities feel unsafe in their own neighbourhoods due to the increase in drive-by shootings and drug-related crime.

              <ParaText id="8660983">Madam Speaker, it is an opportunity and a privilege to rise in the House today to make my maiden speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660984">It is an opportunity because the result of the by-election in my riding came as a surprise, to say the least, to all observers. For me, this journey began with an eclipse and ended with a full moon. Although I worked very hard, I feel so lucky to have been elected that, quite frankly, I really feel that the stars aligned. Ultimately, we eclipsed our opponents. Let us face it, this is a huge victory for the separatist cause, but above all, it is a victory for the supporters. It proves that by getting involved, people can make a difference. It is also a privilege that my constituents, my 78,000 or so bosses, are giving me today to speak on their behalf and be their voice in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660985">In fact, that is exactly why we are here today, to discuss a question of privilege. I hope the House will allow me the privilege of taking a moment to thank the people in my riding from the bottom of my heart for placing their trust in me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660986">I had a great time travelling around the southwest during this campaign. I got to chat with Bloc Québécois members along the last avenues of LaSalle. I got to drink a beer with the Knights of Columbus in the “Bronx”. I got to eat a sub with locals at the famous LaSalle Drive-In. I loved rediscovering Ville‑Émard and Côte‑Saint‑Paul, where I hung out when I was younger, with my friend Yohan Painchaud, the cousin of Joel, another Magdalen Islander. I want to thank the people of the Magdalen Islands for their vital support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660987">I had so much fun saying hello to people at the Maxi on Laurendeau Boulevard and listening to what they had to say. A lot of running goes on during an election campaign. In Ville‑Émard—Côte‑Saint‑Paul, we ran down Maricourt Street and Biencourt Street. Sometimes we even jogged down Jogues Street. When we got hungry, we stopped for a great big Buck Burger at Dilallo's on Allard Street.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660988">What can I say about Verdun? Verdun, the victorious. Verdun, my home, where I met my sweetheart. A lot of people talk about how chic and cool Verdun is. I love everything about my city, but there is another Verdun, one that nobody talks about, and I want to speak for that Verdun today. I love the Verdun of the people, the Verdun with the Maxi, the Verdun with the Zappy, the Verdun of the poor, the Verdun of seniors, the old Verdun, the Verdun with stucco and Gyproc buildings. That is my Verdun. That Verdun must never change and never go away, because the people of Verdun are the heart and soul of this tight-knit community. I will always think about that Verdun whenever I talk about the housing crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660989">English is the official language of 27% of people in my riding. It is safe to say that one in three of my constituents is anglophone. I would like to say a few words to acknowledge them. As I told CJAD radio, I want to be a bridge between Quebec's English-speaking minority and its French-speaking majority. I will never abandon my principles, but I believe that there is room for dialogue. During the campaign, I met many anglophones who, surprisingly, voted for me. I am thinking of Mr. Bellefeuille on Egan avenue, who, despite his French-sounding name, is completely anglophone. We talked about his personal history and the assimilation in his family. It made me realize, and I think it made him realize too, just how fragile the French language is on the shores of the St. Lawrence. He voted for me, because I am a local guy and a true Verdun native. I am also thinking of several anglophones in their early forties whom I met on Monk Boulevard and who told me about their support for the French fact and their desire to learn French. I am also thinking about Mrs. Berman on Argyle Street, a Jewish woman from Great Britain, who told me about how much she admired René Lévesque's integrity. Clearly, the memory of our former premier still lives on in Verdun's English-speaking community.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660990">I am also thinking about an elderly lady of Irish origin who, despite being a Liberal, also told me how much she admired René Lévesque. I think Mr. Lévesque had a lot of respect for the English-speaking community, and that is why people in that community respect him. I think we need to follow his example. Finally, I will never forget the elderly woman from Wales who told me how much the cost of living and rising housing prices are affecting her quality of life. In the autumn of her life, she cannot buy meat or even afford cab fare to the Anglican Church of the Epiphany on Wellington Street. It is deeply unfair that people who worked all their lives should end up living in squalor in their later years. Those on the other side of the House should pay closer attention to the Bloc's proposals about seniors. The Bloc Québécois has lost confidence in the Liberal-NDP coalition for this very important reason. These are people I met, real people, and I will never forget them. I want them to know that I am here to work for them and with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660991">Now, on to today's topic. We have been debating a question of privilege for several weeks now. At this point, the debate has become a time-wasting tactic that will in no way increase the public's esteem for Parliament. We are the people's elected representatives, and we have a responsibility to the people. Our conduct must be exemplary and our interventions relevant in order that we might instill confidence in our institutions and the democratic process. We must constantly prove to the people that we are here to work for the common good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660992">Let us get back to the matter at hand. I will begin by contrasting some of the essential features of our political system with the government's attitude. I will convey what the people of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun have to say. Then I will return to the substance of the matter and the conclusions we can draw.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660993">Let me remind members of a fundamental principle of the British parliamentary system, namely the supremacy of Parliament. The executive branch is subordinate to the legislative branch. To avoid a dictatorship, but also to ensure good governance, the House, and the opposition in particular, have a role to play in scrutinizing spending on our behalf. They also have a role to play in holding the government to account for its decisions. Without that, there is no democracy. If I were one of the members on both sides of the House who say that my party is useless, I would be ashamed to say such things, because the Bloc Québécois takes this role seriously, and we believe that the people of Quebec will once again reward us with their trust for this reason. What are we doing as legislators? For weeks now, we have not actually been legislating, because this government refuses to respect one of the pillars of the current constitutional order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660994">Before I get to the substance of my remarks, I would like to digress one last time to talk about my riding, because this issue raises fundamental questions about the overall conduct of the government, which is accountable to the House. Far be it from me to comment on the internal affairs of the Liberal caucus, as the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has so clumsily done in recent days. Still, I owe it to my constituents and the public to explain what it means for them to have elected me on September 16.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660995">The people of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun elected me because they wanted to send Ottawa a strong message. Here is that message. Throughout my campaign, I rallied the dissatisfied, the disgruntled, the people who are fed up with “he who must not be named”. I entered into a contract in French and English with my constituents. I told them that if they were tired of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> leading the Liberal-NDP government, if they wanted to send him a clear message, they should put their trust in me, because the NDP was blindly supporting the Liberal Party and because the Conservative candidate simply would not get enough votes to win the riding. I repeated that thousands of times, too many times not to say it again in the House today.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8660996">If I can be blunt, the people of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun want the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to go. That is what our by-election victory meant. He needs to give up and resign immediately. That is the message I came here to deliver today, and it is not from me, but from the people who elected me. I had to pass that message on to the House, whether my colleagues like it or not. I hope that is clear, and I will not be commenting further on who should or should not be leading Canada. After all, that could be considered foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660997">Let me end my speech by addressing the substance of the motion. The House compelled the production of documents. A member raised a question of privilege, and the chair found a prima facie case. Since that time, members have been talking non-stop, like Treebeard. The government told us, not without reason, that the RCMP does not want the documents because obtaining them in such an unusual way, through an order from the House of Commons, could compromise the evidence. It is certainly a valid argument, but that is not what the motion says.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660998">The motion instructs the government and the Auditor General to deposit the SDTC documents with the law clerk of the House, who will review them confidentially and provide them to the RCMP. The RCMP is not obliged to accept them. I say, the government should let them decide and should just comply with the order issued by the House, period. We have been stalled for three weeks now because of the government's stubborn refusal to honour the Constitution and parliamentary privilege. Actually, we have been stalled for nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8660999">Is Parliament supreme in this country? The government's answer to that is clear as can be. It is the same answer given by Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his Constitution, which was rammed down our throats: utter contempt. The answer is no. As I see it, this is contempt of Parliament, contempt of parliamentarians, contempt of the people as sovereign, and contempt of democratic principles. How many times will the government tax our patience? Enough is enough. The government must deposit the documents immediately and end this charade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661000">I would like to end on a positive note. The day I was elected, I said that love conquers all. I am sure of it. I think it is the essential ingredient of our democracy. It is also what gives us the strength to fight off despotism, because a voluntary citizen-driven movement is much more powerful than the crushing weight of fascism. Love of country, true patriotism, the love that the citizens have for the good of their community, is the best thing about our form of government, and it is much more powerful than the greed of tyrants. The love that political adversaries can show for one another, despite their differing views, is proof of whether a democracy will survive. Above all, the love of elected officials for their constituents is essential. We must always show those we love that we are here for them and that our hearts are in the right place. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661001">We must never fear the people. We must stand by them. That is our responsibility. Their responsibility is to trust us in spite of our flaws, because we are human, too human. Where there are humans, there is human nature. I ask the people to have sympathy for their representatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661002">I said that the Bloc Québécois victory in Verdun was a victory for separatists. Fighting for Quebec independence is my calling in life. It is a unique opportunity to finally secure our freedom. Quebeckers and Canadians cannot love each other when we are part of the same country, so we must go our separate ways. We tried unsuccessfully to get along with each other with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords and after the referendums. Canada does not want to change, and neither do we. Like its Parliament, this country is not working anymore. It is time to start afresh, with each—</ParaText>

She said, “I’m saying that it’s an emergency—it’s time to break the glass.”</ParaText>

That means the government has kept Parliament paralyzed through the latter half of September and all of October, and now tomorrow will be the third month it would rather tie up the business of the House with a privilege motion on the refusal to hand over evidence to the RCMP in its $400-million corruption scandal.</ParaText>

I hear from constituents every day who want to know who got rich, who knew it was happening and what the government is doing to get their money back. It all starts with the RCMP's being able to do its job.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661301"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour and privilege to rise in the House of Commons to speak on behalf of the great people of southwest Saskatchewan. I have done so many times before, and there seems to be a recurring theme that when I rise in this place, it is to talk about Liberal scandals. It has happened over and over again. If Liberals want to keep abusing the taxpayer, Conservatives are going to keep pointing it out. We will do it as long as it takes and as many times as we have to until they agree to comply with the will of the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661302">What are we here for today? It is about Sustainable Development Technology Canada and the Liberals' failure to produce documents demanded by this House. More than $400 million were funnelled to Liberal-owned and Liberal insider corporations. When Liberals say they are here to deliver for Canadians, what they really mean is they are here to deliver for their friends to make sure they get the first crack at the taxpayer's dollar. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661303">There are public scandals like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s blackface, when he told reporters, “I should have known better, but I didn't.” There are corruption scandals like the SNC-Lavalin affair, where the Prime Minister became the only prime minister to violate the Conflict of Interest Act, which he has done multiple times. The list goes on. In fact, the list is so long that it makes up more than one-third of all corruption scandals at the federal level in our nation's history. One-third of corruption scandals have been committed by the current government in the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661304">I wish I could say that the corruption stops there, but it does not. On April 9, 2020, the government received an unsolicited proposal for a youth program from WE Charity. Just a couple of weeks later, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced a student grant program for this very proposal. In June, when the program officially launched, the Prime Minister said it was not a conflict of interest, despite the charity paying his family members to speak at events, totalling $425,000 in expenses and money paid out. WE Charity co-founder Craig Kielburger also happened to have donated nearly $2,500 to the Prime Minister's leadership campaign back in 2013, and yet we are supposed to take the word of the Prime Minister when he claims his decision on involvement with them was not a conflict of interest. That is not going to happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661305">The then finance minister, Bill Morneau, also had two daughters with ties to or working for WE Charity at the time of the scandal. He took paid vacations and attended special dinners, and he did not think it would be wrong to do so. All the former finance minister had to say on the subject afterward was that, in retrospect, he should have recused himself from the discussion. It is not so easy to tell the public someone should have made a different decision after the person has already made it, especially when it is a bad decision. At what point do elected officials need to be expected to make good decisions and not just constantly apologize for making bad ones? As the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> routinely says, we can all learn from this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661306">The WE Charity was put in charge of a $900-million grant, with an estimated operating cost of $19 million. However, as we learned, it could have been $43 million as it was under-reported. WE has three branches, including one in the U.K. and one in the U.S. and between those branches, more money has been sent to the organization in Canada than abroad, where it claims to be doing charitable work. Where it claims to do the most charitable work, in Kenya, it is not even listed in the top 50 NGOs. Instead, it is known for North American and European celebrity visits and photo-ops, as a reporter from the national newspaper puts it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661307">WE Charity also claimed it sent medical supplies as another way it spent on charitable efforts, but its U.S. tax filings in 2019 have no such purchases, and it refuses to make its Canadian statements public. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> then prorogued Parliament to halt further investigations into the WE scandal. I wish I could say this was a poor decision on who the Liberals wanted to do business with, but they have shown time and time again that they deliberately do business with either corrupt or conflicted organizations, and it is not until they are publicly exposed that they claim to have regrets about their actions. Like the Prime Minister said, we can all learn from this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661308">As parents, we try to teach our kids to be sincerely sorry for their actions and not just simply for getting caught. What parents want to see are corrective actions, steps and measures they have taken to make sure that this does not happen again, and yet here we are in a gridlock once again over more Liberal corruption.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661309"> It seems to be something that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> never learned, possibly was never taught. Either way, he is the one who is in charge of leading this country. We know that a fish rots from the head down and it seems to be true in the case of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661310">Before the WE Charity it was SNC-Lavalin. After the WE Charity it was the Manitoba lab. Then it was the arrive scam. Then it was appointing a sister-in-law as the Ethics Commissioner. Today, it is the green slush fund. What kind of a government thinks it is okay to appoint a sitting cabinet minister's sister-in-law to be ethics commissioner amidst potential investigations into conflict of interest allegations? It is a government that is trying to hide its corruption. That is just unacceptable, no matter what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> says.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661311"> There have been so many scandals, yet the NDP-Liberals have found ways to avoid accountability for their corruption, the latest being the withholding of documents that belong to the public to hide the names and information of people involved in this corruption. Let us take a look back at how they have avoided accountability before this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661312">With respect to SNC-Lavalin, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pressured the justice minister to interfere with the lawsuit to get away without prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661313"> With respect to the WE Charity, the government prorogued Parliament to avoid further investigations into the scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661314"> When Canadians demanded accountability with respect to the convoy, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> responded by enacting the Emergencies Act to avoid being held to account for trampling on the rights and freedoms of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661315">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to believe that this House belongs to him instead of the people and that is a very serious problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661316">In fact, when it came to the Winnipeg lab, he even took the Speaker of the House of Commons to court. The only thing that stopped that from happening was an election conveniently called by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661317">Canadians should not have to worry about the institutions of their nation stealing from them. The government has robbed the taxpayers and has made no effort to make things right or to take accountability. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has still not demanded that the taxpayers receive their money back from the arrive scam scandal. Why is it that it is always the taxpayers who get stuck paying for the government's unethical behaviour?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661318"> Today, we are in the House debating a privilege motion on the corrupt Liberal green slush fund, the SDTC, and how it laundered more than $400 million of taxpayer money to the Liberals' friends and, in some cases, their own businesses. They refuse to hand over unredacted documents as per the will of the House of Commons and the Speaker's order. These documents, along with everything in this House, belong to the people. They are not the Liberal government's property and it has no right to keep them from the taxpayer, especially seeing how these hundreds of millions of dollars that were spent belong to the taxpayer. The government has no money. It only has taxpayers dollars that it has taken from the taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661319"> The SDTC has become a playground for conflicts of interest. In 2022, the SDTC appointed Michael Denham, a previous appointee to the BDC by the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. Mr. Denham has been a generous donor to the Liberal Party, donating thousands of dollars, including to a violator of the Conflict of Interest Act, former finance minister Bill Morneau, who is now “Bill no more”. It is no wonder the Liberal government has been responsible for more than a third of all scandals at the federal level in all of our country's history. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661320">A board member at the SDTC, Stephen Kukucha, not only helped funnel taxpayer dollars into Liberal insider corporations, but has made hundreds of donations totalling in the tens of thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party, including donating to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership campaign in 2013.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661321">There is Annette Verschuren, the director of the board, who was, as members can guess, also a Liberal donor. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661322">Then there is the example of Mr. Kielburger, who invested in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s success to be the head of the Liberal Party and has benefited greatly from receiving either money or positions years later from the government. Somehow it does not occur to the Liberals that this could be wrong, going even so far as to tell the public in the WE scandal that it was not a conflict of interest. I wonder how many others have gotten a return on their investment from the government that we do not even know about yet. Sunlight is always the best disinfectant. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661323">It must be nice to have friends like the Liberals do. It is “I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine”. It should be hard to believe that in just nine years, to say it again, the Liberals have committed more than one-third of all the public corruption scandals in the entire history of the federal government. It should be hard to believe that they think the House belongs to them and are above accountability for their actions. It should be hard to believe that they have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and have given it to their friends and their own companies. However, it is not, when we look at how the people who are appointed to arm's-length institutions are often donors, in-laws or close friends. Just as bad as conflicts of interest is using the executive powers of the House to appoint insider donors and friends to oversee the accountability that is supposed to prevent this kind of theft from happening in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661324">Time and time again, those in the Liberal government have proven that they have absolutely no regard for the sanctity of this chamber or for the offices they hold. The Liberal government has managed to tally up, all in all, one-third of all Canadian ethics violations, while having been in government for less than a decade. Liberal grifting knows no bounds. There has been an ethics scandal every single year the Liberal government has been in office. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661325">One of my first speeches in the House of Commons after I was elected as a member of Parliament was about the Joe Peschisolido report, which was a report from the Ethics Commissioner about former Liberal MP Joe Peschisolido, who the Ethics Commissioner concluded was involved in serial ethics breaches, meaning more than one. In other words, it was happening on a regular basis, permeating from the top down, clearly from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to the rest of his cabinet. I talked then about how as a new MP it was unfortunate that what I was speaking about early in my term was the culture of corruption the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was continuing to demonstrate over and over again to his caucus and the bureaucracy, then allowing it to happen within the Liberals' own ranks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661326">From coast to coast, and especially across the southwest, Canadians are struggling more than ever. Just this morning at committee, I heard from witnesses explaining the debt that Canadians are digging themselves into just to afford essentials like food, clothing and shelter. All the while, Liberal insiders are being funnelled taxpayer money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661327">Despite scandal after scandal and report after report, the Liberals still have absolutely no remorse for what they have done. The house of cards that sits across this chamber keeps trucking along. It is just insane. The Liberals do the same thing over and over again, yet we expect something to change and it never does. Maybe this time they will obey the rules, listen to the will of Parliament and release the documents, but so far, no. Canadians know this, though. Canadians can see the rotten-to-the-core Liberal government and they are ready for change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661328">It is worth pointing out the complacency of the Liberals' coalition partner the New Democrats, who are so terrified of facing Canadians and losing their pensions that they have refused to help bring the government down. In fact, it is 116 days until the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation>'s pension will be vested. He has been making news lately by telling Canadians that he is absolutely not interested in bringing down the Liberal government. In 116 days from now, on February 25, is he magically going to grow a spine, be willing to take real action on behalf of Canadians and bring the tired, corrupt government down, or is he going to keep propping it up? Are the New Democrats going to pass the election reform bill, which will lock in a change to the election date so the NDP leader can make sure that his caucus members and members on the Liberal side are guaranteed to lock in their pensions, or will they do the right thing and call a carbon tax election at the soonest available opportunity? Is he going to put his pension above Canadians? I guess time will tell.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661329">The Liberals hate the thought of accountability, whether it comes from this chamber or from their own caucus. The former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and the former president of the Treasury Board Jane Philpott were kicked out of caucus for doing the right thing when it came to SNC-Lavalin. As I said, one-third of all federal scandals in Canadian history belong to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cronies. The Prime Minister has had as many scandals in his nine years as Canada's first 20 prime ministers did over a span of 137 years. No matter what way we look at it, it is impressive that he was able to do that. That is not to mention that he has added more money to the national debt than every other prime minister combined. I guess when one is involved in that many scandals, of course it is going to cost the taxpayers money. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661330">I would like to remind the House what happened in April: For the first time in over a century, the House called someone to the bar for questioning. That man, Kristian Firth, exercised absolutely no remorse over lining his pockets with taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661331">Even when the most exclusive powers of the House are used, the Liberals do not care. Their friends do not care. They fundamentally believe that they are above accountability and certainly think they are above the will of the House. It is disgraceful. The man summoned to the House back in 1913 was imprisoned because he failed to answer the questions of the House, yet today, the Liberals and the people they empower do it shamelessly and just walk out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661332">At the core of this debate is the Speaker's ruling on September 26 declaring that this place's privileges had been violated. For nearly 350 years, the supremacy of Parliament was something cherished in Westminster systems like ours across the world. Here in Canada, our government, the executive branch, does not operate outside the confines of this place. It is formed by it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet sit just across the way, where every day they face the scrutiny of the opposition in question period. The centralization of power that the Prime Minister is overseeing should worry everyone in the chamber and everybody across this country, because it flies right in the face of how our system of government works. Parliament is supreme and the Liberals must respect it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661333">The government is a public entity and everything in the House belongs to the public. When will the Liberals stop hiding their corruption and stop withholding documents that do not even belong to them so the House can get back to work and Canadians can get the answers they are owed?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661334">Another public entity out there, which hits a bit more closely to home, is Parks Canada. It operates Grasslands National Park. If we want to talk about the way the Liberals are abusing the authority they have, we can look at the species at risk. They are trying to tell Canadians and the ranchers down in the Val Marie area that the prairie dog is a species at risk that must be protected. However, a quick Google search shows that the prairie dog is not even a native species to Canada and it is not just surviving but thriving. We see it from the southern tip of Saskatchewan all the way down to Mexico and all the through the central states, yet the bureaucracy the government is overseeing is saying it is a species at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661335">What are they doing with the sage grouse? They are saying that these two species coexist. There is a way to prove they do not coexist and that the prairie dog does not belong in Grasslands National Park in the way the government says it does: The prairie dog likes to eat the root of the sagebrush. Sage grouse, which are called sage grouse for a reason, like sagebrush for its shelter and protection. When the prairie dog eats the sagebrush root, it turns into a tumbleweed and blows away, leaving the sage grouse exposed, at risk and in danger. When Parks Canada is trying to protect another species at risk, namely the sage grouse, it is creating all kinds of issues because of the way it is managing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661336">Let us talk about the new bridge being built at one of the historical ranches. Parks Canada is building it in a location that was not even recommended by the local RM but decided to plow through with it anyway. There is another species at risk out there called the nighthawk. All of their nests and where they like to be are right in the path of this bridge, and Parks Canada is building right through it. It said forget it; it is building this bridge there anyway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661337">Parks Canada is deliberately ignoring another species at risk, and it is doing it for triple the cost of what the municipality is able to build similar bridges for. If it would have accepted the proposal of the municipality, it would have had the bridge already done and done for a third of the cost, but, no, we have to get more bureaucracy involved and make it way more expensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661338">Rather than just take up the local perspective, the views of the locals, the people at Parks Canada would rather take a view that, again, creates excessive and unnecessary spending. They would rather kick the ranchers out of the park. They say that bureaucrats can manage ranch land better than producers who have been doing it for way longer than the bureaucracy has even been around. It is shameful. If they want to prove to Canadians that they actually care, they would listen to locals. They would listen to the producers down in Grasslands National Park. They would listen to the RM of Val Marie and do what is right.</ParaText>

We can look at the different standards that exist, such as what happened long before I was in this place when a colleague was held accountable over a $16 glass of orange juice. The Chrétien-Martin government was held accountable by Canadians for the sponsorship scandal, which was way less than this scandal. We are at over $400 million.

The Liberal government continues to refuse to release the documents it has been ordered to produce by this very House.

Sadly, corruption has benefited Liberal insiders during the entirety of these nine years of the Liberal government.

              <ParaText id="8661365"> After all of these days of debate, the facts remain clear. First, taxpayer money was taken by conflicted board members of SDTC to benefit their own financial and business interests. Second, and equally important for the integrity of this place, the House has still not been provided with the documents necessary and there has been no indication of when, or even if, the money of these conflicted payments will ever be paid back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661366">In the time between when I spoke to the amendment and now as I speak to the subamendment, more and somewhat interesting information has come to light. In my previous intervention, on October 8, I discussed the importance of Parliament being the grand inquest of the nation and the necessity of the power of the House to send for persons, papers and records. Unfortunately, those in the Liberal cabinet and those in the bureaucracy seem to fail to understand this essential, constitutionally protected power of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661367"> This indifference was clearly on display last week at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.

The king became its servant on good behaviour, liable to dismissal for himself or his ministers. All this was not restitution, but inversion. Passive obedience had been the law of England. Conditional obedience and the right of resistance became the law. Authority was limited and regulated and controlled. The Whig theory of government was substituted for the Tory theory on the fundamental points of political science. The great achievement is that this was done without bloodshed, without vengeance, without exclusion of entire parties, with so little definiteness in point of doctrine that it could be accepted, and the consequences could be left to work themselves out. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8661390">On February 6, 1865, the then attorney general, who was soon to become the first prime minister, the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, rose in the House of the Province of Canada to provide his thoughts on responsible government. He said, “In the Constitution we propose to continue the system of Responsible Government, which has existed in this province since 1841, and which has long obtained in the Mother Country. This is a feature of our Constitution as we have it now, and as we shall have it in the Federation”. That is from page 33 of the debates from the third session of the eighth provincial Parliament of the united Province of Canada</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661391">The first prime minister went on to explain that having cabinet held responsible to the legislative branch was an effort to avoid giving too much power to the executive branch, as had been seen elsewhere, including south of the border. Macdonald went on to say, “With us...the Representative of the Sovereign, can act only on the advice of his ministers, those ministers being responsible to the people through Parliament.” It is the essence of parliamentary democracy that Parliament is supreme and that cabinet is responsible to Parliament. It can neither ignore nor refuse an order of Parliament simply because a minister, or even a prime minister, may disagree with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661392">Where does this bring us today?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661393"> In normal cases, ministerial responsibility means that the minister ought to take responsibility for the challenges within their department. When the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the opposition</Affiliation> made his initial question of privilege, he referenced a memorandum he had obtained from the Privy Council Office at the beginning of this Parliament. That memorandum was written by a certain Paul MacKinnon, and it states, “Public servants do not share in ministers' constitutional accountability to the Houses of Parliament but support ministers in this accountability”. He also wrote, “the ultimate accountability for deciding what information to withhold from or release to parliamentarians resides with the responsible minister.” As such, where is the accountability from the accountable minister?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661394">The Liberal government may believe that the rights and privileges of Parliament do not matter, but we will soon see if the responsibility of the minister responsible is there. It is time that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers hold themselves accountable to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661395">I want to recognize that the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was not the minister of the early days of SDTC. Who was the minister? That minister was Navdeep Bains, who has since left cabinet and politics. We have now twice attempted, at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, to hear evidence from the former Liberal minister Navdeep Bains. He may no longer be a Liberal minister, but he sure still talks like a Liberal minister with his empty statements that mean nothing and are intended to convey nothing. He refused to answer even basic questions at committee about dates and names, and he even refused to confirm where he was currently employed. This is further evidence that Liberals, even after their careers in politics are over, refuse to accept responsibility and accountability for their actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661396">This brings us to the subamendment before the House today. I must admit that I was slightly disappointed with the original ruling in that I do not believe the best course of action is to refer this to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. I know a member opposite is wondering why I would have concerns with the procedure and House affairs committee, but the member knows very well of past Liberal scandals where lengthy filibusters occurred at that committee. They were led by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278697" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation>, or the member for <Affiliation DbId="278395" Type="2">Hull—Aylmer</Affiliation>, who tried to prevent us from getting to the bottom of important Liberal scandals, such as the WE Charity prorogation scandal or the foreign interference scandals that we have seen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661397">That is why I think the amendment and the subamendment are so important to strengthening the motion of the Speaker's ruling. The subamendment would ensure that both Paul MacKinnon, the former deputy secretary to cabinet, and the Privacy Commissioner would appear as witnesses. Paul MacKinnon, as explained by the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">opposition House leader</Affiliation> on September 26, is an official at the Privy Council Office who authored the memo that I cited earlier. It is important for him to explain before members of Parliament what he meant by, “the ultimate accountability for deciding what information to withhold from or release to parliamentarians resides with the responsible minister.” In my view, the ministers relevant to the June 10 motion have not been held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661398">The other witness the subamendment proposes is the Privacy Commissioner. The commissioner is obviously an expert in the matter of protecting documents and could also provide valuable insights to the rules and procedures for providing papers and records based on a order of the House of Commons versus other means, such as an access to information request. I might add as well that the Privacy Commissioner is a former officer of Parliament as the former law clerk, so he also has the added benefit of knowing and understanding the rights and privileges of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661399">This subamendment, if passed, would further strengthen the main amendment and ensure that we would get the answers necessary. This debate could be over today if the Liberal government were to simply hand over the documents as ordered by the House so that they could be provided to the RCMP to do what it will with them. This is to ensure that the accountability of the House is upheld.</ParaText>

In addition, of equal or perhaps even greater concern is the number of conflicted projects in the sample that the Auditor General looked at. This means that the board members themselves were voting specifically on matters they ought not to have been voting on. They were voting on enriching their own pockets by voting in favour. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661427">Madam Speaker, the member for Brandon—Souris is right. We are talking about a centuries-old tradition that gives Parliament the authority and, in fact, the constitutional authority to call for documents, and virtually the only limitation on this ability to call for documents is that the records have to exist and they have to exist within Canada. It does not matter whether they are written documents or digital documents; these matters are constitutionally obligated when ordered by this House of Commons on behalf of the people of this country to be produced. They must be produced provided they meet those very narrow exclusions about existing within Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661428">However, why is this important? It is important because it is our job as parliamentarians to represent the people in the country and the people are talking to us every day about demanding responses from the tired Liberal government.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8661440"> Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise on a question of privilege that has taken our country by storm over the last number of months. No matter what the Liberals say, no matter what argument they throw at Canadians, it comes down to one very simple fact: The Conservative Party of Canada will not relent in our protection of the Constitution and the powers granted to the House by the people of Canada when it relates to reviewing documents and knowing what takes place in the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661441">I was a member of the industry committee when the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> spoke for the first time about the $400 million of waste in question today. Across Canada right now, Canadians are facing crises they have never seen before. The cost of living is up big time. In my riding, food bank usage has more than doubled. Canadians are struggling to pay their mortgage. In fact, since the Liberals and the NDP came to power, house prices and mortgages have doubled. The cost for a mortgage is over $3,500 per month, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Canada's 10 biggest cities is over $2,300 a month. Young Canadians are losing hope because the Canada they once knew is not the Canada before them today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661442">Indeed, I have said in the House before that if young Canadians, say in their early twenties, are in careers where they make more than the average of $55,000 that a Canadian worker makes, saving up for a home in my community would take them nearly 20 years if they saved a large portion of their salary. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661443">Canadians are struggling. British Columbians are paying a carbon tax of over $80 per tonne. Just paying for the gas to get to work every day is costing Canadians hundreds of dollars a month, which goes directly into the coffers of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661444">On housing, Canadians have lost hope. They do not know where to go and are wondering what happened. If a young man or woman making a good salary in Canada was able to save $500 or $600 a month, it would still take them close to a decade to get into a condo in the market I live in today. Canadians are struggling and losing hope. Therefore, when Canadians hear in the House of Commons that the government simply refuses to do what Parliament is asking them to do, they are deeply concerned. They are concerned that the government is willing to stall the business of the House and possibly stall a carbon tax election, a housing tax election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661445">I will talk a bit about small businesses as well. Productivity for small businesses is in a crisis. In fact, from May to June, Canada lost 9,037 businesses; 6,331 declared insolvency year over year during that same period. The closures we are witnessing right now are even greater than those we saw during the pandemic, when the entire country was shut down. While Canadian entrepreneurs and workers are struggling, the government is still hiding behind a facade and behind lies about what the House of Commons can, in fact, ask.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661446"> In the spring, I addressed the damning report released by the Auditor General, which revealed that close to $400 million had been misappropriated by the board of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, otherwise known as SDTC. Two weeks ago, I spoke on the privilege motion and called on the government to provide the relevant documents. Once again, we find ourselves discussing a subamendment to bring the Privacy Commissioner and the former deputy secretary to the cabinet to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs as well. Canadians want us to get on with that work. We are simply waiting for the papers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661447">As parliamentarians, we must stand up for Canadians and ensure that they have the information needed to make informed decisions. The Liberals' refusal to table the documents has effectively paralyzed our country, hindering our ability to do the work we were elected to do. The obstruction makes it impossible for us to address many of the pressing issues that young Canadians are faced with every day: skyrocketing housing costs, rising food inflation and increasing crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661448">This summer, I was out door knocking across British Columbia, and no matter what part of my province I was in, no matter what street I was on, I heard about middle-class families that just could not get ahead. At the end of the month, after either a massive mortgage payment or rent payment, a car payment and fees for school programs and athletics, they were left with nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661449"> One family said to me, and it stuck out so clearly, that just a few years ago they were donating to the food bank and now they have to go there a couple of times a month to make up for the loss. They said that with the cost of gas, getting to work is more expensive, not to mention the fact that in their community today, the amount of crime they are facing as well is just through the roof. This family, like so many others, is wondering what happened to the Canada it knew and still loves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661450"> The issue is about more than just $400 million to Liberal insiders and friends; it is also about what this country stands for and what Canadians expect us to do in the House of Commons. Let me take this time, yet again, to remind the House of the government's corrupt mishandling of SDTC, otherwise known as the green slush fund. The program was designed to support innovation in sustainable development technologies. Established in 2001, it operated with few issues under both Liberal and Conservative governments until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661451">The Auditor General's report outlined that there were a staggering 90 instances where conflict of interest policies were not followed. Nearly $76 million was spent on projects connected to friends of the Liberals who sat on the board. The most egregious example comes from the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>, a member of Parliament from the Montreal area. He worked for a company called Cycle Capital, which received hundreds of millions of dollars from the green slush fund. In fact, the Minister of Environment still has shares in this very company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661452">When we, on this side of the House, stand up for the rights of Parliament and for struggling Canadians, the Liberal Party is standing up only for its rich friends who have been enriched by taxpayer dollars at the expense of everyone else. Not only that, but $59 million of projects were awarded that were not eligible for funding, and $12 million was spent on projects that not only fell into conflict of interest but were also ineligible from the very beginning. The situation not only represents a betrayal of public trust but also illustrates a significant failure in oversight by the current minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661453"> We have to ask ourselves in the chamber how we can ensure accountability in government if those that are in power are not held to the same standards we expect of taxpayers. Conservatives have proven through the debate that the privileges of parliamentarians were violated by the government's refusal, which is why we are continuing to speak and why we will not relent about the serious action the government has taken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661454"> This is not just a procedural misstep. It is not just political wrangling. It is a direct challenge to the very foundation of why all of us are in the House in the first place, and that is to approve or disapprove of how the government spends money. That authority rests with the 338 members of the chamber. As my colleague from southern Ontario so aptly mentioned in the debates related to Sir John A. Macdonald in the province of Canada, our system of government was designed to ensure that cabinet remained accountable to this very House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661455">However, the Liberals are shying away from their responsibilities to be accountable. They are taking every step possible and sharing every single false argument related to preventing them from doing what is right in the eyes of our Constitution and in the eyes of the taxpayers who pay for this place. It is not just us saying this; the Auditor General made it clear that the scandal falls squarely upon the government, that it did not sufficiently monitor the contracts and that it did not sufficiently follow due diligence procedures.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661456"> To understand the gravity of the situation, we must first reflect on the historical context of parliamentary privilege. Our rights and privileges as parliamentarians are not mere formalities; they are rooted in centuries of struggle against tyranny. As the British House of Commons gained eminence as a legislative assembly, it established privileges as statutes and part of common law aimed at protecting its members from interference, namely, the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661457">Erskine May, a cornerstone reference in parliamentary procedure, defines privilege as “the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions”. In other words, I cannot do my job, nor can anyone in the House do their job, for that matter, if our privilege is disrupted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661458"> In Canada, we inherited this legacy through the Constitution Act of 1867, which enshrines our rights and privileges, ensuring that they are not exceeded by any authority outside the House. The Parliament of Canada Act of 1985 further states that we retain these privileges, “not exceeding those...held, enjoyed and exercised by Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom”. In other words, we inherited the democratic traditions of the Westminster parliamentary system of responsible government. This is a powerful affirmation of our rights and responsibilities as members of this institution, drawing on hundreds of years of precedent that bring us here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661459">I will get back to the motion. in June, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> tabled a motion asking for all files, documents, briefing notes, memoranda, emails and other correspondence exchanged among government officials regarding SDTC. The motion was sent through, and SDTC and associated parties either redacted the documents, withheld the documents or outright refused to present the documents to the official opposition. This is a clear violation of our collective parliamentary privilege. In making his argument, the opposition House leader referred to page 239 of <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, which reads:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661460">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Disobedience to rules or orders represents an affront to the dignity of the House, and accordingly the House could take action, not simply for satisfaction but to ensure that the House of Commons is held in the respect necessary for its authority to be vindicated. Without proper respect, the House of Commons could not function.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661461">When the rules of parliamentary privilege and the House are disregarded, it undermines the authority and the powers the House can enact, and it diminishes its ability to govern properly. Let us not forget that it is not the government that decides which papers it must provide; it is the Parliament of Canada that decides which paper it needs. Without respecting the use of parliamentary privilege and obeying the orders of the House to produce and bring forward the requested documents, there is a complete disregard of respect for the House and its authority, as well as of our duty to Canadians to provide them with accurate and transparent information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661462">Why does this matter? It matters because we are in a housing crisis. We will not get out of the housing crisis without building more homes. Again, $400 million matters because Canadians cannot afford a nice place to live. We will not get out of the housing crisis without building more homes. To build more homes, we need everyone pulling in the same direction: the federal government, the provincial government, municipalities, workers and, yes, the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661463">Demonizing, taxing and blocking private sector involvement in Canada's housing market not only keeps us from solving the housing crisis but actually makes things worse. Smart federal housing policy incentivizes the private sector to build the housing people need across the housing spectrum, instead of demonizing it, which is what the government has been doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661464">As for our new policy to remove the GST on new homes under $1 million, we cannot get to this important work because the government and the House of Commons have been hamstrung with the government's refusal to put documents forward. We either have to go into a carbon tax election or a housing tax election, or get to the bottom of why the government is so corrupt that it refuses to give Parliament the documents it requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661465"> Since the government came to power, the price of a home in Canada has doubled. Average monthly mortgage costs have more than doubled, to over $3,500 per month. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Canada's 10 biggest cities is over $2,300 a month, and nine out of 10 young people in this country who do not own a home believe they never will. It now takes over 60% of one's income to cover the cost of owning a home. According to the OECD, Canada has the largest gap between home prices and incomes of all developed countries. Canada has the fewest number of homes per capita in the G7, and CMHC is predicting that housing starts will continue to decline by up to 32%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661466">The government has spoken a lot about its housing accelerator fund, which has actually led to no homes despite billions of dollars more of taxpayer dollars wasted. In fact, my community of Abbotsford was one of the communities that received money under the plan. Do members know what the City of Abbotsford is doing right now? It is about to increase the DCC by 46% and levy a new $7,800 tax on all new homes built to pay for our recreation infrastructure deficit. As a young parent, I understand the need for effective recreational opportunities for our youth, but they should not come on the backs of Canadians who want to purchase their very first home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661467">What we need to do is incentivize more home construction. How we are going to get there is by pushing municipalities to approve more homes quickly, incentivizing them with infrastructure dollars to densify and to build up around our transportation stations so Canadians can get to work faster, save more money and live in the community where they are in fact working. We can do this. We are a country of resilience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661468">Unfortunately, the government has directed $90 billion directed toward housing, but all it can do is point to the statistics I raised earlier that show that housing is more expensive, rent is more expensive and young people do not have an opportunity to get into the market. Indeed, the Liberal record on housing is so bad that young people are giving up on owning a home. In some cases, they are thinking about moving south of the border because there are more opportunities there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661469">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation says that Canada needs a total housing stock of over 22 million units by 2030. To reach 22 million units by 2030, CMHC says we must build 3.5 million more units than we are building right now. CMHC says that those 3.5 million units required by 2030 will require an investment of at least $1 trillion to build. CMHC says we need increased participation from the private sector to meet those goals. That is exactly what the Conservative Party is saying as well: Let us incentivize the private sector to play a larger role in home construction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661470">It is not just the Conservative Party saying this. TD Economics came out with a study in September about the productivity crisis we are facing in Canada. That report said the crisis is nowhere worse than in homebuilding construction, and we need to incentivize private sector players to get back into building homes that Canadians need and where they can live the Canadian dream. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661471">As I turn back to the parliamentary motion before us, it is about the production of documents, but more importantly, it is what this government is signalling to the entire country, which is that corruption is okay, mismanagement of public funds is okay and the rules that have governed our country since we came into inception do not seem to matter anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661472">I am calling on the 24 backbenchers who stood against the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to stand with the Conservative Party to have a carbon tax election now, to have a housing tax election now or just to have an election, because it is clear that Canadians do not have confidence in the Prime Minister and that the House of Commons really does not have confidence in the Prime Minister any longer. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661487">Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague touched upon the theme of betrayal of public trust, and that is what it is. Those words really resonated with me: “betrayal of public trust”. That is what this green slush fund scandal is all about, a $400-million waste. The cost of living is up, food bank use is up, the carbon tax is up and housing taxes are up. In my community, one in seven residents is visiting Project Share, our food bank, and it now feeds 120 families a day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661488">Perhaps my colleague could touch upon why he thinks the government is so lax in wanting to provide those documents. Perhaps he can also tell us what that $400 million could provide to hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>

I also heard the testimony of former industry minister Mr. Bains, who, I believe, now works for Rogers Communications. They were indifferent about the cost of living crisis that is impacting Canada. The government seems to only care about one thing: protecting Liberal friends and insiders from their duty to serve Canadians. Time and time again, we have asked and pleaded with the government to come clean with Canadians about its corruption and criminal activity as it relates to the $400 million in the SDTC, or green slush fund. The Liberals refuse to do so because they are afraid of accountability and are hiding behind a cloak of false constitutional arguments to protect their friends and insiders.</ParaText>

This is becoming very well established. He continues to refuse to get the security clearance, which is not in the best interest of Canadians, and it is unacceptable that he is putting his personal interests ahead of the interests of Canadians. The leader of the Conservative Party needs to step up to the plate and do the honourable thing: not only get the security clearance, but also stop the game he is playing. I would argue it is abuse of parliamentary privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661497">Madam Speaker, Halloween is a great opportunity to rise in the House and tell scary stories about the Liberals and all their close friends who have been collecting candy since 2015. Trust me, there are a lot of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661498">Over the past nine years, we have dug many skeletons out of Liberal closets and gone on witch hunts to unmask all the Liberal “ghouls”. From the sponsorship scandal to the green fund scandal we are talking about today, it all comes back to the man behind the mask, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661499">It is always a privilege for me to stand in the House and proudly represent the interests of the people of Lévis—Lotbinière, no matter what their needs are, and to do justice to the hard-working Canadians of this country. They do not deserve to have their hard-earned money used for partisan purposes or used to grease the palms of some Liberal Party of Canada donors, as we have all too often caught it doing. Let us not forget all those who have been granted privileged access to ministers to talk about their projects. All too often, those projects have served only to line their own pockets, to the detriment of citizens and the future of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661500">This intervention on the privilege motion concerns the green fund scandal. The crux of the problem has not changed: The Liberal government still refuses to send unredacted documents to the police so that they can do their job and determine the scope of the corruption observed in this matter by the Auditor General. What saddens me so deeply about all of this is that, once again, Liberal Party members and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are dashing the dreams, trust, respect and hopes of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661501">Let me review the facts. The Auditor General identified irregularities in the procedure used to allocate money to businesses through the green fund, which was intended to help businesses develop solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We in the Conservative Party believe that technology is the best way to reduce our environmental footprint. Technology offers Canada a pathway forward into the future, unlike the punitive anti-economic measures, like the carbon tax, that are being implemented on the backs of Canadian workers and families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661502">However, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, funnelled much of its funding to companies owned by the members of its board of directors, who were also long-time Liberal insiders. The selection process was rigorous and merit-based, but it was overridden and used in an arbitrary way in order to favour Liberal cronies. So much for fairness, because with the Liberals, friends come first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661503">In fact, it is the profusion of arbitrary actions taken by this Liberal government that is undermining public trust in this government. This includes gifts to certain corporations over others, favouritism, punitive taxes imposed on certain sectors and the capital gains tax, which creates tax bias. Those are all the ingredients of the Liberal magic potion. If the price of a photo-op government were just a bit of fun now and then, we could live with that. Like any good masquerade ball, it always comes to an end and the secrecy ends with it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661504">The bill for the Liberals' systematic incompetence has led to the worst consequences in the history of our country, which is practically unrecognizable because it has changed so much in the past nine years. Right now, more than two million people are lining up at food banks because of failed Liberal policies. That is a record number in our country's history. That is a 90% increase from 2019. As former finance minister Bill Morneau said in his memoirs, the Prime Minister tosses aside good public policy in favour of scoring political points.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661505">His golden image is now tarnished in the eyes of his own troops, and many are asking the same question: Is he standing up for Canadians or for himself? As a legislator since 2006, I can say that if he were really standing up for the interests of Canadians, he would call an election, not refuse to comply with the order of the House and to hand over the green fund documents to the appropriate authorities. This is the cause of our current state of paralysis, which is justified and perfectly legitimate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661506">Like many sneaks, our Bloc friends were once again left high and dry. They are playing the victim card, claiming that they want to work for real this time. However, when the time comes to vote on the side of common sense, their opportunism and hypocrisy always get the better of them, because they want to have their cake and eat it too. Ultimately, the “Liberal Bloc” and the “NDP Liberals” are the same. They are shakedown artists. We have the ultimate proof that, even with a minority government in place, a party like the Bloc Québécois is incapable of making gains for Quebeckers and Canadians and carries no weight whatsoever. At most, the Bloc Québécois is good at taking credit for the work and results achieved by others, when in fact they are all talk and no action. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661507">Everywhere in my riding, there is one word on everyone's lips: “election”. When will the election be called? My constituents are fed up with this slapdash <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They are telling me they want an election as soon as possible so that this minority government can be held accountable for everything it has done. House prices have more than doubled, and the dream of home ownership is gone for an entire generation. In the Canada I once knew, it was normal for anyone in the country who had a decent salary and a decent job to be able to buy a home and live in dignity. Today, this foundational pillar of our society is in jeopardy because of Liberal mismanagement. The Liberal government broke its promise to build homes to keep pace with the country's demographic growth. The immigration floodgates were opened wide, with no regard for the government's ability to provide services. These crazy policies have undermined the Canadian consensus on immigration. Canadians are the most welcoming people on the planet, but ending common-sense immigration policies like those introduced by the previous Conservative government has led to a few skirmishes in this country. It is so bad that even the Liberals had to reverse their infinitely ideological opposition by announcing earlier this week, to everyone's surprise, that they would be reducing the thresholds by about 20%. Unfortunately, it is probably too little, too late.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661508">I dream of being able to go back to the days of the Right Hon. Stephen Harper's government, in which I had the honour of serving. In those days, the issue of immigration levels was a matter of consensus, not a matter that divides Canadians rather than uniting them. However, it is not too late for the government to do what the Conservatives want and adopt a common-sense measure that ties the number of people entering the country to housing construction. The Conservative Party will develop a mathematical formula to respect this rule, which will enable us to lower prices. This formula will make the number of doctors and jobs grow faster than the population. That is the exact opposite of the out-of-control immigration that has taken place under this Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661509">As I read recently in an article by Boucar Diouf in La Presse, “history will unfortunately remember [the reign of Justin Trudeau] as the reign under which intolerance significantly increased in Canada”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661510">Mr. Diouf adds: “his naive vision of immigration and harmonious co-existence pushed Canada even further toward intolerance”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661511">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has also had the nerve to attack Quebec even more by making all sort of comments about it since 2015, even though the latest polls show that Quebec is more open to immigration than anywhere else in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661512">This same Prime Minister forced two women out of his caucus. Although Jody Wilson‑Raybould and Celina Caesar‑Chavannes did not belong to the Conservative party, they were both fine examples of competent and politically courageous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661513">In an interview this week, Ms. Caesar‑Chavannes recalled how little consideration the Prime Minister had for his colleagues and how hard he was to work with. She described multiple incidents she had to deal with involving the person she was serving as parliamentary secretary, who tried to influence her to change the date when she would leave caucus, saying that he could not afford to lose two women on the same day. That type of comment proves he cared more about his image than about the people we represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661514">The former MP for Whitby also said that while she was meeting with the Prime Minister to try to work out their differences, he approached her with such contempt and hatred that she had never been so scared in her life to be alone in a room with someone. He would later apologize to her in the House of Commons, which she described as cowardice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661515">I think it is necessary to look back on this kind of incident to see what a phony the Prime Minister is. For weeks now, his refusal to comply with the House's order has gotten us nowhere. It makes me wonder just how much the Prime Minister is trying to hide. I have to wonder how much political pressure MPs must be under to hide certain information and push certain secret agendas, the same way that Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured in the SNC-Lavalin affair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661516">Considering how many people from his own party have left because of undue pressure, and considering that 24 MPs from his own political party are now calling for his resignation by trying to hold a secret ballot, this Prime Minister's time is clearly up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661517">The time has come to return to normalcy, both in terms of the transparency that Parliament should show to MPs, but also on the economic front, where powerful paycheques give everyone a chance to live with dignity, without compromising future generations through out-of-control spending that generates insurmountable debt and runaway inflation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661518">Oddly enough, the Liberals have dug the idea of a high-speed train out of the mothballs in a blatant campaign-style announcement. We will wait and see how much that will cost. It is always strange to see the Liberals pretend they can make everyone's dreams come true as their term winds down. Do they really intend to move forward with this? If they did, I think they would have made it a priority back in 2015, instead of making a last-minute announcement like this, while they are awash in panic and scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661519">It looks like the only ones who still believe in this Liberal government are the NDP. They are like an ex who just cannot let go, even though it is supposed to be over. What is the NDP's problem, anyway? Virtually all Canadians are wondering why the NDP is systematically supporting this dying government. Is it because the NDP <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> wants to lock in his pension come February 2025? Is it because the party does not have enough money to run an election campaign? Does it have problems with organizing, volunteers or election sign vendors who want to get paid? It is very hard to know what is going on in the minds of New Democrats right now. One thing we do know is that they are more terrified of an election than they are of Halloween.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661520">Meanwhile, the “Liberal Bloc” had a rude awakening when the deadline for its attempted hostage-taking expired. The Bloc Québécois <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> looked like a schoolchild on the Liberals' playground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661521">The sovereignist party tried to hold a federalist party hostage, and it sure looked silly when its ultimatum did not pan out.

              <ParaText id="8661535">Today, street gangs are distributing drugs in high schools across the province and the country with impunity. I had the misfortune of learning that this phenomenon is also occurring in my riding of Lévis-Lotbinière. The Lévis police were forced to increase their presence when a criminal gang tried to recruit in several of the city's schools. Fortunately, additional prevention services have been made available to students by the police, who are not ruling out increasing their numbers to solve the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661536">Drug quantities have increased dramatically. According to journalist Jessica Nadeau's latest report in Le Devoir, over 28 kilograms of cannabis were seized in Quebec high schools in the past five years. Here is a list of other drugs that were seized: 802 methamphetamine and speed tablets, 498 prescription drug tablets, 264 opioid tablets, 51 ecstasy tablets; 219 grams of magic mushrooms, 137 grams of cocaine, 35 grams of crystal meth and 27 grams of crack.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661537">Worst of all, this is only the tip of the iceberg. There are countless incidents of teenagers suddenly dying after using drugs. Then there is the lifelong damage to those lucky enough to survive. An entire generation is being poisoned, and parents are left inconsolable. These drugs have never been so dangerously addictive and deadly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661538">What is the <Affiliation DbId="278267" Type="2">Bloc Québécois leader</Affiliation> doing in the meantime? He does not seem to be making this a priority at all. He supports the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> most of the time and he is soft on crime. We rarely hear the Bloc Québécois leader speak out against the Liberal measures that led to this public disorder. The Bloc Québécois leader supported Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C‑5</Document> which, under the guise of helping drug addicts and people in our communities, eliminates a number of mandatory minimum sentences for very serious crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661539">This allows drug traffickers and producers to get off scot-free. Impunity reigns. The leader of the Bloc Québécois takes the same naive approach as the Liberals called harm reduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661540">The Conservatives' approach is one of understanding the victims of drugs and promoting the associated treatment to help men and women overcome it, but never at the expense of law and order, not at the expense of innocent lives, victims who made the mistake of trying the drug once and ending up hooked on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661541">Traffickers are no longer afraid of the government, just as the Prime Minister is not afraid of the leader of the Bloc Québécois one bit.

              <ParaText id="8661572">It is a scandal that once again highlights the Liberal government's irresponsibility, corruption, and contempt for the people of this land. It has paralyzed the House of Commons for a month now. It is the scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661573">Once again, the Liberal government has broken trust with Canadians by misappropriating nearly $400 million of public funds for its cronies, only to later try to sweep its mistakes under the rug, as usual. Those days are over. There will be no more cover-ups. We will not allow it to carry on with utter impunity and disdain for Canadians, for all my colleagues here, and for the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661574">The House ordered that the documents be produced in order to expose all of SDTC's practices. All of us, including the Speaker, demanded that essential documents be handed over so that the RCMP can thoroughly investigate the current Liberal government's questionable activities. We are not asking the Liberals to do us a favour. We are not asking them to do this out of the goodness of their hearts. We are simply asking them to respect Canadians and the authority of the House, especially that of the chair, and to respect the authority of all the Canadians we represent. It is a demand that is part of the legitimate and necessary exercise of the powers of the House. It is a demand that represents the interests of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661575">What is this Liberal government doing in response? It is doing what it does best, what it always does: It is shirking its responsibilities and trying to circumvent decisions that make it uncomfortable. It refuses to provide the RCMP with the documents in their entirety, meaning unredacted. That is essentially what we are asking. It is not complicated. This is a serious breach of parliamentary privilege. More than a breach, it is a real shattering of our privilege. It is a direct affront to our democratic institution. It is an attack, a threat, a disgrace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661576">What is important to understand about SDTC is that we are not talking about a few omissions or administrative errors. What we are seeing is a deliberate strategy, a finely tuned pattern of manipulation to protect all those profiting from this corruption at the expense of honest Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661577">Let me digress for a moment. This is not the first time I have spoken on this issue in the past month. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, where my colleagues and I heard a wide range of testimony. I know that some of my colleagues on other committees have also heard testimony. Just yesterday, we heard from the former industry minister, who was responsible at the time for this fund, a so-called “independent” organization. The current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was forced to shut down the fund last June because the scandal had broken and all the corruption had been uncovered. Inevitably, thanks to us, the minister had no choice. The Liberals say that the fund is independent, but in reality, it was the minister who made the decision to shut it down. They obviously do have a responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661578">I want to recap the facts so everyone can fully grasp the scale of this scandal. This is not a recent affair, nor is it an isolated event. The Auditor General's report published last June reveals damning details. SDTC gave hundreds of millions of dollars to projects that either were ineligible or represented a conflict of interest.

              <ParaText id="8661583">Mr. Speaker, the ineligible projects were those that demonstrated no environmental benefit. SDTC is a program designed to help companies implement green environmental technologies. The Conservative Party is very open to the idea of supporting technologies that can help us, rather than imposing the carbon tax on people. We want to implement new technologies that will help us improve the environment. In this case, the Liberals seemed to forget one detail: SDTC is a fund for implementing sustainable development technologies in Canada, not a fund for helping their cronies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661584">We are also talking about the environment. The organization was supposed to support environmental initiatives, but $58 million was invested in ineligible projects. That $58 million was wasted, with no tangible results for the environment or green technologies. That is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661585">I am in business, and I am not getting any subsidies. Quite honestly, none of the SMEs in Canada are getting subsidies. What we all want is for the technologies that are put in place to help the environment to actually work. Unfortunately, the government has thrown away $58 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661586">On top of that, a whopping $334 million went to projects where there was a blatant conflict of interest. That has been proven. The Conservative Party of Canada is not the one saying that. It is the Auditor General of Canada, who audited all of the records that she had at that time. She had to stop because she ran out of time. That is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the truth about this fund. There are probably a lot more problems. How can we and Canadians stand by when members of the SDTC board of directors directly profited from these public funds?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661587">I have to briefly share a personal story. After losing the election in 2011 by nine votes, I went back to university. I took a course to get a certificate in business administration at Université Laval. The course was given over a few weekends. I relearned some things I already knew, basic things in life. When managing public funds, whatever they may be, there are certain rules that must be followed. I was the mayor of a city, and before I was mayor, I was a supplier to that city. I knew perfectly well that when I became mayor, I would no longer be able to get those city contracts for my company. If I did, I would be personally benefiting from public funds. The course I took at Université Laval is an excellent course. It still exists today, and it trains certified business administrators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661588">I will digress for a moment. When this government came to power in 2015, it appointed administrators who were friends of the party and who favoured other friends of the party. However, there are training programs in Canada, particularly at the Université de Montréal, Université Laval and Concordia University, that train people to run corporations and organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661589">What is a corporation? It can be a foundation, a fund, a listed company or an unlisted company, for example. These people are therefore authorized to manage funds. They do not have to be appointed. This is where most of the problem originated: Some of the people who were appointed had received funds from SDTC in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661590">When these people were appointed, of course, they declared potential conflicts of interest. However, that did not stop them from awarding themselves money after being appointed to the board of directors. There are other people in Canada who could have done a very good job of managing this fund. In some cases, directors paid money directly to themselves. Afterwards, they said that it was because they were misinformed and got bad legal advice. I went to university for a few weekends to learn about corporate management or business administration. They taught us the basics, the most fundamental things. People cannot profit directly or indirectly from public funds that they administer.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661591"> There is nothing complicated about that. It is the absolute starting point for public administration, and it is no different for a member of Parliament. I own a business that I could use to provide services to a lot of people. I could even provide services to myself. I do not, however, because it is not allowed. If I used the services of my own company, it would put me in a conflict of interest. My company employs 12 graphic designers, but I pay someone outside my company to handle my business as an MP. I know I have no choice. It is what I have to do. That is the bare minimum when it comes to potential conflicts of interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661592">This $334 million was taken directly out of Canadians' pockets, out of everyone's pockets, including the people here. That money should have been invested in other innovative, useful and sustainable projects to serve these same Canadians, but instead, it was used to make the rich richer. This is almost a Liberal hallmark. They keep taking money from Canadians to make the rich richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661593">This type of scandal should not be conceivable, let alone achievable. The government has a duty to protect public funds and ensure that every taxpayer dollar is used with integrity and transparency. However, SDTC's actions and the Liberal government's complete lack of control show just the opposite. In fact, the minister was forced to admit to the House that the situation had really gotten out of hand. He was forced to shut down the fund and reallocate the money to another department, which reports to his own department, in order to be able to continue investing in green technology. The whole board of directors was sacked, and rightly so. It was the only thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661594">However, the actions of SDTC and the government's complete lack of control prove just the opposite. This government claims to be the champion of transparency and good management. This really bothers me. In 2015, the government, led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, came in saying that it would be the most transparent government Canada had ever seen. Instead, we have never had a worse government than this one when it comes to transparency. Not only did it fail to manage all the funding, but it is still actively trying to hide the truth today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661595">These cover-ups are not an isolated incident in this government's recent history, far from it. The Liberals have earned a reputation for their many, many scandals. It is one scandal after the other, each more shocking than the last. They may not know how to outdo themselves when it comes to governing a country, but when it comes to corruption and scandal, they outdo themselves every time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661596">The current government has always cared more about protecting itself and its allies than serving the interests of the public, the interests of the Canadians who elected it to defend them and represent them. I would remind my colleagues across the way that Canadians are the ones who allow us to sit here in order to serve them and defend their interests, not to make them poorer and to lie to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661597">Let us come back to the topic at hand. I was saying that it is fundamental to understand that the SDTC scandal is much more than an isolated scandal. It demonstrates precisely how this Liberal government operates. Conflicts of interest seem to be the norm, not the exception. How can this government hope to retain the public's trust when it so openly favours its cronies while ignoring the concerns of the people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661598">This contempt for Canadians is completely unacceptable. It is downright insulting. Canadians are struggling to afford food and shelter, to pay for fuel, to deal with the overwhelming cost of living. All of us, from every party, know it. We hear it in our ridings, we see the news and we make it a priority here in Parliament to say that the cost of living is too high, much too high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661599">I was in my riding last weekend, and I met with people who often call our office. My staff is inundated with calls from people who unfortunately are unable to make ends meet. They are struggling to survive because of rising costs. From inflation to interest costs, all this means that people cannot cope with the cost of living right now. That is really not good news for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661600">Quite honestly, the current government is to blame for the increased cost of living. Over the past nine years, the government has doubled the debt. According to a statistic that was released today, Canada's GDP is tanking compared to that of the United States. Americans have a far higher standard of living than Canadians. That was not the case until just recently. We are moving in the wrong direction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661601">This morning, at the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, Mr. Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, explained that the cost of living is only going to go up. Just this morning, La Presse published one of his articles in which he said we need to be prepared because the price of meat is going to be outlandish next year. It already is. The other day, I went to the grocery store and saw a two-pack of T-bone steaks for $87. I have never seen anything like that in my life. It is absolutely incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661602">We are conducting a study right now on credit card interest rates. Interest on credit cards is going up all the time, not only for users, but also for companies that have payments. Meanwhile, the big banks are making money hand over fist, whereas in other countries there are fixed fees that are much lower than what we have in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661603">All of these things have prevented the government from making a decision. Today, people are literally drowning in bills they cannot pay, and it is not a pretty sight. As a result, Canadians are unable to meet their basic needs. That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661604">We have been debating this privilege motion for a month. If the government wants us to move on to something else, all it has to do is hand over the documents. What is it hiding that is important enough to stop it from handing over documents that we have been asking for for almost a month? This government invariably has to do things its own way. Canadians are tired of this government. It seems to live in a bubble, cut off from the realities of everyday life and completely disconnected from the people it is meant to represent. People were talking to me about it last week, when I was in my riding. They want an election as soon as possible. They are fed up, sick and tired, and they need a change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661605">Last week was Small Business Week. My riding is full of SMEs, and I am extremely proud of them. I admire their work and I support their activities. I am a proud long-time entrepreneur myself, having been in business for 33 years. I am also proud to say that my daughter just bought my partner's shares, so our company is truly a family business, and like all entrepreneurs, we work extremely hard to create high-quality, well-paying jobs. The most important thing for an entrepreneur is to create jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661606">The SMEs in my riding are really struggling right now. I talk to entrepreneurs every day, and I meet with them every weekend when I am in my riding. My thoughts are with those entrepreneurs who are struggling to do business in this scary economic environment. When I think of the SDTC scandal, I have to bite my tongue, because my remarks could be a lot more aggressive. I am trying to be polite. People are literally disgusted by all the scandals caused by this government over the past nine years and all the money that is going down the drain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661607">The chair, Ms. Verschuren, came to tell us that she was not responsible since she was no longer on the board of directors. I am sorry, but she was there when the decisions were made. We are responsible for what we do in life for the rest of our lives. We cannot just disappear into thin air just because we are no longer on the board of directors and no longer linked to that. Someone has to take responsibility for this. It is important for the people who were on the board of directors at the time and who were given money through a company to be held accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661608">The business owners all got through the COVID-19 crisis. The lucky ones at the green fund were given a sum equivalent to 5% of all the loans already given to bolster their working capital. I am sorry, but the other businesses across Canada did not get 5% of the loans that they already took out through the fund or at the bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661609">We have a lot of work to do. The Liberals have a very big job to do to give us back this money as quickly as possible.</ParaText>

In the same committee, the superintendent of bankruptcy told us that the number of insolvencies and bankruptcies today is below the prepandemic level; in fact, it is even lower than the 2009 level, when there was a fiscal meltdown in the country. This is because our plan is working. Our actions and our programs are yielding the results that Canadians deserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661633">What he just said is that the superintendent of bankruptcy said that there may be fewer bankruptcies right now, but that is because there are a lot more proposals for bankruptcy, proposals for agreements with creditors. That means there is an increase. That is the opposite of what he is saying. There are more people who might end up in bankruptcy, but there is an openness by the banks to reach agreements based on proposals. It is like saying that this comes back to accepting 25 cents on the dollar and the rest of the debt will be written off.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661655">Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to wish you a very happy birthday today. Are you one? Are you two? Okay, it might take up 20 minutes of my speech if I were to continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661656"> Normally, I would stand up in this place and say it is an honour to rise on behalf of the people of Barrie—Innisfil, but the reality is such that we have an effective standoff going on in this place because of Liberal obstruction through not providing the documents that were requested back in June by Parliament. It was an order of Parliament that was reaffirmed by the Speaker. The privileges of its members have been violated by the government because there are, quite literally, tens of thousands of documents that were not submitted for them to be moved on to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661657">We know that there are that many documents because, publicly, we have heard from the justice department, for example, that it has over 11,000 documents that it has advised the parliamentary law clerk that the Liberals have not submitted to them. It begs the question of how many of those documents from industry and science have not been following the order of Parliament, or from Environment and Climate Change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661658">There could be, quite literally, tens of thousands of documents that have not been submitted, as per the order of Parliament, so we can get to the bottom of this scandal. How much of that information is being hidden? How much advice from the Department of Justice, ISED and Environment and Climate Change to the board of SDTC is in those documents? What was the cost of that advice to taxpayers, and what were they discussing? How much were they trying to suppress the information for parliamentarians to not become aware of just how deep the rot and the scandal goes of $400 million being allocated by the board of directors of SDTC in 183 circumstances of this money being funnelled and approved, which we already knew were conflicts of interest?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661659">The Ethics Commissioner had already deemed it a conflict of interest. I have had a front row seat to this whole thing. It was over a year ago this very issue came to the ethics committee, and as the chair of ethics, I recall we had Annette Verschuren and Leah Lawrence appear before the committee. We actually had the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> appear before the committee, and we could tell, based on the responses to the questions from parliamentarians, with these people who were appearing in front of the ethics committee, that something stunk. Something was not right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661660">Through the course of time and further investigation by parliamentary committees, and through an Auditor General's report that showed hundreds of millions of dollars being funnelled to board of director members who were not declaring a conflict of interest, we are now just scratching the surface on this thing. This is why it is so important for Parliament to invoke its will and its constitutional right to have these documents go to the RCMP, not to a committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661661">It is well known that committees are places where things go to die around here. This is criminal, I would suggest. There are many people who would suggest the same thing. This is why the RCMP needs as many documents as it can to do a proper investigation. As I said earlier, there are literally tens of thousands of documents right now that have not been provided, either through the justice department, or other departments, contrary to what Parliament's order was. That was reaffirmed by the Speaker's ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661662">When we go back and we look at this over the last year, the Auditor General of Canada found that the government, led by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, had turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. We heard this at committee when we had Doug McConnachie in front of us, who was the subject of the recording. Mr. McConnachie had said that this slush fund was on the level of the sponsorship scandal.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661663">However, we found out that we are looking at $400 million, and the sponsorship scandal, not to diminish it, under the Chrétien government was $40 million. So, this scandal is 10 times more. The Liberals knew they had a problem, they knew that the oversight was not being done in a manner that protected taxpayers, and that people were actually benefiting and gaining as a result of their involvement on the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661664">The Auditor General found out that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that, on occasion, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. There was $334 million over 186 cases to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. Can members imagine if any of us operated in that way? Not only would our professional careers be ruined, but our personal reputations would be too. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661665">I would expect that there would be some criminal investigation into this when we have that level of rot and corruption going on, with $58 million to projects without ensuring contribution agreement terms were met; they were just giving it away. Of course, one of the companies that was a beneficiary of that was Cycle Capital, which we now know the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> was a shareholder in. I checked his registry under the conflict of interest commission tonight, and although he has it in a blind trust, he is still listed as a beneficiary of Cycle Capital, and we know that it received quite a substantial amount of money as a result of what went on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661666">The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. In fact, we had, as I said earlier, the industry minister appear before our committee, and he told the ethics committee, at the time, that measures were taken to ensure that SDTC was aligned with policies. We subsequently found out that was not the case. It was implied by a whistle-blower that the industry minister had not been truthful in his testimony with the ethics committee. In fact, the whistle-blower had told us that the industry minister was well aware of what was going on within SDTC and that he turned a blind eye to what was going on. It was not until this became public and became a political issue for the government that the Liberals started actually dealing with the rot and corruption that was going on in there and, in fact, hired outside consultants to come in. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661667">At the time, the ethics committee had asked for the unredacted report. Well, guess what we got? We got a redacted report, the very thing that we are standing here today arguing against. The Speaker ruled in favour of making sure that these documents were given to Parliament in an unredacted fashion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661668">Again, this is a government that, in 2015, came in and said that it was going to be transparent and open by default, and the Liberals have been anything but over the course of their government. In fact, we see that nobody is abiding by the freedom of information, FOI, laws anymore. At the ethics committee, we did an FOI study. We had witness after witness come in front of us telling us that it has taken years to get access to information and that the access to information system has effectively been broken, which is another thing that has been broken as a result of this government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661669">However, we are talking about $400 million. What could $400 million go to? It could go to a lot of things right now. There are families hurting all over this country. In my community of Barrie—Innisfil, similar to what we are seeing across the country, food bank usage is rising and people are stressed. Moms right now are wondering, with mortgage renewals coming up and the cost of groceries, how they are actually going to look after their family. Much of the security blanket they had in the past under previous governments is being ripped from them as a result of the cost of living and the housing affordability and attainability crisis that is going on in this country right now. These moms, and many of them are single moms, are worried about their families. They are worried about their kids and their kids' future, and about their ability to be able to afford a home.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661670">With respect to food bank usage, we now know that two million people are visiting food banks per month. What could the $400 million that went to Liberal-connected insiders and cronies have been used for? Food bank usage has increased significantly as a result of the economic policies of the government. Two million people a month, according to a food bank study that was released just the other day, are going to food banks in Canada, a G7 country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661671">Before I stood to speak today, I pulled the latest statistics from the Barrie Food Bank. Interestingly, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit has done a study, and 30.7% of people in Simcoe County are experiencing food insecurity right now. The Barrie Food Bank had 400 first-time visitors. There are 7,000 individuals every month using the Barrie Food Bank. To put that in context, with the population of the city of Barrie, that represents 5% of people in the city of Barrie who are using the food bank right now, in a supposedly prosperous country, a G7 country like Canada. Of the 7,000 people who are using the food bank in Barrie every month, 37% of them are children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661672"> I spoke earlier about moms who are worried about affordability, about how they are going to put food on the table and about paying their mortgage and keeping a roof over their head. The numbers are an indication of just how difficult it is for families in this country. I know from speaking with representatives from the Innisfil Food Bank that its demand has increased significantly as well and is proportionate to what we have seen not just across this country but also to the city of Barrie.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661673">It is not going to get any better, because mortgages are due for renewal; roughly 900,000 are due for renewal in the next little while in this country. Mortgage rates have increased by about 30% to 40%. That means more and more families are going to continue to be under the cost of living and affordability crisis that is a wound inflicted by the government's economic policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661674">The other aspect is the carbon tax. We have stood here and put forward, what was it, 12, 14, 20 or 24 motions to axe the carbon tax. We are doing it not because of a political ideological advantage; we are doing it because the carbon tax is impacting people in a negative way. It is impacting the cost of the necessities of life. Everyday things people are buying, such as groceries, gas, consumables and other things, are all subject in the cascading effect of the carbon tax through the supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661675">We are hearing about the people who move the food and the goods, and about the increased cost they are seeing as a result of the carbon tax. We are seeing it among municipalities. The member from <Affiliation DbId="278471" Type="2">Belleville</Affiliation> stood up today and talked about $1.5 million in additional costs to the City of Belleville based on the carbon tax alone. It does not get a rebate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661676">I have asked the mayors from the city of Barrie and the town of Innisfil to provide us with the cost to their municipalities of the carbon tax, the impact it is having on heating recreation centres, on putting gas in police cars, putting fuel in fire trucks and heating city buildings. It is significant, and all of those costs end up getting passed down to the consumer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661677">I know the government will say that it gives rebates. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has already shown the difficulty in that argument. Nobody has ever answered this question for me: If I were to take a dollar from somebody, only to give them a dollar back or maybe less, why am I taking that dollar in the first place? It does not make any sense, and it is just costing Canadian families from an affordability standpoint.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661678">The carbon tax is not going to stop. We are at at $80 a tonne right now. The carbon tax, according to the government, is going to go up to $170 a tonne; it is going to more than double. It is going to add 61¢ a litre to the cost of fuel.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8661679">This is a government that, during the election campaign in 2019, said the carbon tax was not going to go past $50 a tonne. The Liberals and their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood there and said that during the campaign. Now we are at $80, on our way to $170 a tonne. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661680">The information that the Liberals provided Canadians at the time, along with the reassurances they gave them, was not the truth. There was concern at that time about the cost of living crisis and the fact that the carbon tax was going to go up. They did not tell Canadians the truth. The truth is that they have gone beyond the $50 a tonne that they said they were going to go to, and it is on its way to $170.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661681"> The necessities of life, groceries, fuel, goods that are shipped, and the cost to our agriculture community are all things that will have a material impact on the cost of goods going forward. They will work their way through the market as a result of the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661682"> The other challenge that is going on right now is the housing crisis. I touched on that a little. Again, we are talking about $400 million in a scandal that went to Liberal-connected insiders and cronies. A lot of that money could have been used to offset the cost of housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661683">Our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> came out with what has been universally called a game-changing plan this week, which is going to see the GST taken off homes. This is among other plans in our building homes and not bureaucracy program. That would have an effect on people. It is going to have a great effect, because that saving is going to be passed on to the people who are buying the homes, the ones who can least afford it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661684"> There is a generation, right now, of young people who do not just feel lied to and let down by the government, but who are actually despondent. Ninety per cent of them are saying they do not have any hope of owning a home. That despondency is a direct result, again, of the economic policies that have been created by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661685">This is one step in a multistep approach that is going to lead to the building of more homes in this country, to working with municipalities and incentivizing them to build more homes. This is not just for the short term, for two or three years, but also for the long term. This is a program that will be instituted to benefit municipalities and homebuilding for a long time to come. That is what we need to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661686"> I am going to wrap up with the fact that this scandal and the standoff that is happening in Parliament can be resolved. These things can be resolved if the Liberals follow the will of Parliament, their constitutional obligation and the constitutional right that we have to compel documents. That was reaffirmed by you, Mr. Speaker. We could then get those documents to the RCMP so that we can truly understand and give them the investigative ability to understand just how deep and rotten the corruption is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661687"> The other thing that $400 million can do is buy subscriptions to the National Enquirer and maybe buy tinfoil hats for Liberal members who are peddling conspiracy theories in this place. They have been doing so over the last month. They know they are part of a government that is failing, that has run out of ideas and whose time is up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661688"> We not only need a carbon tax election in this country, but we also need to get back to some sense of normalcy for the sake of all Canadians. This would be a country where people are not divided, where region is not pitted against region, race against race, faith against faith, with the apparatus of the government being used to divide Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661716">I look at it this way. The majority of Canadians, represented in this place by a majority of parliamentarians, using their power and supremacy as MPs and as Parliament, have compelled the government to provide these documents in an unredacted form to allow for a proper investigation, not necessarily at committee, where things, as I said at the beginning of my speech, go to die.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8661721"> Mr. Speaker, those who are tuning in may be curious as to why we are debating the wasteful spending of $400 million, a funnelling of $400 million of taxpayer money to the companies of Liberal insiders, appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661722">What could we have done? The member for <Affiliation DbId="278574" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation> spoke very eloquently about what could have been done with $400 million of taxpayer money to solve the food and housing crises. As we know, food bank usage has doubled. We know that the carbon tax is a major contributor to food inflation. We know that the food professor, Professor Charlebois, spoke this morning at the industry committee about the impact of these policies on increasing folks' borrowing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661723">It is a terrible thing that we have to be here because the Liberal government is filibustering and hiding from the taxpayer documents that three parties of the House, the majority of members, have demanded to be turned over. It is parliamentary privilege. It is the ultimate parliamentary privilege. The Liberals have come up with lame excuses. They have given up on their charter arguments, which were dismissed after we pointed out that, like any other business, it is a business that the government owns. When we find potential criminal activity, we turn it over to the police. In addition, the police could do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661724">The Liberals have claimed that they are unable to do this. If they could not do it, then why did nine departments turn over unredacted documents? However, the hypocrisy is that 19 have not. The most egregious one is the department of industry, which was responsible for the Liberal green slush fund. It has redacted almost every single document it has sent, and it has many it has yet to send. What is it hiding? We know it is hiding more and more diversions of taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661725"> I will tell members why. The Auditor General only sampled a small portion of the transactions, 226 of 420 transactions in that five-year period. We asked the Auditor General if she would audit all of the 420. Do members know what the Auditor General wrote back? The Auditor General said she did not need to because her sample, under accounting standards, is statistically valid for all 420. That means that over $700 million of the $836 million under that period would have gone to Liberal insiders. There has been no scandal bigger than this in terms of a diversion of taxpayer money to insiders of the government in the history of this country if we are talking about $700 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661726"> These Liberals have no shame. The Liberals are insensitive to the pain of Canadians while over two million people a month are lining up at food banks, a number that is growing every month; while people cannot pay their mortgages and rent; and while we have a carbon tax, which is driving the cost of everything up, that the Liberals intend to quadruple. They care nothing about the pain of Canadians. They care about covering up the funnelling of hundreds of millions of dollars to Liberal insiders' companies while they enrich themselves and Canadians line up in food banks in record numbers. They are having their Marie-Antoinette moment of letting them eat cake. We all know what happened to her. There was also King Charles I, who defied Parliament although Parliament's reign was supreme. Do colleagues know how it was supreme? King Charles I lost his head over the issue of trying to say that the King, who, in this case, is represented by the government, was superior and more important than Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661727">Why is it that the Liberals are doing this when a majority of Canadians, represented by a majority of MPs in the House, have demanded this? Why would the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s personal office, the Privy Council Office, have said to redact the documents and blank them out, contrary to the House, and contrary to the Privacy Act? The Privacy Act says that, if the House wants unredacted documents, it can get them. Why do the Liberals not want to do that? It is because they are covering up for their cronies and their insiders. They are covering up their corruption.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661729">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to continue what I think is an important question. As a proud member of the environment committee, we have undertaken, at the request of the government, a study of the factors that led to the Jasper wildfire that devastated that community, leaving 2,000 people homeless and roughly $1 billion in damages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661730">What this investigation has revealed are staggering levels of negligence or incompetence. I am not sure what is the better word to use here. When I asked, in question period, how much incompetence it takes to get fired from a Liberal cabinet, I did not get a very clear answer, so I wanted to come back for a little bit more clarity on what, in fact, it does take to get fired from the Liberal cabinet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661731"> At the time, the <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> replied, stating that the “government did everything it could to prevent the wildfire.” This is clearly and demonstrably false, but the Liberals simply refuse to take any responsibility, to show any humility for the possibility that maybe they could have done more and that they did not, in fact, do everything they could have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661732"> The reality is that, starting in 2017, the minister of environment at that time, former minister McKenna, began to receive letters from experts warning that Jasper was a tinderbox waiting to explode and it was not a matter of if; it was just simply a question of when. Those individuals who know the region and know the industry pleaded with the Liberal government of the day and were dismissed. The individuals were told “Everything is in hand. Do not worry. We have it. Jasper is going to be fine. Everything is fine.” It reminds me of what is currently happening under the Liberal government: the gift that in a burning room around us everything is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661733"> It was no different in 2017 than it is now. The emails of that time showed discussions that there may have been political perceptions at play regarding whether there would be prescribed burns, which are an important tool that has been used for generations in this country and around the world. However, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>'s department, Parks Canada, only cleared a very small amount. As former prime minister Harper said when talking about the future Liberal government's deficits, it was just the teeny-tiniest amount of a percentage of the acres necessary to ensure that the area around Jasper would be protected. Worse, when the disaster struck, trucks were turned away. Twenty trucks and 50 firefighters were turned away. Worse, they realized after they were turned away that Parks Canada, for some reason, had bought the wrong fitting hookups with the wrong threading on the hydrants in that area that did not align with those in the rest of B.C. and Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661734"> What we have seen through this investigation is simply a failure and a refusal to accept any responsibility or acknowledgement and show any humility that maybe the government of the day did not do enough. My hope is that we might see a bit of a shift in that because the evidence is irrefutable, that the Liberal government did not do everything that it could to prevent this fire. I will ask again: When will the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> be failed for his either negligence or incompetence? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661735"> Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing that we are back here despite the fact that Jasperites have actually pleaded now with Conservative politicians to tone down the political rhetoric on the disaster that claimed 30% of Jasper and the life of 24-year-old firefighter Morgan Kitchen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661736">In committee and here in the House of Commons, the Conservatives have persisted in making this a political issue. I hate to join them, but the fact is that between 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives completely ignored Jasper altogether. The Stephen Harper deficit action reduction plan cut more than $30 million a year from Jasper's wildfire prevention budget. This meant that, from 2010 to 2015, there was almost no mechanical thinning and there were very few prescribed burns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661737">That $30-million annual cut had an impact on 1,600 jobs and left the park worse off. In 2016, when we took power, we provided $42 million to Parks Canada. Since 2019, we have invested over $800 million. This is all incremental money, because the Harper Conservatives did nothing, to improve wildfire management, support provinces and territories and train over 1,000 firefighters. Our support did not stop there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661738">In budget 2021, our government committed $100 million over five years in Parks Canada wildland fire funding to allow critical firefighters conducting risk reduction, preparedness and response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661739">Our ability to control the weather or extreme weather in the face of unprecedented climate change and drying from the effects of burning fossil fuels is not absolute. We can work with various other jurisdictions, and we can do the mechanical thinning and prescribed burns. We can work with indigenous communities, such as the Indigenous Leadership Initiative and the Indigenous Guardians, to conduct some of those prescribed burns. This has a really positive impact, but that has not stopped the Conservatives from amping this up and implying that this was some kind of human error.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661740">That is not what the witnesses at committee have said or what Jasperites have asked for.

              <ParaText id="8661752">The people of Jasper deserve answers. They deserve truth. They do not deserve excuses, diversion and people trying to say that we are being political whereas they are not. That is really frustrating. Any level of negligence in any other institution or job would be reason for firing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661753">This is on track with the current Liberal government. It blames everybody else for every single part. It did nothing. It did not do enough to prevent this fire. It should have done more, and I would love to hear why it did not.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661754">Mr. Speaker, that is a little rich coming from somebody who worked in the government with Stephen Harper, which did absolutely nothing to prevent wildfires or to have mechanical thinning or prescribed burns. That left a long hangover of inaction that our government took action on. If the member wants to talk, we have a committee meeting on Monday. We can talk then. The reality is that our government undertook a mountain pine beetle strategy in 2016. That was months after we got elected. We have invested millions of dollars into that program. We have done the prescribed burns. We have done the thinning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661755">I want the member opposite to stop politicizing a wildfire that was started by lightning. It is absolutely disgusting. Jasperites have asked us very clearly to cut it out. They are trying to rebuild, and people are retraumatizing Jasperites by making this such a political issue. The member should read the article and cut it out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661756">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to rise this evening on behalf of Saskatchewan's small businesses, communities and people against the NDP-Liberal government's greedy carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661757"> Canadians are rightly fed up with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cruel tax. I hear it at each opportunity I have to meet with people as I travel throughout my riding. Their frustrations, despair and desire for a change of government grow day by day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661758">Let us start with the facts. The Liberal carbon tax increased to $80 per tonne on April 1 of this year. If the government has its way, the goal is to quadruple the tax to $170 per tonne by 2030. Let us also be clear: That means the carbon tax will be quadrupled on everything Canadians buy. From gasoline to clothing to fresh produce, the carbon tax is a punishing tax that affects every pocketbook decision a family makes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661759">It is not a matter of a mere 3¢ more per litre of gasoline or whether the federal carbon tax charge is clearly defined on a monthly energy bill. Time and again, the Liberals fail to understand a very simple truth about the carbon tax. When they tax the farmer who grows the food we consume, or any product for that matter, they also tax the trucker who ships those goods. The farmers, the businesses and the truckers have no choice but to pass those added costs on to consumers. The government knows that. That is why families are paying an extra $700 for groceries this year. That is why food bank lines and homeless encampments have become all-too-familiar sights in our towns and cities. It does not even look like Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661760"> The carbon tax is quite literally a tax on everything that only gets more burdensome year after year, all while Canadians struggle to make ends meet in the cost of living crisis. None of my constituents voted for this, and that is not an unrealistic statement at all. Those who voted to elect the Liberals in 2015 were told by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that his carbon tax would max out at $50 per tonne. They were falsely told they would receive more money back through rebates than they paid in taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661761"> Shockingly, they are still being told the same old story by the NDP-Liberals. Those assurances have been completely thrown out the window. The stories of desperation we hear from our constituents do not align with what the government says, and neither do the hard numbers. It came as no surprise to the House when the Parliamentary Budget Officer released an updated carbon tax report that shows most Canadian families are worse off as a result of the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661762"> In my province of Saskatchewan, by 2030, the average family will have to pay $894 more in carbon taxes than they get back in rebates. It is in the numbers. That is second only to Ontario families, who will have to pay $903 more. Canadians will not only have $1,000 less in their pockets to provide for their families, but the carbon tax scheme will shrink our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661763"> The PBO estimates that by the start of the next decade, the Liberal fuel charge will increase the federal deficit by $4 billion as a result of decreased employment and investment income. This aligns with the NDP-Liberal government's own data, which it shamefully tried to hide from Canadians. The Liberals know the carbon tax will cost the Canadian economy $30.5 billion per year by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661764"> This is only further proof of what Conservatives have been saying since the inception of the carbon tax. It is nothing more than an expensive scam. It is not an environmental plan. It is a tax plan. What an insult to the people of this country, and particularly the people of Saskatchewan. My province is known globally for its environmental stewardship and innovation. We are proud of what we do and we will continue to do it without a carbon tax on our heads.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8661765"> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to start. First of all, my father used to live in Saskatchewan. I like it very much there, but I think it is a bit rich to suggest that it is world-famous for its environmental stewardship, when the vast majority of its electricity is generated with coal. It is not 1905; we can do a lot better than burning coal to create electricity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661766">Manitoba is right next door to Saskatchewan, and it has an 85% clean grid. Ontario also has a relatively clean grid, almost 80% I think, and Quebec's is close to Manitoba's. Manitoba actually has the cleanest grid in the world. I love Saskatchewan. I have spent a lot of time in Regina. I love it there, but its grid is not clean; it is filthy. Coal is a terrible way to generate electricity, and Premier Moe, who was recently re-elected, boasts about it all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661767">I am not surprised that I am standing here with the member, as she blames absolutely all of Canada's challenges on carbon pricing. Yesterday the Conservative leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, who has been in the House for over 20 years, continually referred to the inflation rate of food in Canada as 36% higher than it is in the United States. That is factually incorrect. It is actually closer to the opposite; food inflation in the United States is higher than it is in Canada, and that is in the absence of a national price on pollution, or carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661768">Canada has a federal price on pollution and a backstop program, which Saskatchewan utilizes, because as Premier Moe pointed out, he looked at other options but they are all too expensive so he decided to go with the federal backstop program. It is really important to recognize that when we look at the entire country, we do have a federal price on carbon. It is efficient, sends more money back to eight out of 10 families, is lowering our emissions and, since our food inflation is lower than in the United States, is not having an impact on food inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661769">Food is too expensive in Canada; we know that, but we need real solutions. We also know that axing the taxes is not going to do it. I spoke to Sylvain Charlebois about it today. I asked him clearly, “Will axing the tax lower food prices at grocery stores?” The answer is no. There are jurisdictions with higher food inflation that have no price on pollution. It is simply not the case; food is not taxed in Canada, and carbon pricing does not have a material impact on food inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661770">One last thing is that the member said that nobody in her riding in Saskatchewan voted for carbon pricing. That is also incorrect, because she ran in the last federal election under Erin O'Toole, who had an environmental plan. He was a good progressive Conservative, something that the far-right Conservatives have completely abandoned. They will not even acknowledge that human activity and burning fossil fuels have a demonstrable impact on climate change, our warming planet, extreme weather and all of the challenges that we are facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661771">The number one cause of food inflation around the world is climate change. If we do not want to fight climate change, then we are basically going to give up. The Conservatives want to give up, throw their hands in the air and say that climate change is not human-caused; it is in the Almighty's hands, and they are not going to bother trying to lower our emissions. Instead they are going to keep burning coal to generate electricity, and they are not going to apologize for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661772">The Conservatives are not going to be accountable for their actions, and they are also not to acknowledge that, in the last federal election, the member ran under the leadership of Erin O'Toole, who had a program to price pollution. We all remember it, because it was billed as “The more you burn, the more you earn.” It was sort of like a catalogue of green products that people could purchase with their points, and people got more points if they burned more fossil fuels. It was widely regarded by environmental NGOs and researchers as ineffective and not a good way to implement carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661773"> However, the guy who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for carbon pricing, William Nordhaus, says that our plan is getting it right. We are lowering our emissions, fighting climate change and fighting for affordability. The Conservatives cannot get past their three-word slogans.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661774"> Mr. Speaker, my province is known globally for its environmental stewardship and innovation, and we made a difference at the last COP convention. Much of our stewardship and innovation was practised and perfected long before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took power or before carbon tax was even on the table. We are consistently ahead of the curve and have made the investments and sacrifices to show for it. We will continue, but the carbon tax is not required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661775">Middle-class Canadians are losing ground, and people wishing to join the middle class have no confidence that the NDP-Liberal coalition will ever get them there. It is no wonder the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s numbers have plummeted, but it is not that simple; every single member of the Liberal party and of every other party in the House but ours is complicit in the despair we see across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661776">It is time for the NDP to accept responsibility for its hand in the carbon tax catastrophe, and it is time to allow Canadians to vote in the carbon tax election so they can select a common-sense Conservative government that will axe the tax once and for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8661777">Mr. Speaker, for my rebuttal, I am just going to read from Trevor Herriot. He is a Regina-based writer, naturalist and grassland advocate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661778">He wrote, “As representatives from around the world were starting to gather in Montreal at COP15 to work toward an agreement to stave off biodiversity collapse, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe decided it was a good time to say a few things about his province’s environmental sustainability and stewardship.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661779"> I suppose that is the record that the member is referring to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661780">Herriot continued: “No matter that Saskatchewan was ranked dead last in the environmental report cards handed out to the provinces by the Conference Board of Canada. According to Premier Moe and the new website he launched, 'Saskatchewan has some of the highest-quality and sustainably produced food, fuel and fertilizer, that a growing world needs.'”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661781"> That could be true, but it has nothing to do with the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661782">Herriot continued: “A quick glance at the website, filled with images of hard-working people out on the land, reveals a set of measurements carefully curated to show that 'in the areas of sustainable resources, environmental stewardship, community support and clean energy Saskatchewan is rising to the challenge.'”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661783">However, when we looked at the numbers and applied some of the international standards, we realized that Saskatchewan is not doing anything on endangered species protection. It is not doing enough on protected and conserved areas. It is still burning coal to generate electricity. It is not doing enough to protect the wetlands and its grasslands, and it is not doing anything on climate action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8661784">As such, I am sorry that the experts disagree. The Saskatchewan government is not an environmental steward. </ParaText>
