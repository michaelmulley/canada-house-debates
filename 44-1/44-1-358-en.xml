              <ParaText id="8643376">Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the Bloc Québécois will be presenting a dissenting opinion. More importantly, I want Quebeckers to know that all of the recommendations in this report are aimed exclusively at supporting the economic development of English-speaking Quebec. That is really unfair and appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643377">We know that the English-speaking community is growing and developing and that it is highly favoured. For French-speaking Quebeckers, who are in the majority in their own state but in the minority in Canada, there is nothing, no offer of support. Despite the new elements that we managed to include in the new federal language law for Quebec and for all official languages support programs, there are only measures to strengthen the anglophone community. Let us remember that these measures are funded in part by the federal taxes that Quebeckers send to Ottawa every year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643378">The recommendations were all approved by the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP, which shows that only the Bloc Québécois is defending French in Quebec and that the only real way to protect our national language going forward is for Quebec to become independent.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643384">Mr. Speaker, I move that the 12th report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, presented on Wednesday, June 19, be concurred in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643385">I am rising today to speak to a subject that is at the very heart of our society, and that is safe sport in Canada. Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a broken system that has been allowed to deteriorate over the past three decades.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643386">This debate was launched by the motion I introduced here in the House of Commons about Hockey Canada's actions as part of a reported cover-up of an alleged gang rape by players on the Canadian hockey team in 2018, which was brought to light by an article penned by journalist Rick Westhead. I wanted to start a dialogue on the importance of safety in sports by encouraging us to listen to athletes' experiences with a view to keeping them safer and enhancing their well-being. Numerous experts have shined a light on the systemic problems, and I felt it was important to examine these issues at a higher level. I have led the charge on this, focusing on the need for a review as part of an independent public inquiry, which strikes me as the only solution. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643387">Despite two years of study at the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, despite the open letters, from gymnasts in particular, despite testimony from many athletes in over 16 sports, including water polo, swimming, soccer, kayaking, rowing, sailing, track and field, curling, fencing, speed skating, figure skating and boxing, and testimony from Canadian Hockey League players who were sexually abused, not to mention articles written by journalists like Rick Westhead, we have seen inaction and lip service, but little in the way of concrete results on the part of this government. The government's do-nothing approach in the face of these issues is alarming, and I am here to draw attention to the situation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643388">Recommendation 20 in the report calls for the launching of an independent public inquiry. We must get to the bottom of this. An independent public inquiry is still and definitely needed to delve deeply into the systemic problems affecting Canadian sports. We must understand these abuses and shortcomings that have arisen and persisted for such a long time. The inquiry's scope must not be limited to individual cases, but rather extend to the governance structures that have allowed these deficiencies to arise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643389">It is essential that athletes, coaches and all other people involved in sports be free to testify without fear of reprisals, including financial ones. Such an approach is needed to restore trust and ensure that concrete measures are put in place to protect those who dedicate their lives to sport in pursuit of their passion. Ignoring the call for an inquiry remains a serious mistake and encourages continued indifference toward problems that deeply affect our society. I would remind members that the launching of an independent public inquiry was favoured by over 95% of witnesses, including the Canadian Olympic Committee and the organization Own The Podium, which spoke out in favour of such an inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643390">I would like to raise an important point about the future of sport in Canada commission, much trumpeted by the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport and Physical Activity</Affiliation>. I want to make it clear that this voluntary commission is merely an advisory body, with no real authority to make significant changes. We must not be misled by the minister's empty words on this small-minded initiative. Instead of taking concrete measures to fix the pressing problems facing us, the government seems content to pursue this sham voluntary consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643391">What is more, the fact that the minister has announced that she will not be seeking re-election sends a troubling signal. This decision simply reinforces the idea that her commitment to sports was merely a means of playing out the clock, with no genuine desire to resolve the issues we are concerned about. If the government truly wishes to advance sports in Canada, it must stop hiding behind hollow speeches and take bold decisions. We need strong leadership and concrete initiatives, not some phony commitment. It is as though the minister had been installed to protect her own system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643392">It is also important to recall that the minister had the power to better align, through legislative means, safety issues in sports with questions of justice, coercion and grooming of athletes. Instead, for a year and a half we have had radio silence, and that is troubling. It is imperative that we discontinue mediation in cases where the events in question amount to criminal abuse. The safety of our athletes, especially child athletes, must trump any other consideration. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643393">We must reinforce the message that it is essential to report these instances of abuse to law enforcement. Sports must be a safe space for all, and abusive behaviour must not be trivialized or concealed. Victims must feel supported when they report this behaviour, rather than being forced into silence by procedures that leave them vulnerable. It is incumbent upon the government to protect children in sports, and that starts with tangible, legislative action that reflects a genuine commitment to their safety. Ignoring these issues is not just negligence, but a danger to our collective future—hence the urgent need for a truly independent public inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643394">It is alarming that when cases of abuse were reported to Sport Canada, departmental officials did nothing for years. There was no follow-up or investigation within the community. That is unacceptable. This lack of an active response not only exposes the victims to situations of ongoing vulnerability, but it also sends a horrible message on the culture of impunity that seems to be prevalent in sports. That message is all the more troubling because we discovered, thanks to the study by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, whose report we are debating today, that certain national sports bodies accessed funds to cover up cases of abuse. This practice raises serious ethical concerns, as was shown by Hockey Canada and Soccer Canada. This behaviour reinforces the perception that these organizations are more concerned about their image than about the safety of their athletes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643395">We also learned that they had shelved reports commissioned by independent third parties, reports that pointed to safety and abuse problems. When something is not in their interest, they put it on a shelf to gather dust. How can we hope for true societal change if this information is ignored and set aside? There is no mechanism for monitoring this practice, opening the door to a culture of silence in national sports bodies. This has to stop. We need total transparency and clear accountability mechanisms to ensure that all instances of abuse are not just reported, but treated with the seriousness they deserve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643396">In the face of these serious deficiencies, we called on the Auditor General of Canada to familiarize herself with the file and conduct an in-depth examination of Canadian sport policy. This is essential if we are to ensure that the systemic problems facing us are brought to light and treated appropriately. An independent analysis will not only assess the effectiveness of existing measures, but will also make concrete recommendations on how to enhance safety and integrity in the sports world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643397">It is high time that we take these issues seriously and act on a factual basis. The investigation by the Auditor General, as called for in recommendations 3 and 7 of this report, can also be leveraged to encourage the government to adopt necessary reforms and implement rigorous monitoring mechanisms. We need truth, not half measures. Public trust in our sport organizations depends on our ability to confront these realities head-on and to commit to building a better future for our athletes and our young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643398">The <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport and Physical Activity</Affiliation> played a key role in designing Canada's sports system. She must have the courage and humility to recognize her serious mistakes and commit to making the necessary corrections so that, one day, we will not have to confront the need to remedy these injustices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643399">How can the former chair of the board of directors of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, or CCES, be objective? Could this be a way of sweeping under the rug the problems in the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner, or OSIC?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643400">How can the former adviser to the director general of Sport Canada deliver reforms on measures that she herself put in place? How can she justify all those trips around the world she took on the taxpayer's dime, at a time when the sports system was in such bad shape?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643401"> How was the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport and Physical Activity</Affiliation> able to award an untendered contract for CCES to take over the OSIC without any prior analysis? She is the architect and guardian of what has gone wrong in sports for some 20 years and of this culture of silence that protects the perpetrators rather than the victims. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643402">I would also like to address the financial challenges and problems of access and inclusion in the sports community. The government promised investments, but where did this money really go? Budget cuts to sports programs, both provincially and nationally, had devastating consequences. Amateur sports clubs, schools and sports associations are on the front lines of this crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643403">There are also glaring regional inequalities. While large cities get new infrastructure, rural communities like those in Abitibi—Témiscamingue are still fighting for basic facilities. Young people in these regions are being left behind and are denied access to potentially transformational sports. To ignore these inequalities is to sacrifice the future of our young people and maintain the inequalities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643404">Let us talk now about access and inclusion. Sports should be a universal right, but in reality it is a privilege for only some. Registration fees, equipment costs and travel expenses for athletes and their families are barriers that many cannot overcome. While the government talks about inclusion, youth from underprivileged communities are left watching from the sidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643405">Moreover, minorities and persons with disabilities are often invisible in our sports programming. We hear the talk about equity, but the figures speak for themselves. Very few actual initiatives have been put in place to ensure that everyone gets to play. The government's indifference to these issues is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643406">An article in La Presse is timely. I presented the case of Témiscamingue to the office of the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport and Physical Activity</Affiliation>. People do not have access to a swimming pool within a 100-kilometre radius, and government programs are not adapted to the reality of remote communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643407">Let us turn now to governance. Sports federations must be models of transparency and integrity, but that is not the case. In the study carried out after my motion was adopted, we saw harassment and mistreatment scandals within these organizations, and we learned that the government took no concrete measures. It is high time to demand accountability. Media pressure and public indignation have done more to change the system than the minister herself has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643408">The performance-at-all-costs culture cannot justify the sacrifice of athletes' well-being. The government's lofty words are no longer enough. We need concrete action to reform the system and to ensure a safe, respectful environment for our athletes. Failure to act now will open the door to further abuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643409">Besides, should sports in Canada not fall under Health Canada, which aims to promote healthy living, rather than Canadian Heritage?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643410">How to justify the presence of coaches with active criminal records at the Paris Olympics and the Coaching Association of Canada's failure to react? How to explain the drone scandal, the only scandal at the Paris Olympics? This sowed doubt among some athletes, who had to bear the brunt of complaints from the other teams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643411">How to explain the fact that Own the Podium still imposes its choice of coach for Canada's women's soccer team? What about the cost overruns of the Canadian competitions for FIFA 2026? This will be a scandal for Canada. How much has the federal government spent to ensure security for these events? The Liberal government will not even be there to defend itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643412">Can the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport and Physical Activity</Affiliation> rise and tell us that all of the national sports organizations will make changes to the membership of their board of directors and meet the criteria for receiving support from Sport Canada as announced in May 2023? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643413">Can the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity assure us that Soccer Canada and Hockey Canada have no confidentiality agreements concerning reports of abuse, mistreatment or toxic environments? What is the situation within Gymnastics Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643414">Do all our national sports organizations have a firm serving as an independent third party, which was itself at the centre of the abuse and cover-ups? Can the minister explain what kind of scrutiny she has exercised over the wrongdoing, abuse and complaints from athletes who make their way through the sport system along with the judicial system? How many misdeeds have not been reported to the police?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643415">Fortunately, today, outside the realm of Sport Canada and this minister, sport is often seen as a matter of national pride, and far less in terms of health and wellness. I need to point that out. We celebrate our athletes' success on the world stage, but we should not ignore the real problems in the sports community. Athletes should not be seen as mere commodities, as tools to enhance our image and boost national pride. This utilitarian vision exposes our youth to all sorts of abuse, whether physical, psychological, emotional or financial.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643416">By prioritizing performance over well-being, we are creating an environment conducive to abuse, where victims' voices are silenced, and where athletes' physical and mental health are often sacrificed on the altar of victory.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643417">Athletes, especially the young and vulnerable, should feel supported and protected, yet their value is reduced to the medals and trophies they can win for us. We are neglecting the true benefits of sport, namely, personal development, team spirit, sportsmanship, the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits and pushing one's limits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643418">We need to shift our discourse when it comes to sports. Instead of focusing solely on performance, we need to promote sport as a vector for health, inclusion and personal development. That is how we will protect our athletes and offer them a secure and fulfilling future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643419">Lastly, it is imperative that we reform the governance of our sports federations. We need to implement mechanisms for transparency and accountability. These are not promises, but systemic changes needed to restore the trust of our athletes and our constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643420">Also, who in our sports organizations are legally and ethically responsible for ensuring athletes' safety and wellness? This fundamental question has yet to be answered and deserves urgent attention. Sports federations, clubs and the government have a role to play in protecting those who dedicate their life to pursuing their passion. It is high time we took a look at the reasons why we keep avoiding this crucial subject. Having the courage to look back at the past 20 years of wilful blindness is a necessary step in understanding how we got here, which is why we need an independent public inquiry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643421">We need to acknowledge that, in Canada, the government does not take its responsibilities seriously. It is unacceptable that there could have been abuse without concrete measures being taken to prevent it. Our laws and policies must be adapted to establish clear standards on safety and well-being. Organizations must be held accountable for their actions, as well as for their failure to act. We need to commit to change. As long as we continue to turn a blind eye, we will imperil the future of our sports and the safety of our athletes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643422">We also need to encourage private companies to invest in community sports, but never to the detriment of ethics. Sponsors should have no influence over the decisions made by sports federations or clubs. We need a clear regulatory framework to make sure that sporting values such as fairness remain paramount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643423">Lastly, it is imperative that we reform the governance of our sports federations. We need to put mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability. These are not promises, but systemic changes needed to restore the trust of our athletes and fellow citizens. This includes the creation of independent ethics committees to investigate complaints and scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643424">In conclusion, we cannot remain passive in the face of these problems. Indifference is not an option. The government's rhetoric is no longer sufficient. We need concrete measures, commitment and determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643425">Change is possible, but it depends on our collective will to question the status quo. I encourage my colleagues to act, to take a stand and to ensure that every young person, regardless of their position, has an opportunity to dream, play and fulfill their potential through sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643426"> I would like to conclude by thanking the key players in this study, which, I would point out, took almost two years. I would like to thank Jessica, Kim, Rob, Kristin, Amélia, Ryan, Kelly, Randy, Whitney, professors Ross and McFarlane, Judge Aquilina, Judge Cromwell, Melanie, Sylvain, Janine, Quinn, Sophie, Christine, Andrea, Kiara, Myriam, the members of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, the members of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and the former minister of sport, now the <Affiliation DbId="300004" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation>. As a point of interest, on May 11, she herself, as Minister of Sport, on behalf of the federal government, undertook to conduct an independent public inquiry into sport.

I would also like to thank some of my parliamentary colleagues. Exceptionally, I will cite their first names: Andréanne, Kirsty, Peter, the members of the Conservative party, including their critic Richard, and the Liberals, in particular Adam.

It has been a failure since day one. The government is clearly trying to support Sport Canada, which has never done its job; it never checks in with the 62 national sport organizations. That was evident with the sexual assault charge against Hockey Canada in London, Ontario in 2018. Then the government added the OSIC. That is another layer of bureaucracy that is now doing the work that Sport Canada should have been doing all along.</ParaText>

It is not up to Sport Canada to conduct a review of Sport Canada. There needs to be a public, independent inquiry. We need an independent judge to make recommendations, someone who can call for the production of documents, much like the House is calling for documents. That is how we found out that there are funds within the funds, that there is wrongdoing, that there are people who are protecting themselves and hiding, and that there are corrupt boards of directors.</ParaText>

I have been an athlete my whole life, although, when I was a young boy, I did not believe in myself. I did not think that I could become an athlete. The great coaches at the Burloak Canoe Club gave me the skills and the confidence necessary to achieve my dreams in athletics. Thanks to them, I am able to stand in the House.

I was first asked to work on the safe sport issue by the then minister of sport, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278313" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>. That was back in 2017, a year after I retired from the national kayak team after 18 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643464"> I am very proud to have joined a woman whom we celebrated last night at the Order of Sport awards, Dr. Guylaine Demers. She is a researcher, an advocate, an athlete, a coach and a professor at Laval in Quebec. Dr. Demers has empowered generations of students, coaches, athletes, administrators and people like me to make sports a safer, more equitable and more welcoming place. She is a former high-performance basketball player and coach, and she has become a driving force for gender equity and safety in sport, right across Canada and around the world. She typically works as a volunteer. She was the chair of the gender equity task force for the then minister of sport when I joined in 2017. She is currently the president of Égale Action, Quebec's association for the advancement of women in sport, and she is an active member of the Canadian Olympic committee's Sport Inclusion Task Force. Last night, very deservedly, she was inducted into the Order of Sport, Canada's only sports hall of fame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643465">I would also like to take a moment to thank every single witness for their brave testimony at the heritage committee over this very challenging period of time; some old wounds were reopened, and some very important conversations were had. I know it was challenging for a lot of people, including members of Parliament who joined those committees. On behalf of the government and the sport movement here in Canada, I would like to offer our deep thanks to every single witness; the witnesses were brave in coming forward and courageous in giving testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643466">This past summer, Canadians from coast to coast to coast tuned in to cheer on team Canada at the Paris Olympic and Paralympic games in Paris. They cheered on athletes such as Nicholas Bennett, also there last night at the Order of Sport awards, who made history by securing Canada's first gold medal of the games, then followed it up with another gold and a silver medal; Brent Lakatos, with his incredible speed on the tracks, who secured multiple podium finishes; and Aurélie Rivard, who continues to make a big splash and secured three medals at the Paralympic Games.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643467">Team Canada athletes are the pride of their communities. When Canadians come together to celebrate their hometown heroes, we see a testament to the unifying power of sport. These athletes show us what is possible and inspire the next generation of Olympic and Paralympic heroes. It is not just that; rather, when athletes come home with medals, we also see a rise in the registrations at clubs right across the country. It is an inspiring thing to watch Canadians perform on the world stage. I can speak from experience. Down at the Burloak Canoe Club, whenever we had success at the Olympics, registration was always through the roof in September.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643468">These moments of triumph and perseverance unite us as a country. While Conservatives seek to divide us and destroy the institutions that support Canadians, Canadians of all political stripes unite to cheer team Canada on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643469">However, more than being just a unifying force, sport must be grounded in human rights. This means making sure that everyone, regardless of ability, gender, identity or background, has the same access to safe and welcoming sport experiences. Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere across the country or around the world. Back in 2006-07, I started working in sport development with organizations such as Right To Play. It uses sport to unify people and to rebuild after countries and communities have been affected by war, poverty and disease. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643470">Our challenges here in Canada are different, but they are important to address. I would like to single out some organizations, such as Spirit North, which brings sport to first nations communities, primarily in western Canada. I am proud that our community sport initiative has helped to fund some of that great work. I would give Beckie Scott, a former Olympic champion in cross-country skiing, a shout-out. She is the founder of that organization, which brings sport to many kids, and they enjoy it very much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643471">Back in 2022, Canadians were shocked and dismayed to hear revelations of alleged sexual assaults by members of the 2017-18 world junior hockey team.

              <ParaText id="8643473">Those systems and those abuses of power resulted from a lack of accountability, from a culture of silence and, too often, from a desire to win at all costs. The reckoning that we now see in hockey and across the sport system is the result of brave survivors coming forward to share their lived experiences. It takes a lot of strength to stand up and share those horrifying experiences. Once again, I thank them for their courage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643474">Because of that courage, we can learn. We can better protect children. We can work to improve Canada's sport systems. We can believe them. We are listening to them every single day, and we are supporting long-term, meaningful changes that make our sport system safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643475">Many stories were shared at the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage or at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. I thank the members of both committees for their work in terms of all the recommendations that they have made. We support these reports. Indeed, the government has already acted on the majority of the recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643476"> We are standing with survivors to implement long-term, meaningful changes to improve governance, enhance accountability, increase transparency and apply funding. This is a really important thing. We cannot expect a system to develop and implement new practices and policies without properly funding those organizations. We are demanding increased transparency and, ultimately, delivering a safer sport system for all Canadians. We have made remarkable progress over the last six or seven years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643477">I would like to take a moment now to highlight some of these actions. Most recently, in June 2022, the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada launched its abuse-free sport program. This program prevents and addresses maltreatment in sport by offering a wide range of resources, mental health supports and services for sport participants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643478">Since April 2023, our government has required all federally funded sport organizations to be signatories of the abuse-free sport program, including services of the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner. This flies in direct contravention to what my friend and colleague from the Bloc Québécois has said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643479"> It is not optional. This is a mandatory system. This is obligatory for all national sport organizations that receive federal funding. The commissioner administers the Universal Code of Conduct to Prevent and Address Maltreatment in Sport, or UCCMS. They oversee a complaint management process. They regularly commission independent investigations. They maintain a registry of sanctions, and they monitor compliance of sport organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643480">Once again, I would like to say that this is mandatory, obligatory for all national sport organizations. This has been a process of learning and implementing a brand new system. This institution has integrity, funding and the resources necessary to implement these new policies, and they are working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643481">If sport organizations do not participate, they simply do not get federal funding. That is how it works. It is as simple as that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643482">Just now, the Conservatives recommend that we burn it all down, that we weaken and destroy institutions and systems that are currently protecting athletes. I was a part of that sport system for two decades. There were times when I found it frustrating, when I wrote letters to Sport Canada and to my member of Parliament. To be honest, I did not see progress for decades. I did not see progress when I wrote to my member of Parliament in 1999, when I was 17 and had problems with the selections committee, or in 2008.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643483">Recently, because we have athletes in the government and in other parties who know the sport system and want to collaborate with athletes from across the country, we have made tremendous progress. I am not the only one saying that. Dr. Guylaine Demers has been doing this work for 25 years. Last night, she was directly asked what she has seen. Her response was that we must keep going, but we have seen remarkable progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643484">When we see headlines about athletes being protected by a system that now has integrity, strength and resources, the progress is something to acknowledge and, at times, even celebrate. Again, the Conservatives want to burn it all down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643485">Through these funding agreements, we have also prohibited national sport organizations from restricting the rights of athletes and sport participants under the UCCMS. We also prohibit any contract, policy, procedure or action from restricting athletes under this code of conduct. This is a new code of conduct. It has been developed. It is rigorous. It is world class. Other countries are following suit. That is good because a lot of these athletes compete internationally and train internationally. It is important for us to ensure that this system is adopted by other countries, particularly peer nations with similar challenges.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643486">The process is a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that athletes can no longer be muzzled by non-disclosure agreements. This is essential. Every athlete needs to sign an agreement when they get funding from their national sport organization or through Sport Canada. I will be honest that in the past, as a two-decade national team athlete, sometimes it seemed a bit burdensome. Sometimes it seemed as though we were being told what we could and could not say, and that is over. I am very proud of the government for taking action on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643487">Last March we also launched the abuse-free sport registry. It provides a searchable database of participants subject to the UCCMS whose eligibility to participate in sport or to coach has in some way been restricted due to provisional measures and sanctions. It is a tool for athletes, parents and organizations to make informed and safe sport choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643488">Looking to longer-term solutions, last spring we launched the Future of Sport in Canada Commission. Through a trauma-informed approach, this independent commission is seeking to learn from the experiences of victims, survivors, experts, academics, parents and coaches. The process will bring these experiences to light. It will help identify the causes and impacts and will help determine how to move and how to improve the sport system in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643489"> I can say right now that it will not be by burning it all down and applying some cowboy approach to the sport system in Canada. We know that is what the Conservatives want to do with broadcasting by burning down the CBC and selling it off for parts. We know that they are against the Public Health Agency of Canada. We know that they, just like Doug Ford, want to burn down institutions, resulting in weakening Canada and making it poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643490"> That is not what we are going to do. We are going to keep trying to strengthen our institutions. We are going to ensure that there is more rigour in the system. We are going to properly fund our institutions and we are going to make sure they have the resources, because if nothing is measured, then nothing will be managed. That is what the Conservatives do not understand: If we do not measure something, we cannot manage something. Therefore we are measuring the challenges, applying resources and putting in place leadership and expertise to confront the challenges head-on; we are not ignoring them, which seems to be what the Conservatives want to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643491">I want to clarify briefly our decision to launch a commission rather than a public inquiry. Our government spoke to survivors, athlete groups, external experts, the Canadian Women's Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, among many other experts. We looked at other commissions in Canada and around the world, and at other public inquiries, to inform the structure this one would take on. We chose the commission because it prioritizes the voices of survivors to improve safe sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643492">A public inquiry would have retraumatized victims by requiring testimony under oath or by subjecting them to subpoenas and cross-examination. That is not productive. It is not helpful, not trauma-informed and not the type of progress we need. We will not force people to relive their trauma. We believe survivors. We do not need to question them or call into question their integrity. We want to make the system better; we do not want to reopen old wounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643493"> Given that sport is a shared jurisdiction between municipal, regional, territorial and provincial governments and jurisdictions, a public inquiry would have required months of negotiating with provinces. I have been to a couple of FPT meetings, and they can be really, really challenging to develop consensus in. Canada is a great country, but we have a lot of various jurisdictions and sometimes it is challenging to get everybody at the table at the same time agreeing on one thing; therefore we would probably still be waiting for it to start, but with the commission, the work is already under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643494">With that in mind, I encourage anyone with experience in sport who wishes to participate in the commission to do so. It is currently open to input. We want to hear from people. We want to make the system better and we know they do too. We know that Canadians love sport, physical activity and recreation. This is not a partisan issue; it is about building the Canada we love and about making sure that sport, physical activity and recreation are available to anybody who wants to participate. We want an open-door policy and we want to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to engage with the commission.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643495">Despite all these efforts, we know that there is still more work to be done. Like a country, a sport system is never complete. We have to lay bricks every single day to ensure that our sport system improves, encourages people to get involved and is as safe as possible. This past summer, the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> launched the ministerial athlete advisory committee to put athletes at the heart of decision-making about sport, and I could not be more proud of this effort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643496">The <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is also establishing an international integrity work group to promote a unified approach to sport integrity globally, including safe sport, because, like I said, sport is an international concern. Coaches are coming in from other countries. Our coaches are going to work in other countries. Our athletes are going to compete in other places and train elsewhere, and we want to make sure that the global community is following suit.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643497">Our government is in the process of developing a sport integrity framework; through these efforts, we are working with sport organizations and also holding them accountable. I would like to reiterate that none of these things are optional whatsoever, as my friend and colleague from the Bloc pointed out; they are mandatory and obligatory. They are challenging. The system has rigour. Organizations have to do training and adopt new policies. They have to ask all of their coaches, participants, umpires and every single volunteer to do that training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643498">I will give an example. This past summer, I competed at the national canoe kayak championships. I was on the national team for 18 years. I could not get into the boat until I had done a 15-minute survey online. I sat down in a chair and did the survey. I learned some stuff. I completed the training and submitted it with my signature, and then I was allowed to compete at the national championships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643499">It was my 25th national championships, but because of the new rigorous measures, every single participant needs to be accountable. They have to demonstrate that they have the interest and the willingness to learn. I have been participating in sport my whole life, and I learned something through that process. I am proud of that work. I showed my coach my phone afterward and said it is really cool that I have been working on safe sports since 2017, and I am really glad the survey exists for every single person, the 2,000 participants at the national championships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643500"> I was just going to paddle a war canoe with a couple of 17-year-olds from my club. I had a great summer, and it was great to see that everybody has to do the training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643501">We are putting our money where our mouth is through budget 2024, which, I will say as a casual observer of budgets for the last 25 years in Canada, is the most sport-forward budget I have ever seen. I am proud of that. The federal government recently committed $16 million to prevent and address maltreatment, support people with concussions and mental health challenges and advance inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility in sport. We have made specific investments in athlete mental health that did not previously exist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643502">I will be a bit vulnerable here. When I retired from the national team in 2016, we did not have a mental health package. I did not have benefits, so I had to go to an external agency to get a counsellor and sit down to talk about some of my challenges and problems. Athletes do not have to do that anymore; there is funding for them. There are applied funding and investments in athlete mental health. They can go to Game Plan, work with their safe sport advisers or work directly with their national sport organization or outside their national sport organization. It is up to them, and it is so much better than it used to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643503">We have also made investments in athlete well-being. We have invested in the sport institutions right across the country. I am very proud to have one in Milton, the national cycling centre at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. It is fantastic. Our track cyclists are amazing. Kelsey Mitchell is an Olympic champion, and another young guy just won a medal at the world championships. I am so proud of our investments, whether they come from big games like the Pan Am Games or the 2010 Olympics, or from the community sport initiative that I am going to talk about in a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643504">We also did something that athletes have been demanding since 1999. The current government has done it twice. I want to acknowledge that we increased the athlete assistance program. Many people ask me, almost as a weekly thing, whether we fund our athletes and whether we support our athletes enough from a financial perspective. I am proud to say that we have given them a more than 20% raise in the current budget. In 2017 we gave them the largest-ever raise they had received up until that date, and recently we have done it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643505">Athletes still do not make enough money in Canada. I still do not think that Olympians and Paralympians are properly funded, and I am going to continue to make sure we fund them even more, but we have basically paid for grocery money every single month, and they will be getting that money in short order; it is with the Treasury Board. I am really proud of the athlete assistance program boost. Every national team athlete is asking me in my DMs when it is coming, and it will be there soon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643506">The Community Sport for All initiative is a hallmark of the government's action on making sure that sport is inclusive, available, equitable and safe for everybody across Canada. It has ensured that over a million Canadians have gotten more active through the power of sport, physical activity and recreation over the last couple of years. I am extremely proud of the Community Sport for All initiative, reinvested in budget 2024 with an incremental $15 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643507">We are making the investments and it is making an impact. Canadians are healthier and our communities are more connected. They have better mental health services. Whether someone is playing in the sandbox or playing beach volleyball at the Olympic Games, team Canada is supporting our athletes. Unlike the Conservatives, we refuse to let Canadians go it alone. The Conservatives want to burn down our institutions. They want everyone just to be a cowboy and figure it out on their own, but our Liberal approach is to invest in the things that make our community stronger, like sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643508">Our approach is to work to strengthen our institutions that serve Canadians instead of tearing them all down. Our approach is to invest in the things that support strong communities, like affordable child care, dental care and local community sport programs, and to invest in the things that unite us, such our athletes. Our approach is about making sure that everyone, regardless of ability, gender or identity has the same access to safe and welcoming sport activities, and our government's quick action to create a safe sport experience for all Canadians makes me proud to stand on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643509">By investing in sport and athletes and by building a safer sport system, we are making Canadians safer, stronger, healthier and more united.</ParaText>

We have invested an incremental $75 million through the community sport for all initiative in a safe, equitable and accessible manner.

              <ParaText id="8643534"> Mr. Speaker, it is a personal ambition of mine. It is a professional obsession, in fact. I love sport. I love community sport, high-performance sport and international sport, summer, winter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643535"> Yesterday, I was the keynote speaker at the Ottawa Special Olympics Festival Breakfast and I had a great time. The athletes there were amazing, as always. They were articulate, kind and generous. They wore their medals. The Ottawa police and the Ottawa fire were there. My message to everybody was about participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643536">Participation is key. Whether it is in democracy or in sport, we have to stand up for each other and ensure we show up, whether it is to hand out medals or to do a little talk, to coach or to hand out sliced oranges. Whatever it is, sport requires participation. It makes our communities healthier and more active.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643537"> The survey that my friend and colleague pointed to was a great step forward for Canada. It is an educational tool. It is another layer of accountability to ensure that people are undertaking those reminders on a regular basis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643538">Despite having worked on the policy and having contributed, I still learned something from that survey, and that is remarkable. I am so proud of the work we have done. I am proud that it has been remarkably non-partisan despite some accusations in the House. I am so proud that the government has taken action on protecting young athletes, ensuring that high-performance athletes, Olympics and Paralympic athletes, have access to services, additional funding and supports. I am also proud that the community sport for all initiative has funded organizations like Spirit North in western Canada, the North American Indigenous Games in eastern Canada, just recently, and so many little community sport opportunities that I have visited, from free basketball games to cricket in Mississauga. It has been a fantastic thing and I hope it continues.</ParaText>

However, by being wilfully blind, the current Minister of Sport and Physical Activity eliminated duty of care and the UN principle of human rights from her governmental responsibility. She did so in order to protect friends and serve the foreign interests of the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, in managing Canada. This puts athletes at risk. She helped maintain the status quo.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8643546"> Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour to stand in this place and talk to issues that are so important to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643547">It is interesting that the previous Liberal member spoke a lot about how his experience of an athlete has informed policy. I wish the Liberals would take that same approach when it comes to some of the expertise offered by, for example, farmers in this place to help inform things like agriculture and environmental policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643548">Before I jump into my speech, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the fantastic member for<Affiliation DbId="278689" Type="2">Hastings—Lennox and Addington</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643549">I rise to address an important issue, safe sport, and the need to ensure that Canadians have trust within the institutions, whether it is a parent dropping their kids off with an athletic organization or our athletes going on an international trip to compete. Over the last number of years, dating back to 2018 in specific instances, and throughout history, we have seen examples where people have taken advantage of that trust and have abused and hurt athletes. It is unacceptable and it needs to stop. We cannot overstate how important it is to ensure that we have those very real and honest conversations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643550">When it comes down to it, Canadians and our country should and can be proud of much of what we have accomplished in sport, whether it be the things that make it onto television or minor sport associations. Unlike what the previous Liberal member thinks, I am very proud of a professional and amateur rodeo circuit, a sport of which we can be proud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643551">I also am very proud of my two boys, who had their first year of baseball this past year. I had a fantastic time learning some of those key and formational skills of teamwork and the discipline associated with team sport. I am sure each member of the House, either directly or one or two steps removed, has a story, whether it be themselves, or their children or a family member, of being involved in various levels of sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643552">We cannot understate how important it is that we are able to trust those in authority, especially when it can be in vulnerable situations. There is a power structure in the way sports organizations are run, and we see how abuse has taken place, and that is absolutely egregious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643553">I appreciate my colleague from Quebec moving this concurrence motion, because it gives us the opportunity to not only talk about these issues, but also to ensure that action is taken so we can, as a nation, demand there be excellence and trust within the existing structures. As parliamentarians, looking at national sport organizations all the way down to the parents dropping their young kids off for those minor sports, there has to be trust throughout. When that trust breaks down, it leads to absolutely tragic situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643554">We heard about a number of those scenarios in relation to Hockey Canada and gymnastics in hearings at the status of women committee. Parliament has heard about tragic stories where action should have been taken but was not. Words are not enough, and the result is that lives are broken and destroyed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643555">The idea of sport is an important one. This is not lost on me. As I mentioned, my kids started organized sport at a young age. Sport has an impact in building a resilient workforce and a capable structure. With the Olympics and the Paralympics this summer, we saw national pride expressed through sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643556"> To reference rodeo again, my personal favourite sport, a number of local athletes from Battle River—Crowfoot competed in the Canadian Finals Rodeo a number of weeks ago. I am very proud that a high school friend of mine will be going to the National Finals Rodeo in a couple of weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643557">We talk about sport and international competitions as being a point of pride. They give us something to believe in, including when times are tough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643558"> I remember watching the gold medal game in the 2020 Olympics at a professor's house. It was incredible, a moment of intense national pride when Canada scored that winning goal. At the foundational level, when it comes to the role the government plays, it has to ensure that these national sport organizations and the leadership they provide in sport in this country can be trusted every step of the way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643559">I want to highlight a number of things that Conservatives, who were proud to participate in the report we are debating concurrence in today, put forward in addition to the work the committee put into the overall report. A number of additional recommendations were submitted in a dissenting report to ensure we can have that trust restored, as I referenced before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643560">The first one is at the very foundation of everything we are talking about: Sport Canada must hold national sports organizations accountable. There has to be accountability throughout the entire system, from leadership at the top all the way through our sports organizations. I have heard examples from constituents where that has not been the case, where there is erosion of trust and an inability by different organizations to have the clear accountability structure that is required to ensure that happens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643561">The second recommendation Conservatives highlighted in the dissenting report is that the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner must investigate complaints in a timely and impartial fashion and enforce consequences for non-compliance. It is great to have an office with an idea, but I have heard from other members of civil society who have been through various ombudsman processes and whatnot that an office needs teeth to ensure there can be investigations and an actual resolution of concerns that are brought forward. It may look nice on paper and may even have a nice office in a downtown building somewhere, but if it cannot result in action, then one truly has to ask what the point is. It comes back to that fundamental concept of trust. We have to be able to trust the process, investigate in an impartial fashion, investigate complaints in a timely manner and enforce consequences for non-compliance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643562">The third recommendation the dissenting report put forward was that Sport Canada must work with provincial and territorial governments to ensure provincial and post-secondary sport organizations are held accountable. It goes without saying that sport does not start and end in the nation's capital. I am sure we all have stories, whether it is our children, ourselves or high school sports team members all the way up to professional athletes. We have to ensure a team Canada approach, so to speak, that goes across governments and different levels of organizations to ensure accountability, again coming back to that fundamental principle of trust. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643563">I would note the fourth recommendation in the dissenting report is that Sport Canada must establish a public registry. I want to dive into this very briefly. This is fundamentally important. As we heard in testimony before the status of women committee, there has to be the ability for athletes, coaches, parents and others involved in organizations to know that the person they are entrusting with either their lives, their athletes' lives or their children's lives can be trusted, to ensure they are going in with eyes wide open. That full accountability and trust needs to be there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643564">When it comes to the government's response, I found it interesting that the previous speaker talked about how great the government has been doing, yet it knew about allegations at Sport Canada for four years and did nothing. Action needs to be taken, trust needs to be restored and this debate today is an important step. However, without action, it is just words.</ParaText>

Tangible action, and the results that follow that tangible action being quantified and accountability being enforced, is something that needs to happen, especially when it comes to an issue as important as ensuring our children, our athletes, are kept safe in this country. Tangible action is absolutely required. It is why Conservatives put forward a dissenting report. We will take that action when we have the opportunity to make the changes needed in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643576">Those who know me recognize I will often be the optimistic one in the room and focus on the good. In reference to sport and youth, I would love to be speaking on the benefits and life lessons acquired through sport, such as healthy communication, commitment, concentration, competition, confidence, control and self-respect. However, today I am speaking to a report regarding safe sport in Canada that was tabled in the House by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage in June 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643577">To provide some context, this report covers the study of abuse in organized sport in Canada, mostly hockey and soccer. This study was triggered by reporting that Hockey Canada had reached an out-of-court settlement with a woman who alleged she had been sexually assaulted by members of the national junior hockey team. This was later found to be a deeper issue within Hockey Canada and the study was expanded in September 2022 to include all organized sport, on ice, on fields, in gyms and on spring floors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643578">The key findings included abuse experienced by athletes, testimony concerning junior hockey, racism, issues faced by indigenous athletes, issues specific to minors, culture within the Canadian sport system, fear of retribution, jurisdictional issues and suggestions to amend best practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643579">I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage; I never have been. However, I chair the status of women committee, previously sat on the national defence committee and currently serve as the shadow minister for women, gender equality and youth. This may seem a rather scattered membership that would not tie into this report, but it does. In every one of these areas, we have dealt with predation by people in power positions on vulnerable Canadians, be they women, especially indigenous women, children or persons in abusive relationships, and with institutions that just do not care about what is happening unless it makes the headlines. This is true for resource extraction companies, the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal public service and apparently some of our sport associations here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643580">It seems wherever I turn in my political career, sexual, physical, emotional and mental abuse rears its ugly head. My most relevant role in all of this is my most important job and biggest privilege, which is to be the mother of two gifted athletes. I have two daughters. My youngest, Reese, is a club volleyball player with the U16 Peterborough Thunder, and my eldest, Tori, plays south of the border with the U19 Connecticut Junior Rangers. Watching our girls in competitive sport is what I love, alongside watching my nieces and nephews, who all love to compete and do it well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643581">I was raised with sport my entire life. I have seen, and continue to see, outstanding, motivating and firm but fair coaches and teammates along the way. However, it is disturbing to acknowledge how the twisted and dark stories of some can stain the very fabric of sport in Canada. Small rural communities like those in Hastings—Lennox and Addington are home to thousands of athletes, from house league to high performance. We play, we cheer, we win, we lose and we learn. Small communities rally together to support our own and can only hope they are experiencing safe, inclusive and fun sport cultures. Sadly, this is not always the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643582">For the report itself, the testimony was harrowing but so essential in helping us, as legislators, try to address the systemic issues plaguing organized sports in Canada. The report itself was very thorough, but there are a few areas where additional action could be taken. In the dissenting report presented by the Conservatives, four particular areas were laid out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643583">The first was that Sport Canada must hold national sports organizations accountable. The report goes on to cite the revolting actions by Hockey Canada in establishing a hush fund for the survivors of rape and sexual misconduct by its players. To be very clear, Hockey Canada was complicit in covering up and, quite frankly, promoting and enabling the sexual harassment of women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643584">Before I was elected as a member of Parliament, I would have asked myself how this was possible. Now I know better. This is possible because these institutions often exist, in part, to protect and enable themselves, to the point where they are willing to cover up rape because some particular young athlete has outstanding talent or is a star on their team. This is the exact same issue plaguing the armed forces.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643585">There needs to be buy-in from the government to bring the hammer down on these organizations when the issues are made so obvious. It should not have taken 10 months for Sport Canada to intervene, as it did in the Hockey Canada case. We should be teaching our children that respect, consideration and justice are more valuable than a trophy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643586">Similarly, point two says that the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner needs to be fully independent from the sporting community. Far too often, victims and survivors feel that they will not get a fair shake with the OSIC because it is populated by people with a vested interest in sport. Again, this is a similar to the complaint heard in CAF, where many survivors feel isolated from justice because they need to go through the chain of command, which often involves an associate of the perpetrator, if not the perpetrator themselves. The government is moving to rectify that by reforming the military justice system, but that needs to continue. Sport Canada should take a long, hard look at both the pitfalls of populating the review board with people involved in the industry and what steps the government is taking to rectify that and apply those lessons to sport in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643587">The third point was on co-operation between the provincial, federal and territorial governments to ensure that provincial organizations and post-secondary sport organizations are being held accountable. The federal government needs to be exceptionally clear on what is expected from provincial and territorial counterparts, and leading by example would be an excellent start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643588">Lastly, we need transparency for the parents and young athletes who are making that transition into the next level of organized sport. We need a public, accessible, searchable registry of all coaches who have been found to have been in violation of the universal code of conduct to prevent and address maltreatment in sport, regardless of the type of violation. This registry should be detailed and include the name of the offender, the number of complaints, the number of arrests and the number of convictions. This would not only help ensure that our kids are kept safe from predators but also provide ease of mind to athletes and parents alike, who would know that the history of the person they are trusting is clean and issue-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643589">Provocative testimony of allegations of sexual assault and secretive, unaccountable organizations have been covered up. While the committee was waiting for a response to this very report, the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport</Affiliation> claimed that it was her mandate to repair the erosion of trust within the sport system in Canada. Is this happening? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643590">Sports is a significant part of who we are. The Liberal government must take responsibility, ensure that the toxic culture is eliminated and make sure that protecting our athletes who have been victimized takes precedence over protecting bullies, abusers and government officials. Crossing the line is never okay. Having athletes feel threatened and uncomfortable should never be tolerated or ignored.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643591">I would like to acknowledge, in the last part of my speech, that earlier today we heard comments regarding intimidation towards witnesses. More specifically, they were conversations that members had with other members. I will speak more clearly to that and share acknowledgement from a member who wrote to me to say that they were sorry. They said they let their emotions surrounding the safe sport conversation get the better of them, and that, in one instance, they reacted in an unprofessional manner and called integrity into question. This was directed at a member, not a witness. Most importantly, we cannot turn a blind eye, or we will be jeopardizing the future of sport in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643607"> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise on such an important initiative, which came directly from parliamentarians, from MPs, and speaks directly to some of the most horrific experiences of our youngest citizens who are engaged in sport, something that we as Canadians believe is important. I want to acknowledge the tireless work of so many and the strength of so many survivors who came forward to take part in the safe sports study. I want to acknowledge the tireless work of many advocates, those in research and academia and those who have been involved in sport, who want to support the survivors coming forward and work, very much, toward effecting long-lasting, systemic change when it comes to sport in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643608">I want to acknowledge the work of my own colleague who was the lead on this committee from the NDP. My colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="278709" Type="2">New Westminster—Burnaby</Affiliation>, along with others, put in many hours to make sure that this report was of the highest quality and that critical recommendations were made on how we need to go forward. I believe that, first and foremost, the importance of a national public inquiry is critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643609">We in the NDP are clear. There must be a national public inquiry into safe sport. We have heard that from survivors, advocates, and those in academia. We have heard it from people who want change. It is deeply disappointing to see that the Liberals, despite their commitments to integrity and fair play, do not actually support a public inquiry into safe sport. Before I go any further, I would like to reflect on some of what we heard from the report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643610">On May 26, 2022, a story was published by Rick Westhead regarding an out-of-court settlement made by Hockey Canada to women who had been sexually assaulted by a group of hockey players on the 2017-18 national junior team in London, Ontario, after a gala. Five players, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart, Michael McLeod, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton, are now facing jail time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643611">One hundred and four witnesses spoke to the committee, but it was that story, that bomb that went off, that really underscored not just the horrors within our sport system, the level of abuse and, in this case, sexual violence or sexual assault oftentimes targeted at women, but also the way in which our sport system, sport organizations and sport officials turned a blind eye while fully knowing that this kind of abuse and horror had taken place under their watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643612">This is not what sport should be about. Canadians rightfully love sports. In the case of hockey, which is oftentimes referred to as our national sport, even though, of course, lacrosse is our national sport, the fact is that hockey was tarnished by these stories of abuse that came forward. The way that Hockey Canada dealt with this abuse was shocking to so many Canadians</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643613"> We have all grown up with hockey as part of our lives. Here in northern Canada, it has been a key part of the lives of many boys, girls, young men and young women. It is part of our fond memories as we grew up, such as the more recent one of Sid calling out for Iggy to score the Olympic winning goal, or sitting with friends, and maybe family, on a Saturday night to cheer on Canada's team. However, it is clear that the culture that surrounds hockey needs fixing. For too long, we have put young boys on a pedestal, especially within junior hockey, expecting boys to act like men without giving them the supports necessary to be their best selves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643614"> It should be clear to anyone who has been reading the sports sections of the newspapers over the last couple of years that harassment and abuse are sadly endemic to high-level sports in this country. We would be remiss to ignore the all-too-common pressures that athletes face to play or practise with some pretty serious injuries. It is only in the last couple of years that sports have even begun to take seriously things like brain injuries, especially when dealing with minors. There is no question that this needs to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643615"> Hockey culture in particular admires Patrice Bergeron for suiting up in game six of a playoff game with a small puncture in his lung, a cracked rib, torn rib cartilage and a separated shoulder. The careers of Carey Price, Shea Weber and Paul Byron ultimately ended after the injuries they faced in the Habs' run to the Stanley Cup that ultimately came up short in 2021. We admire their courage and tolerance for pain but ignore the lifelong cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643616">Shea Weber recently opened up about his post-career quality of life. After a charity softball tournament, he could not walk for two weeks. Carey Price, an inspiration for so many, even in my riding, talked about how his forced retirement contributed to descending deeper into a drinking problem that he has since gotten help for. Athletes sacrifice their bodies, but in many cases, we are talking about kids. It is often too big a sacrifice they do not fully understand, and they are surrounded by adults who do not take their long-term health seriously, which needs changing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643617"> Even since the completion of this study, we are reminded of a culture that needs fixing. Just recently, Rick Westhead, who along with Katie Strang led a lot of the reporting that forced Canadians to start being honest about a broken culture that needs fixing, wrote about an incident, this one in 2014, where a woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by eight OHL players. She decided to come forward after watching a press conference where the London chief of police apologized for not appropriately dealing with the sexual assault by team Canada players.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643618"> She had been invited to watch TV with a 19-year-old player. When she arrived, there were eight players in the basement, aged 16 to 19. Here are her words:</ParaText>

Hockey Canada responded to this reporting by saying that it was out of Hockey Canada's hands and to use the appropriate CHL league.

              <ParaText id="8643621"> When representatives of Hockey Canada came to the heritage committee, they attempted to show that sexual assault was taken seriously. Do not forget that this is the same Hockey Canada that, after covering up the sexual assault that took place in 2018, welcomed Carter Hart onto team Canada at the World Juniors and the IIHF World Championships a year later. This is the same Hockey Canada that claimed that its attempted cover-up of sexual assault was done because it respected victims, saying that it had a “moral obligation to respond to the alleged behaviour that occurred at one of our events by players who attended at our invitation.” Hockey Canada wished to respect the alleged victim's privacy and avoid requiring her to participate “in a prolonged court proceeding”, and said it was “inappropriate to victimize the young woman in court.” Apparently, the board's instinct was “one of compassion for the young woman”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643649">I am deeply disappointed by the Liberals' cheap shots. Nothing covers for the fact that the Liberals are not doing what is needed to ensure safe sport in our country. We are seeing half measures from them and a lot of PR stunts, which I will get to it in a couple of minutes, but it is the same Liberals who just a couple of days ago blocked a motion that I put forward in committee to seek accountability on the soccer drone scandal that rocked our reputation in soccer and sport on the world stage during the Olympics. The Liberals are doing what they can to cover up what happened there, perhaps not unlike what we are seeing in the House today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643652">The former board chair maintained, “Hockey Canada took appropriate action by reporting this incident to the police, Sport Canada and launching an independent investigation.” Was that appropriate action? Nothing about this was appropriately handled. As shocking and horrific as this case was, we cannot turn away from it. There is a problem within sports in our country, and this report makes that clear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643663"> That is not what sport is supposed to be in our country. We know that sport has the potential to transform lives. It can be key in terms of building not just athletic prowess and better physical form, but also a sense of self-confidence, self-worth and belonging.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643664">Since ancient times, we know the power of gathering to compete in sport, as through the Olympics. Owing to my Greek heritage, I am familiar with the proud history of the Olympic Games as a special time where that part of the world came together to engage in sport as a high form of living and, certainly, as a way of people reaching their full potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643665">I will say that Canada talks a good talk when it comes to its commitment to sporting ideals. We heard it from Liberals in the House today, commitments to integrity, commitments to safe sport, commitments to accountability. However, the reality is that Canada has failed many of our young athletes and their families and has failed the advancement of sport in so many ways.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643666">I want to turn to a more recent scandal and again point to the failures of Canada when it comes to ensuring that ethics in sport, integrity in sport, is held to the highest standard. This summer, we all tuned in to watch the Olympics with great pride. We saw major successes from Canadian athletes, but we also saw a major failure. That was the soccer drone scandal that in many ways engulfed a big chunk of our time at the Olympics. We have one of the best women's soccer teams in the world, former gold medal winners, who are incredible players. I want to acknowledge the great Christine Sinclair, who did not play this summer but was critical in supporting and building the sport of soccer for women in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643667">However, we were all shaken when we found out that officials of Soccer Canada, officials of the Canadian women's team, engaged in flying a drone and engaged in spying, which was clearly known to be illegal, during the Olympic Games. It did not just make the news in Canada; it made the news around the world. It was so bad that FIFA launched an investigation, docked points from Canada and fined Soccer Canada. It was so bad that teams from around the world reached out, asking about what Canada was doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643668">What was so problematic, in addition to the act of spying, was the arrogance with which Canadian officials responded, the pretense, making comments along the lines that everybody does it. We heard from teams that came out publicly to say no, that they do not engage in flying drones to spy on other teams, on their practices and as they prepare for games. Yet, Canada was out there flouting the most fundamental tenets of ethics in sport, of integrity in sport, of fair play in sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643669">I admire our women's soccer players who gave the game their all, who gave it their all as a result of their years of hard work and the support of their families, of their coaches growing up and of their communities. They put it all on the line. However, shame on those Canadian officials. Shame on those within Soccer Canada who thought it was not just acceptable but legitimate in a way, as they went on to defend, to engage in that kind of culture, to engage in spying and to engage in the use of drones to spy on other teams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643670">I think we all recognized that this was needed work when Soccer Canada said that it would engage in an independent investigation, but that was months ago and we have not heard anything. That is why I put forward a motion to seek accountability on the parliamentary side. This motion finally came to a vote this week and I was shocked that the Liberals, along with the Bloc, blocked our initiative to have public testimony on the soccer drone scandal. Canadian athletes, families and fans deserve answers. They deserve to know that this mess is going to be cleaned up and that we will put an end to the culture of spying and cheating that was clearly encouraged in the lead-up to and during the Olympics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643671">What do the Liberals have to hide when it comes to Soccer Canada? What is it that they have to hide when it comes to truly getting to the bottom of integrity, ethics and fair play in sport? Canadian athletes and all Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

It is our responsibility to oversee the development of safe sport in our country. The Liberals have dropped the ball and they are continuously dropping the ball. I brought up the most recent example around the soccer drone scandal.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643701"> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak on this very important issue. There is no doubt that the standing committee did a fabulous job of gathering information. I would especially like to give a shout-out to those individuals who shared their personal stories. I am sure that if we were to canvass members who listened to those personal stories, we would find that members in all political parties would express a great deal of gratitude to the witnesses for having the courage to share their stories. By going to the standing committee, they shared their stories with all Canadians. In my book, that would have taken a great deal of courage. For this reason, I would like to acknowledge those presenters who went before the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643702">I want to emphasize that this has been a very important priority for this government. When we think of sports and the abuse that has taken place, this is not new, unfortunately. It has been there for many years. I can assure people that the government's priority has been the safety of kids. We take this very seriously. It is one of the reasons why we were very pleased to see the standing committee deal with this important issue. Even the presentations we have had thus far have been really encouraging, at least in some ways, not as encouraging in others.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643704">Let us look at a number of the comments that were put on the record today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643705"> I thought the parliamentary secretary, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278728" Type="2">Milton</Affiliation>, did a fabulous job explaining, to anyone following the debate, the types of actions the government has taken. He also shared with us his personal experience. He is someone who can relate, at least in good part, with individuals who are most affected. He has a depth of knowledge that very few people in the chamber would have, and I would encourage others look at what he had to say.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643706"> I was disappointed in the member for <Affiliation DbId="278477" Type="2">Saskatoon—Grasswood</Affiliation>'s thoughts in regard to the issue. We are trying to come up with some ideas with respect to how we can improve the system, and he summarized the Conservative Party's position by saying that we should get rid of Sport Canada. That is the far-right attitude we often see from the Conservative Party. Cutting something does not make things better. I had the opportunity to ask another Conservative member if he supported that and he did not deny it. I am led to believe that is what a Conservative government would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643707">We have a contrast between the Liberals and the Conservatives in the way we would approach public policy. It is one that is based on marginalized government, where it cuts where it can, versus a government that cares about people and the role that government can play to support Canadians. We see that when we get speeches like the ones we heard earlier and in the questions on those speeches. Here is what the member for <Affiliation DbId="278477" Type="2">Saskatoon—Grasswood</Affiliation> said in his response to a question from the Bloc member, “disband it altogether.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643708">In the background, I can hear some members from the Conservative lobby saying, “Hear, hear.” Canadians can hear them. When the election comes, we will ensure that Canadians know how sharp the knife is in the Conservative Party, that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> yields two machetes, like a samurai, cutting everything he can see so he can fix the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643709"> We just heard another statement about something they are going to fix, but at what cost? As a government, our primary concern is the safety of kids. What is the alternative? What is the Conservative Party going to do to deal with this issue? First and foremost, I would like to think the Conservatives recognize the seriousness of the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643710"> Instead of just talking about cuts, what are they going to do to deal with the issue? I understand that Stephen Harper did nothing, and the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> was one of his minions back then. However, at the end of the day, the issue does not disappear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643711"> Through organizations, we are able to build upon it, whether it is through regulations or codes of ethics. The government has done that to ensure our athletes, both today and into the future, are in fact being protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643712"> The report deals with the issue of how we can best provide support to our children. We can answer that by reading what the the minister has provided to the House, responding to the issues listed in the report that we are debating. The minister gave about an 12-13 page response. I would highly recommend that members read the response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643713"> I want to pick up on another point. As the House deals with concurrence reports, it does give us a break from the Conservative game and why the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> does not want to get the security clearance, unlike every other leader in the House of Commons, because he does not have an interest in foreign interference and its impact within the Conservative Party. I believe there is a reason, and it might have something to do with Conservative leader's past. We are getting a break from talking about that issue, whether it is concurrence reports or the hours and hours of debate by the Conservatives on a bogus issue, which is their motion that ultimately asks for the issue to go to procedures and House affairs committee. The Conservatives do not want to allow it to go to committee. The Conservatives are actually talking out their own motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643714"> With the sort of behaviour we have witnessed over the last few weeks, they are denying the government the opportunity to bring forward its legislative agenda that deals with things such as the inappropriate use of the Internet, and I am talking about the harms to children, to reforms of our military court system being transferred to the civil side to changes to our Citizenship Act.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643731">Madam Speaker, I want to begin by reminding everyone in the House that people are watching us at home right now. I would remind them that victims and survivors are listening to this debate. I want to recognize Kim Shore, from Gymnasts for Change, who is calling on us to rise to the occasion and to take action for victims and survivors. I also want to recognize her entire team. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643732">I am rising today to take part in the debate on the <Affiliation DbId="300028" Type="4">Minister of Sport</Affiliation>'s response to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage's report on safety in sport. This issue was first examined by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, but the Standing Committee on the Status of Women also examined it at my suggestion. This is an issue that the Bloc Québécois has worked on as a team, and I commend my sport critic colleague for bringing this issue before the heritage committee. We then also looked at it at the status of women committee. I had to invoke Standing Order 106(4) for an emergency study to be conducted on the growing number of cases in the media. Yes, the media had to talk about situations of violence, abuse and bullying, particularly the terrible sexual assault scandal at Hockey Canada, before the minister finally took action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643733">We need to get to the bottom of this matter and provide better protection for young people. As we know, high-level athletes are not just 50-year-olds, but also young people between the ages of 16 and 25. We have a duty to protect them. The Minister of Sport had the opportunity to do something following the committee's report, but she did nothing. Given the letter from the 1,000 gymnasts sent in March 2022, given the Hockey Canada issue, given the many scandals in sports, 16 different disciplines want and deserve action. The committee even heard that this could be just the tip of the iceberg and that further investigation is needed. Accusations were made, but the minister did nothing. Other examples include the Olympic Games and all the stories of coaches abusing athletes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643734">The Bloc Québécois wants an independent public inquiry because aggression in sport is systemic. The sports policy expired over a year ago. There is still no clear direction for action, and the minister is not giving any direction. If there is no clear leadership on this issue, sports businesses are not going to follow through and nothing will change. The minister has a duty of due diligence and verification. If the minister does not ensure athlete safety, who will? The revolving door for the position of Minister of Sport over the past few years certainly has not helped either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643735">Today, I am going to approach the issue from three angles. First, I want to go over a bit of background, which I have already started doing. Then, I will come back to our crucial recommendation, which we see as a priority. Finally, I want to talk about other ideas related to today's debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643736">To begin, I would remind the House that, following the allegations in the media, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage held an emergency meeting in the summer of 2022. Then, seeing that there was still a great deal to learn about the allegations, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women launched a study, during which we heard from victims, sports organizations, in short, a long series of witnesses who came to explain why this issue could not be swept under the rug and why there absolutely needed to be an independent public inquiry. Let us not forget that the previous minister of sport froze funding to Hockey Canada but reinstated it far too quickly and without the systemic changes demanded by victims and survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643737">Second, let us come back to our work in committee. To take meaningful action to eradicate maltreatment in sports, a rethink of the sports governance system in Canada is needed. Witnesses identified systemic changes that could be made to the sports system. These changes include: an oversight of sports organizations' funding use and ways they process maltreatment allegations; the creation of a publicly accessible national coaches registry aiming to prevent coaches subject to sanctions for maltreatment from being able to coach in another sport or to coach in a different province or territory; the improvement and expansion of safe sport education and training for athletes, parents, and any other individuals involved in the sports system; and efforts to increase women's and girls' participation as well as gender equality and inclusion in sport.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643738">In order for all of those changes to occur, most witnesses called on the government to establish an independent national public inquiry into maltreatment in sports. This inquiry could shed light on how the sports system has allowed maltreatment to occur and go unpunished. First of all, the slate needs to be wiped clean and truly everything needs to be put on the table through this inquiry. In the report that was tabled, despite the 24 recommendations in total to prevent the maltreatment of athletes, the recommendation on the independent public inquiry was crucial and a priority. It was the one that stood out.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643739">Third, I will talk about other important issues related to this file, including the non-disclosure agreements that sought to cover the whole thing up and protect the institutions. We heard that victims were forced into silence through these non-disclosure agreements. We also need to look at that, if we really want to make a change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643740">There is also the matter of grooming, where an adult sexually propositions a 15-year-old minor or a person representing themselves as such using electronic or other means of communication. We also heard about that in committee. We heard about adults using their position of authority as coaches to manipulate underage athletes, while the parents of those athletes thought that they were safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643741">We also talked about the CCES, the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, and the OSIC, or Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner. The OSIC is a mechanism that is available to only a small proportion of athletes. Witnesses who appeared before the committee expressed concern that OSIC's complaint mechanism set up by the previous minister of sport was not independent from the sports system. As a result, athletes may not report maltreatment, fearing retribution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643742">Here is another subject that is very close to my heart. I raised this issue at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, where we are currently doing a study on coercive and controlling behaviour. I will give a definition of coercive and controlling behaviour. It includes physical, sexual or psychological abuse, financial control and implicit or explicit threats of harm to a victim. Coercive and controlling behaviour is not limited to a single incident, but rather involves repeated behaviours. It is important to understand that certain actions taken in isolation could be considered normal, but in some cases, it is the recurrence and repetition of those actions that make it coercive and controlling violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643743">These definitions were given at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, but they reminded me of what we heard during testimony at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. Coaches and other organizations exert this kind of control repeatedly over victims, witnesses and survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643744">These authority figures can also restrict a person's movement and even control what they eat and what they do. I myself have a bit of personal experience to share, unfortunately. I was with my sister through her journey as a gymnast, and I saw how much pressure she was under. They tried to control everything, including what she could and could not eat. It is unbelievable that young kids are being put through this. It can put them at serious risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643745">Coercive control is insidious and repetitive. We have heard about physical violence, but it is not necessarily physical. It ends up eroding athletes' self-awareness and self-confidence. That is what we heard from witnesses in committee. The victims stop making decisions based on what is best for them and what really motivates them. Their decisions are based on fear of what the coach might do to them or what other people might do to them. They even end up making bad decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643746">Abusers use these intimidating, degrading and dehumanizing tactics to instill fear in their victims. The goal of abusive behaviours is to provoke fear and gain power and control, even over the victim's thoughts and actions. Such behaviours start to control all of the victim's thoughts. That is pretty terrible, and that is where we are at. We have to do something about that. Coaches use physical and psychological isolation. They do everything to control their victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643747"> Many victims who appeared before the committee told us, in their courageous accounts, about how they were living in fear and about how this is systemic and far more widespread than we think. We really need to keep the issue of coercive control in mind when it comes to all sports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643748">In closing, once again, the government thinks it will be better off if we do not get to the bottom of this. With a voluntary commission, the victims are the ones who have the most to lose. This is not the way to restore confidence in the system or to encourage young people and parents to participate in sports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643749"> Maltreatment in sport is truly an ongoing problem that has been reported by survivors for decades. The report by the Standing Committee on the Status of Women was our way of shedding light on the various measures available to protect women and girls from maltreatment in sport, but that requires an independent public inquiry, not a voluntary commission. There are two problems. First, as far as the commission goes, the minister is not required to report on what she does. Who will she appoint to the commission? She might even try to protect people. Secondly, the word “voluntary” means what it says. It means that no one is under any obligation. That is a real concern. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643773">I would like to start off by highlighting why the matter of safety and trust in the world of sports is so important and why the concerns raised by the athletes who came to committee, who highlighted their experiences, is something we need to take seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643774">For a lot of young people across our country, especially young people lacking in opportunity or facing a series of adversities and barriers to success, sports are often where they find themselves. It is where they access mentorship, guidance, personal growth and development, and learn about hard work and discipline. It is a place where they often find the first adults who ever care about them and are invested in their success.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643775"> When I think about the positive things in the world of sports in our country, I think of some of the people who are doing excellent, incredible work at the grassroots level. I think about people like Michael “Pinball” Clemons, the general manager of the Toronto Argonauts, who has been able to work with youth in some of the most challenging circumstances across our country and do what he describes as bringing young people from the margins of society into the mainstream and building a bridge for young people who grow up in circumstances where they feel like they are looking at life from the outside, unsure of where they fit in in school or where they fit in in our economy. It is by building confidence and self-esteem through sports that they are able to perform well in school, pursue their dreams and live up to their potential.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643776">Mr. Clemons has done a phenomenal job through his foundation of building grassroots programs and supporting them across our country, but particularly in the Toronto area. One of the organizations he supports, which has operated in the Jane and Finch community for a long time, is the Youth Association for Academics, Athletics, and Character Education, run by a schoolteacher named Devon Jones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643777"> Mr. Jones has been in the Jane and Finn community for a long time. He works in classrooms by day and is operating incredible sports programs and tutoring programs by night. He has shown many young people who did not believe in themselves what they are capable of by first engaging them through sports and then opening up an entire world of possibilities for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643778">Locally in my community of Durham, Scott Dickinson, a basketball coach, has run local basketball programs for young people in partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters all across Clarington and Oshawa, showing young people all the incredible things they can do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643779">The reason these programs are so successful is that they prioritize safety and trust. Parents who know their kids need more opportunities and access to ways that allow them to live up to their potential and learn all the skills and abilities they have inside of them given by God know they can trust these programs and trust these people. They can hand their kids over to them and it will be an incredible experience that will elevate their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643780"> Unfortunately, what we have learned through the process of understanding what has happened with safe sports in Canada is that there are far too many young people, student athletes and parents whose trust has been broken. They believed that organized sports were going to be the positive experience they are for some, but they instead found that they were not getting the support they deserved. In fact, there has been poor conduct and people have not lived up to a reasonable standard, or even a decent standard, of how to treat other people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643781"> The impact of sports hinges on safety and trust so that young women and men can engage in sports organizations and receive the mentorship, guidance, personal growth and development they need. The report on safe sports in Canada highlights where Sport Canada and national sports organizations have failed to create a safe and trusted environment for athletes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643782">I stand in the House today in full support of the Conservative Party's dissenting report on safe sports in Canada, which outlines changes that would help us provide a positive experience to more Canadian youth. I would like to focus on the lack of accountability highlighted in the testimony provided by witnesses before the heritage committee. In particular, the testimony highlighted a lack of accountability resulting from failures of the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner, which, as many people across our country have highlighted, needs to do a better job of investigating complaints in a timely and impartial fashion and needs to enforce consequences for non-compliance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643783">The issue of a lack of accountability is a theme that comes up very often when discussing the current government, but some very reasonable, logical, actionable recommendations have been provided on how the OSIC can better do its job of protecting athletes and enforcing accountability in sports across our country. I would like to highlight three of those recommendations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643784">First, the OSIC is not trusted by many Canadians to take their concerns seriously, act in an impartial, investigative manner and enforce compliance. These are the reasonable expectations of any commissioner who receives a complaint, a red flag or a concern about what an athlete, a young person, might be going through. Time, impartiality, seriousness and enforcement are the basic foundational elements of any ability to evaluate a complaint and make sure not only that victims are heard, but that what they share, which is often a very uncomfortable and difficult experience to begin with, is acted upon. That is the first recommendation to the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643785">The second recommendation is that the OSIC work with provincial and territorial governments to ensure greater transparency and accountability on provincial and university teams. We heard from witnesses that red flags, concerns and complaints can be raised at the national sports level, but they are not necessarily enforced locally when it comes to provincial and university teams. This is a jurisdictional problem that should not exist, but it is the result of a bureaucracy that is not working with local partners to make sure that if violations are found or complaints are raised, those who have been found guilty or proven to be violating a code of conduct are followed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643786">Young athletes, young men or women, naturally work with and are members of teams in sports at various levels. The idea that we have a commissioner who cannot work with universities and provincial and territorial governments is absurd. It is a very reasonable recommendation that deserves action immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643787">The third recommendation, which is also common sense, is to establish a searchable and accessible public registry of coaches who have violated the Universal Code of Conduct to Prevent and Address Maltreatment in Sport. This makes complete sense. Coaches are trusted authorities in the lives of young people. When a mother or father sends their kid to practice or to perform as part of a team, they are trusting that their coach is going to use their authority within the law, with respect, care and love. When that does not happen and there is violence and, as one of my colleagues adequately put it, pernicious behaviour on the part of an authority figure in the world of sports, that needs to be known to parents. That needs to be known to athletes. Putting coaches in an accessible and searchable registry makes sense. This is how we protect people and hold people accountable for their actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643788">I call upon the Liberal government to take action on these items. The report that we received identifies many items that could be acted upon now. Actions could be taken now, with the best interests of families, students and athletes in mind, to restore what should be a trusted and safe environment for all young people to be involved in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643789">As I mentioned at the top of my comments, many people, and I count myself among this group, find their best mentors and sources of support, the people who believe in them the most, through the world of sports. It makes such a difference in the lives of young people, especially young people who are struggling and overcoming adversity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643790"> I believe this needs to be a top priority, as another one of my colleagues mentioned, to ensure that the bad behaviour of certain actors in the world of sports does not taint or poison how sports broadly are perceived. We hope that the Liberal government will take action to hold those who give sports a bad name accountable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643802"> Madam Speaker, what I would like to see is the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner strengthened. That is my focus today. I am not here to talk about any other parallel debates that may be happening in the House. I am narrowly focused on wanting to see real changes. Those changes would involve making sure there is impartiality and timeliness in the commissioner's investigations, that the commissioner works with the provincial and territorial governments so that provincial and university teams are aware of issues that occur at the national level, and that the Universal Code of Conduct to Prevent and Address Maltreatment in Sport is prioritized and held up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643803">Madam Speaker, I have been involved in sports for some 45 years. I have enjoyed it and seen a lot, but how dare the Liberals suggest that we should keep funding an organization that contributes to a culture of abuse in sports?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643804">Here is part of the issue I have. In the spring of 2018, the then sports minister proposed, and in fact held a news conference, that the government was going to roll out a new safe sport agenda for Canada. Good for the minister. However, within probably two weeks, one of the biggest sex assault scandals in sport in this country took place in hockey. Sport Canada, which was in charge, failed to even follow up with Hockey Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643805"> We heard nothing from Sport Canada, which should have suspended funding immediately. That is its mandate, and it was not following through on its mandate. It stayed silent and did nothing until May 2022. Why? It is because a prominent sports reporter broke the story about the sexual assault allegations from the Hockey Canada gala in London, Ontario, which had actually taken place four years earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643806">Only when Sport Canada was embarrassed by its lack of due diligence, I believe, did it even begin to take half-hearted measures to manage the crisis. At the time, Sport Canada funded hockey. Canada did absolutely nothing. The government proved its incompetence and its unwillingness, I believe, to support safe sport in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643807"> Then we found out that Hockey Canada paid out, from a slush fund, $3.5 million as a settlement to a woman known as E.M. We found out in testimony from Hockey Canada that it had an equity fund. It was actually set up long before, to take money from hockey membership registrations paid by parents, just to cover uninsured liabilities that included sexual abuse claims. Again, where was Sport Canada?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643808">This is the issue I have. Understandably, minor hockey parents in this country were livid about the allegations of Hockey Canada's taking registration money and putting it into the fund. It paid out $7.9 million for nine claims out of the national equity fund. Of that, $6.8 million was for the settlement related to Graham James in my home province of Saskatchewan when he was head coach of the Swift Current Broncos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643809">The government set up the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner to investigate complaints in a timely and impartial fashion. However, we have received numerous anonymous calls to my office here in Ottawa from individuals, parents and athletes who are concerned that the rules are not being complied with in a timely manner by OSIC. That is right; my office is receiving anonymous calls because people are very concerned about the repercussions of even speaking out about abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643810">Sport Canada was told it must hold national sports organizations, all 62 of them, accountable. However, it is silent. We know from the Hockey Canada debacle in 2018 that it failed to do this. Sport Canada is not fulfilling its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643811">We also heard from a number of members of the Canadian women's soccer team on their concerns about pay equity. It has affected their training and preparation for World Cup matches. Again there has been nothing from Sport Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643812">The funds must be fully accounted for and transparency must be disclosed, which it has not been. Since only national sports organizations are captured by the Office of the Sport Integrity Commission, OSIC, it is now essentially doing the job that Sport Canada was asked to do for many decades. That is the issue I brought up earlier: Sport Canada is not fulfilling its mandate. OSIC is another level of bureaucracy by the Liberal federal government, which has spent millions of dollars to set up safe sport in Canada, to the embarrassment of Sport Canada.</ParaText>

How does anyone know ,when they drop off their children at soccer, ringette or hockey, that they are safe? It is provincial jurisdiction, and all the sport organizations do is ask for a police check of the coaches and volunteers. We know that every organization in this country is grappling with the lack of volunteers. Many organizations will take anybody from the sidelines; they simply invite them onto the field or the ice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643824">The petitioners say that people with disabilities often face barriers to employment along with higher costs associated with health care and housing and that the proposed Canada disability benefit restricts eligibility to individuals receiving the disability tax credit known for its many barriers. There is a risk to life due to insufficient supports on current disability programs federally and provincially. They say that Canadians living with disabilities on provincial and federal disability benefits are struggling immensely with benefits significantly below the poverty line, with the cost of living crisis and with the ever-increasing amount of homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643825">According to petitioners, the proposed Canada disability benefit outlined in budget 2024 is not what the disability community called for, falling short of the government's promises and the disability community's needs. They say that the proposed maximum amount of $200 per month is insufficient to alleviate poverty levels.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8643837">Madam Speaker, as always, it is an honour to stand here representing the good people of Battle River—Crowfoot and talk about issues that are so important to them, especially when it comes to the appropriate use of tax dollars, which is at the crux of what the House has been seized with for, I believe, 14 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643838"> As I referenced yesterday, just prior to the House adjourning for the day, it is not just about some documents or a stack of paper. Rather, the privilege debate taking place in the House is about the fundamental basis of our democratic system: the ability of Parliament and those elected by the people of this country to fulfill their constitutional duty in ensuring that, in this case, there is accountability. Ultimately, it is about ensuring that this place, the people's House of Commons, is, remains and continues to be the supreme law-making authority of the land, and that Parliament has what is often referred to by the technical term “unfettered access” to any document in the country. That includes documents in relation to government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643839"> Now, the government has kind of flip-flopped. Each day the Liberals seem to have a different tack on how they want to attack Conservatives for simply asking for accountability. What is very interesting is this whole debate could be avoided. It is quite simple. It could easily be avoided by the government simply releasing the documents. This debate could come to a close if the government was willing to take the step of being transparent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643840"> Thus far, the government is unwilling to do so. Does that mean there is incriminating information in the documents? Well, it could. We do not know because we do not have the documents. Could that mean criminality would be exposed in those documents? Well, it could, but we do not know. It certainly raises the question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643841">I have heard from so many Canadians, and not just constituents. What is interesting is, as this debate has raged on, I have increasingly heard from folks from across the country, including some who live in Liberal ridings. At least, they are Liberal ridings today; we are not sure that will be the case after the next election. They are asking why the government would waste so much energy in a cover-up. The Liberals claim they have nothing to hide. If that is in fact the case, and this is what people are sharing with me, then they should be more forthcoming. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643842"> I would invite members of the governing party, Liberal backbenchers who have the constitutional obligation to represent the people who sent them here, to end the cover-up and release the documents. It is truly simple and straightforward, yet the Liberals refuse at every turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643843">What is distressing to so many Canadians is that over the last nine years, there has been an erosion of trust in the very foundation of our democratic infrastructure in this country. We have seen it time and time again. I talked yesterday about the normalization of constitutional crises, and how one would outline, nine years ago, what the Liberal government would perpetuate in terms of normalcy in how they treat the institutions of Parliament and of government, and how they would treat Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643844">The fact is that the Liberals, under the modern Emergencies Act, are the first government since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s father invoked it in the 1970s to suspend charter rights. Can members believe the current Prime Minister suspended the charter rights of Canadians? It is astounding that the Liberal government, with such disregard, is so quick to trample on the rights and freedoms of Canadians. Time and time again, we saw it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643845"> I mentioned briefly yesterday, as my time was coming to a close before the House adjourned, that it was the current government that dismissed 800 years of parliamentary tradition by asking for unfettered taxation and spending authority. It wanted to bypass this place. It wanted to bypass democracy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643846"> It is unbelievable, and it has certainly contributed to this culture of corruption the Liberals preside over. It is essential that we right the ship. The good news is that it is possible, because we have seen difficult times in this country before. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643847">I have heard stories, although I was not born yet when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s father was leading this country, that it was a disastrous time for the west. There were national unity crises, constitutional crises. Flipping the bird to the west is what the Prime Minister's father was doing, and certainly that seems to be the Prime Minister's attitude toward the west as well. There was the national energy program stealing the wealth that could have benefited our country, but instead he targeted his own political self-interest above the national good. We have seen difficult times before, and we have seen the ability and the resilience of Canadians showcased in the innovation, ingenuity and potential that exists in this country. I believe we will see that unleashing of potential again. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643848">However, we have to get back to the point that the House of Commons is in order and can do its job. The foundational element of that is that the government needs to understand it is Parliament that makes the rules. It is Parliament that can call for documents. Ultimately, for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the government and the members of the governing party, it is Parliament that is the final law-making authority of the land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643849">My hope is that we can see, through the mechanisms that exist in this place, a level of accountability take place today, in the 44th Parliament, to ensure the government does the right thing and releases the documents. I must be honest; I have my doubts. I saw how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament when the WE Charity scandal was under way in the midst of COVID. After saying he would not for so many years, he prorogued Parliament the day the documents were sent to the clerk of a committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643850">For Canadians watching, proroguing Parliament puts a stop to committee activities. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament to cover up his family's involvement with an organization that would have gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in sole-source contracts across this country. The lengths to which he goes to cover up the corruption is astounding. So, forgive me when I say I have my doubts that the Liberal government will do the right thing. However, that is where Parliament steps in. Parliament has the ability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643851">I understand from media reports that there is some dissension in the Liberal ranks. Some MPs are figuring out that it is MPs who are elected to the House of Commons, not governments. It is MPs who make up a party that then forms a government. It is almost hard to believe that I have to explain these basic principles to my colleagues across the way. I am glad, in a sense, that they are waking up and realizing they have the ability to stand up for their constituents.

              <ParaText id="8643902">Madam Speaker, I was about to say that, when I worked in that field after graduation, I was involved in environmental waste containment projects. They were exciting projects, such as building sewage lagoons, mine tailings dams, solid waste containment and even waste water retention ponds. It was magical. Maybe that is not exciting to most, but it certainly was to our customers; the engineers, who are a difficult to excite crowd; and others who benefited. Yes, it is true: We all want clean water and clean air to breathe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643903">We were selling real products; they were being sold and installed by real people in real environmental projects. Materials were manufactured in Canada and sold throughout this country and in the United States. That means GDP for Canada, exports and productivity. These products were considered new technology at the time; therefore, while early adopters were happy to embrace them and realized their environmental and economic benefits, others were not so sure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643904">As such, we went to the government for help, but this was not a green slush fund; we had no contacts to get easy money. We did not have a slate of directors who were investors, who had contacts or who were sitting on the SDTC slush fund board. We applied to the government for research dollars and had testing carried out at our universities to prove the products. We conducted strength testing at the University of Western Ontario, as it was called then, and later at Queen's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643905">Why do I tell that story? How could my career possibly be germane to the House? It is because, as we heard earlier, 82% of the projects that were sampled by the Auditor General were conflicted. If we apply that rate of malfeasance over the universe of projects, we come to a staggering $832 million of questionable funding. If we add the opportunity cost back to that $832 million, we are very close to $1 billion of taxpayer money funnelled to sketchy destinations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643906">However, there is more: $58 million was spent on 10 ineligible projects in the sample. That scales up to $104 million if we factor up to the full size of the universe of projects in question. How many projects like the one I described above, that I was involved in and that was undertaken by the small business I worked for, were displaced because of the highly questionable awarding of funds by the board of the green slush fund? Certainly, because the money was misallocated to ineligible projects, good ones did not get funding. Some of these potential projects may well have been home runs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643907">That is forgone GDP, jobs and tax revenue. Does this not suggest to everyone in this place that oversight of this fund was weak at best and potentially criminal at worst? Does this not make one think that we may need a change in the management of the government's spending writ large? I see some heads nodding. We may need some people with real financial expertise in charge of the books. This is green technology science. This is not rocket science.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643908">Getting to the bottom of this scandal may not be easy, but it is a journey worth taking. This is not $400 million that we are talking about. That is the number that has been confirmed. It only represents 226 projects of the 405 that were funded. As I stated earlier, this is $832 million plus opportunity cost, so we are very close to a billion-dollar scandal. One billion dollars could buy a lot of Girl Guide cookies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643909">One thing that is concerning for Canadians is the level of corruption in the board and the Governor in Council appointment to the sustainable development technology fund, otherwise known as SDTC. People at home are calling it the green technology slush fund.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643910">Another thing is the federal government's refusal to produce key documents on this matter, which is stifling public scrutiny and raising red flags about accountability. When government actions, particularly those concerning the use of public funds, come under scrutiny, it is the right of every Canadian to demand clear answers, but we are not getting clear answers from the government, which leaves one to ask what it is hiding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643911">Who are the Liberals protecting? They are protecting their friends and associates who benefited. The fact that we are still discussing this and asking for a disclosure that was demanded by Parliament is bewildering to this rookie MP. Maybe I should not be surprised. When I consider the long list of Liberal scandals, there are almost too many to count, but I will name some here for good measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643912"> We will start with the SNC-Lavalin affair. This political scandal involved an attempt at political interference in the judicial system by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada and the Prime Minister's Office. Ultimately, the company changed its name, partly to distance itself from its tarnished brand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643913">In no particular order, next we have the ArriveCAN affair, affectionately known as “arrive scam”. In this one, the federal government spent over $50 million on an original contract of $80,000. It spent $54 million. I am not making this up. A group of programmers created that app over a weekend, so this one is out of control. The GDP is under attack. Ten thousand people were erroneously forced to isolate. I may have been one of those because officials made me isolate for longer than I needed to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643914">There is the Aga Khan scandal. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was found to have broken no fewer than four provisions of the Conflict of Interest Act when he vacationed over Christmas on the posh private island in the Caribbean owned by his good friend the Aga Khan. The Prime Minister was the first prime minister in Canadian history to break federal ethics rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643915">Next, we have the WE Charity scandal. This one in particular I did not like because my daughter actually participated in raising money for WE Charity. My daughter Charlotte raised over $10,000 to build a school in Africa by carrying water through the streets of Toronto—St. Paul's and generating donations by doing just that, so this one hurt. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> granted his friends at WE Charity a project to oversee a $1-billion program for student employment grants. Do we not have government employees who do the same thing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643916">There are two common elements we can quickly identify through this partial list of government scandals. Members can identify their own, and these are the two that I have picked. If members have a few in mind, I invite them to keep them quiet and see if they match up with mine. The first one is friends in high places in the Liberal government awarding their Liberal friends at the expense of taxpayers. The second is a complete lack of ethical behaviour. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643917">What we do not see is transparency. Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of any functioning democracy. They are the twin principles that ensure those in power act in the best interests of the public rather than serving their own narrow political or personal agendas. The concept of transparency is not just theoretical. It is embedded in laws and regulations that compel governments to disclose information, especially when there are questions about the misuse of public funds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643918">Parliament has this power. Parliament has asked for the documentation. Therefore, the documentation must be produced. The government's accountability to its people is not optional. This is a fundamental responsibility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643919">A 2024 CanTrust index poll revealed that less than 25% of Canadians trust the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government. Is that a surprise to anyone? That number might be high since this poll was conducted back in February, but it makes sense. When the government refuses to release key documents, especially in response to serious allegations, it erodes public trust. It undermines the very fabric of our democracy. Without transparency, how can citizens know that their government is acting in good faith?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643920">Let us look at this from another angle, and I promise again that I am not making this up. I will give a bit of a timeline of how we got here. In 2018, the then Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> decided he did not like the chair of SDTC, which was Mr. Jim Balsillie, because he was criticizing the government. The chair of SDTC was asked to stop his criticism, and he did not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643921">In 2019, the then Liberal <Affiliation DbId="253394" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> decided to appoint a new chair, but this one already had conflicts of interest. He did this even though the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Privy Council Office were warned of risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair. The new chair had ownership positions in companies receiving green slush fund SDTC funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643922">The funding floodgates opened. Conflicts of interest were managed rather than outlawed. SDTC members began to award funds to companies where other board members held ownership. The following example is the one I love the most. If someone does something so audacious, maybe no one will suspect a thing. I think that is called hiding in plain sight. The founder and beneficial owner of Cycle Capital, Andrée-Lise Méthot, voted for Cycle Capital investments to receive a significant amount of green slush fund funding while she sat on the board of the Liberal green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643923">In fact, before and during her time on the green slush fund board, Ms. Méthot's companies received $250 million. Cycle Capital's lobbyist, before he came to the House, was none other than the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. One might ask, “So what?” In the year before he joined the Liberal government, he lobbied 25 times, and the green slush fund board gave over $100 million to the Cycle Capital companies. Then, when he was part of the government, he participated in talks that gave SDTC another $750 million to deploy, of which 25% went to Cycle Capital. We do not know, but he may or may not still own shares in Cycle Capital. It is a really good trade where I come from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643924">I spoke earlier about my career as an environmental engineer, but I actually spent most of my career in finance. That is another reason the misappropriation of funds in this green slush fund scandal speaks to me. When I was in the financial and investment industry, fund managers were generally paid dependent upon how their funds performed. The better someone's fund did, the more they would get paid. The better their fund did, the more assets they would attract, and again, the more they would expect to be paid, all else being equal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643925">What I find peculiar about this fund and the way it paid its principals is that they were paid based on the dollar volume of grants they made. I swear I am not making that up. The more money that was allocated, the more that was spent, whether it went to a good project, a bad one, a medium one or some other, the more money that was paid to those individuals. Rather than scouring the country for the best projects, the easiest thing to do, the path of least resistance, was to allocate funds to projects that were already known to the board, regardless of the expected return to the taxpayer. We call that a fiduciary duty.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8643926">For a government that loves to virtue signal about its care and vision for the environment, its behaviour when it comes to deploying funds is contradictory, as I just detailed. The government says one thing and does another. This matters, and here is why: Instead of investing taxpayer dollars in the most promising projects and companies, the Liberals appointed a chair, and her board funnelled taxpayer dollars to projects and companies that were run by their friends or into companies where they had a financial interest. This is the kind of situation we are taught to avoid in a business education. This is why we have ethics classes in business and financial education. Perhaps the financial leaders on the other side of the House missed those classes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643927">The misallocation of money and capital leads to the destruction of capital in this country. This leads to a loss of Canadian competitiveness, a reduction in productivity and a decline in GDP. We are seeing all these economic measures play out now in our economy, and we are worse off as a country for it. The green slush fund is not responsible for all of that, but the green slush fund and its grant allocation principles are emblematic of the attitudes and principles of the Liberal government over the last nine years. Good money put toward programs with admirable goals is great, but lacking in the financial know-how and financial management expertise to succeed is a waste of taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8643928">The reduction of our productivity and competitiveness in GDP is not an accident. This is the result of an overall mismanagement of the economy by the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal cabinet. At the heart of this issue is public trust. Canadians trust their government to act in their best interest, to steward public funds responsibly and be forthright about how decisions are made. When this trust is broken, it is incredibly difficult to rebuild, except perhaps with a new government. The refusal to release the green slush fund documents erodes this trust. It sends a message to the public that the government is not interested in being transparent and that accountability is a secondary concern.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644223">Madam Speaker, as my colleague is well aware, we are complying with the ruling of the Speaker of the House, which indicated that this matter must be referred to committee. As the Speaker said, the Conservatives are obstructing their own obstruction. I cannot help but think that that is because they do not want to know the truth.

              <ParaText id="8644224">I also want to illustrate the fact that his question is totally fake, much like the tacky slogans Conservatives hide behind because they have no actual ideas or policies for the country. That is probably why they continue to filibuster their own motion: to distract Canadians from the fact that they are nothing more than an empty shell. It must be pretty embarrassing for Conservative MPs, having to filibuster their own motion day after day to protect their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> from any real accountability. It must also be kind of embarrassing for Conservative MPs to sit in a caucus with a leader who refuses to get a security clearance, because he clearly has something to hide. It is expected of a leader of a political party to do this, but beyond his little performances in the House, their leader does very little that comes close to leadership.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644228">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to speak on behalf of the residents of the beautiful riding of Simcoe—Grey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644229">As members know, last week was a riding week, and there were couple of celebrations that I was fortunate to attend. The first was the 40th anniversary of Jan Trude's first Tim Hortons. Jan owns all the Tim Hortons's in the Collingwood catchment area. It was a great anniversary. Forty years is pretty incredible, as is what Jan does for the local community, whether it is the hospice, the hospital or the Georgian Triangle. She also donates money every year for golf tournaments and is always there with products when people need them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644230">The other celebration I would like to highlight quickly was for Honorary Colonel Rory MacKinnon. I am fortunate to have Canadian Forces Base Borden in my riding, and he is now the honorary colonel for 16 Wing. I went to the change of appointment ceremony and I congratulate Rory. He will do a great job and will represent the people in our armed forces very well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644231">If I asked someone back in my riding of Simcoe—Grey if they had heard about the Liberal scandal in which the Liberals gave hundreds of millions of dollars to friends and insiders, the one with all sorts of conflicts of interest, the one in which Liberal cronies figured the rules did not apply to them, the one that produced perks and profits for Liberals and their friends while many Canadians struggle just to put food on the table, do members think that person might be able to guess which one it was? I suspect they would ask which of the many Liberal scandals I was talking about That is because for nine years, we have seen this behaviour time and time again. Canadians are finding it harder to get by, but for Liberals and their insider friends, the times have never been so good. Through scandals, mismanagement and insider deals, Liberal friends have enjoyed an endless buffet of Canadian tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644232"> Maybe my constituent would have guessed I was talking about WE Charity. We all remember WE Charity. Sometimes it feels like forever ago when it comes to Liberal scandals. However, WE Charity almost got $1 billion from the Liberals, untendered, to administer the short-lived Canada student service grant program. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself stated that WE was the only possible option to administer such a program, despite the number of public service executives growing by 42% since the Liberals took power and 50,000 new bureaucrats being hired just from 2015 to 2020. Now it is more than 100,000 new hires since the Liberals took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644233">Despite 50,000 new people on the public payroll, somehow only an organization that had spent almost half a million dollars to hire the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> own mother and brother, not to mention prominently featuring the Prime Minister at events targeting youth, could handle this billion-dollar program with almost no strings attached. One can spend half a million dollars and get a billion-dollar return. Only friends of the Liberal Party would get that type of return on investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644234">“What about SNC-Lavalin?” my constituent might ask. It is another classic case of Liberal corruption for our feminist <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644235">Members will recall that SNC-Lavalin spent $1.9 million to host Muammar Gaddafi's son on a visit to Canada in 2008. The RCMP were watching, and it turns out that was just small potatoes. By February 2015, the RCMP pressed charges alleging that between 2001 and 2011, SNC-Lavalin had paid $48 million in bribes to government officials in Libya. The charges also alleged that the company defrauded Libyan organizations of $130 million. However, luck, once again, was on SNC-Lavalin's side, because shortly after all of these charges were pressed, the Liberals came to power.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644236">After 51 meetings with senior officials and $110,000 in donations to the Liberal Party later, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> agreed to change the Criminal Code to allow SNC-Lavalin to get away with fraud and bribery charges. Here we go again: only $100,000 in donations to make almost $200 million in corruption disappear. That is a great return on investment for friends of the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644237">It was not the WE Charity scandal and it was not the SNC-Lavalin scandal. What about the Aga Khan? That was one of our first reminders that the rules the rest of us follow do not apply to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644238">On December 26, 2016, while most of us were dealing with food hangovers from Christmas dinner the night before, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family hopped on his jet and headed down to Nassau, Bahamas. Then they got a lift from there in the Aga Khan's private helicopter over to his private island so they could have a bit of rest and relaxation. Conveniently enough, a few Liberal friends were also visiting. The member for <Affiliation DbId="299807" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount</Affiliation> and her husband, who is a childhood friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, were there, as were the member for <Affiliation DbId="278109" Type="2">St. John's South—Mount Pearl</Affiliation>, a groomsman at the Prime Minister's wedding, and his husband.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644239">What did this quaint New Year's getaway for a few old Liberals cost? It cost $271,000, almost five years of salary for the average Canadian. That is not to mention the $50 million of federal funding given to the Aga Khan Foundation, a registered lobby group, in just the previous year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644240">We would think that for that kind of donation, the vacation would have been for free, but I guess for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the few Liberal friends who attended, it was. Imagine spending 50 million tax dollars for the invite and another 271,000 tax dollars for a vacation that regular Canadians can barely ever dream of. It is another great return on investment for the Liberals who were lucky enough to get the invite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644241">Incredibly, though, the present scandal we are talking about is not WE Charity, SNC-Lavalin or the Aga Khan's private island getaway. My constituents may guess it must be the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation scandal. That one almost slipped my mind. There seem to be so many that it is hard to keep track. Let us recall it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644242"> In 2015, if a billionaire and adviser to the government of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite basic dictatorship were asked to get in the good books of the Liberal Party, what would they do? They know the Prime Minister's father had an admiration for Communist dictators like Fidel Castro and Mao, and they know there is a foundation named after the former prime minister that is actively seeking donations, since the previous Liberal government gave it a generous $125-million endowment. They also know that the foundation is stacked with Liberal cronies and regularly meets in the Prime Minister's Office. Conveniently enough, they know that the Chinese Business Chamber of Canada is hosting a posh fundraiser in Toronto, where they might be able to get some face time with the Prime Minister and his brother. What would they do? They would hop on a jet from Beijing to Toronto and commit to dropping $1 million in exchange for future considerations. That means $200,000 for the foundation, $750,000 to Pierre Trudeau's favourite alma mater and $50,000 on a statue of the elder Trudeau himself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644243">CSIS says that China interfered in the 2019 and 2021 elections, both taking place after the donation was made. It could be a coincidence, but what if it was not? Taking $1 million in donations to help sway two elections in one's favour seems like a good return on investment that I think even the Liberals would be truly impressed with.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644244">Amazingly, though, this is not even the scandal we are here to talk about today. Nor is it about former Liberal MP Frank Baylis, whose consortium got $237 million to build ventilators that may or may not have been delivered. Nor is it about GC Strategies, which the Auditor General has announced she is investigating for more than $100 million in often sole-source contracts it received from the Liberal government. Members may remember that for the arrive scam app alone, GC Strategies pocketed $20 million, and that was for no work. That was for an app that was supposed to cost only $80,000. It is certainly nice work for those who can get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644245">Today, I am here to talk about what may be the dooziest of all Liberal scandals, which is saying something. I am here to talk about Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Maybe members know it better by its unofficial name, the Liberal billion-dollar green slush fund. They may have heard something about the green slush fund recently, but in case they have not, let me provide a bit of background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644246">Sustainable Development Technology Canada is a federally funded not-for-profit that approved and disbursed over $100 million in funds annually to clean technology companies. It was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act. It supported projects that develop and demonstrate new technologies that address issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil. It was an arm's-length organization from the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644247"> By all accounts, SDTC was doing good work for its first few years under its Stephen Harper-appointed chair, the Canadian technology leader Jim Balsillie. However, in 2018, former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains had concerns regarding Mr. Balsillie's public criticism of the Liberals' privacy legislation. Those concerns continue to be shared by many Canadians and many in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644248">Now we know that the Liberals do not tolerate dissenting options, so Bains manoeuvred to put Annette Verschuren in as CEO, even though she was already receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies and in an immediate conflict of interest. In fact, the minister, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Privy Council were warned of what risks would be associated with appointing somebody who was already in a conflict. They were told that the fund had never had a chair with interest in companies receiving funding from SDTC. Bains appointed her anyway. He also appointed two other very controversial board members who went on to engage in unethical behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funding to companies in which they held ownership stakes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644249"> It is said that the new chair and board members began to oversee an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and managed, not avoided, as they be. Board members regularly awarded SDTC funding to companies in which they themselves either held stocks or positions. It really was corruption on a staggering level.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644250">By January 2021, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</Affiliation> was appointed after Navdeep Bains declined to run for re-election. In November 2022, whistle-blowers raised internal concerns with the Auditor General about unethical practices at SDTC. The Privy Council was briefed by these whistle-blowers about the allegations shortly thereafter and commissioned two independent reports. In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public and the industry minister finally agreed to suspend SDTC funding.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644251"> This was followed shortly thereafter in November 2023 by an audit of SDTC by the Auditor General. Fast-forward to June 2024, and the Auditor General's report was released. It claimed severe governance failures at SDTC. Just what did the Auditor General's report find? Are members ready for this? It found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that did not even produce green technology or contribute to emission reductions and $334 million, over 186 cases, to projects for which board members held a direct conflict of interest. There were 186 cases, and no one flagged that there were that many conflicts of interest. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644252">SDTC gave $58 million to projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were even met at all. The Auditor General also made it clear that the blame for the scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> who “did not sufficiently...monitor” the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. I am wondering if perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> was maybe too busy organizing his own leadership campaign to keep an eye on the money or the department that he was giving money to. That is certainly not very responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644253">Let us dig a little deeper. There is the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, who, after being arrested by Toronto police but before joining the Liberal cabinet, served as a strategic adviser for a venture capital firm called Cycle Capital from 2009 to 2018. The founder and owner of Cycle Capital, Andrée-Lise Méthot, sat on the board of the green slush fund. While she was on the board, she helped give $114 million to companies that she herself had invested in. Thanks to her strategic voting and the hard work of her strategic adviser, who had 25 meetings with the Prime Minister's Office and the industry department, the value of Cycle Capital strangely tripled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644254">When she finally left SDTC in 2022, Méthot was awarded for her great work and went on to join the Canada Infrastructure Bank's board, another Liberal debacle. While there, she helped get $170 million of infrastructure bank money for a company owned by the chair of the green slush fund, the aforementioned Annette Verschuren. We really cannot make this stuff up. We could make a movie about all this corruption. I should add that, according to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> still has a passive interest in Cycle Capital. We do not know how much he owns, but we do know, whatever he does own, the company tripled. That is a really good Liberal return on investment, if members ask me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644255">Not to be outdone, green slush fund board member Guy Ouimet admitted in committee that $17 million of green slush money went to companies he himself had a financial interest in. He said that this is a small amount of money. It might be for Guy, but for the residents in my riding, that is a lot of money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644256">How about those who are actively being punished by the government, which is desperate to raise revenue to pay for all of this corruption? These are people like Katie, a farmer in my riding, whose family also runs a grain drying and storage operation used by other local grain growers. She got a hold of me this week, actually. Her family, so far, has paid a total of $151,781.02 in carbon tax, plus $19,731.53 in HST, for a total of $171,512.55. The Liberals like to say that most Canadians get back more than they pay in carbon tax. If that is the case, Katie is still waiting for her $200,000 cheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644257">That is what angers people about these scandals. In just this speech today, I have highlighted over two billion dollars' worth of Liberal corruption and mismanagement. Those are tax dollars for hard-working Canadians. We need to find where this money went. People deserve answers and need to be held accountable. That is why, on June 10, we asked for the production of various documents related to SDTC—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644290"> It is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the great people of Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame to speak on this privilege motion on the failure to produce documents pertaining to funds delivered inappropriately by Sustainable Development Technology Canada. This is just another reason Canadians have lost faith in the corrupt NDP-Liberal government. It is one of the reasons 24 of the very people connected to this Liberal slush fund have decided to sign a letter asking the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to quit, which is what 40% plus of Canadians want him to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644291"> The government has become so corrupt that the business of the House has ground to a halt. This is the place where we represent the people who elected us and work on issues that are important to them, but no, the work has stopped. We have to debate this question of privilege until the corrupt entity across the way decides it has had enough and produces those documents, which the Chair of this House has demanded that it do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644292"> There is quite a simple remedy. On June 10, a motion was adopted calling for the production of documents related to SDTC to the law clerk. What happened over the summer? Very little. The documents were either redacted on the order of the corrupt <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or simply not produced at all. The common-sense <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege because of the failure to comply with the order of this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644293">On September 26, the Chair ruled that this House privilege had in fact been breached, so here we are debating and begging for accountability, once again, from the corrupt government that Canadians have had enough of. It is just another attempt to cover up Liberal corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644294">One might ask what is so corrupt about the green slush fund. The Auditor General sampled a five-year period of SDTC transactions and found that 82% were in conflict. Is anyone shocked? I doubt it. Twenty-four MPs just signed a document and presented it in caucus to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, demanding that he step down. They are demanding that he leave because his corruption and his cronies are taking away their chance of re-election, taking away their chance to sit in this place representing the people they love. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644295">What does 82% of these SDTC transactions look like? It looks like $330 million that was found to have been granted to Liberal insiders in conflicts of interest. It was found by investigating only 226 of the 405 transactions approved by the board over that five-year period, so no doubt it is just the tip of the iceberg.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644296">The board was headed by a close friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Andrée-Lise Méthot, appointed in 2016. That chair received $250 million for her very own venture capital firm, Cycle Capital, in the form of grants from the board that she became chair of. We cannot make this up. Before Méthot joined the board, a radical jumpsuit environmentalist lobbied for her, before he became the radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. He lobbied his crooked pals and the Prime Minister, and secured $111 million for her. Over Méthot's time on that board, a further $114 million went to so-called green companies she was invested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644297">All together, so far, it is looking like around $390 million was dished out to Liberal insiders through just this one crooked slush fund. I will speak about another slush fund a little further along. This one is called the green one, and I will refer to the other one as the blue slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644298">Let us get a little context here. The Chrétien sponsorship scandal was all over $42 million of taxpayer money that went to further the Liberal Party's cause at the time. That pales in comparison to the nearly $400 million represented in the green slush fund cover-up scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644299">Scandals are nothing new. We can look at the WE Charity. The Liberal government blew nearly $1 billion of taxpayers' money and passed it on to Liberal friends. This is nothing new. It is a continuation of a trend: SNC-Lavalin, the Aga Khan, the arrive scam, and it goes on and on. If the NDP-Liberal government is not removed from this place, it will continue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644300">This privilege debate over the green slush fund could come to an end very quickly. All the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has to do is follow the orders of the Chair, produce the documents, unredacted, and the privilege debate would come to an end. It would be all over. We could get back to the business of the House, working on trying to fix the country. It is impossible to get through to the people who sit across the way and to the crooked <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. However, it is not just him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644301"> There is something I am going to refer to as the blue slush fund, known to others as small craft harbours. It is going to be a real shocker. Would anyone be surprised to know that one member of the House, who just so happens to be the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation>, who administers the small craft harbours program, delivered 20% of the projects in this program to her very own riding this year?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644302">Really, does that add up? There are 338 members in this House and one of them gets 20% of the small craft harbours budget for her own riding, and signs off on it herself. We have East Pubnico and West Pubnico, two harbours where the landed value of the catch is higher than the entire Pacific catch in the commercial fisheries, and they did not get a nickel. Vessels are four abreast and wharves are condemned and falling apart. The fish harvesters cannot even receive fuel shipments because the wharves are not safe enough for the fuel trucks to pass over. There are hazards to anyone who uses those wharves. They could fall through broken planks or whatnot. Ladders are missing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644303">What is happening is unbelievable. There are a whole bunch of ridings in Atlantic Canada where a disproportionate amount of catch is being landed compared with the funding they receive from small craft harbours, while the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> uses the program as her very own slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644304">A few other things do not add up. I am not sure if members are aware that the oyster industry in P.E.I. is in great peril. In mid-July, it was discovered that the MSX parasite had been detected in three areas of P.E.I. By mid-August, the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> declared she is going to invest $500,000 a year in the P.E.I. oyster industry and have a summit this fall with industry experts to try to figure out what is going on. There have been no talks at a summit so far, but $500,000 this year and $500,000 next year have been committed to try to save an industry that means about $100 million to that small island economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644305">A report that came out a couple of weeks ago from the CFIA says it thinks MSX has spread all over P.E.I. Everywhere that virus has shown up, it has completely decimated oyster populations. If the oyster industry gets wiped out, it will take a minimum of three generations, or nine years, to start to rebuild. Those in the oyster industry in Prince Edward Island reached out and asked me to go to P.E.I. to see them. They said they had to explain it. I went to P.E.I. in August to meet with the stakeholders in the oyster industry and hear their pleas. All these pleas were being made to save a $100-million industry, and the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> offered $500,000. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644306">At the same time, the Atlantic healthy oceans initiative, or the AHOI group, an outfit that has five employees and three board members, one of whom works for two Liberal senators, received $1.8 million in grants. When I questioned the <Affiliation DbId="300019" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> yesterday in the fisheries committee, she had no idea who they were, and neither did her deputies. No one knew who they were, but everyone knows of the oyster industry in Prince Edward Island and how much it means to the economy, cultural fabric and even the tourism industry in the province.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644307"> Everyone has heard of the Malpeque oyster, which, in 1905, was named the number one oyster in the world in a Paris competition. This is very serious. There was $500,000 for a $100-million industry, including spinoffs, and $1.8 million for an ENGO that has five employees. It just does not make sense. Where are the Liberals' priorities?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644308">It is no surprise that Canadians are disgusted with the priorities of the government. It is no surprise that 24 backbenchers signed their names to have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> take a walk. Canadians have suffered long enough. They have suffered through a record cost of living rise and record food bank usage. Most of this is driven by the carbon tax.</ParaText>

I stood in this House not long ago and I spoke about rural crime in my riding, which the media downplayed and said I was exaggerating.

              <ParaText id="8644311">However, people are living in fear. Our senior citizens have to sleep with a baseball bat or a gun next to their bed. The people who built this country, paid taxes, worked hard and raised families have now retired and are not able to sleep at night.

              <ParaText id="8644343"> Madam Speaker, at a time when Canadians are struggling to put food on their table; when the dream of home ownership in Canada is just that, a dream for many young Canadians; and when our country is plagued by so many other serious challenges brought upon us by the failed policies of the incompetent and reckless government, we are here this afternoon continuing debate on the government's failure to live up to its responsibilities in your order to produce important documents pertaining to the Sustainable Development Technology Canada green slush fund scandal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644344">SDTC was established by the Government of Canada in 2001. As a federally funded foundation, it was responsible for the approval and disbursement of over $100 million annually in taxpayer funds to help Canadian companies develop and deploy sustainable technologies. For many years, SDTC operated responsibly and earned a generally good reputation for its work. However, that all changed in 2019, when former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains appointed Annette Verschuren as chair of SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644345">The issue at hand was conflict of interest. Verschuren was an entrepreneur who was already receiving SDTC funding through one of her companies, but then she was appointed by the Liberal government to hold responsibilities overseeing the very same funds her company was receiving. That fact alone should have sounded alarm bells and set off red flashing lights to alert everyone in the government to the obvious conflict of interest at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644346">In fact, it was no secret. The minister, the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office all knew and were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair. However, the warnings all fell on deaf ears and indifference, as Verschuren was appointed by the Liberal minister anyway. How can we tell that a government has lost its moral compass? It is when it makes poor decisions like this one without concern for doing the right thing and without fear of consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644347">Only two years later, Minister Bains announced in January 2021 that he had decided to step away from politics and not run again in the upcoming federal election. That same year, SDTC entered into a five-year, $1-billion agreement with the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644348">Fast-forward to Fall 2024, and it is clear that the Liberals are trying desperately to run away and wash their hands of this mess, which they laid the foundation for through their own actions, especially after the Auditor General released a scathing report about SDTC in June 2024. The AG found massive issues at SDTC, which resulted in the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice—Champlain, abolishing the SDTC and immediately transferring its funds to the National Research Council Canada. These are truly astonishing developments in just three years for something the Liberal government does not want to talk about anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644349">What did the AG find that was so bad as to cause all this carnage? In June 2024, she found that SDTC had demonstrated “significant lapses in governance and stewardship of public funds”. Nearly 20% of the SDTC projects examined by the AG were in fact ineligible, based on the government's own rules for funding, for a total price tag of $59 million. There were also 90 instances when the SDTC ignored conflict of interest provisions while awarding $76 million to various projects. The AG found 63 cases where the SDTC directors voted in favour of payment to companies in which they had declared conflicts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644350">The AG report concluded, “Not managing conflicts of interest—whether real, perceived, or potential—increases the risk that an individual's duty to act in the best interests of the foundation is affected, particularly when making decisions to award funding." It also blamed the government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, whose ministry or department did not sufficiently monitor the contribution agreements with SDTC.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644351">Believe it or not, it gets far worse. Since June, the Auditor General has found that directors had awarded funding to projects that were ineligible and where conflicts of interest existed. She found that over $300 million in taxpayers' money was paid out in over 180 cases where there were potential conflicts of interests, where Liberal-appointed directors funnelled money to companies they owned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644352">Time after time, the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have shown total contempt for Canada's ethic laws. In fact the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself has been found the subject of three ethics investigations and has been found guilty of breaking ethics laws twice. The Liberal government allows the culture of law-breaking to persist, as six Liberals have been found guilty of breaking ethics laws. The Liberals have gone through ethical scandals before; that is why they are withholding the documents, breaching parliamentary privilege and trying desperately to sweep the mess under the rug and move on to the next thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644353"> However, the common-sense Conservatives are not going to let the Liberals get away with it. We are holding the corrupt Liberal government to account. It will be held responsible for its carelessness, recklessness and, indeed, corruption. That is why on June 10 the House of Commons adopted the following motion proposed by common-sense Conservatives on this important matter:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644354">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House order the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) and the Auditor General of Canada each to deposit with the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, within 14 days of the adoption of this order, the following documents, created or dated since January 1, 2017, which are in its or her possession, custody or control...</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644355">The motion then detailed what documents were to be supplied, and then directed that “the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel shall provide forthwith any documents received by him, pursuant to this order, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644356">The common-sense Conservative motion passed with the support of the New Democrats, the Green Party and the Bloc Québécois. Only the Liberals opposed it. To be clear, nothing in the motion orders the RCMP to conduct an investigation. The House is simply asking that the documents be turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644357">Fourteen days came and went, and instead of complying with the adopted motion, federal departments outright refused the House order or provided heavily redacted documents, citing provisions in the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act. This is not a good look.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644358"> Further, nothing in the House order contemplated redactions to documents being made by the government. That is because the House of Commons enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents. That is not limited by statute; the powers are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644359"> In response to the Liberal government's failure to produce the documents, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> rightly raised a question of privilege, arguing that a House privilege had been breached due to the failure to comply with the House order. On September 26, you issued a ruling on the question of privilege raised, and you found that the privileges of the House had in fact been breached. Today, nearly a month later, we continue our important debate on the matter and continue our demands for the Liberal government to provide the RCMP with the unredacted SDTC documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644360">You have ruled that the government has violated a House order to turn over evidence to the RCMP in the latest Liberal scandal, the $400-million green slush fund scandal. The Liberal government's refusal to respect your ruling has paralyzed Parliament, pushing aside all other work to address issues such as the cruel and crippling carbon tax, the cost of living crisis Canadians face for food and shelter, and the increasing crime, disorder and chaos in our streets, our communities and cities. This is happening at a time when the cost of food, fuel and shelter are all up and millions of Canadians are having to line up outside food banks just to survive. Sadly, as Canadians continue to struggle, life for well-connected Liberal insiders has never been so good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644361">One of the drivers of this hardship is the cruel NDP-Liberal carbon tax. In fact the carbon tax will cost the average Ontarian $903 this year. This is completely unacceptable to the constituents in my communities of Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie, who work hard for their money, who save carefully for their future and who dream of a better tomorrow. Instead of doing anything about climate change, the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is impoverishing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644362">Recently the PBO confirmed that Canadians will suffer a net cost, paying more in the carbon tax than they will ever get back in rebates. Unfortunately the NDP-Liberal government does not care. Instead of giving Canadians the tax relief they deserve, the government hiked the carbon tax by 23% last year as part of its plan to actually quadruple the carbon tax by 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644363"> It turns out that the carbon tax is not a tool to fight climate change like the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> argues; it is just another tax grab. Canadians can add it to the long list of growing NDP-Liberal taxes they already pay, including income tax, sales tax, excise tax, underutilized housing tax, property tax, capital gains tax and more. After listing all those taxes, it is easy to see why Canadians are getting poor. It is because the government is taking more of their hard-earned money away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644364"> The STDC scandal is also happening at a time when costs are up for food. In fact food will cost families $700 more this year than it did in 2023. That is because when the government taxes the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who ships the food and the store that stocks, stores and sells the food, it ends up taxing the family that buys the food. As Sylvain Charlebois, the “food professor” and director of Dalhousie University Agri-Food Analytics Labs, has said, the costly NDP-Liberal “carbon tax likely adds a significant cost burden to the Canadian food industry”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644365">Canadians are going hungry. That is evident by the massive surge in demand and need at food banks. Food bank usage has increased every year the NDP-Liberal government has been in office, because its inflationary spending and punishing carbon tax have hiked up the price of groceries, causing Canadians to skip meals, eat less healthy food and rely on food banks to survive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644366"> This was confirmed recently by Feed Ontario, which revealed that a record one million people visited a food bank in Ontario in 2024. That is a dramatic increase of 25% from the previous year. In fact Feed Ontario's CEO told media that she never thought she would see this day. She has been with the organization 15 years and never thought it would see this level of demand. She cannot believe it has reached a point where numbers are so drastically high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644367">Food Banks Canada reported earlier this year that it had seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021, with food banks handling a record two million visits in a single month in 2023. Of the people visiting food banks in Ontario, one in three visitors is a child. Only one in six adults visiting food banks is unemployed; the NDP-Liberal government's cost of living crisis has become so severe that even working Canadians are having to depend on food banks to get by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644368"> The numbers reflect what is happening across Niagara too. Let us try to wrap our heads around the following statistics from Project Share, which serves vulnerable residents in Niagara Falls. Last year Project Share saw a 20% increase in people served, compared to the previous year, and 4,740 people accessed its services for the first time. On average, 120 families per day accessed its essential support services. In total, 13,995 people were served last year, which equates to one in seven residents in Niagara Falls having accessed its essential support services just last year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644369"> We should be debating these issues, and we could if the government simply abided by the Speaker's ruling and provided the documents the House has requested. Why are the Liberals so hesitant to do what is right? Is it that they do not want to speak to the situation facing young Canadians and first-time homebuyers, which is so bad that the Canadian dream of home ownership is dying? Two-thirds of young people believe they will never be able to afford a home. Canadians see the housing crisis most tragically in our streets, where there are now 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario and thousands more across the country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644370">Time after time, the NDP-Liberal government has promised to fix the housing crisis, but the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has been clear that the number of new homes being built is not enough to reduce the existing supply gap and improve affordability for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644371">Crime is also getting worse under the watch of the NDP-Liberal government. Again, perhaps that is why they refuse to hand over these documents: so we cannot debate these issues, which are so important to all of our constituents. Since 2015, when the Liberals formed government, the number of auto thefts has skyrocketed by 45%, violent crime has increased by 50% and hate crimes have increased by 251%. In addition, just recently, the Toronto Police Association had to come out publicly and fact-check the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. When the Prime Minister attempted to brag about banning firearms for law-abiding firearms owners while continuing to ignore the crime wave he has unleashed across the country, the Toronto Police Association reminded him that, in just the last year, shootings have gone up 45% and gun-related homicides have gone up 62% in Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644372">The reality is that the Liberals' soft-on-crime approach is making life easier for violent criminals by repealing mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes with Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and making it easier to get bail with Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Meanwhile, it is failing to stop the flow of illegal guns across the U.S. border. The issues I noted are all pressing, and parliamentarians should be debating them. However, the House of Commons has seized because the government is refusing to comply with the House order to hand over SDTC documents to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644373"> Canadians are suffering great hardship after nine years of the NDP-Liberal coalition. The country is headed in the wrong direction, and we are all worse off than we were about 10 years ago. The Speaker ruled that the government has violated a House order to turn over evidence to the RCMP about the latest Liberal scandal, the $400-million green slush fund. The Liberal government's refusal to respect the Speaker's ruling has paralyzed Parliament, pushing aside all other debate. It is time for the Liberals to end their corrupt cover-up and provide the ordered documents to the police so that Parliament can get back to work and Canadians can have the accountability they so rightly deserve.</ParaText>

A lot of local business owners currently benefit from our tourism economy, and our hope is to grow that. We should be talking about that.

              <ParaText id="8644386">Madam Speaker, the member speaks to the importance of food security and poverty elimination in Canada, which is a very valuable debate and something we should make time for in the House. He talked about Feed Ontario and various food security organizations and food banks. Then he immediately launched into his typical slogans on carbon pricing, although none of those food security organizations have mentioned carbon pricing or the elimination of a so-called carbon tax in their advocacy. They want more poverty reduction strategies. They have all acknowledged that the Canada carbon rebate reduces poverty; they also recognize that carbon emissions and climate change itself have an impact on food prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644387">When will the Conservatives recognize that the Canada carbon rebate is supporting families in need? It is eliminating food security challenges in Canada. We need to fight climate change and lower emissions in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of food prices in Canada and around the world. If Conservatives are going to quote food banks and food security organizations, they ought to listen to what they are advocating for, which is poverty elimination, not carbon taxing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644392"> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House this afternoon as the member of Parliament for Hastings—Lennox and Addington.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644393"> In most offices on Parliament Hill, there is, perched upon a bookshelf, an unassuming little book, about an inch wide, and if a member or a staffer has been here for some time, it is likely collecting a fair amount of dust. Outside of a House leader's office, there is not too much need for this book, with its greyish-blue hard cover, inlaid in faux gold with the mace of the House of Commons. I certainly never thought I would ever have the need for it when I started my parliamentary career three years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644394">However, thanks to the government and the hard work of one of its former colleagues, it became incredibly valuable in the preparation of my remarks this afternoon. I am, of course, talking about <I>The Power of Parliamentary Houses to Send for Persons, Papers and Records: A Sourcebook on the Law and Precedent of Parliamentary Subpoena Powers for Canadian and Other Houses</I>, a book by former Liberal MP Derek Lee. To Mr. Lee, I send my thanks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644395">The reason I want to bring up this authority is because it is my firm belief that Canadians need to know why opposition parties, both past and present, take such umbrage with what is currently happening in this place. Far too often, we as members can get lost in the ebb and flow of the internal machinations of the House of Commons, or perhaps take it for granted that people who are tuning in are as knowledgeable in procedure as some of us may be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644396">If members will indulge me, I would like to first talk about the how. One of Parliament's privileges, the power to send for persons, papers and records, is a cornerstone of the functions of every legislative responsibility and every legislative assembly. It is important to note that this power, to send for persons, papers and records, as a law of Parliament, is constitutional in nature. It is so fundamental that it has scarcely been altered over the centuries, and as a matter of law, cannot be altered except by the express will of Parliament itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644397">The power of a House of Parliament to send for persons, papers and records is an essential element of a democratic legislative function founded on the rule of law. One of the cornerstone privileges of both historic and modern Parliaments and other assemblies, the term is often better understood when restated in more contemporary language. Based on principles firmly established in constitutional and parliamentary law, a House of Parliament has the full authority to summon and compel the attendance and testimony of any person and to summon and compel the production of any document.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644398">I think this section is very straightforward. The House has the power to compel documents. This is the overarching umbrella under which we are now operating. It stands to reason that the next question would be if this authority extend to ministers, and if so, if there are limitations on what they can do. Mr. Lee writes that, under the law, ministers of the Crown enjoy no special status of privilege before the House or a committee. Any difference in treatment is either for political reasons or because the minister is a member of a House. In other words, legally speaking, a minister who is not a member of a House may be treated like any other member of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644399">He further writes that, when the House orders a return from the government without a deadline specified, it is the government's bounden duty to bring it down to the House as quickly as possible. This Canadian reference is one of those cited by Bourinot, the third clerk of the House of Commons, for his statement that, if a person neglects to furnish a return or frames it so as knowingly to mislead the House, it will be considered a breach of privilege, and he will be liable to reprimand or punishment.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644400"> When a deadline is imposed, therefore, and a minister fails to comply, he or she may be found in contempt and punished by the House or other powers used to coerce the minister to comply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644401">Again, it is pretty clear that, if the House asks, the government must comply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644402">Now we have two very important pieces to explain the how. First, Parliament has the power to compel the production of documents. Second, it is allowed to compel documentation from ministers and the government, and they must comply. From the words of the Speaker, it very much appears that the government failed to comply with the lawful order of the House, which leads us to the why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644403"> In 2001, the government of the day established an arm's-length organization, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, for which the stated aim was to demonstrate new technologies to promote sustainable development, including technologies to address issues related to climate change and the quality of air, water and soil. There was no issue with this organization during its first governance period, and that is a fairly impressive statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644404">The Jean Chrétien Liberals managed to not abuse the program. The Paul Martin Liberals managed to not line the pockets of their lackeys. The Stephen Harper Conservatives fought off the urge to swindle the taxpayers. The Liberals, enter the scene, far left, were ready to put the gift in grift. There was 400 million in taxpayer dollars stolen out of the pockets of hard-working Canadian families and funnelled into the silk-lined jackets of Liberal Party insiders. Members need not take my word for it. The non-partisan Auditor General has much to say on the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644405">The Auditor General released a scathing report with such headers as: “The Foundation awarded funding to ineligible projects”; “The foundation’s records showed that the conflict-of-interest policies were not followed in 90 cases”; “The Foundation did not report conflicts of interest to the department”; “Legal requirements for the number of the foundation’s members were not met”; and my personal favourite, “The department did not monitor conflicts of interest at the foundation”.</ParaText>

The only difference is that the current administration was the only one out of four that looked at it and thought to itself, “Let's abuse it.” Considering that the Chrétien and Martin governments, which were run by two individuals who were heavily involved in the ad scam scandal, gave this grift a pass, I would wager to say that the current government opting to siphon funds from this particular program is bordering on profound.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644413">When it was politically expedient, the Liberals, New Democrats and Bloc members decided that they could not bear the thought of a government's using redactions in documents and decided to find it in contempt and force an election, even though that backfired cartoonishly on two of the three parties. However, today, the Liberals suddenly seem perfectly fine with it, going so far as to accuse the Conservatives of slowing down Parliament. I keep hearing about the millions of dollars a day being spent on holding the government to account, yet the Liberals are suspiciously quiet on the $400 million that was funnelled into the pockets of Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644414">Let us take a step back. I would like to go back to a better time. Food costs were less. Housing was much more affordable.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8644461"> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today in this very interesting discussion we are having. For those just joining us or those watching on social media, I will give a bit of background before I really get into things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644462">On June 10, the House of Commons adopted a motion demanding the production of various documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada. I will refer to it as SDTC. All those documents were for review by the RCMP. However, in response, several departments of the federal government either outright refused to comply with the House order or redacted the documents provided. Some excuses cited the Access to Information Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644463">Notably, the House order did not allow for any redactions. It was a straightforward motion on the production of documents. Parliament does have the power to do that, and we have that power because Parliament holds the government, the executive branch, to account. That is a very important part of our parliamentary democracy. For additional context, the House's absolute and unfettered power to order documents is in our Constitution and has been a major part of Parliament's history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644464">Considering the failure to produce the documents, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> raised a question of privilege asserting that a breach of House privilege had occurred, a point confirmed by the Speaker's ruling that the privileges of the House had been violated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644465">The green slush fund scandal began late in 2018 when the former Liberal industry minister, Navdeep Bains, raised concerns about Jim Balsillie, the Harper-era chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, due to his public criticism of the government's privacy legislation. The minister's office requested that Jim Balsillie cease his criticisms, prompting the Liberal minister to propose two alternative chairs to the CEO of SDTC, one of whom was an entrepreneur receiving funding through SDTC. That is very important to remember.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644466">Despite the warnings about the risks of appointing a conflicted chair, given that SDTC had never had a chair with vested interests in funded companies, the minister knew better and proceeded with the appointment in the summer of 2019 anyway. This decision then led to an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated, as board members awarded funding to companies in which they held stakes. Despite witnessing 186 conflicts at the board level, officials at ISED, Innovation, Science and Economic Development, took no action. They witnessed potential wrongdoing and did nothing about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644467">In January 2021, the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> succeeded Minister Bains, but he did nothing to correct the obvious conflict of interest taking place right under his nose. A year later, whistle-blowers reported unethical practices at SDTC to the Auditor General, and following these revelations, the Privy Council was briefed and two independent reports were commissioned. Another year passed, and in September 2023, the whistle-blowers made their allegations public, prompting the Liberal minister to finally take action and suspend SDTC funding. Two months later, the Auditor General announced an audit of SDTC, which culminated in a damning report, released in June 2024, revealing a complete breakdown of governance and accountability by the minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644468"> Unfortunately, nothing seems to shock Canadians anymore about the Liberal government. My constituents are quite frustrated, but mostly they have come to unfortunately expect this level of corruption and incompetence. I really cannot blame Canadians, though. We have to look at the Liberals' substantial and abysmal record on these scandals. Perhaps a brief overview of some of the many scandals would help to put this latest one into perspective.<B /></ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644469"> The SNC-Lavalin scandal unfolded in 2019 when it was revealed that senior officials in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office had pressured then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin, a major engineering firm facing bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya. She resisted those pressures, leading to her demotion and eventual resignation, as well as the resignation of several other officials, including another cabinet minister. The controversy ignited a national debate over political interference in the judicial process, raising questions about the integrity of the government decision-making and the rule of law. An ethics investigation later concluded that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had violated the Conflict of Interest Act, further intensifying public scrutiny and leading to significant political fallout for the Liberal Party. The scandal underscored the challenges of balancing economic interests with ethical governance in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644470">The WE scandal emerged in 2020 when it was revealed that the Liberal government awarded a multi-million dollar contract to the WE Charity to administer a student grant program, despite the organization's close ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his then finance minister Bill Morneau. Does that sound familiar? As in the current scandal, critics raised concerns about conflicts of interest, as both the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and then finance minister Morneau had personal connections to the charity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644471">Public outcry intensified when it was disclosed that the charity was planning to pay large sums to the Prime Minister's family for speaking engagements, leading to allegations of favouritism, a lack of transparency and much more. The scandal prompted multiple parliamentary investigations and led to the resignation of the finance minister, while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> faced significant scrutiny over his government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the controversy highlighted issues of accountability and ethics within the federal government, leading to calls for greater oversight of public contracts and lobbying activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644472"> The ArriveCAN scandal emerged in 2022 when it was revealed that the government had spent over $54 million on a mobile app designed to facilitate border crossings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argued that the app was overly complicated and ineffective and imposed unnecessary burdens on travellers, leading to significant frustration. Allegations surfaced regarding the government's failure to adequately test the app and the lack of clarity on its effectiveness in managing public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644473">The controversy further intensified when it was disclosed that the app collected personal, sensitive data, raising privacy concerns among Canadians. This situation sparked widespread criticism from opposition parties and led to calls for accountability and transparency regarding the government's pandemic response strategies. The scandal highlighted issues of mismanagement and raised questions about the efficiency of government initiatives during a crisis. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644474">More recently, and still unfolding, we have two more scandals worth mentioning. First is the indigenous procurement scandal, which has revealed that the government made significant missteps in its efforts to boost indigenous participation in federal procurement. Critics highlighted instances where contracts meant to benefit indigenous businesses were awarded to non-indigenous firms, undermining the intent of initiatives aimed at fostering economic development for indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644475">There were allegations of mismanagement and a lack of oversight. Indeed, one need only upload a picture of a cute mammal to qualify. This sums the whole debate up. It is about trust. It undermines the trust of indigenous people, who are trying to take the government at its word. The documents issue we have here is about the trust in Parliament and government that Canadians must have. Of course, as expected, the ongoing scandal has prompted calls for reform in procurement to ensure that contracts genuinely serve indigenous interests and has raised broader questions about the government's commitment to reconciliation and equitable economic opportunities for indigenous people. As a result, there were increased demands for transparency and adherence to commitments made to indigenous communities in federal policies. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644476">Then there is the ongoing foreign interference scandal, highlighting that foreign entities, particularly from China, had attempted to influence Canadian elections and politics. Reports indicated that foreign agents engaged in tactics such as the intimidation and harassment of Canadian citizens and attempted to manipulate electoral outcomes by funnelling money to candidates. The scandal escalated when security agencies, including CSIS, revealed that it had warned certain members of Parliament about threats to their safety stemming from foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644477">This revelation has led to widespread public concern and outrage over the integrity of Canadian democracy. The Liberal government continues to face criticism for its inaction and lack of transparency regarding these threats, prompting calls from the Conservatives to release the names of the compromised parliamentarians in the CSIS report and for stronger measures to protect national sovereignty and enhance accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644478">This Liberal scandal has highlighted the failures of the Liberal government and the urgent need for reforms to safeguard against foreign interference. The lack of transparency, ethics, accountability and safeguarding of the interests of Canadians is a pattern that is consistent throughout all Liberal scandals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644479">Let us now turn to yet another one, the one we are talking about today. Sustainable Development Technology Canada, for those wondering, was a federally funded non-profit organization established in 2021 to support the development of clean technologies aimed at addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. With a mandate to disburse over $100 million, SDTC administered the SD tech fund to finance innovative projects related to air quality, clean water and soil health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644480">However, significant governance issues emerged, particularly following the appointment of conflicted executives by former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains in 2019. Under the new chair appointed by the minister, the board began approving funding for projects where executives had direct conflicts of interest, resulting in over $390 million being awarded improperly. Whistle-blowers raised concerns about financial mismanagement, prompting investigations by the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner that revealed severe lapses in governance and compliance standards at SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644481">Here is just some of the damning testimony from the SDTC whistle-blowers:</ParaText>

The law clerk would then give them to the RCMP and the RCMP could do with them whatever it wants. That argument should have been made in June when the majority of the members of Parliament in this House voted to get those documents handed over handed over to the law clerk. What the Liberal MPs are trying to do is to rehash the same argument we have already had in the chamber. A majority of this chamber, which was made up of all of the opposition parties, voted against Liberal MPs to get the release of these much-needed documents, which would show off the corruption in the Liberal government.</ParaText>

Then it is happening, but they are not going to deal with it or will try to memory-hole it somehow. With the Liberal government, this happens every single time.

One involved the former minister, who did not like what the current chair was saying publicly about some Liberal policies and was then replaced by two individuals, one of whom had a company that was receiving funding from that organization. The person who was co-chairing it was actively a participant in receiving funds for whatever projects they applied.

              <ParaText id="8644518"> Madam Speaker, today I will speak about the production of documents ordered by the House regarding the latest Liberal scandal, the billion-dollar green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644519"> I have the honour and privilege of being a member of the public accounts committee. We received a damning report from the Auditor General last June when she found that the Liberal government had turned the once-legitimate Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. The Auditor General found that the Liberal-appointed SDTC board gave $330 million of taxpayer money to companies where the board members who voted to give out that money had a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644520"> In addition, the Auditor General found that the same Liberal-appointed board approved another $59 million in projects that were not eligible for funding because they were outside the SDTC foundation's mandate. The Auditor General said that at least 10 of those projects did not even produce green technology or contribute anything whatsoever to emissions reduction. What a mess that was, and what a joke too, but what a farce and what a sad day it was for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644521"> At the public accounts committee, we have been diligently trying to get to the bottom of the $400-million Liberal scandal since the Auditor General submitted her disturbing report, but we are being stonewalled by every single witness. Just yesterday, a senior official from the Privy Council Office, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own department, testified as we were trying to seek clarity on Annette Verschuren's appointment as SDTC chairperson in 2019. The lack of consistency in witness testimony certainly looks like a cover-up at the highest levels of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644522"> Ms. Verschuren has testified that she did not apply for the chairperson role but had been called two or three times by former industry minister Navdeep Bains, asking her to take the job. This was after a year-long selection process that had already produced a short list of names for former minister Bains, but then suddenly Ms. Verschuren's name was suspiciously added.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644523">Everyone whom we have had the luxury of talking to has given a different account. Some would say that the opposition is skeptical. Well, of course we are. Everybody is telling a different story. We have not been able to find out why there was a last-minute addition. It certainly was the beginning of the culture of corruption at the Liberals' green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644524"> At the public accounts committee, we received the following information this week. Ms. Verschuren submitted an application to the selection process for the role of chairperson of SDTC on April 30, 2019. She was then interviewed by the selection committee as part of the selection process on May 14, 2019. Her application, interview and references were assessed by the selection committee. She was found to have met the selection criteria for the position. She was then identified as a qualified candidate for the role in an advice letter to then minister Bains dated May 21, 2019. She was appointed chairperson of SDTC on June 19, 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644525">My question for PCO officials was regarding their belief that Ms. Verschuren had applied for the position of chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada through the Privy Council portal. However, as I said earlier, she testified at the industry committee on September 16 that she had not applied for the chair position. She said that the former Liberal industry minister Bains approached her two or three times to take the position of the chair of the Liberals' green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644526">In his testimony to the public accounts committee on October 9, the former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains stated that he could not recall asking her to take the position. Perhaps he had amnesia. Perhaps he misremembered. In the end, we know the truth. If it walks like a duck and looks like a duck, it must be a duck. I mean, this is our job; this is what we have to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644527"> Something smells awfully fishy here, and I know the smell of fish because I represent lobster fishermen and I am a salmon fisherman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644528"> Yesterday, we tried to understand how there could be such a discrepancy between Ms. Verschuren's testimony and Mr. Bains' recollection. The PCO officials had testified before that a formal letter of advice would have been provided to the former industry minister containing a list of names of qualified candidates. At that point, it would have been up to the minister working with his office to determine the choice of candidate for chair he would recommend for cabinet's approval. PCO officials also testified that they would have undertaken a full assessment process for suitable candidates who would have been eligible for the position. We can see the trend, and it is very alarming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644529"> Considering both the Auditor General's June report and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner's Verschuren report in July 2024, we are perplexed and find it strange as to why, and I am repeating what a member of the bureaucracy we met this week said, such a merit-based process would not have uncovered the serious conflicts of interest Ms. Verschuren brought to the job as SDTC chair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644530">Also, the former CEO of SDTC had also raised serious concerns with the minister's office and elsewhere about the new chair's conflict of interest. The former CEO of SDTC told the industry committee that:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644534">So, in this case, we have one individual who simply tried to do their job, and tried to do it ethically, morally, the right way, and we have a cabinet minister who did not take that advice and brought in somebody with serious conflicts of interest. We will continue to try to find the truth about why the former minister, Mr. Bains, thought it so necessary to appoint a chair with such blatant conflicts of interest despite repeated warnings from the organization's CEO not to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644535">The Auditor General's June report found, according to the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors, 90 cases that were connected to approval decisions representing $76 million in funding awarded to projects where the foundation's conflict of interest policies were not even remotely followed. The board of the green slush fund did not ensure that the foundation complied with its enabling legislation. That is alarming. SDTC is entirely funded through public money. The Auditor General stated, “With that comes an expectation that it holds the highest standards for ethical practices.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644536">Conflicts of interest that are not disclosed or managed call into question the objectivity and impartiality of the foundation and its directors. In light of these damning reports, we have tried to get the former Liberal industry minister, Mr. Bains, to answer questions about Ms. Verschuren's questionable appointment as chair and why he was convinced she was the right person for the position even with all of her conflicts of interest. Unfortunately, he has not been willing to answer our questions so far and has been called back next week. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644537">We have also asked if it is not the role of the Privy Council Office to ensure that all proposed appointments meet all requirements. However, once again, we have been stonewalled at public accounts; normal and typical behaviour. Yesterday, my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278440" Type="2">Edmonton West</Affiliation>, asked the PCO officials a simple question: Who ordered the documents to be redacted before they were submitted to Parliament? He did not get an answer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644538">It is important to point out that the Privy Council Office is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> personal department. It takes its marching orders directly from the Prime Minister's Office. Some people say that there must be a nefarious reason that the Prime Minister's own department continues to block access to thousands of documents related to the Liberals' green slush fund.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644539">As part of her investigation, the Auditor General conducted a governance audit of SDTC. She did not conduct a criminal investigation. A whistle-blower told the public accounts committee that he is confident criminal intent will be identified if the documents in question are turned over to the RCMP. Could this be the reason the department officials have redacted and refused to turn over the documents, to prevent criminal intent from being identified?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644540">The PCO's telling departments to send in redacted documents has resulted in the Speaker's ruling that they are in breach of members' privilege because the order from the House of Commons did not say “redact”. Because the Speaker has ruled that the NDP-Liberals violated a House order to turn over unredacted documents and did not co-operate with the production order, we continue to talk about the green slush fund scandal today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644541">It is important to note something. I remember the sponsorship scandal of the 1990s well. I was much younger then, and I followed politics a little, from a distance. I was in junior high or high school; I may be dating myself a bit. If we can imagine it, that was the big scandal of the day in my youth. That is the first one that I remember. I am sure there were many others. I know there were, historically, but this is the one that stands out to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644542">I hope people are watching because there is an interesting aspect to this. The sponsorship scandal was only one-eighth the size of the green slush fund scandal. Can we imagine that? We are talking about $400 million in taxpayers' money, given to friends fraught with conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644543"> I know it bothers the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. I know it bothers everybody in here from these other parties. They are not getting up today to speak, because they would sooner ask me questions about why I care and why the Conservative Party cares about $400 million that went missing and where it is. The Conservative Party is doing the good work for the people of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644544">At the public accounts committee, we ask questions to provide oversight of taxpayers' dollars, to check for value for money and whether programs have achieved value. Members have privileges at public accounts. One of those privileges is that, when witnesses come into hearings, they are not there to evade. There are no bonus points for trying not to answer the questions. They are called in as witnesses to public hearings. They are there to answer those very important questions, and it is our job to ask those questions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644545"> The Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest. In just a sampling of the SDTC board decisions, with a five-year sample period, the Auditor General actually found that 82% of funding transactions that she looked at were conflicted. Eighty-two per cent had conflicts of interest. We can let that sink in.</ParaText>

The taxpayers deserve clarity. They deserve accountability. That is the oversight we try to provide at the public accounts committee and here in the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644547">It is alarming and deeply disappointing to me that the Liberal government members on the public accounts committee do not want to simply find the truth for Canadians. They do not call out witnesses who evade questions at committee hearings. They actually defend them over and over again, and they bring up continuous points of order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644548">As I stated, when former Liberal industry minister Bains testified earlier this month, he would not answer our questions. That is why he is being called back. Mr. Bains knows the political process. He knows what is acceptable and what is not. He would know what it means to be held accountable and to be transparent with taxpayers' dollars. As a former cabinet minister and member of the Privy Council, he must be held to a higher standard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644549">When discussing the appointment of Ms. Verschuren, Mr. Bains told the president of SDTC, who questioned her conflict issues, that they would manage her conflicts as they appointed her the chair. Who is this referring to? Could it be the PMO? Who said, “Oh, don't worry; we'll manage all the conflicts. There are only 186 of them so far. We will look after them. We will look after them for the people. We are going to do a good job here.”</ParaText>

He was and will always be a member of the Privy Council, forever bound by those rules</ParaText>

It was a lot of money for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked appointees, the chair and others, who got themselves into a position to benefit their own companies. It is deeply shameful, discouraging and disappointing, and it is pathetic too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644552">The $400 million may not seem like a lot of money to some Liberal members, but there are record numbers of people at food banks.

Rent is way up. All of these affordability problems are on the watch of the current government, which has inflated prices.

              <ParaText id="8644555"> It is deeply disappointing that we are still here today talking about the Liberal green slush fund scandal of $400 million.

              <ParaText id="8644594"> Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House on behalf of the Westman residents. Today, as in past weeks, we are once again seeking clarity on why the Liberal government has refused to comply with a binding House order to produce documents related to Sustainable Development Technology Canada, better known now as SDTC, and perhaps better known to Canadians as the Liberal green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644595">Let us take a moment to recap what we already know. The Auditor General conducted a thorough investigation into SDTC's governance after a whistle-blower came forward. What she uncovered was shocking. As my colleagues have stated, nearly 400 million dollars' worth of contracts were inappropriately awarded by the board of directors, all of whom had multiple conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644596">As reported by The Globe and Mail:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Some of the complaints alleged SDTC had made grants to startups and technology accelerators with ties to its own senior management, or to companies or technology accelerators that were ineligible because they were too established. The complainants also alleged a volatile workplace under [the CEO of Sustainable Development Technology Canada] Ms. Lawrence, marked by high staff turnover rates and stress-related leaves.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644598">The Auditor General determined these complaints were rooted in serious issues within SDTC. Ultimately at issue is the Auditor General's finding that Liberal appointees gave nearly 400 million tax dollars to their own companies, which involved 186 conflicts of interest. That is nearly $400 million wasted, or stolen tax dollars, while so many of our fellow Canadians cannot afford the cost of gas, groceries and home heating. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644599">After nine years, Canadians are yet again reminded that the Liberal government is not worth the cost, not worth the crime and certainly not worth the corruption. SDTC was a Crown corporation fully funded by Canadian taxpayers. Every member of its board of directors, including the CEO, was appointed by the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644600">When the Auditor General began her review, she found that $58 million had been awarded to 10 ineligible projects. Furthermore, an additional $334 million was linked to 186 projects for which the nine board members had conflicts of interest and failed to recuse themselves from the decision-making process. In fact, nearly 59 million dollars' worth of projects had no contribution agreements, nor were the terms of those agreements met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644601">The Auditor General made it abundantly clear that this failure lies squarely at the feet of the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister of industry</Affiliation>, who failed to ensure proper oversight or governance. Instead, he turned a blind eye when it was revealed that public money was being funnelled to Liberal insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644602">We now know that the RCMP has launched an investigation into the nine directors identified by the Auditor General in the SDTC green slush fund scandal. The RCMP has also confirmed it is using some of the documents turned over by the parliamentary law clerk. However, this raises serious questions. Why is the government willing to provide only some documents while other departments have outright refused? Even more absurdly, some departments have claimed they are not even part of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644603">To give Canadians a sense of just how bizarre this situation is, here are a few departments that refused to produce documents: the Department of Justice, of all places; the Canada Revenue Agency; the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency; Global Affairs; the department of housing; the Department of National Defence; and Natural Resources Canada. The list goes on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644604">The question is simple: Why will these Liberal ministers not turn over the documents to the police? What is so damning in them that, while the RCMP confirms it has some documents, the Liberals and their co-conspirators refuse to hand over the rest? Canadians have a right to know what is in those documents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644605">The House of Commons has spoken on the matter. The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has ruled that the Liberals violated a House order to turn over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation. That is pretty serious. Moreover, the decision to refuse to turn over the documents has left the House paralyzed as day after day the Speaker's ruling is not adhered to by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644606">We cannot and should not let the corruption slide. The Liberals keep saying that we should move on and look away. “There is nothing here to see”, they say. If there is one thing we can all agree on, it is that no one wants to spend their time talking about this kind of gross mismanagement and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644607">It just plain should not have happened, but it did, and now it has become impossible for the House to focus its full attention on the needs of Canadians. We should be addressing the doubling of housing costs. We should be addressing the Liberal government's policies that have resulted in inflation and higher prices for gas and groceries. We should be addressing rising crime and chaos in our cities and rural crime outside our urban centres. We could be having a very different debate right now if the Liberals ended the cover-up and provided the evidence to the RCMP. That is all it would take to get this place focused on the priorities to which we need to return our attention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644608">Should we really be surprised by any of this? After all, the current Liberal government has been ethically challenged every step of the way during its years in power. It has been plagued by scandals and continues to demonstrate a culture of corruption. We only need to look back at its history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644609">Let us begin with the SNC-Lavalin scandal in 2019. In that case, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> pressured his then justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to approve contracts for SNC-Lavalin and grant it a pardon, allowing it to bid on government contracts again. However, when she refused to comply, the Prime Minister removed her from her position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644610">Next there was the WE Charity scandal in 2020, in which the Liberals attempted to funnel over half a billion dollars, so this was not just a wee scandal, to their associates at the WE Charity. Fortunately this was halted, but not before it was revealed that former finance minister Bill Morneau had close ties to WE. His daughter worked for the organization, and he advocated for it without recusing himself from the decision-making process. Although the Ethics Commissioner cleared the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that does not erase the fact that his close family members have received nearly $500,000 from WE Charity since he took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644611">Foreign interference is yet another issue where the Liberals not only turned a blind eye but also appointed two individuals with close connections to the Trudeau Foundation to investigate how the government might have benefited from such interference. It is not a surprise that the investigation went nowhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644612">Then there is the ArriveCAN app scandal, in which tens of millions of dollars were funnelled into the pockets of Liberal insiders. It was later revealed that the ArriveCAN app could have been developed for around $80,000. Instead, $60 million of taxpayer money was used to enrich a couple of individuals working out of their basement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644613">We must not forget the issue of the Winnipeg lab documents, from 2021. The House of Commons requested and ordered the production of the documents, but the government stalled and blocked the process at every turn. It even took its own Speaker of the House to court to prevent the documents from being released. When they were finally made public this year, they revealed that two scientists involved were operatives for the People's Liberation Army in Beijing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644614">The documents also showed that viruses and intelligence on various vaccines were sent to China, raising serious concerns about other potential security breaches at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. The Liberals were so determined to keep the documents from the public that instead of complying with the House's order, they called an election in 2021, effectively breaking Parliament and halting that process as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8644615">Moreover, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> has been found guilty by the Ethics Commissioner on two separate occasions. These violations include awarding contracts to family members through a Crown corporation and appointing his sister-in-law as interim ethics commissioner.

              <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich—Gulf Islands, GP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8644617"> Madam Speaker, I rise virtually this evening to pursue a question that I asked in the House some months ago. It was on the occasion of a wonderful conference that took place in Ottawa, called Vote16. There are movements across this country of people who want to see the voting age lowered to 16 years old. I am going to canvass very quickly why that is because the response I received that day from the <Affiliation DbId="311643" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> was not about the issue of why it would help make our democracy more vibrant if we were to change the voting age, as some jurisdictions have. For instance, on the occasion of the referendum in Scotland, the voting age was 16 years old.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644618">The problem we have in Canada with voter turnout, and it is a significant problem, is that it tends to go down over the years. The voter turnout that scandalized me was in the most recent Ontario provincial election. The last one had something like 46% voter turnout, so fewer than half of the people who were able to vote actually voted. That really is a blow to democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644619">The demographic group that votes the least in our country is the group that has, if we will forgive the expression, the most skin in the game: young people. The decisions we make in the House in 2024, in this Parliament, are going to significantly affect 16-year-olds for the rest of their lives. For people my age and older, there is relatively less of a long-term impact. However, young people vote the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644620">When we look at the research, one of the reasons for that is as follows: At 18 years old, many Canadian youth are away from home for the first time. They may be away at university or off trying to find a job, making their own way in the world. They end up feeling they are not sure they know enough about the community in the new place they live. It is not where they are from. That tends to reduce voter turnout.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644621">We also know from the research that, if young people do not vote at their first opportunity at 18 years old, they are quite unlikely to start voting when they are 25, 30 or 35. We put in place patterns of nonengagement and non-involvement. We add to that the general disgust of the public at political partisan games, and we end up having a very real risk of voter turnout continuing to go down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644622">I imagine turning that around, which we could still do before the next election, and saying that voting is now legal at 16 years old. Sixteen-year-olds can drive and pay taxes; 16-year-olds can risk their lives in many ways, and we accept that. Why could we not allow young people to vote at 16 when they are in their home community, when they have the support of peer groups and the potential for beefed-up civics classes? I have heard from many retired schoolteachers that they feel teaching democracy in schools has gone downhill in civics classes. Of course, this is in the provincial jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644623">In the time remaining, I just want to say this: Let us seize the opportunity while we have time to increase the engagement of Canadian youth in the future of our country and to ask young people to step up and start voting at 16. I think we would see a positive impact for all of us, including seniors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644624">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise today in the chamber to talk about the opportunities for youth engagement in our democracy, particularly voting in federal elections. I would like to thank the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands for raising the important issue of Canada's voting age. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644625">Section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedom states, “Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote”, and all citizens do eventually. The Canada Elections Act qualifies this right by adding the age requirement that citizens must be 18 years old. This is consistent with the voting age for provincial and territorial elections and most jurisdictions around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644626">The federal voting age has not always been set at 18. In 1970, it was lowered from age 21, which had been the voting age since Confederation. Since then, Parliament has often reflected on the voting age. Indeed, this very Parliament debated the idea of lowering the voting age to 16 a few years ago. While Parliament did not agree to lower the voting age, our government and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in particular have made very significant efforts to ensure young people continue to have a voice in our parliamentary democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644627"> I would like to highlight a few of the many opportunities available to youth for engaging in democratic life at all levels of government. For example, they can become an active member of political parties, and they can join or even launch social movements on issues of importance to them, as well as advocate for public policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644628">Our government recognizes that youth participation in our democracy, which is not limited to voting, makes it healthier. This is why we have taken important steps to provide youth opportunities to participate in our democracy in recent years. For example, in 2018, the government passed Bill <Document DbId="9808070" Type="3">C-76</Document>, the Elections Modernization Act, which created a voluntary register of future electors, providing Canadians between the ages of 14 to 17 who wish to vote with the option to register early with Elections Canada. If they choose to sign up early, these youth are automatically included in the National Register of Electors upon turning 18, as well as the list of electors, so they are registered to vote and will receive their voter information card. The Elections Modernization Act also facilitated the ability of Elections Canada to hire 16- and 17-year-olds to work as election officers, giving young people an opportunity to be at the front lines of Canada's electoral process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644629">Our youth can and do participate in our democracy and continue to make a valuable contribution in a variety of ways. At the same time, our government recognizes that it is important that we continue to support ways to encourage participation. All of us here can and should do more to encourage the turnout of all electors. We need to be an example for our youth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644630">In March of this year, our government introduced Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document>, the electoral participation act, which seeks to enhance voter participation for all electors, including youth and students—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644634"> I hear from 16-year-olds sometimes who say, “Maybe we don't know enough yet.” However, I would remind all colleagues here that we do not cut off the ability to vote based on intellectual capacities.

Parliament has continued to support the current voting age of 18 for a variety of reasons. At the same time, important actions have been taken to further foster youth participation by the government and stakeholders, as well as youth-led organizations and initiatives. However, I would note that voters aged 18 to 24 continue to have much lower turnout than the national average. Our government believes more can be done to make voting easier for these electors, many of whom are post-secondary students. That is why the government's proposal to make voting on campus permanent through Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document> is so important.</ParaText>

Instead of trying to estimate the number of trees that still stand in Jasper, I know there are very many trees that still stand, thankfully, as the fires in Jasper did not consume the whole park.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8644680">Madam Speaker, a couple of weeks ago, I asked a question during question period about the possibility of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s calling a carbon tax election. This was an important question for me and it was based on conversations that I had with many people in my home riding of Langley over the summer months, people who are deeply concerned about the ever-rising cost of living. We hear the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> saying that we should be celebrating that inflation is coming down to the Bank of Canada's target of around 2%, but I am saying that celebrations might be a bit premature and certainly offensive to people who are struggling to put food on the table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644681"> A recently retired couple explained it to me like this. Groceries that cost $100 when they first retired four years ago, today are costing $175 for the same food and that is week after week. Even though inflation might be down, the price of groceries is still sky high. Government-induced inflation is a tax on people on fixed income. Add to that the Liberals' ever-increasing carbon tax, which drives up the cost of everything, including groceries, and is driving a record number of people to food banks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644682">The Liberals say, yes, they realize that the carbon tax is going up and they realize it is inflationary, but that taxpayers are better off with this carbon tax because taxpayers get some of that money back. In support of that audacious claim, the Liberals highlight the fiscal-impact-only table of the recent Parliamentary Budget Officer report, while conveniently ignoring that same report's broader economic analysis saying that the carbon tax deals a sharp blow to our national economy and to our per capita income. In other words, we are all poorer, on account of the carbon tax and that is why my question was timely and important. Many Canadians feel that. They know it when they are out buying groceries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644683">I will acknowledge that we have been asking variations of that question for some time and perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, or the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> who answered the question, was tired of the repetition, but I asked the question in good faith. It was important for my constituents. It was important for me. That is why it was so disappointing to receive a flippant answer to my question about the carbon tax from the government House leader. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644684">She said something to the effect, “Oh, the House has lost confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>.” Well, she knows the rules as well as everybody and that it is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s job to earn the confidence of the House and it is the opposition's job to test that confidence from time to time when it is appropriate to do so. We have been doing that very effectively since Parliament resumed again after the summer break. We have posed several appropriately placed non-confidence votes. Unfortunately, with the ongoing support of the NDP, the government still stands to continue wreaking economic havoc on our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644685">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> knows how this all works and maybe she is anticipating already what it is going to feel like to be on this side of the House. She is going to have her chance soon enough, but for now, we are asking the questions and I am hoping for a more serious answer to a legitimate question. Why is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> afraid of a carbon tax election? Why not let Canadians decide?</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">Mr. Adam van Koeverden (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and to the Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8644686">Madam Speaker, the member opposite is from <Affiliation DbId="278480" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation>. That constituency is in British Columbia. British Columbia does not utilize the federal backstop system, so there is no federal carbon tax, as he calls it, in British Columbia. Every time he stands up in the House and says that he wants a carbon tax election for his constituents in British Columbia, in Langley—Aldergrove, what he is doing is continuing to try to impress upon his constituents that the federal carbon tax even applies in his constituency, but it does not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644687">Either he is unaware of that fact or he is intentionally trying to mislead his constituents; I do not know which one it is. I will not hazard to guess or even hazard to suggest that he is trying to intentionally mislead his constituents into thinking that a federal carbon tax is applied to any amount of fuel in British Columbia, because it simply is not and never has been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644688">We have had the conversation before and have repeated it enough times that every member of the House knows that the federal carbon tax does not apply in British Columbia. If he would like to talk about carbon pricing, there was just a provincial election in British Columbia. He can talk to the future premier of British Columbia about carbon pricing, because British Columbia is a leader on carbon pricing. It always has been.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644689">In fact, it was a government in which many of the member's colleagues served that brought in this country's first-ever carbon pricing program, which is a provincial one. It has had its own system since 2008, more than 10 years before the Government of Canada implemented carbon pricing across the country. One of the reasons we did it across the country is that it was working. The emissions per capita were dropping in British Columbia. British Columbia's economy continued to grow as now Canada's emissions have gone down and Canada's economy continues to grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644690">If the member opposite would like to talk about carbon pricing, then what we should also talk about is the cost of climate change itself. The Insurance Bureau of Canada reports that, for a second year in a row, Canada exceeded $7 billion in insured damage from severe weather and events linked to climate change. It is a scientific fact that climate change increases the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and many of those have affected my colleague's riding. Certainly his province, even just during the provincial election, received an extreme amount of precipitation in a very short period of time, constituting extreme weather.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644691">Without significant additional actions to reduce emissions, these costs are projected to balloon to $35 billion in 2030 and to between $80 billion and $103 billion in 2055. The cost of inaction is far too great to bear. What we need to do is join countries like those in Europe; states like California, New York and New Jersey; and countries around the world that are determined to lower their emissions. The Conservatives are continually demonstrating not just their climate denial but also the fact that they are literally in the pockets of big oil and gas. It is as if their statements in the House were written by oil and gas lobbyists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644692">On the other hand, our government is taking serious and ambitious climate action. It includes using all of the tools in our tool box, which includes putting a price on pollution, and it also includes an industrial pricing system, widely recognized as the most cost-effective way of combatting climate change. Just today, industry called the provinces to work together to strengthen the industrial price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644693">Once again, if my colleague from British Columbia would like to talk about carbon pricing in Canada, that is great. If he would like it removed in British Columbia, he needs to talk to provincial politicians because there is no carbon tax in British Columbia from the federal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8644694">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the <Affiliation DbId="311642" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> for highlighting the fact that there has been a provincial election recently in British Columbia. He might not be aware that both parties said in their electioneering that if the federal government drops the carbon tax, they will too. There are different variations of it but, effectively, they are responding to calls from their constituents who do not like the federal carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644695">The provincial carbon tax arguably was accepted by most British Columbians, but the federal carbon tax backstop has been driving that tax to a level that is inflationary and that is unacceptable to British Columbians. Yes, I do know what I am talking about, and I also want to highlight the 81% increase in food bank usage in British Columbia. If the Liberals are so confident that their policies are good, why not call the carbon tax election?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8644696"> Madam Speaker, this is simply astonishing. The member just did it again. He suggested that there is a federal carbon tax in British Columbia. He said the provincial price on pollution in B.C., the provincial carbon tax, was widely regarded as a good measure, but then he said the federal one was driving up inflation. They are very similar. One cannot be good and effective while the other drives up inflation. What we have seen is a decline in inflation. Inflation is at 1.6%. We saw a 0.5% cut in interest rates just this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8644697"> As the carbon tax has gone up in Canada, as it does every year, year after year, the Canada carbon rebate has also gone up. What we have seen is that eight out of 10 families get more money back through the Canada carbon rebate than they pay in the climate action incentive or the price on pollution. I would just remind Canadians and British Columbians that that does not apply in British Columbia because British Columbia has been pricing carbon for over a decade.</ParaText>
