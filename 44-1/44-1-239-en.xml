              <ParaText id="7971211">Many organizations also demonstrated their support for the cause. I want to thank the Salvation Army, Chaudronnée de l'Estrie, CAP, Coop de solidarité l'Autre-Toit and all of the other organizations that help to fight hunger, prevent trauma and eradicate extreme poverty. I walked, ate some delicious chili and talked about the reality of homelessness with Michel‑Alexandre, Jérémie and Alexandre.</ParaText>

Many remember “Tall Ted” on CKLG's <I>Doc Harris Show</I>. Ted's colleagues have remembered him for being an outstanding coach and mentor. I met Ted at Kelowna's AM 1150, where he led the news team. Ted was dedicated in all that he did. Ted Farr's interviews always got to the heart of the issue; and not just what the news was, but how it affected people in their daily lives.</ParaText>

Myrtle has been the heart and soul of what is now a weekend that runners everywhere have circled on their calendars. Myrtle has tweaked and perfected the formula that keeps volunteers, sponsors, spectators and runners coming back year after year.</ParaText>

No one, not even the Prime Minister, should be above the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971248">After eight years, the corrupt NDP-Liberal government has not only worsened the livelihoods of Canadians but also seen trust in government disappear as quickly as a Liberal election promise.

              <ParaText id="7971249">Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the sad news that Canada has lost a loyal and faithful public servant. Our friend and colleague, Senator Ian Shugart, has left us after a battle with cancer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971250">Ian was born in Ottawa and educated at Trinity College, U of T, before taking a degree in political economy. Ian cut his political teeth as a policy adviser to two Right Honourables, Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney. When the Conservatives were elected to govern in 1984, he first became a policy adviser and then chief of staff to Minister Jake Epp. During this time, he played a pivotal role in historic events, such as the patriation of the Constitution and the development of the charter, and working, among other things, on child care, labour market agreements and the Meech Lake accord.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971251">In 1991, Ian entered the public service, rising to many important roles, successive deputy minister positions, with a substantive impact in many areas, including health, labour, climate and global affairs. Finally, in 2019, he was named by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as the 24th Clerk of the Privy Council. He would serve in this role for two years, marked by the outset of a global pandemic, until his health forced him to step aside. When the situation looked more positive, in 2022, he returned to public service as a senator and with a deserved role at the Munk School.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971252">Ian's public service was punctuated not only by his intellect but also by his practical wisdom. I would add, too, his stability and kindness. As a rookie cabinet minister on some challenging files, I will always appreciate the many kind words from Ian before, after and sometimes during cabinet meetings, whether spoken or in the form of an encouraging note.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971253">On behalf of all Canadians, we are thankful for Ian's dedicated service to this country and to our public institutions. We thank him for his thoughtfulness. To Linda, family and friends, please accept our condolences.</ParaText>

As Sudan's Hala Al-Karib said recently, only paying lip service to the women, peace and security agenda without insisting on women's rights and women's meaningful participation in peace and political processes is not enough.</ParaText>

Desperately needed humanitarian aid must reach vulnerable Palestinian civilians at risk in Gaza. Canada is closely engaged with partners to build a humanitarian corridor. Hamas must release hostages, and we have to get foreign nationals, particularly Canadians, safely out of Gaza.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971494">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise to present a petition on behalf of neighbours in Kitchener Centre. They note, first of all, that their quality of life is being negatively affected by a high frequency of air traffic occurring near residential areas, and this is related to stress and interrupted sleep. They note there is a need for greater co-operation on the part of airport management with citizens and federal authorities to reduce the negative impacts of aircraft noise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971495">The Region of Waterloo International Airport is home to one of the largest and busiest flight training schools in Canada, and its total air traffic, the petitioners note, has increased by over 1,400% between 2019 and 2022, making it now the sixth busiest in Canada. They note that the negative impacts for residents near this airport have worsened significantly over this time, given the fact that the airport, for example, does not have any nighttime flight restrictions or curfews in place, among a number of other items. They also note that Canada's other busiest airports in residential areas, in places such as Edmonton, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, are all subject to heightened noise management requirements, and air traffic and runway restrictions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971496">In light of all of this, the petitioners are calling upon the <Affiliation DbId="300025" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> to first ensure that all Canadian airports near residential areas have established sufficient airport-specific noise-abatement procedures and control requirements to meet all of their obligations under the Canadian aviation regulations and, secondly, to assess whether any other Canadian airports near residential areas should be subjected to additional noise management requirements and restrictions, such as the requirement to develop a minister-approved noise management plan and report publicly on these plans, heightened noise-abasement procedures, and operating restrictions for designated noise-restricted runways.</ParaText>

In addition to calling for funding intervention for families that were affected, it calls on the House of Commons to provide an explanation of the factors that led to this decision, support the call for an emergency council meeting with members of the public present to discuss the child care crisis facing Lanark County, and ensure that contingency plans for affected families, with appropriate timelines and procedures in place if funding for child care agencies is terminated, to ensure that no family is ever put in this position again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971545">Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak about Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the International Transfer of Offenders Act. The bill was reported back to us with some modifications by members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights following their careful study of its proposals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971546">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> proposes amendments to both the publication ban provisions of the Criminal Code and the national sex offender registration regime. The bill is an example of the government's commitment to responding to concerns around sexual offending and demonstrating its overall commitment to victims of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971547">The proposed reforms of publication bans aim to increase victim autonomy and control in this area of the law. The changes proposed to the national sex offender registry would ensure the continued operation of this valuable police tool by making changes to bring it in line with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971548">First, I would like to discuss the amendments relating to publication bans. These proposals have been informed by the lived experiences of victims of sexual offending, and they have always had the empowerment of victims as their ultimate objective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971549">I want to give a particular thanks to My Voice, My Choice. This group has worked tirelessly to advocate for improvements to the publication ban regime. I can say with confidence that its members' advocacy has changed the national narrative on publication bans for the better. Without them, we would not be having this important conversation on returning agency to victims and ensuring that they are not silenced against their will.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971550">My message to all victims and survivors is that these conversations are not over. We know that there is always more to be done. We can continue to fight for positive change. It is incumbent on us to see Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> as a step in the right direction, not an end point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971551">The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would improve communication between victims and justice system actors with respect to publication bans and ensure that there is a clear legislative process on how to amend or revoke a ban. Importantly, it is our intent that prosecutors consult with victims before a publication ban is invoked. Prosecutors should ascertain whether victims wish to have a ban in place and act accordingly. Moreover, the accused should not and will not have any say in whether a publication ban should be revoked or modified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971552">In addition, Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would add clarity to the law with respect to the conduct captured by a publication ban. It is only in the rarest cases that a victim or witness should be prosecuted for such a breach. Publication bans are there to protect victims and should not be weaponized against them in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971553">Another victim-centric element of Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would improve victims' access to information in the criminal justice system. I am grateful to the federal ombudsperson for victims of crime, who advocated for this change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971554">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would ensure that victims are asked whether they would like to receive information on case developments after sentencing, such as appeals or parole. This would be a great improvement on the current system, in which victims must proactively make a request to receive information. In some cases, victims are not told that they must make this request, or they have trouble indicating their wishes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971555">Every victim is different; some want updates, while others want to move on and not hear about their case ever again. Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> recognizes that this choice is entirely theirs. Our justice system should ensure that victims are supported to make the best choice for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971556">I will now turn to the Senate amendments made to the publication ban aspect of Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>. For the most part, these amendments greatly improved the bill by creating a more robust and victim-centred approach to publication bans. However, some of these amendments raised concerns, which were voiced to the justice committee by the <Affiliation DbId="299996" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and were shared by some provincial attorneys general. We also heard testimony from organizations and individuals that represent victims, and they echoed some of these concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971557">In the Senate, provisions were added that would enhance communications with victims about the imposition of publication bans. For example, prosecutors would be required to ask the victim if they wished to have a publication ban that applied to their identifying information, as well as to inform a victim who was the subject of a publication ban about its existence and the right to revoke it. The Senate also amended the bill to propose a more robust process for how a publication ban can be revoked or varied. In addition, the Senate crafted provisions that would clarify what information is captured by a publication ban to ensure that victims could share their own information with friends and family, for example, without fear of any prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971558">These were positive suggestions that improved the bill, and the justice committee was generally supportive of the intention behind these changes. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971559">However, as I previously indicated, we heard testimony at the justice committee from witnesses who voiced concerns with the effects of some of the Senate amendments. I am grateful to the witnesses who lent their expertise to improve Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> by pointing out these concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971560">To that end, the justice committee proposes to delete language that would require the prosecutor to inform victims and witnesses who are subjects of a publication ban about the circumstances under which they could legitimately disclose information without facing legal consequences. The committee shared concerns raised by some of the provincial attorneys general that this proposal presented serious questions about prosecutorial independence and conflicts of interest. This is because some of the Crowns who would be giving that advice may also be called upon to prosecute an individual for the offence of breaching a publication ban. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971561">I am confident that removing this language would not impact the objective of ensuring better communications with victims about a publication ban, but ensure our Crown prosecutors could continue to effectively carry out their duties. Further, some witnesses heard by the committee during the study said that they would prefer to see the Criminal Code include a list of professionals to whom victims or witnesses could disclose identifying information without breaching the publication ban.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971562">In response, the committee proposed an amendment that would specify that victims or witnesses do not breach a publication ban if they disclose their identifying information in situations where the disclosure is to a legal professional, a health care professional or a person of trust. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Green Party and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278615" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation> who suggested this change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971563">I am strongly in favour of these amendments as I believe they add clarity to Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> while still respecting the overall objective of empowering and giving a greater voice to victims of sexual violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971564">I now turn to the sex offender registry provisions in the bill. The legislation would strengthen the sex offender registry and respond to the Supreme Court decision striking down sections of the registry. Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> proposes that all sexual offenders must be placed on the registry in cases involving a designated offence unless they can show that the registration would be overbroad or grossly disproportionate to the objective of the registry. Providing this limited discretion to judges responds to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision while still ensuring a robust registry that would assist police in preventing and investigating sexual offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971565">However, in recognition that there are some offenders who will always pose a higher risk of reoffending, Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> proposes to retain automatic registration for two categories of offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971566">The first category is repeat sexual offenders. If offenders are convicted of a sexual offence and have another sexual offence in their background they would automatically be registered. This is reflective of the social science evidence that indicates that repeat sexual offenders are twice as likely as first-time offenders to reoffend sexually. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971567">The second category is offenders who commit sexual offences against children and are sentenced to two years or more of imprisonment in cases where the offence is prosecuted by an indictment. These offenders would be covered even in the case of a first-time offence. Proposing automatic registration for this category is reflective of the social science evidence that offending against children is a validated risk factor for sexual offending. Sexual offences against children are among the most heinous crimes and I condemn them in the strongest possible terms. Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would ensure the police have the necessary tools to prevent and address these crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971568">I would like to be clear that limiting automatic registration to these two narrow categories of offenders is not intended in any way to signal that other sexual offending is any less serious. This could not be further from the truth. All sexual offending is reprehensible, but within the confines of the majority judgment in the Ndhlovu decision, I am confident this was as far as the government could go with respect to automatic registration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971569">I would like to be clear that this government has faith in the judiciary to make appropriate decisions. The bill also provides a robust appeal mechanism when there is a need to challenge a decision made by a trial judge about whether an offender should have been required to register.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971570">In addition, Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> proposes to provide judges with a list of factors that are relevant to assessing an offender's risk of sexual reoffending. This proposed list incorporates well-established risk factors based on empirical social research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971571">In addition to providing guidance to judges, these factors are intended to address the criticisms and concerns reflected in the minority judgment about the possibility that myths about sexual offending will inform any part of a judge's decision.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971572">I would like to close my remarks by reminding members that Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> also proposes other changes to strengthen the sex offender registration regime. Bill S-12 addresses operational issues that have been identified by our provincial, territorial and law enforcement partners. This includes, for example, creating a new compliance warrant provision that would allow police officers to arrest non-compliant offenders, bring them to a registration centre and give them an opportunity to provide the legally required information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971573">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would also expand the list of offences that qualify an individual for the registry. The list would include crimes such as non-consensual sharing of intimate images and sextortion. These are terrible crimes that have had serious impacts on Canadians, especially women and children. I am glad to see their inclusion on the list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971574">The bill would also require registered sex offenders to provide 14 days' notice of any travel as well as specific addresses of their destination. These changes have been lauded by American officials, including Attorney General Garland and Secretary Mayorkas. I know that these measures would contribute to enhanced security on both sides of our shared border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971575">I am confident that Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> is a balanced, thoughtful and constitutionally defensive response to the Supreme Court. It also represents our government's ongoing commitment to victims and survivors of crime. Victims and survivors must have full ownership of their own stories; this is critical. I urge all members to support this bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971589">Madam Speaker, after eight years of this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s weak-on-crime policies, Canada has become a more dangerous place and he is not worth the cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971590">Liberal law Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, the catch-and-release act, has unleashed a wave of violent criminals onto our streets and incidents of repeat and violent crime have predictably surged as a result. This increase in crime is particularly true when it comes to sexually based offences. Under this NDP-Liberal government's watch, sexual assaults have gone up 71%. Sex crimes against children have seen an astonishing 126% increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971591">Thanks to extreme politicians weakening our laws, those who commit sexual assault can now serve their sentences at home in the same community as their victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971592">According to Statistics Canada, only one in five cases of sexual assault reported to police result in a trial. Only 6% of sexual assaults are reported in the first place, due to fear and stigma, the lowest of all violent crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971593">I know that when I was sexually assaulted, as a child of 12, by two perpetrators, I was too afraid to tell my parents, even. I did not tell my mother until I was 40 years old. That is the story for many women in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971594">The Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter points out that only one in nine cases of sexual assault reported to police results in a conviction. Worse, only one in 15 reported cases results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail. As a mother of three daughters, I find these statistics alarming. As a lawyer and member of the official opposition, I must hold the government presiding over this crime wave responsible. The lack of urgency of the NDP and Liberals to protect women and children is shocking. They must act now to fix the problems they created with this radical ideology that puts criminals first and victims last.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971595">These stats only tell part of the story. The assault is traumatic enough for the victim to live once. The effects last a lifetime. To get justice, they are required to relive the trauma during the rigours of a criminal trial. They are often revictimized, forced to recount their assault through their own testimony and cross-examination. It is understandable that sex crimes and assaults are significantly under-reported, making it impossible to accurately quantify just how widespread this picture is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971596">It is not just sexual assault. Other forms of sexual violence are also on the rise. Online child exploitation has increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971597">According, again, to StatsCan, my province of British Columbia accounted for 54% of Canada's reported incidents of making and distributing sexually explicit images. The RCMP in British Columbia dealt with 9,600 cases of child exploitation last year alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971598">This is unacceptable in the extreme and speaks to the NDP-Liberal government's failure to protect the most vulnerable in our society, particularly women and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971599">The House must acknowledge that Canada has a problem with sex crimes, as we debate legal changes to the sex offender registry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971600">In my family law practice, I handled a case where a woman was concerned for the safety of her child during a custody dispute. She expressed concern that unsupervised contact with extended family members on the father's side of the family could put her child at risk of sexual assault. I discovered, through a sex offender registry in the United States, that the family member in question was a known offender. We were able to secure conditions in the custody arrangements that kept the child safe and under supervision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971601">This underscores the need for a strong, effective sex offender registry, to help law enforcement keep the public safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971602">The legislation before us today, Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>, amends the Sex Offender Registration Information Act, following a Supreme Court ruling that determines that sections of this law were unconstitutional.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971603">The court gave the Liberals one year to fix the unconstitutional provisions. That was on October 28, 2022. The so-called “feminist government” has dragged its feet yet again, and here we are today at the 11th hour debating the bill with a looming deadline just three days away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971604">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would change the Sex Offender Registry Information Act that was first passed in 2004 with the support of all parties. It was created to assist law enforcement agencies by requiring the registration of specific information about sex offenders, such as addresses, phone numbers, a description of their physical appearance, the nature of the offence committed, and the age and gender of the victims and their relationship to the offender. At the time it was up to the discretion of the judge as to whether a sexual offender should be on the registry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971605">However, this led to several issues. In 2009, the public safety committee found that only 50% of sex offenders were required to enrol in the sex offender registry. Conservatives recognized that to be effective and to actually protect women, children, victims and survivors, the national registry had to be enforced consistently across the country. Conservatives are the party of law and order. We support tough sentencing and enforcement against sexual crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971606">The previous Conservative government brought in the law that required convicted sex offenders to be automatically listed on the national sex offender registry to better protect the public, a measure that was also supported at the time by all parties. Conservatives remain supportive of legislation that would protect the public from sexual offenders, including Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>. However, the bill is another missed opportunity to improve public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971607">At committee, the Liberals amended their own bill to further prioritize the interests of the accused in sexual assault cases. Frankly, accused sexual offenders do not need more support in the criminal justice system. It is the victims and survivors who need the support. This was a chance for the coalition government to stand with victims, but once again it abandoned them. Common-sense Conservatives believe all sex offenders must be listed on the national sex offender registry, and we will amend the legislation to ensure this is the case when we form government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971608">As a family lawyer, I often dealt with custody cases where the sex offender registry was especially used to protect the interests of children. It is an essential tool for police and law enforcement agencies. I am concerned that the court's decision will water down the effectiveness of the registry and make it harder for police to prevent and investigate sexual offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971609">At committee, that soft-on-crime NDP-Liberal government opposed our common-sense amendments to strengthen the bill and opposed amendments to publication bans that key stakeholders, such as My Voice, My Choice, which was earlier praised by the member opposite, have advocated for. While the government claims it stands for women's rights and supports survivors of sexual violence, its actions say otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971610">Victims and survivors welcome stronger penalties and protections like mandatory enrolment in the national sex offender registry. They have asked for increased flexibility and victim input regarding publication bans and access to case information. The Liberals had a year to get the legislation right. Their delayed response has opened the possibility of sex offenders escaping registration if Parliament does not comply with the court-imposed deadline looming close now, something Conservatives will not allow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971611">We will agree to pass the bill through the House today to avoid putting the registry at risk. However, make no mistake, there is only one party committed to ending the crime wave, keeping vulnerable Canadians safe and fixing the flawed legislation. Only common-sense Conservatives will act with the urgency and the specificity required to keep women and children in Canada safe.</ParaText>

When the sex offender registry was originally brought in, with the support of all parties at the time, it was discretionary for judges as to who would be put on the registry. However, it seemed to be taken up only about 50% of the time, so the Conservative government of the day, again with the support of all parties at the time, took the next step to make it mandatory because it simply was not being taken up enough to fully and thoroughly protect women and children in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971626">Madam Speaker, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for making it possible to pass Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S‑12</Document> in a reasonable enough time frame that should hopefully allow it to get through the legislative process fast enough for the existing legislation to be amended before the deadline set by the Supreme Court. I think everyone on the committee worked seriously and diligently, and I would like to thank them all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971627">Having said that, Bill S‑12 has two components. The first is the component required by the Supreme Court pertaining to the national sex offender registry. It is a response to the Supreme Court ruling handed down on October 28, 2022, in R. v. Ndhlovu, which struck down two provisions of the Criminal Code, namely section 490.012 and section 490.013(2.1).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971628">The court held that registering offenders who are not at risk of committing a future sex offence is disconnected from the purpose of registration. The court pointed out that the purpose of registration is to capture information that may assist the police in preventing and investigating sexual offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971629">The Supreme Court gave the federal government one year to remedy the situation, and that time is up next week, on October 29, 2023. If the amendments are not passed by then, then offenders will no longer have to register with the national sex offender registry. Clearly, we all want to avoid that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971630">Obviously, the House of Commons fast-tracked the legislative process to meet that deadline. What I am wondering is why the government waited until April 26, six months after the Supreme Court ruling, to introduce this bill. I would remind the House that the Supreme Court delivered its ruling in R. v. Ndhlovu over a year ago on October 28, 2022, and ordered that the Criminal Code be amended by October 29, 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971631">On April 26, 2023, Senator Gold introduced a bill in the Senate, six months after the Supreme Court delivered its ruling. Bill S‑12 was passed in the Senate at third reading on June 22, meaning the bill took two months to get through the Senate. Six months elapsed between the time when the government found out that it had to amend the law and the time when the bill was introduced, another two months elapsed between the time when Senator Gold introduced his bill and the time when it was passed at third reading in the Senate, and a further three months passed before the bill arrived here in the House of Commons—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7971634">Madam Speaker, I was saying that it took six months for Senator Gold to introduce the bill in the Senate. I do not blame him. It was the government's responsibility, not his.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971635">The Senate passed the bill at third reading in two months, which seems more than reasonable to me. Three months went by between June 22 and September 19, because it was the summer. The bill arrived in the House on September 19, and 36 days later, here we are in the House for third reading of the bill. Thirty-six days is obviously not a lot of time to study a bill of this magnitude in the House. I find that disappointing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971636">What happened between October 28, 2022, and April 26, 2023? Was the government closed for business? Were there no ministers around who could work on drafting the bill? I guess not. I am very disappointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971637">The only reason we are here today, being forced to ram through this bill, jeopardizing our parliamentary duty to listen to every citizen and group concerned about the bill, weigh their positions and arguments, and study the representations made in committee with care and attention, is that the government did not put in a modicum of diligence to satisfy the obligations imposed on it by the Supreme Court ruling. At no point, in the House, in committee, in the media or in a press release, did the government offer the slightest explanation for this delay. We received no explanation, no excuse, nothing. Again, it is disappointing to say the least.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971638">Basically, the bill reinstates the principle of automatic registration, but with better guidelines and subject to certain conditions. Registration will now be automatic only for sex offenders sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or more and for repeat offenders. In all other cases, there will be a presumption that the offender will be required to register, but it could be overturned if the individual proves that there is no connection between the order to register and the purpose of registration or that registration is totally disproportionate to that purpose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971639">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S‑12</Document> therefore allows for greater flexibility and provides that judges may use their discretion to order whether those convicted of multiple offences during a single trial should, or should not, remain on the registry for life when their behavioural profile demonstrates an increased risk of reoffending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971640">The Bloc Québécois unsurprisingly endorses these amendments, which are in line with human rights requirements and respond to the Supreme Court's October 28, 2022 ruling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971641">With regard to the second component, Bill S‑12 proposes provisions promoting the participation of victims at the publication ban stage, when a ban is to be issued. On numerous occasions, witnesses have come before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights asking that we amend these rules and allow victims to intervene before a publication ban is issued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971642">Publication bans are issued to protect the identity and privacy of victims and witnesses. They are issued for their benefit, not for the benefit of the defendant or the benefit of the courts and prosecutors. The basic principle in Canada, and a cornerstone of our justice system, is to hold open trials. Not so long ago, we heard about hidden trials, secret trials. I do not think anyone wanted them. They certainly should not become the rule. Open legal proceedings are a guarantee of fairness and of trials that comply with the applicable legal provisions. Justice is done in public, not behind closed doors or in secret.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971643">Obviously, the presence of the public and the media in the courtroom is critically important, as is the right to talk about the trial, the evidence presented and the issues at stake. Publication bans should be used only under exceptional and clearly defined circumstances. On several occasions, the courts have heard challenges to their validity, often raised by media representatives.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971644">If these bans are to be issued only on rare occasions, it is quite understandable that the reasons justifying them must be very well defined and clear to everyone. The purpose of the bans must be to protect the identity and privacy of victims and witnesses, or at least seriously strive to achieve that objective. What is the current situation? At present, unfortunately, that is not always the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971645">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S‑12</Document> seeks to ensure that the people we want to protect are truly protected, and that they know they are protected. It seems to us that, at the very least, before issuing such a ban, the courts must ensure that the victims are aware that a ban is being sought and could be granted, that they understand the details of the ban and, finally, that they consent to it. How else could anyone claim that the ban is in their best interests?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971646">Victims must also have the opportunity to request that the publication ban be modified or lifted. Victims may have consented to a ban for one reason or another but, for a host of other good reasons, they may later decide they want the ban modified or lifted. Logically, victims should be allowed to request such modifications if the ban is indeed in their best interests, as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971647">However, as things stand, these bans are often issued without the victims' knowledge and, unfortunately, without their consent. Worse still, when they find out that a publication ban has been issued, the victims, whom the bans are intended to protect, are currently unable to request that the ban be modified or lifted. As if that were not enough, victims are even liable to prosecution if they violate a publication ban by speaking out about the assaults they have suffered or about their attacker's trial. The victim we want to protect becomes the culprit we want to prosecute. I agree with what everyone is probably thinking: That is insane and it has to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971648">The purpose of Bill S‑12 is therefore to correct these incongruities and greatly improve the situation for victims and witnesses. From now on, judges will have to ensure that victims are notified when a publication ban is about to be issued and that they consent to it. If the victims are not present in the courtroom, the judge will have to ensure that the prosecutor has notified them and obtained their consent. Furthermore, victims will now be able to communicate with a legal professional, a health professional or a person with whom they have a relationship of trust without putting themselves at risk of contravening the publication ban. This is a necessary and welcome improvement. One even wonders how it could ever have been otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971649">That said, our courts will face challenges. Sometimes, they will have to weigh the interests of the different parties if one victim wants a publication ban revoked or varied but other victims involved in the case disagree. The judge deciding the issue will have to consider the opinions and rights of everyone concerned by the ban. It will definitely take some imagination to word the ban in a way that satisfies and respects each person it needs to protect. This will be no small challenge, but nonetheless, it is a challenge we must meet. While it may not be perfect, I hope that Bill S‑12 will largely and adequately meet our legislative obligations.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7971656">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be speaking to Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> today, as it would address one of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights report entitled “Improving Support for Victims of Crime”, which was tabled in the House in December 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971657">When the justice committee began its study on victims of crime more than a year and a half ago, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> brought to my attention the bizarre and unjust situation that survivors of sexual assault face in their current circumstances, which is that survivors regularly suffer from restrictions on their ability to talk about what happened to them and sometimes even suffer penalties for violating court-ordered bans on the publication of information that would identify their own names. It is important to note that these bans are routinely imposed in sexual assault cases across Canada. Anecdotally, we know it approaches 100% of the time. It is also important to note that most of the time, this happens without survivors' being aware that the publication ban is in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971658">Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would fix that by requiring notification of survivors. There are many reasons a survivor might choose to or inadvertently violate such a ban. Some feel that such publication bans inadvertently protect the perpetrators by the necessity of protecting their identity in circumstances where the publication of the perpetrator's identity would identify the victim. Others feel the idea of publication bans itself is based on an archaic and misogynist idea that sexual assault victims are somehow responsible for what happened to them and should be ashamed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971659">To be clear, some survivors do want their privacy protected by having publication bans in place, but others believe that public safety requires them to let family, friends and members of the public know of a risk of sexual assault they might face, by identifying the fact they were assaulted and who the perpetrator was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971660">At this point, I want to express my thanks to the survivors of sexual assault, and in particular those from the group My Voice, My Choice, who risked retraumatization by coming forward to committee and talking in public about their own personal experiences, in order to get the legislative change they need, in the hearings before the justice committee on victims' rights that began in October 22, more than a year ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971661">Again, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278625" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, who brought this situation to my attention and then introduced a private member's bill on the topic in order to try to get the House to act. In addition, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="278544" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard—Verdun</Affiliation>, the former minister of justice, who decided to include measures to restore agency to survivors of sexual assault by including it in Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971662">The government did not choose a path, using a Senate bill, nor did it choose a timetable, at the last minute, that New Democrats might have chosen. This has left us with little time to meet the deadline for passage of Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> and therefore with little time to consider all of the important amendments suggested by My Voice, My Choice, without endangering the fate of this bill as a whole by causing a to and fro between the House and the Senate. Now, we have a bill that, had it been on a better path and a better timetable, could have been even better in meeting the needs of survivors of sexual assault. However, we still have a bill before us that, I am assured, would make the necessary fundamental changes to restore agency to survivors and to ensure that there would not be prosecutions for violating bans of those whom they were supposed to protect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971663">Let me turn briefly now to the other half of Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document>, which provided the original impetus for the bill. The Supreme Court of Canada decision requires revisions to the sex offender registry. The Supreme Court found that automatic lifetime registration for those convicted of listed offences was overly broad, and as a consequence, was capturing some who were very unlikely to reoffend. I know some argue that all must be listed, but it is important to remember that if we list people who are at very low risk to reoffend, we waste public resources that might better be used to monitor the higher-risk offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971664">Instead, Bill <Document DbId="12367527" Type="3">S-12</Document> would meet the Supreme Court's challenge by implementing the presumption of registration of those convicted. This would mean that a very small number of those convicted of listed offences could ask a judge to use their discretion to exempt them from legislation. The estimates are that it would be probably far fewer than 10% who could ask for that exemption.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971665">The bill would also strengthen the sex offender registry in a couple of important ways. Most importantly, to me, it would add the offences of non-consensual distribution of intimate images and so-called sextortion to the list of offences that would result in registration as a sex offender.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971666">In our modern world of overuse of social media, overuse of the Internet and overexposure of everyone to everything, these offences sometimes may seem trivial. However, we must remember that with non-consensual distribution, intimate images last forever on the Internet, and I think those who perpetrate this need to understand that these offences will be taken very seriously and that they will be monitored as sex offenders on the registry to make sure they do not engage in this kind of behaviour again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971667">I would like to conclude with thanks to all the parties that have worked together to get this legislation here today in time to meet the Supreme Court of Canada's deadline. I know that some parties still have reservations and I know that some of the victims would like to have had more amendments made to the bill. However, I do believe that we have it in a form in front of us today that will help restore agency to survivors of sexual assault in the future. I think that is a very important reason for us to act promptly.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971668">Madam Speaker, for those who do not know, two weeks ago, I ran 10 kilometres to raise funds for the Centre d'aide et de lutte contre les agressions à caractère sexuel de Longueuil, or CALACS. It is a Longueuil-based support centre that is doing very good work helping victims of sexual assault. Its members want to run a campaign in high schools in the spring to prepare young students for their prom, and they want to talk about the concept of consent. They really are doing extraordinary work. I wanted to mention it because we are sort of talking about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971669">I was looking at some statistics, which were actually provided to me by the CALACS people, and I can say that the work is far from done. The bill before us is important, but there is still a lot of work to be done. Only 5% of victims of sexual violence file a complaint in Quebec. What is more, when they do, only three out of every 1,000 complaints result in charges being laid. That falls very short. Clearly, the justice system still scares victims. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971690"> He said: Madam Speaker, the purpose of Motion No. 96 is to close what many, especially who know the fire and rescue profession, see as significant and dangerous gaps in the ability to respond effectively to aircraft accidents at major Canadian airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971691">Motion No. 96 calls for the Government of Canada to close these gaps by amending the Canadian aviation regulations to bring them in line with standards published by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency headquartered in Montreal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971692">Specifically, closing the safety gap involves three measures: including rescue as well as firefighting in the mandate for firefighters at Canada's major airports; mandating a response time of no more than three minutes for fire rescue equipment to reach any point on an operational runway; and specifying the number of personnel required to meet fire rescue standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971693">People have been raising attention to the lack of a rescue mandate for at least 25 years. The April 1 edition of Fire Engineering reported a Department of National Defence document quoting an item in the Canadian Press, suggesting “firefighting standards at civilian airports in Canada aren't up to snuff and may even put lives at risk”. The report draws attention to life-threatening dangers faced by occupants of aircraft who are not able to walk away from a wreck because Transport Canada only requires airport firefighting crews to assist in rescue outside the craft. The DND reported that the primary responsibility for rescue from inside the craft is left to the airline's flight crews and local fire departments. I will say more on that a bit later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971694">In its 30th Canadian legislative conference, held in Ottawa at the end of March, the International Association of Fire Fighters raised the issue again. This time, we in Parliament have an opportunity to respond and close the gaps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971695">Transport Canada's standard 323 in its Canadian aviation regulations states, “an aircraft fire-fighting service is a contingent resource tasked with the primary responsibility of providing a fire free egress route for the evacuation of passengers and crew”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971696">Section 323.03, on general requirements, adds:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This standard is not intended to limit the fire-fighting service from providing services in addition to that of aircraft fire-fighting at the airport or aerodrome, nor to prevent it from dealing with other occurrences.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971698"> Some I have spoken to reflected that firefighters can be assigned other duties while on shift, such as cutting the grass, that could well increase the turnout time for a call. Regardless, the reality at most of Canada's major airports is that fire crews do not have the personnel or, perhaps, even the training or equipment to step beyond this basic mandate, which is now limited to fighting the fire, trying to keep an escape route open and hoping that whoever is inside the aircraft can make it out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971699"> Transport Canada's outline of the requirements to comply with the current Canadian aviation regulations focuses on fire extinguishing agents and the testing of the equipment needed to ensure the correct discharge rate and the reach the foam can get to when out fighting a fire. The section on training of personnel focuses almost exclusively on responding to an aircraft fire, with one reference to emergency aircraft evacuation assistance. If this measure refers to anything more than keeping open an escape route through the flames, the reality of staffing makes it only aspirational at some, if not most, Canadian airports. In discussions with the firefighters association, I was told that the staffing requirements on a rig dispatched to extinguish a fire is two firefighters: One drives and assists the second firefighter to discharge the foam.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971700"> If firefighters are charged with the additional mandate to rescue aircraft occupants from inside the craft, I am told that they would almost certainly need to rely on the two-in, two-out rule: If personnel are sent into any burning structure, there must be at least two firefighters outside to be there if it becomes necessary to rescue their colleagues inside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971701">We cannot ask firefighters to risk their lives, as they most certainly do when they go in to rescue people, without the support and backup needed if things go terribly wrong. A two-person response team today would then become maybe four, six or more. Bolstered fire hall complements, plus any necessary equipment and rescue training, would all be necessary to bring the Canadian aviation regulations up to ICAO standards.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971702">A number of us in this place are exposed to the broadest range of risks when we fly to and from our ridings to be here for our parliamentary duties and to go back home and help our constituents, and I am one of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971703"> An assessment of the fire and rescue capabilities in Canada puts Vancouver International Airport at, or near, the top. That is where I usually originate my trips to come to Ottawa. In 2022, YVR recorded 230,162 runway movements and passenger counts of over 19 million. This is a lot, though it is still far short of the prepandemic total of 25.9 million passengers, but it is quite likely that volume will be reached and exceeded relatively soon. I would estimate, judging from the passengers I see at YVR, that this year will probably see the old level reached quite handily. I am told that the Vancouver Airport Authority has voluntarily adopted standards that meet or are very close to the ICAO standards. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971704">At the other end of the journey for most MPs from metro Vancouver, we have the Ottawa International Airport. It is cited by the IAFF as one of the most challenged in meeting ICAO standards. In preparation for today, I reviewed the “YOW 2038 Master Plan”. I looked through it, and currently, there does not appear to be any provision in that plan to close any kind of a fire rescue gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971705">I am told Pearson airport in Toronto is close to meeting the higher standards, and most Canadian airports, at least the 25 to 30 larger airports with more than 180,000 enplaned or deplaned passengers per year that are subject to the Canadian aviation regulations, face greater challenges than Vancouver or Toronto.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971706">The second gap is the response time to an incident. The ICAO standard is three minutes for a fire rescue response to any point on an operational runway. I am told the Canadian standard is three minutes to the midpoint of any operational runway.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971707"> Let us have another look at the Ottawa airport. The fire hall is located very close to the end of its longest runway, which runs north-south and is 3,049 metres long. Current regulations require firefighters to reach the midpoint in three minutes, and I am told that they can do that in just under three minutes. However, it would be a challenge for them, if we are looking at a worst-case scenario of four minutes or five minutes for a crew to receive an alarm, turn out and reach an incident at the farthest end of that longest runway. I have not been able to find any records on YOW's actual performance in exercises or incident responses, but a resource here with us this evening has said that they can do the three minutes. Beyond that, it is pretty dodgy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971708">By the way, when we talk about meeting the standards, we should not for an instant doubt the dedication and professionalism of the firefighters. The focus here is on enabling them to meet high standards efficiently and, above all, safely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971709">Ottawa's airport is one of those ones that relies on the aircrew on board a burning aircraft to get the people to the door and outside, where the current regulation says that the fire department has to keep a pathway clear so that the people can get away from the aircraft. If it is to be fire rescue, they have to rely on the Ottawa civic firefighting service. The fire hall on McCarthy Road is nine driving minutes from the airport, and the hall on Leitrim Road is 11 minutes away. That is driving time. That does not count the turn-out time or getting the person out of the back or wherever they happen to be when the alarm comes in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971710">To the extent that Canadian airports have been designed like YOW, it could very well be that meeting ICAO's response time would require the relocation of fire halls. As I mentioned, the fire hall at YOW is at just about the end of the longest runway. That leads to the issue of costs, of course. In a 2003 regulatory impact analysis statement, the definition of “rescue” was specifically drafted, “to ensure that the status quo will be unchanged with the types of activities included as aircraft rescue and fire-fighting services” without imposing any additional obligations or costs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971711">Let us think about that for a moment. In these times, when passengers pay a surcharge of, let us say, $12 a ticket for security costs and $35 or more, in fact, in airport improvement fees, the IAFF suggests that an additional surcharge of 50¢, a dollar or, in the case of a smaller airport, maybe two, three, four or five dollars might be necessary to fund the lifting of services up to the ICAO standards. Canadians love to travel, especially by air. I certainly see a lot of evidence of that here in Ottawa or in Toronto, which I go through. I occasionally see it in Montreal and certainly at YVR. Those airports are jammed. I am seldom on an aircraft that has any empty seats. In spite of the narrative that says the country is broke and nobody can do anything, there sure seems to be a lot of money around for air travel these days. Therefore, we have to wonder whether maybe a few bucks per ticket to bolster the ability of aircraft passengers and crew to survive an accident at Canada's key airports is really too much to ask. Of course, the proposition here is no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971712">In preparing for this debate on Motion No. 96, I have been inspired by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278753" Type="2">Longueuil—Charles-LeMoyne</Affiliation>, whose private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11525130" Type="4">C-224</Document>, which we passed unanimously, has paved the way for a national framework to raise awareness of cancers linked to firefighting and to improve access to cancer prevention and treatment. When it appeared I had this opportunity, she was the first to promote resolving the regulation gaps as an important, worthy and complementary initiative, one that could support our firefighters even further by delivering critical safety improvements for air crews, air passengers and, yes, firefighters too. I would like to thank the Library of Parliament and our legislative assistant Riley Sutton for their assistance in researching this issue. I would also like to thank, of course, the International Association of Firefighters and firefighters from the Ottawa airport, who are helping to keep this issue alive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971713">I am now looking forward to hearing the perspective of our colleagues, because when Motion No. 96 came out, we received notes from members of the other party asking what it was all about. We provided the information we had, and I know they have been doing their own research and will be in a position to maybe expand on some of the points I have been able to raise this evening. Therefore, I will be very pleased to cede the floor to questions if there are any and certainly to my colleagues to expand on the need for Motion No. 96.</ParaText>

I think Canadians will appreciate this and certainly understand what we are talking about and what we are asking our fire services to do to meet standards. As one of my colleagues said, people expect this to happen, and if it is not happening, we have to move it in that direction. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971731">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House and engage in critical discussions about the policies that effect the lives of everyday Canadians. Today, we are being presented with a motion that calls for the adoption of International Civil Aviation Organization standards in Canada's airports for rescue and firefighting regulations. This could potentially increase fees imposed on passengers and shippers to cover the costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971732">Safety is paramount and is certainly something that unites all of us. Conservatives believe that this is an issue that deserve more study. We will be calling on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, upon which I happen to sit, to take this issue up. We must carefully consider and evaluate the consequences of implementing these proposed changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971733">The mover of the motion just spoke about the fact that Canadian airports are exceptionally safe. That is something we are all proud of. What is the signal we are sending in debating this motion today? Are we giving the impression that it is lacking?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971734">Canada is not out of step with the rest of the world on this. Many countries, including our neighbours to the south, make necessary adjustments to ICAO standards to best suit their own unique circumstances. It is a standard practice that recognizes the need for flexibility, while maintaining high safety standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971735">Why are we signalling there are perhaps deficiencies in our safety regulations? Canadian aviation regulations are designed to be robust and thorough. They are tailored to the specific needs of communities and circumstances. In fact, in some areas, such as aircraft rescue and firefighting training, we even surpass ICAO standards by threefold, demonstrating our commitment to safety and preparedness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971736">It is important to acknowledge that airport emergencies are well managed across Canada through close collaboration with community resource partners. Municipal police, ambulance services and firefighting resources play pivotal roles in emergency response. Airports cannot be expected to staff for every conceivable emergency scenario, so they rely on these mutual aid partners to ensure a comprehensive response. It is worth noting that all of our airports are already working closely with their local fire departments, actively planning and conducting exercises to ensure a swift and effective emergency response.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971737">We can talk about Hamilton International Airport, which I am proud to say is located in my constituency of Flamborough—Glanbrook. It is the fastest-growing cargo airport in the country, plus it serves over a million passengers a year. It is owned by the City of Hamilton, so naturally, there is a strong partnership with the Hamilton Fire Department.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971738">This partnership is already in place and exemplifies the importance of a well-coordinated approach to aviation safety. We have heard this from other airports across the country. They recognize the significance of a collaborative approach, which is why they have expressed concerns that the proposed regulation and added costs are unnecessary. That is why we need to study this further.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971739">It is essential to consider that these additional expenses would inevitably be passed onto travellers and shippers, and would further raise the costs associated with air travel in Canada, which is already expensive on a global scale. In a country where air travel and cargo is already subject to significant fees and taxes, these costs are going to be one more thing added onto the backs of Canadians at a time when we are already dealing with 40-year-high inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971740">It is crucial to remember that increasing costs for passengers and shippers does not necessarily translate into increased safety. We must be mindful of the impact on Canadians' wallets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971741">Additionally, the regulatory changes proposed in this motion are designed to provide a one-size-fits-all, Ottawa-knows-best approach. However, our vast and diverse Canadian landscape necessitates a more flexible approach to regulation. What works for one airport, may not be suitable for another. Flexibility in our regulations is essential to accommodate these variations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971742">We must recognize the merits of our existing Canadian aviation regulations and the partnerships we have built with community resources to ensure the safety and well-being of airline passengers. Thorough studies have been conducted, and sound research has supported it, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our current approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971743">The proposed changes, while they may sound appealing on the surface, risk imposing unnecessary costs and red tape. There is just no clear evidence to suggest that this would result in a safer air travel environment. That is why we are proposing additional study on this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971747">Mr. Speaker, I have turned everything off around me. For once, I am the one who is disconnected. That is a first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971748">I wanted to thank my colleague for moving this motion because airport safety is so important. What we read in the motion is rather shocking. It first talks about how there are significant regulatory shortfalls concerning emergency responses at our airports. That is a matter of passenger and employee safety, but it is also a matter of the country's international reputation, since Canada is known for being a safe place to fly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971749">Here is what the motion calls for. It says that we need to change the safety standards in Canadian airports so that airport firefighters can reach any part of the runway in less than three minutes. Those are international standards, and Canada is lagging behind in terms of International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, standards. Right now, Canada requires firefighters to be able to reach the mid-point of the runway in three minutes, rather than all points on the runway. The three-minute time frame is very important. We know that some runways are very long, particularly those at the Mirabel airport in my riding. That time frame can extend to four, five, six or even seven minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971750">We are talking about airport safety, and it can seem as though fires in and around airports never happen. Let me remind members that a tragedy took someone's life at the Mirabel airport on October 18, 2022. A vehicle caught fire at the airport. Aéroports de Montréal, the supposedly independent Crown corporation that manages the facility, decided not to send firefighters and instead waited for municipal firefighters to arrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971751">A second call was made to notify the firefighters that there was a fire, and Aéroports de Montréal again decided not to send their firefighters. They have to come from far away. When Mirabel's municipal firefighters arrived, the individual had died inside his car. Municipal firefighters are not trained for that. These things happen. People often do not know that airport firefighters exist. However, when they are needed, it is a matter of life and death. They have to act quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971752">I would like to take advantage of today's debate to salute the 31 valiant firefighters who work at the two airports, located in Mirabel and Dorval. Nine are in Mirabel, and the other 22 are in Dorval. Just think, there are nine firefighters for one airport. These people risk their lives, and all they ask is to do their job; all they ask is to save lives. I salute these people, who put the safety of passengers and airport staff first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971753">I am thinking in particular of Philippe Gagnon, president of the Syndicat des pompiers d'Aéroports de Montréal, and of Alexandre Bertrand, vice-president of the Syndicat des pompiers d'Aéroports de Montréal. I am also thinking of Yvon Barrière and Jonathan Choquette from PSAC‑Quebec. For his bravery, I salute hero Francis Labrie, a firefighter who was suspended because he took the fire truck, went to the scene and tried to save a life. This is no laughing matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971754">Aéroports de Montréal tells us that municipal firefighters are to intervene inside an aircraft. Canadian airport firefighters can hose down a plane from the outside, but they are not allowed to go inside the plane. This is against the rules of the ICAO, which is headquartered in Montreal a few kilometres from our airports. To be able to intervene in an aircraft, they need to have completed 333 hours of training. Municipal firefighters do not have this training, and they cannot get there in time. They lack the necessary resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971755">In his motion, my colleague says quite rightly that firefighters need to be able to reach the mid-point of the runway in three minutes. However, under municipal standards, firefighters arrive in 25 minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971756">People inside a burning aircraft die after three minutes from the smoke. It is extremely serious. Airport firefighters who follow international rules are needed because there are inherent risks to aircraft fires.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971757">For example, aircraft fires release toxic gases that are specific to airports. There are chemical, physical and thermal dangers, the combustion of composite materials, the oxygen and halon tanks, the sulphur, the exhaust from the running engines, engine fires, the hydraulic systems, and radioactivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971758">I do not want to hear that Montreal firefighters are trained for these specific types of risks. Think of the hot brakes, tire fires, flammable synthetic oil, door openings, deployment of emergency slides that are specific to planes, batteries that produce hydrogen gas and lead to a risk of fire and explosion, radar systems, the inflatable cushions, and so on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971759">We need to have trained firefighters who arrive on time. In France, Great Britain and most industrialized countries, the international standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization, or the ICAO, apply. In Montreal, where the ICAO headquarters are located, these standards are not used, which is rather ridiculous. It is shameful. Our colleague is giving us an opportunity to take note of these shortcomings today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971760">For example, the Canadian aviation regulations, called CARs, require only three trucks. Unlike the rules at most airports around the world, personnel is not specified, and Aéroports de Montréal takes advantage of this omission to excuse its understaffing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971761">For six years now, firefighters at Mirabel airport have not received any medical training. The Canadian aviation regulations say that medical training must be up to date. However, since Mirabel no longer has the required number of passengers and is supposedly a cargo-only airport, they say medical training is not required. All they are trying to do is save money at the expense of human lives, when we know that chartered planes, flight schools and general aviation operate out of Mirabel. The situation is extremely serious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971762">One of the main problems we are having in my riding has to do with the airport administration structure. It is a non-profit organization that essentially leases the land the airport is on for a very long time. These folks are being asked to make money, to make their activities profitable, to open shops and to break even.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971763">At one point, Aéroports de Montréal got a new president. The first thing he did was cut the number of firefighters, the number of trucks available to respond and firefighter training. I guess this means that if there is ever a fire with radioactive elements, the airport firefighters will respond with three trucks and three firefighters. There are even cases where there are so few firefighters that the support truck carrying the equipment cannot even get to the plane. Firefighters are then told to hose down the outside the plane, to get there in three, four, five or six minutes, but to wait for municipal firefighters before boarding the plane. Now we are relying on the municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971764">I commend the initiative of my colleague who moved this motion. He took action instead of waiting for dozens of deaths in a crash landing or fire. He is looking ahead. The people, the passengers and the staff come first for him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971765">There is an urgent need to act and amend the outdated Canadian aviation regulations. There is an urgent need for greater transparency in the management of our airport facilities. These facilities belong to the taxpayers, to Quebeckers, Canadians, the people of Mirabel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971766">At some point, these people need to be held accountable for their actions.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7971767">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on motion M-96. It is a motion that the House recognize that an assessment of the International Association of Fire Fighters concluded significant regulatory shortfalls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971768">Basically, the shortfalls are failing to specify rescue as a required function of airport firefighters and requiring only that firefighters must reach the midpoint of the furthest runway in three minutes, rather than all points of operational runways within that time period. Another part of the motion seeks to give firefighters at major Canadian airports the mandate and resources that are necessary and specify that the required function of firefighters must be rescuing passengers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971769">I do not want to go through the whole motion here. I want to talk a bit about process and how it relates to our airports and the holes we have in the services there. I know that the Speaker is flying tomorrow, and we do have a very good record in aviation, but we still have some improvements that need to be made. Sadly, this problem has been around this place longer than I have. I find interesting that it is a regulatory change that any minister can do at any point in time, so there really is not the requirement for this to go through as a motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971770">A motion is not binding. It would not mean that the government has to follow the motion that is passed. That is one of the reasons we might want to look at regulation through the minister as a quicker more direct process, or we could have legislation that would bind the government once it passes this chamber and the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971771">I think the motion is good for public awareness. I commend the member for bringing this forward, but the government, if it wanted to, could act on this really quickly. There is not really much of an obstacle, because it has the support of the rest of this chamber here. It is good that the member brought this through to discuss it, because maybe his government and the minister will listen to what is taking place here today and act on it even before the motion takes place. Perhaps, in the best scenario, the minister would actually act on the regulations and let the member have a victory lap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971772">That would be awesome, because the intent of the motion, in terms of fire safety at airports, is critically important, and he needs to be clear that there is support in the chamber for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971773">I do want to also acknowledge that our critic on this, who has done a lot of work, is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278635" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>. He is our transport critic, but he is also a former mayor. We look at airports in municipalities. I was on the City of Windsor city council when things were offloaded to municipalities. Local taxpayers had to pick up, basically, from deregulation, which we have seen Conservatives and Liberals do on a number of different things, including airline safety. They tried to get a safety management system employed there. We were able to stop that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971774">We face a number of things that have been deregulated. This was downloading onto the municipalities, so municipalities like Windsor and others have had to pick up the slack for fire safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971775">There are some really good things here in this motion, as discussed. A good one one is regarding persons with disabilities. In the case of accidents, there is very little direction about how we would help get passengers, especially those who are disabled, off planes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971776">The government was very lackluster when it came to Nav Canada, which was responsible for airport towers. It was looking at closing several across this country and studying them, and they included the Windsor one in that, despite the fact that we have five air zones in the Windsor district area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971777">We are on the border, so our air zones are not just domestic, but they are international, and they overlap. I was fortunate to be invited by Mr. Chris Kenney, the central regional vice-president who requested a meeting with CATCA with regard to touring my airport tower just recently. I want to thank everybody who was there for the education they also gave me, which confirmed that saving our airport tower was important. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971778">When Nav Canada was looking at this, they basically wanted to close it down so they would not have people in the airport tower. If members can imagine it, we not only have domestic flights, but we also have other services like coast guard and the U.S. air services and so forth that overlap in our region. That would have been detrimental. Losing that, especially as we are growing the airline industry, would have been wrong.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971779">The first response from the government on this, by our local Liberal MP, was that it could not do anything about. It was Nav Canada, so it could study this. All heck broke loose.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971780">I started working with a number of different people, because it came to me. I want to thank the flight instructors at that time: Dante Albano, Ryan Lee, Patrick Li and Craig Borowski. They are international airport pilots and are involved in the issue with the Windsor Flying Club. I also thank Karan D'Souza, Mayor Dilkens and Rakesh Naidu from the Windsor chamber of commerce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971781">We pushed back at the fact that Nav Canada was doing this, and it became a significant incident. We went from the government saying originally that it could not do anything about it to it saying the minister does not have the legal authority for it to get done. What I did was drafted legislation for the minister and tabled it here in this chamber so he could act. The heavens opened up and the light was on this issue after the government said it could not act. We prepared and tabled the way the minister could do it. Thank goodness that at that time, soon after we tabled the legislation for the minister, the issue was resolved. Nav Canada backed off, and we saved the airport tower.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971782">It was a good story to tell in the sense of activism, but it also showed the vulnerabilities of municipalities in the deregulation that can take place. I mentioned the safety management systems with regard to the airport issue, because in the past, it has been the NDP that stopped the safety management systems from being in the airline industry. That is a system members might have heard about in the rail systems. The rail systems have safety management systems in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971783">People are wondering what the heck a safety management system is. Basically, at the end of the day, an employee is supposed to report any of the problems they have on a daily basis about safety to their employer. Imagine that. The employee has to be a whistle-blower in their job to prevent some things from taking place. We saw Lac-Mégantic and other types of rail problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971784">A rail study done independently talked about CP and CN having a culture of fear and intimidation over their workers. We were expecting, and we still expect, the workers to report those problems to the people who employ them and control their futures as employees. That system has failed quite significantly, and it does not empower workers. We have seen other whistle-blower problems in this chamber, even more recently in some of the departments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971785">I point back to this because it is why we have to make sure the government never brings in that system for the airline industry. That has been attempted in the past, but we used what was called a “hoist motion” to end debate at the time, creating a stalling tactic. Another election took place in between, and no government has come back since that point in time to bring in that legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971786">To come back to this motion again, I think there has been a lot of work going on. In fact, our critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278635" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>, rightly pointed to Senate and other types of studies in the past about this issue, going back to the 1990s. That is important. He has done his due diligence, and we do think there is a lot of value in this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971787">I always encourage there to be discussions among government members that could get the minister to move right away, especially if we can get this in the chamber and have some consensus. With unanimous consent, we could get that regulatory process going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971788">In all sincerity, I want to again thank the member for bringing this up, because it is an important issue. We will support it, but we do not want to see that be a reason not to do it now with the regulatory changes that could be done. It should also come with resources for municipalities. Local taxpayers should not be paying for federal responsibilities. One would think that fire and other safety issues would be under a federally regulated industry that is required to have different types of security and support systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971789">We will see where this goes. The time in this place is always shorter than we think. That is why I am hoping this regulatory process will come into effect sooner rather than later.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971791">I always find it interesting that, when we get into debates on motions or private members' bills, sometimes individuals will read into them things that are not necessarily there from the sponsor's perspective. I have seen that before. When I look at this particular motion, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278512" Type="2">Fleetwood—Port Kells</Affiliation> has done a wonderful job in identifying an issue that is very important to many people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971792">Most people would be quite surprised. Some might say that the centre of a runway or the total length of a runway is a bit of a nuance. I was in air traffic control before, posted in Edmonton. It has the longest runway in the Commonwealth. A space shuttle could land on it. I can recall the fire hall's having drills, and I can say that it takes quite a while to get down a 14,000-foot runway. I can understand and appreciate that every second counts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971793">We need to recognize that when members bring forward motions, not very many of them will pass in the life of a session. The member has been inspired to bring this issue forward, and I suspect it might have had something to do with discussions we had about recognizing cancer agents for firefighters. The government was made aware of this in a very real and tangible way by another member of the chamber, the <Affiliation DbId="278753" Type="2">former deputy House leader</Affiliation>. By their raising the issue, the public and the House of Commons became more familiar with it and ultimately passed legislation. Today, firefighters from coast to coast to coast have benefited from that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971794">The motion my colleague from British Columbia has brought forward deals with the issue of safety. When we canvass about different professions and ask which ones Canadians really respond positively to, I suggest that firefighters are close to the top of the list. I will not say where politicians are. When I think of the firefighters in the community I represent, Winnipeg North, I have an incredible amount of confidence in people like Alex Forrest and the associations that not only advocate for the safety of their membership but also ensure that Canadians are safe, whether they are in their homes or in international or domestic airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971795">To be honest, I had no idea that firefighters at airports are not allowed to go into a plane. That surprises me. I think it would surprise a lot of people. The other point that is raised in the motion is that the location of fire halls is also important. If there is a three-minute standard and the location of a fire hall could make the difference, then why would we not give some sort of consideration to that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971796">Across the way, some would ask why the member brought this forward in the form of a motion as opposed to talking to the department. After all, it is a so-called regulation, and the regulation should be changed, as one member across the aisle pointed out. However, the member also indicated that this has been an issue for many years, for decades.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7971797">Let us not try to make it a political partisan issue. Let us believe that the member has taken an initiative during private members' hour and that he feels that, at the very least, he now has a mandate to be able to bring it to a standing committee. Not only are we having a debate here, but if it passes the chamber, it can also get the standing committee engaged. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971798">I think there was one member who spoke, talking about whether the matter should be brought to a standing committee. I love the answer that was provided. We are setting this as the goal, saying that people need to be aware of this. This motion makes us all aware of a very important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971799">In terms of how it is actually implemented, the standing committee could assist in that. Members who want to pick up the ball from where the member has brought it to now, to date, could ultimately bring it to a standing committee. The committee could work out the different ways in which it can actually be implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971800">If at some point in time, unlike in the last 40 or 50 years, it is determined that this could be done, I think there would be a greater likelihood today that we would actually see the change as a direct result of the initiative from the private member. This is if a standing committee has also taken a look, and, through the standing committee, there have been invites to professionals, whether firefighters or municipalities, to come forward to make presentations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971801">I do not think we should be discouraging private members from identifying issues that are important to them. We should be encouraging it. Through that, we get the type of changes into the future that can really make a difference. I respect that about the member's motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971802">As I said, as a member of the Canadian Forces, I sat out in a tower. It is no longer there, as this was a few years back. I do not want to date myself, but I can say that one builds up a bit of a relationship and sees the practice that is taken, and justifiably so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971803">Our firefighters take their jobs seriously. They are very quick to respond. There is a standard that we are talking about, in terms of three minutes, and maybe it is time that we try to raise the profile of this issue to a degree where we can see some specific action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971804">That may mean, at the end of the day, that the municipalities and Ottawa need to work together and maybe even bring in the provinces. Our airports are economic engines. They provide so much to our communities, and they need to be safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971805">That is why, ultimately, when I would see the fire trucks going out onto runway 29-11, back at Lancaster Park, I saw first-hand the types of responses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971806">I must say that they actually did, at least in the military, even more than that, by going out. There are other types of benefits. They are not just direct but also indirect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971807">I hope that members will, in fact, support my colleague's motion with the idea that the issue has now hit a point in time where we will at least have some sort of discussion on how it can actually be done. Then we can work on ways in which we can improve the issue of safety at our airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971808">I thank the member for bringing the resolution forward.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7971809">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be rising on Motion No. 96. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971810">As many people know, I spent 30 and a half years as a firefighter. I am actually trained as an aircraft rescue firefighter. I spent a week up at Base Borden trudging through AFFF, which I am now finding out is a cancerous material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971811"> Where I worked in Markham, we had Buttonville Airport. There was no active firefighting capabilities on site, and all of it was done through the municipality in Markham. I remember responding to several incidents of aircraft crashes, such as landing gear coming up and the aircraft not being able to land, and aircraft landing on top of buildings, so it was interesting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971812">I enjoyed being an aircraft rescue firefighter, to be frank, because of the training involved, such as understanding the different aircraft and some of the emergencies that could occur, including making sure that a means of regress was the number one priority and protecting the exits of those aircraft that were in trouble. I dealt with multi-engine aircraft, but I never dealt with large aircraft that we would see, for example, at Pearson or Vancouver international airports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971813">I want to thank the member for bringing Motion No. 96 forward. I think that it is well intentioned. I believe that none of us in this place want to limit or diminish the value of safety, either for the passengers, pilots and crew of an aircraft, or for those firefighters who are intended to respond. However, I am not sure that Motion No. 96 is the way to go about it, quite frankly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971814">There are a lot of stakeholders who need to be involved in this process, not the least of which is the International Association of Fire Fighters, whom I spoke with this afternoon, along with airports and the Airports Council. There are other stakeholders that need to be included in the process, including, for example, the pilots associations, such as ACPA, the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association and regional airport authorities. They all need to be involved in this process of understanding the full impact of what the motion proposes. In my opinion, this motion would be better off going through the process of the committee, and I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> talk about that. That way, we could get all of the stakeholders together. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971815">How would this affect municipal agreements? There are many across this country in which local and regional airports have an agreement with a municipality. What are the impacts on cost? What are the impacts on personnel? These are the types of discussions that we should be having on this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971816">The motion does identify a problem, and I can tell members that in my time of being here, every time I have met with the International Association of Fire Fighters and the Barrie firefighters, they come advocating for improved responses at airports. There is no question that this is an issue. In fact, the regulations have not been addressed since the 1990s, so it is time that we have this discussion. Furthermore, the government has within its power the ability to initiate the type of regulations that are required to increase safety at airports. The minister, in fact, could do it with one swoop of the pen if he wanted to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971817"> I believe that I will have more time to speak about the logistics of this at the next intervention, but as I stated, and I will make the point again, all of the stakeholders need to be involved in this process, and that would include the firefighters, the Airports Council, regional airport authorities, the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association and a whole list of others. The only way that can be done is through the process that is in place, and that is through the transportation committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971818">Let us make sure that we get it there, have a fulsome discussion and look at the implications. I do not want to take away from the good nature of what the member is proposing here, because I believe it has been done in good faith, but this needs to be studied in its entirety to understand what the full impact is going to be on airports, on municipalities, certainly on our country and on safety as well. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7971821">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise tonight on adjournment business and talk about a question I put to the government last June. I asked the government about interest rates, and I pointed out the devastating effect that interest rates are having on Canadian homebuyers and homeowners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971822">I asked when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would take the advice of other Liberals, including former finance minister, John Manley. John Manley asked the Liberals to take their foot off the inflationary gas pedal and stop pouring gas on the inflationary fire, so there would be less pressure on interest rates so we could avoid a crisis among mortgage holders and mortgage payers, and also get some relief to homebuyers amid this affordability crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971823">The response I got was really quite disappointing. The parliamentary secretary at the time did not even make any attempt to answer the question. I am not even sure if he heard the question, because his response was totally unrelated to any of the elements that my question contained. He talked about small business loans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971824">He actually said something that is false. He should probably be brought to the House and made to withdraw his statement. He falsely claimed that opposition parties voted specifically against the CEBA support program for small businesses during COVID. That is an untrue statement. That is a fact. He should apologize and withdraw the remarks; they were unparliamentary and false.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971825">Be that as it may, it gives me an opportunity tonight to get a little deeper on this issue. The truth is homeowners across Canada are concerned about whether they are going to be able to stay in the house that they already own. Mortgage payments are more than doubling for most mortgage customers when their mortgages renew.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971826">We have people who bought homes in 2018 with five-year fixed mortgages that are maturing this year, and they are beside themselves because they do not know how they are going to make the payments. People are seeing their mortgage payments go from $2,500 to $6,000 a month. They cannot do that; they do not have the income to do that. In some cases, people are going to lose their homes. Depending on what city they are in, depending on what their local market is doing, they may not even be able to sell their home. We saw transactions that could not close.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971827">At the time I asked the question, I had been speaking to some people in the industry. I have over 20 years in the mortgage brokerage business before I was a member of Parliament. I was talking to some of my colleagues and some of the industry people in Calgary. We have people who could not close on new construction deals because of the enormous shift in interest rates that occurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971828">The government is absolutely oblivious to this and the role it has played in pouring inflationary gas onto the fire. It has a responsibility to do something, to rein in inflation. It talks about the support payments during a small period of its time in office, but most of the deficits that it has piled on were before and after COVID, or had nothing to do with COVID support payments. We have half a trillion plus in new debt, more than every government in history combined. This has an effect on interest rates and inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971829">When are the Liberals going to rein it in and do something to help quell the inflationary fire?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971830">Mr. Speaker, I think at times Conservatives are challenged when it comes time to look at the reality of what is taking place not only in our communities, but around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971831">First and foremost, it is important for us to recognize that Canadians are, in fact, hurting. We are very much concerned about inflation rates, interest rates and the whole issue of affordability. We do not need to be lectured by Conservatives who have the mentality that the way to resolve things is to just cut, aimed recklessly at where it is they would like to take the country and at a huge risk. That is the Conservative way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971832">We have been consistent. Let us compare Canada to any other country. Let us look at the U.S. or the G20 countries, from Germany to France to England, and what they have for interest rates and what is happening with inflation. In comparison, Canada is doing relatively well. That gets completely lost on Conservatives, because they have a specific agenda of trying to say that everything in the country is broken. They are like the Prince of Darkness. They have nothing to say that is positive about the economy, the hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created and the supports that have been put into place. That does not mean that we do not have to provide additional support. We have legislation before us, which Conservatives continue to filibuster, that is going to put money into the pockets of Canadians and ensure we see thousands more homes being built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971833">I have news for the member opposite and the Conservative Party. No government in the last 50 or 60 years has invested more into housing. Stephen Harper was an absolute failure when it came to investing in housing. One of the reasons we have a shortage today is because of the former government's inability to have affordable housing. It was this government that came up with the housing strategy that ultimately led to millions of dollars of investment into the repair of affordable housing, and thousands of affordable homes. It is this government that has supported things such as infill housing through non-profit agencies and working with provincial entities to ensure that we can improve Canada's housing stock. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971834">Compare that to Stephen Harper. Yes, we have seen substantial growth, and growth throughout the pandemic, which had created very difficult times for a lot of people. Let us put it in the proper perspective, in a context that is fair, which is something Conservatives are not. I think $300 million was spent on 99 homes built. The reality is Conservatives were missing in action when it came to the issue of affordability in housing. There is no doubt they did not believe there was a federal role, that the national government should play a strong leadership role. That is the absolute opposite of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971835">When it comes time to deal with things such as interest rates and the issue of inflation, the member's <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> said that he would fire the Governor of the Bank of Canada. Now he is glorifying him and putting him on a pedestal when a number of months ago he said he would fire him. Those are the flip-flop policies we cannot count on. </ParaText>

The greatest risk to Canadians is if the government should last much longer.

              <ParaText id="7971844">In February 2022, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="278218" Type="2">Huron—Bruce</Affiliation> introduced a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which would also exempt natural gas and propane used on farms for essential tasks like drying grain and heating barns. A year later, in March 2023, it passed the House of Commons with full support from the Conservatives, the NDP, the Bloc, the Green Party and a handful of Liberals. However, the bill is now in the Senate and has been there for some time. Then the Senate amended the bill and took out the exemption for buildings. This was a piece of legislation passed in the House through three readings and through committee, and it went to the Senate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971845"> This is with respect to the exemption for farmers on carbon tax. These are the people who do not get a rebate. We hear all the time that the government is sending a rebate. I have talked to many people at farm operations, because my riding is a rural one, including last weekend at a meeting I had in the small community of Enchant. The farmers do not get a rebate, but they are paying a huge carbon tax. The bill has now been amended. I have the utility bills from one of those people, and for one their buildings, they paid $15,000 in carbon tax. This would have been exempted, but now the bill is sitting in the Senate, amended.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971846"> For the bill to get out of there, amended, it has to come back here and go through the process. Is there a likelihood of the bill's being passed before we get to another summer? The bill has been kicking around for two summers. For two summers, farmers across the country, from coast to coast, have been paying carbon tax on propane and natural gas for grain dryers and buildings. The bill was what we needed for our agricultural sector. Now, the Senate has amended it and taken out the exemption for buildings. Like I said, a constituent of mine paid $15,000 for carbon tax. It was not the price of the power and the electricity; it was carbon tax because they are using natural gas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971847">The bill is going to come back here. The delay costs the agriculture sector because of <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>-appointed senators making the amendment to it. Let us understand that: It was Prime Minister-appointed senators who made this amendment. They knew what they were doing. They knew the delay that they were causing. This is hardship. The carbon tax allows no rebate to these kinds of farmers. They do not get the rebates that the government members constantly talk about. It is a travesty to our agricultural sector that this has happened.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971848">Mr. Speaker, the member is talking about a very important issue, and there is no doubt about that. I am very sympathetic to the farmer, and also very understanding of the Conservative Party's positioning on the issue of the price on pollution, or carbon tax, whatever one wants to call it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971849">When it comes to farmers, I do believe there have been some healthy discussions with different ministers, in particular the <Affiliation DbId="300021" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, who has been following this issue very closely. We want to ensure, as much as possible, we are helping farmers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971850">At times I too get frustrated. I remember when I was in opposition and there were huge ships out in the Pacific Ocean that were not able to come in and pick up the wheat piles all over the Prairies. The wheat, in many cases, was getting wet, and there were serious issues back then. The member would know, if he recalls, at the time there was that issue along with the one of the Canadian wheat board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971851">I bring this up because I do very much follow agriculture and the importance of food supply. Canada plays a critical role in this whole area. I would like to think, given the number of stakeholders out there, that they will continue to work with not only the federal government but provincial jurisdictions, and to a certain degree the many municipalities. We need to ensure farmers are supported in a very real and tangible way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971852">However, then the member brings in the issue of the carbon tax. As the member is very much aware, it is very much an issue of contention in Ottawa nowadays. The Conservative Party says it will get rid of the carbon tax, or the price on pollution, and its members have made that commitment. If by chance, whether it is in two years, four years, six years or eight years, they ever get the opportunity to govern, I suspect there is a very good chance that commitment will happen. I say that tongue in cheek to a certain degree because in the last campaign, they actually campaigned in favour of a price on pollution. When it was in the election platform, did they exempt the farmer? If not, why did they not do that? I would be very much interested in knowing if the member is aware of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971853">Having said that, I realize there has been a change, but it is an important point. It demonstrates consistency of party policy. The member knows full well the government's position on the price on pollution and the carbon tax. We will continue to provide rebates. We should continue to have dialogue with farmers and see how the government can continue to work with the agricultural community to ensure it is able to continue to grow and prosper. The agricultural community as a whole is one of the greatest environmentalists in the nation. On many of the techniques and ways it cultivates land, we lead the world. We also lead the world in many different ways when it comes to the environment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971854">Mr. Speaker, to my colleague, I know he is from Winnipeg, which used to be the grain exchange centre of the world. It is part of the heritage of the Prairies. I am very pragmatic about this. In my riding, which has 70% irrigation, the costs are huge, as is the money paid on the carbon tax, and there is not the recognition of the value irrigation brings to the amount of crops we can produce in this country and the variety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971855">We grow more potatoes than P.E.I. these days in my riding and we have the only sugar plant left, and we grow sugar beets because of irrigation. Farmers tell me on a regular basis the carbon tax is so hard on them, so we lose from our communities hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars, up to millions and millions. This hurts our communities because those farmers are not able to buy what they could if they did not lose it on the carbon tax. They cannot support our rural communities. They cannot volunteer to donate things they would have donated before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971856">It is a piece pragmatic for me that those who produce the best and highest quality and variety of foods because of irrigation are paying the highest price for carbon tax. That exemption needs to be understood, and I think it has been recognized there should be more conversations about agriculture.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7971857">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the manner in which the member is presenting the case. In the agricultural sector, there are many strong advocacy groups and farmer personalities. They are always very happy, I have found in the past, to share their opinions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971858"> Many of us recognize that we need to do more for the environment. When we are doing that, there is no intention to devastate an industry. The diversification of crops benefits not only the farmer but also all the communities in many different ways. We could talk about what we see on the food table for Canadian products and of the overall future through diversification. I love the amount of diversity we have witnessed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7971859">Being from a Prairie province, I think of strawberries from Portage la Prairie, which irrigation plays a role in. The member made reference to potatoes. Manitoba grows a lot of potatoes, too, and irrigation is important. I am sympathetic to what the member is saying, and I am going to have—</ParaText>
