              <ParaText id="7936238">Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin people who have lived on these lands for millennia. We recognize the enduring presence of first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples on this territory.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936239">It is with great humility that I rise to offer my candidacy as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936240">I have been in the workforce for 34 years. One half of that time has been spent as a litigator. When I was called to the bar of Prince Edward Island in 1989, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Gerard Mitchell as he then was, reminded me that as a member of the bar, I was an officer of the court and that my first duty was to the court. It was not to my clients, not to my firm, but to the court. Throughout my legal career, there were professional differences, robust debates and aggressive cross-examinations, but the respect for the administration of justice, the professional code of conduct and the rule of law transcended everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936241">I offer this comment not to say that we need more lawyers in this House, as for God's sake we have enough already, but to say that the level of respect for Parliament and the office of the Speaker has taken an incredible beating in this session of Parliament, especially in question period, and it does not need to. A vigorous and relentless prosecution of an issue is not made stronger by the repeated flouting of the rules of this place or by defying the Speaker. It denigrates this institution and all of us, its temporary occupants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936242">I believe it is time for a reset, and the election of a Speaker in the middle of a parliamentary session is a historically unique opportunity to do just that. We can do better and we must. If individual members are willing to be part of a collective effort to restore public confidence in the way we treat each other and the rules of Parliament, then I would be honoured to lead that cause. If, on the other hand, members are comfortable with the current state of decorum and level of respect for the office of the Speaker, please do not vote for me.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936243">I was first elected to Parliament in 2011 and proudly took my seat as an MP for the third party. We were in the Centre Block at the time. I spent four years as a member of the third party, then four years as parliamentary secretary to three different ministers, and the last four years as chair of standing committees. This variety of experience informs my perspective and approach to everything I do and makes it less difficult for me to put myself in the position of the MPs I am talking to. I submit this experience to the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936244">The events of September 22 were unfortunate, embarrassing and hurtful. A good man, with a deep respect for all of us and for this place, acknowledged his mistake and gave up a role that he took extremely seriously as a servant of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936245">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278667" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation> for his service and to welcome him back to caucus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936246">It will now be up to the next Speaker to make sure that this never happens again and that the proper procedures and protocols are adhered to. It will also be important that the new Speaker reach out to the communities that were hurt, including Jewish Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936247">I am ready to accept members' advice on how to lead this outreach.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936250">I will bring a breadth of experience, tough love, progressive discipline and a quick wit to the role of Speaker.

              <ParaText id="7936257">Colleagues, today I am running to be your Speaker. My last two years as Deputy Speaker of the House has confirmed my deep desire to continue to work as your Speaker. My experience will assist you in the discharging of your responsibilities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936258">Since my election to the House of Commons in 2019, I have gotten to know quite a few of you, from all parties. I have taken that duty to heart ever since I was named Deputy Speaker in 2021. I thank you all for the great talks. I intend to maintain this approach regardless of the vote's result, because friendship must prevail in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936259">Hon. colleagues, I have heard you. Like many of you, I want to restore this august place's reputation. It is the Speaker's duty to put respect for each other, for our Standing Orders, for decorum and for procedures at the centre of our proceedings. I am convinced that I will successfully fulfill the Speaker's duties and make sure that the powers and privileges of the House are top priorities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936261">As many of you know by now, I have a very calm French Canadian demeanour and work well with others. In fact, these are traits that are strongly tied to my deep Acadian roots, as we Nova Scotian Acadians learned, once we returned home from exile, to remain calm and non-confrontational and to continuously strive for consensus no matter the situation we find ourselves in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936262">Let us remember that the last few years have been difficult, and we have faced many challenges. Last week was incredible.

              <ParaText id="7936265">Canada is a bilingual nation, and the Speaker of the House must also be bilingual. However, beyond the ability to speak both official languages, the Speaker must have a firm grasp of the unique linguistic and cultural characteristics of the people who call these languages their own.

              <ParaText id="7936291">I begin by acknowledging that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Anishinabe Algonquin nation. It is important that we, as representatives of the Crown, acknowledge the people whose lands we stand on and the history that this place represents in this context, especially as we just marked the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation this past weekend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936292">We sit here today at a unique moment in the history of the House. It is obviously quite rare for us to discuss the election of a new Speaker in the middle of a Parliament. This has been done only once before, when Speaker John Bosley, who was coincidentally the last Speaker appointed to the role rather than elected, resigned to sit in the Progressive Conservative backbenches in 1986.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936293">Speaker Bosley, whom you may remember was commemorated in the House last year following his passing, left the position because he was concerned about the erosion of public respect for Parliament and believed he could do more to build that respect from outside of the Speaker's chair. Speaker Bosley was clearly concerned about how the House was being perceived by the Canadian electorate. The erosion of public respect for Parliament is real, and I believe we, the members of the House, all have a responsibility to work toward improving it.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936294">The role of the Speaker, as representative of the House of Commons, is to guide this institution in the debates, to oversee the rules and traditions that are so dear to us and, perhaps most importantly at this time, to maintain order and decorum so as to restore the public's respect for Parliament—something that Speaker Bosley was concerned about nearly 40 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936295">I believe that my experience as Assistant Deputy Speaker has prepared me for this role. I have held this position for the duration of the past two Parliaments and the first half of this Parliament.

              <ParaText id="7936296">I have made decisions that maybe, at times, were not popular, even with members of my own party, because the duties of the Chair demanded it. I have also heard from some members of all parties that they believe I am fair and even-handed and have been consistent in my application of the rules of the House. When we are here, regardless of what our party affiliation is, the rules are the rules.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936297">Speaking of political parties, I know there is more that binds us together than divides us. We are all here because we love our nation and are all dedicated to seeing it flourish. We may have different ideas about how to accomplish this goal, and it is vital that we encourage healthy debate to find the common ground. However, I feel, as I am certain many of you do, that at times members can act in a manner that is challenging for the House. I believe that, in those moments, we do a disservice to the House and to Canadians by allowing unhealthy debate to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936298">My commitment to each of you is that you will have your moment to engage in healthy debate, and you will allow your colleagues their moment to a healthy debate, without unacceptable interruptions, shouting or heckling. This is how we rebuild the public's trust in and respect for Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936299">I am also looking forward to following in the footsteps of another of our predecessors, the Right Hon. Jeanne Sauvé, former governor general of Canada, who is to this day the only woman who has served as Speaker of the House of Commons. It has been over 40 years since she last presided over the House, and I believe that we must show young women that they too can see themselves represented in our institutions, including as Speaker of the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936300">In closing, I would like to remind members that Canadians are looking to us to make Parliament work in a way that will deliver results for them.

              <ParaText id="7936308">For me, this is essential. If you walk down the back corridor behind the Speaker's chair, you will see the portraits of former Speakers. I do think you should pause in front of the portrait of Lucien Lamoureux, who served this place from 1966 to 1974. He was the best of all of our Speakers. He personified nonpartisanship. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936309">Elected as a Liberal in the government of Lester B. Pearson, when Lucien Lamoureux ran for re-election as a sitting Speaker, he did so twice as an independent. He also applied our rules, which meant he was not always popular, and he was not elected. He was able to enforce the rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936310">Everyone who has spoken has said our rules are important, but on a daily basis we ignore Standing Orders 16 and 18, which require that we respect one another and that we treat each other with respect.</ParaText>

              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936313">There are rules about recognizing visitors in the galleries. In this case, it is clear that the rules were broken in acknowledging that man's presence.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936314">I know that because I tried to convince the former Speaker to recognize someone whom I thought did deserve recognition in our gallery, only to be told that Dr. David Suzuki did not qualify, so I know the rules represent a steep hill to climb to have someone recognized in the gallery. I cannot imagine how this happened, but I also agree words are not enough. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936315">That moment in this House brought back the words of the late Irving Abella, who said that in our history it was easier to gain entry to Canada as a Nazi than as a Jew. I think we have to do more than say we are sorry. I think we have to atone and open up the records of the Deschênes commission. We have to look at our history, just as we do on the day of truth and reconciliation for the injustices and genocide toward indigenous peoples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936317">The Speaker's role is essential, as the Speaker is the only person who can decide who speaks in question period. It has been 40 years that the Speaker has broken the rules every single day, regardless what Speaker we are talking about, by accepting a list from a party whip that tells him or her who speaks and in what order. That abomination has moved the system of rewards and punishments from the Speaker to the party whip. The party whips are not the people we want to please if we want this place to operate with respect and to make Canadians look at the House of Commons and think, “There is a place I respect; that is democracy in action.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936320">I pledge my support to the next Speaker, whoever is brave enough to go back to following our rule that only the Speaker chooses who speaks in question period. This was confirmed when the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> was the Speaker of the House, in April 2013 on a point of order from the late Mark Warawa.

Loving what we do, this place where we do it and the people who help us do it, for me, is a fundamental aspect of a successful parliamentary life. It cannot and should not be all about insults and accusations, about “gotcha” moments and questionable statements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936333">I associate some of the most meaningful hours I have experienced in the House with debates where members strove to find shared goals. Emergency and take-note debates, private members' bills and motions, and even some legislative initiatives are often moments where we find our better natures. This is the place where Canada's important conversations should be held, where we seriously debate and where we humourously disagree.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936334">What I take away from those moments is that we are all quite capable of rising above partisan sparring when that is what is called for, and that some of our colleagues' sense of humour seasons what would otherwise be dry or overly technical conversations with a zesty <I>je ne sais quoi</I>.</ParaText>

She is too young to understand what that means. She is too young to fully grasp the significance of the work that we do here every single day, but she will understand it one day. Colleagues, if you are asking me for my two reasons for running to be the 38th Speaker, there they are: to be your servant as we honour those who sought this place out in generations past and to be your servant to help build an even stronger democratic institution for my children, your children and future generations of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936346">Colleagues, we are at a pivotal moment in Canadian history. I truly feel that. Through the conversations that I have had with so many of you over the weekend, I know that you feel that way, too. We have the work ahead of us of rebuilding trust in this place among members, of rebuilding trust that Canadians have in this place, of rebuilding trust that our allies and friends around the world have in us. As your Speaker, that will be my primary priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936347">First and foremost, I seek to put in place a policy that will ensure due diligence, so that when I rise as your Speaker to ask hon. members to rise on behalf of somebody who is in the gallery, you can do so with trust and with confidence. I pledge to you that within one week of being elected your Speaker, I will invite Jewish community leaders from across the country, as well as veterans groups that are also affected by what happened that Friday, to this place, to apologize as your Speaker on behalf of all members of this House. I pledge that I will send a communiqué within one week of being elected Speaker to the hon. Speaker of the Parliament of Ukraine, informing him of my intentions to apologize to him and the members of the Ukrainian Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936348">I believe these to be diligent measures and ones that are necessary if we seek to move on and truly reconcile with what occurred on September 22. Just as important will be my work to ensure that your right to speak freely in this place is defended. The story goes that the distance between the Right Hon. <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s desk and the desk of the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was measured in such a way to be the distance of two duelling individuals, their swords drawn, with one inch added in the middle, that inch to symbolize that in this place we solve our differences not through violence but through discourse, dialogue and debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936349">As your Speaker, I vow to do everything that I can within the powers and the tools available to me as Speaker, to ensure that when you come to this place every single day to do the hard work for Canadians, you are able to do that, to share your gift, the gift that your constituents saw in you and the reason they sent you here: to be able to share that gift unimpeded and without fear of intimidation.</ParaText>

You started off with a message of humility, which is very powerful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936419">I also want to acknowledge the incredible weight that you now bear and the incredible feat that you have achieved. When people walk the halls of this place and look at the pictures on the walls to be reminded of some of the great achievements of Canada and some of the grave errors we have made as a nation, they are one day going to see your face on the walls of this chamber.

We know there is going to be, and rightly so, increased attention on all parliamentarians and on this House. I have no doubt that you will be able to satisfy your responsibilities with the utmost capacity, but it is indeed an increased responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936421">I also know that there are deep concerns about divisions in politics and the polarization of debate. While vigorous debates are of course important, there is a certain tone and decorum that must be upheld. Going back to kids visiting this place, sometimes when school kids are watching the elected officials of this country engaging in debate, I am embarrassed that they are watching people yelling outlandish things and acting as if it is cool to be yelling at someone while they are speaking. I hope you can restore some decorum. It is important. Everyone is going to have a chance to share their viewpoints, but it should be done in such a way that people are able to express them and then sit down. Then someone else can respond and rebut. I hope you can create that decorum, restore the prestige of this place and restore confidence in the important work that happens here.</ParaText>

When the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> was the housing minister, homes were attainable and affordable. Now it takes 25 years to save up for a down payment in a city like Toronto. Some families have even had to stretch the terms of their mortgages to a shocking 90 years. Some just cannot make their payments anymore.</ParaText>

He is clearly only reading one sub-bullet when he is looking to the measures that will build 5,000 homes. I would point him to the estimates that the cut on GST for apartment construction in this country would have, showing that we expect to see up to 300,000 homes built. I point him to the recent change to the Canada mortgage bond program, which is going to add 30,000 homes a year over the next decade, which is 300,000 homes. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7936733">Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk today about Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document>, which is the Liberal-NDP government's attempt at dealing with the affordability issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936734">To talk about the legislation itself, we first need to look at where we are in this country, and it is not a very pretty picture. If we look at where we are right now, mortgage payments over the last eight years have virtually doubled in this country from coast to coast to coast. We have a similar issue now with rent all across the country. If we look at the average rents being paid now, that amount has also virtually doubled. This is the track record of the Liberal government, which now suddenly seems to be concerned about affordability for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936735">However, the bad news for Canadians does not stop there. It used to take 25 years to pay off one's mortgage. Now it takes the average Canadian 25 years to save for their mortgage. Think about what the difference between those is. Some people might say that is not their problem and that this is a young person's problem when they are trying to get into the market. It is bad enough if it is a young person's problem, but it is also affecting average Canadians right here and right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936736">I was recently informed about a person whose mortgage has come up for renewal. Their mortgage was coming from that nice, low fixed interest rate. People will remember those low interest rates the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said were going to be there for a very long time, the interest rates the Governor of the Bank of Canada said were going to stay low for a very long time. Based on that, many people took mortgages with a very low interest rate because it allowed them to have a mortgage payment they could afford. However, as mortgage rates have continued to go up, as the Bank of Canada has continued to raise interest rates in order to fight inflation, average Canadians now have to pay the bill as a result of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936737">In this particular circumstance, this family has said that it can hold on for about another six months with this increased mortgage payment. They can dig into savings and they can further borrow for about six months, and then they are not going to be able to make the mortgage payments on their home. That is the consequence of eight years of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936738">Inflation is out of control. I hear it all the time in my riding of Dufferin—Caledon. People come up to me in the grocery store and say to me that they now have to only go to the grocery store to shop bargains. They do not actually have a grocery list, because they can buy only what is on sale. This is all they can afford. After eight years of the Liberal government, this is what people are saying to me in the grocery store. It is a shocking turnaround for Canadians. They are having trouble paying their mortgages. They are having trouble buying groceries. They are having trouble heating their homes as a result of the carbon tax. All of these things are making life more expensive for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936739">There is a simple solution. There are actually two very simple solutions the government could implement right away. Number one is that it could cut the carbon tax. We know that would have an immediate impact, because, as has been said by Conservatives in the House of Commons over and over again, the farmers are taxed on farm produce. As they produce it, they are taxed with the carbon tax. Whether that is for drying the grain, driving the combines or whatever, they are paying a carbon tax. When that crop is harvested, the driver of the truck that comes to pick it up is going to pay the carbon tax. When it goes to be processed, there is a carbon tax. When a truck picks it up to take it to the grocery store, there is a carbon tax. At the grocery store, the carbon tax is heating the grocery store; therefore, the store owner is paying a carbon tax as well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936740">At the end of the day, Canadians cannot afford to pay for food, and they end up saying that they do not even have a grocery list and just go to the grocery store and buy whatever is on sale. If we would have said this to Canadians eight years ago, they would have said that this was not possible. In a country like Canada, food is abundant. We feed the world because we have the best farmers in the world, who are great stewards of the land. If we had said eight years ago that Canadians would only be able to go to the grocery store and shop bargains, that would have been an inconceivable thought, but here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936741">After eight years of the Liberal government, that is the sad situation that Canadians find themselves in. It is very difficult to pay the mortgage, very difficult to buy groceries, very difficult to pay rent and very difficult to buy a house. That is the Liberals' record. That is the context that we look at when they bring in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936742">This is not a new problem. Conservatives have been talking about this problem for the last number of years. In fact, the Conservative leader, many years ago, said that the inflationary spending caused by the government was going to drive up inflation, which would then drive up interest rates. He is looking more and more like Nostradamus with that prediction. As for me, 18 months ago, I rose to speak about the impact of the carbon tax on food production. I said that it was going to cause a massive increase in the cost of food, and here we are. The Liberal government cannot therefore claim that somehow this is a new problem, that it was unaware of the problem. It was well aware. It was well forewarned and did absolutely nothing about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936743">When we look at this particular bill, what is amazing to me is that Liberal members will get up in this House during debate and during question period and talk about how, as a result of tabling this legislation, one developer has said it is now going to build 5,000 rental units. They puff out their chests and say to look at them, look at the amazing things they have accomplished. Well, let us put that into context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936744">According to the CMHC, we will need to build three million more homes between now and 2030 than are planned or scheduled to be built. The plan is that we will build two million homes. We will have to build three million more than that in order to get back some affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936745">As I have said a few times in this chamber, I went to law school because I was not good at math. However, what I did before I prepared for this speech is decided to get out my calculator and look at this. I saw that 5,000 units out of the three million we need is 0.0016%. If I had a child come home with a bad grade, and the teacher not only put an F on there but said that my son got 0.0016% on the test, I would not be a proud father. However, somehow these members walk around like they have discovered fire with this plan to build such a small number of houses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936746">It is even worse. To even come up with some of their plan, they had to take from the Conservative leader's plan. With grocery affordability, again, the best thing they could do is cut the carbon tax, which they repeatedly vote against. We know that this would bring the most relief. They also decided they are going to bring in some Competition Act changes, which they also stole from a Conservative member of Parliament's private member's bill. When a government is completely out of ideas, affordability has gone off the scale and Canadians are deeply hurting, what does the government, the brain trust and all of the political advisers they have come up with? Well, they just take what the Conservatives said they were going to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936747">They have only taken some of it. What we have here is a plan that is not going to do anything to address the affordability crisis that is going on across the country, and there is a real consequence. I spoke about this in question period. For example, there is Paula in B.C., 71, who is retired. She is now saying that she might have to move out of her house because the landlord is going to sell it. She is also facing a 75% increase in rent as a result of that. That is their record. They have not provided solutions quickly or ones that are going to address the concerns of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7936768">Madam Speaker, today I rise in this chamber to debate Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document>, which would make several important and timely amendments to the Competition Act. A stronger competition framework is good for all Canadians, ensuring that companies are playing fairly, preserving opportunities for new firms to enter the market and ensuring that consumers benefit from more and better choices in the marketplace. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936769">The bill includes three significant changes to the Competition Act: one, the ability for the Competition Bureau to compel information during a market study; two, the abolition of the efficiencies defence from merger review; and finally, the enabling of the review of agreements between any two parties when the agreement is designed to limit competition. These three important amendments stem from the government's extensive consultations, which took place over the last several months. These measures and others like them have widespread support, particularly from Canadians and small businesses. They reflect the concerns raised and respond to the pleas of many stakeholders from a wide variety of backgrounds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936770">The Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development has released a report on what it heard during its consultations. I strongly recommend that all my colleagues review it to gain an understanding of the stakes involved and learn about some of the issues under consideration as the government takes the next steps. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936771">With that in mind, I would like to share some of what stakeholders had to say in support of the measures that ended up in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936772">Regarding market studies, the consultation drew a significant number of comments on the importance of knowing how our markets function. The majority of stakeholders felt that the Competition Bureau needed access to the best information and that this was the norm in most other countries. The Canadian Anti-Monopoly Project, a think tank dedicated to Canadian competition policy, stated that the lack of formal bureau powers in this area cripples its ability to understand new and emerging markets. It makes the bureau less able to assess if its enforcement decisions have had the desired impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936773">OpenMedia, a consumer organization dedicated to an open and free Internet, stressed the need for the bureau to have the power to proactively study new and emerging markets. In markets especially fraught with high levels of concentration, serious and persistent problems need to be detected in order to be tackled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936774">The importance of a competitive freight transport sector to bring goods to Canadians was driven home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain difficulties that it brought. A joint submission by the Freight Management Association of Canada and numerous producers and shippers who rely on our transportation infrastructure also came out in favour of a framework for market studies. They highlighted that the international nature of ocean shipping means national authorities need to be even more vigilant in monitoring the behaviour of the companies at their ports. Data collection systems are integral to assessing the impact on Canadian trade and business, and the bureau needs to be able to collect information outside of an enforcement context to properly detect problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936775">The Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a national public policy think tank, probably familiar to many members of Parliament, explains how an expanded information-collection power should be supported by traditionalists and reformers alike and serves to fill other information gaps that hinder government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936776">There was also a wide call for appropriate safeguards attached to market studies. The Canadian Bar Association asked that information requests be subject to judicial authorization and open to challenge by the parties, while the Business Council of Canada insisted that if studies were to be introduced, there must be time limits on their duration and that the responsible minister should provide approval to launch such a study. These guardrails are all provided for in the proposed approach outlined in Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936777">Now I would like to turn to another amendment to the Competition Act, which relates to the efficiencies defence. Long before the public consultation, the Competition Act's efficiencies exception has been a focus of commentary. This provision allows anti-competitive mergers to survive challenge if they generate corporate efficiencies that are said to outweigh competitive harm, even if consumers pay the price. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936778"> There was no shortage of submissions to the consultation on this particular topic. It is the area of concern that received the most engagement, with a strong majority supporting its abolition. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a national not-for-profit organization that promotes inclusive decision-making and protection of consumer interests, explained how the original policy intent of creating internationally competitive companies had not been met. It felt that the efficiencies defence has, in fact, served to protect domestic companies from competition, at consumers' expense. The Centre for International Governance Innovation has also come out against the efficiencies defence, which it sees as a mistaken attempt to bring more predictability to the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936779">Abolishing the defence is the right thing to do in recognition of the increasing concentration of multiple industries across Canada, as well as the corresponding decrease in competition. These factors create a significant drag on the real efficiency of our marketplaces, and the productivity and international competitiveness of our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936780">Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, explains how the efficiencies generated are often only passed on to the shareholders at the direct expense of laid-off workers. The cost savings of efficiencies come from a decrease in personnel, resulting in a less competitive industry that can more easily capture value for those at the top.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936781">Moreover, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the National Farmers Union and L'Union des producteurs agricoles, all key players in Canada's food procurement and supply chain, have come out in favour of the abolition of the efficiencies defence as well. Their reasons include a skepticism of the ability for efficiencies to overcome anti-competitive effects and their significant contribution to the ease of unfavourable acquisitions in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936782">Lastly, I wanted to talk about collaborations as another topic this bill addresses. The consultations also raised the question of whether the bureau should be able to review collaborations between non-competing entities when they harm competition. Currently, the law addresses only agreements or arrangements formed between real or potential competitors, and Bill <Document DbId="12569206" Type="3">C-56</Document> would expand that in some circumstances. A majority of those who commented on the matter supported broadening the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936783">The Consumers Council of Canada felt that the exclusion of certain agreements from reviewability renders the bureau unable to deal with real competition issues. They explain how commercial relationships established with good intentions by both sides can still lead to unanticipated and unintended consequences, and the bureau should not leave it up to businesses to decide—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936790">Madam Speaker, the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers has stressed that restrictive covenants in lease or purchase agreements, a form of vertical restraint that is not currently reviewable as a competitor collaboration under the Competition Act, have a serious impact on the food supply for a significant number of Canadian communities. The International Center for Law &amp; Economics also agreed that collaborations between any two actors have the possibility of harming competition, and that the Competition Act should not be limited arbitrarily in the sorts of agreements that it can review.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936791">In conclusion, the consultation process revealed many significant areas of concern for our Competition Act, informed by each stakeholder's unique perspective and valuable insight into the Canadian economy. The proposals that the government has chosen to advance were chosen to carefully target the most critical issues impacting affordability for Canadians in the near term and were informed by the inputs of a variety of actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936792">These three reforms represent much-needed updates to the Competition Act. They allow the Competition Bureau to better serve its mandate and will help make Canada a better place to live and do business. I hope all members will join me in supporting this bill's speedy passage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936811">This is yet another half-baked, half-measure bill from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to solve an affordability crisis that he, himself, and his government have created. After eight years of inflationary taxes and out-of-control spending, Canadians have now found that they cannot afford the Liberal government. They cannot afford housing.

This is going to add so much red tape and bureaucracy, and and an onus on every industry, manufacturing every product and growing every commodity, that it is going to make life that much more unaffordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936814">The interesting thing is that the Liberals are implementing or imposing these punishing carbon taxes on, for example, agriculture, which is one of the industries that we are a leader in. We are world class in sustainability, in our emissions and in our ability to grow food with the lowest emissions in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936815">The data in painfully clear on the impact the Liberals' carbon tax 1 and 2 is having on Canadian farm families. According to the Canada food price index, a 5,000-acre farm would be paying $150,000 in carbon taxes every single year. There is not a farmer I know that could absorb those types of costs and still remain economically viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936816">That is the question the Liberals always seem to forget. They talk about sustainability. I think they get a quarter every time they say it. However, they never talk about economic viability. When these new regulations and taxes are imposed on industry, agriculture or energy, it is impacting their ability to remain economically viable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936817">The Parliamentary Budget Officer just published a new report confirming the correlation between inflation in Canada and the suffocating carbon tax on our farmers. Diesel will go up 70¢ a litre. In many provinces, gas has already exceeded two dollars a litre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936818">When I was in Vancouver a couple of weeks ago, in the GVA meeting with some farmers, it was $2.08 a litre for gas. It is unbelievable that the government is now expecting Canadians to absorb that and still be able to put food on the table and pay their mortgages. This year alone, the carbon tax collected from farmers, just from on-farm propane and natural gas, was $50 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936819">I find it interesting that the <Affiliation DbId="300664" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> said in his speech on Thursday that he did not know why we were so excited, that the carbon tax does not impact farming. The statistics from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the Canada food price index and just about every commodity group in the country say otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936820">This is why we have brought forward Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document>, which would exempt the carbon tax from natural gas and propane because they are still paying the carbon tax on those two fossil fuels, and that is because there is no alternative. They need these fuels to heat and cool their barns, dry their grain and power their irrigation equipment. This is not something the Conservatives are tossing around, these are indeed the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936821">Those who think those numbers are bad can hold my jerry can. The newest Parliamentary Budget Officer's report on the impact of the carbon tax on farming said that between this year and the year 2030, agriculture will be paying $1 billion in carbon taxes alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936822">The Liberals are saying that these costs on farmers, which they do not even believe exist, while the Parliamentary Budget Officer confirms they do exist, are not impacting the price of food and not the reason we are seeing these high costs at the grocery store shelves.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936823">I do not know anyone, other than maybe those in the Liberal-NDP coalition, who thinks that adding taxes will somehow reduce prices. However, that is exactly what they are saying. As part of this discussion, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has threatened the CEOs of the major grocery chains in Canada, saying that, if they do not stabilize grocery prices by Thanksgiving, there will be tax consequences. He is threatening to increase taxes on the grocery store CEOs and the major chains in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936824"> Is there an issue with competition in Canada? Yes, I would agree with that. We need to do things to improve competition in Canada, which always brings down prices. However, do the government members honestly think and truly believe that if they increase taxes on Sobeys, Loblaws, Costco and Walmart, the companies are just going to absorb those additional costs? There is no scenario where an industry just says, “The government is right; we are going to pay more taxes, and thanks very much.” Of course they are not. They are going to pass them on to the consumers, and that is going to drive up costs even more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936825">I want to emphasize the real-life consequences these taxes are having on those whom we are relying on to grow the food that we use to feed our families; these growers certainly play a key role in Canada's ability to help feed the world. A fruit and vegetable grower in my riding showed me their power bills for the last few months. They were paying $5,000 a month in carbon taxes alone, plus $800 of GST on top of that carbon tax; it is a tax on a tax. The grower has now decided to close their market in the winter months because they simply cannot afford to stay open. That is fresh fruit and vegetables at a nearby farmers' market and grower, which my rural constituents were able to go to without having to drive into the city. That is now going to be closed, forcing constituents to drive even further. It makes a lot of sense if climate change and reducing emissions is their goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936826">A farmer in southern Alberta told me he paid $140,000 in carbon taxes last year, meaning that he could not invest that money in new equipment, which would have been more energy efficient and more fuel efficient. More frustrating for this grower is that he was hoping to have that money to put aside for his daughter, who wants to take over the family farm. She would have been the fifth generation to take over that farm. Now, instead of having that money to invest in his operation, improve efficiency, reduce emissions and help the next generation, where has that gone? It has gone to the Liberal government into general revenue. In fact, again, if reducing emissions and addressing climate change is their ultimate goal, this is doing the exact opposite.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936827">There is another interesting thing. The Liberals want to increase taxes on the grocery CEOs; however, many of the grocery stores in Canada are actually owned by local franchisees. I went to visit the operator at one of the larger Sobeys operations in my riding, to see how things were going. His energy bill has gone up $6,000 a month as a result of the carbon tax. He is trying to absorb those costs, because he is a local business owner. However, he says that, eventually, he is going to have to pass this on to the consumers; otherwise, it is going to have an impact on what he can pay his employees or what he can contribute to local community initiatives, service clubs, sports teams, youth organizations and all those things that business owners try to help support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936828"> The Liberals think that these costs are just magically absorbed by those farmers and small business owners, but they are not; of course, these costs are passed on to the consumer. That is why we see apples up 61%, carrots up 72%, and oranges and potatoes up 76%, just in time for Thanksgiving. The Liberals need to realize that when they increase the tax on the farmer, trucker, manufacturer and retailer, those costs are passed directly on to the consumer. Canadians are paying the price for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936829"> We are seeing that with millions of Canadians. Seven million Canadians went to a food bank last year. In Alberta, food bank use is up 70%. The food bank in Calgary is supporting 700 families every single day. These are numbers that I know the operators of food banks across the country have never seen before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936830">In conclusion, if the Liberals really cared about grocery prices and family farms, they could do something right now: They could eliminate their carbon taxes and certainly their plans to quadruple the carbon tax. That, not more red tape and bureaucracy, would make food more affordable for Canadians.</ParaText>

What they should do is say they will help get Europe to where we are, with precision agriculture, zero till and 4R nutrient stewardship. Those are the things Canadian farmers are doing, and Liberals had better start recognizing that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936851">We need to frame the situation that Canada is in right now as a time when the chickens have really come home to roost after years of economic policies of the Conservatives and the Liberals. They told us that our cities would be better off if we let the market and global capital decide the value of our neighbourhoods and gave up the security that we had with union jobs and defined pension plans, if we turned our nation over to the Morneau Shepells of the world to decide what kinds of benefits we should have after a lifetime of working. We see the results. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936852">When I go into stores in my region, people in their seventies, who used to be retired, are now working at places such as Tim Hortons, because they cannot afford to retire. I see the results when talking to men in my region who are 68 or 69 years old, who went back to work underground on the drills because they could not pay their housing costs. Working on the drills is hard for a young man, but 70-year-olds are going back underground because they cannot afford to pay these costs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936853">Another man I knew said he had to go back underground at 70 because he could not pay for his wife's medicine. We have a government that has talked about pharmacare since my hair was dark and long before that, and yet it still has not delivered. Of course, the Conservatives do not believe in pharmacare, just as they do not believe in the public programs that we and our parents built up over generations, which have been stripped away steadily under the belief in the free market, that we had free market in labour so that people were on precarious gig work. That was Bill Morneau. Members will remember when he told a young generation to get used to it; this would be their new normal. Of course, COVID blew all that away. Young people are saying that this is not going to be their normal, and they have started walking away from these jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936854">We see the situation where people cannot afford to buy their groceries because of the relentless price gouging of the likes of Galen Weston. We will never hear the Conservatives stand up to a CEO. For example, the other day, they were telling us that the price of potatoes in Calgary had gone up 70% because of the carbon tax. Calgary does not get its potatoes from P.E.I. It gets them from Idaho, which does not pay a carbon tax. In Idaho, the reason the price of potatoes went up is because of the climate crisis that is ongoing in the west. This is something the Conservatives will never admit, even in a year where we have lost 14 million hectares of forest lands and where over 200,000 people were forced to be evacuated in Canada, with billions in costs. That is what we get from the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936855">The Liberals talk about it, but emissions continue to go up. The Liberals say they are going to sit down and meet with the CEOs of the grocery chains; hopefully, they will do something. Nobody believes them. We need stronger commitments. I do not know how many announcements and reannouncements I have heard in eight years from the Liberals about their commitment to housing, yet I still do not see those houses being built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936856">We need to take this issue seriously because of the price gouging that has gone on, the market exploitation and the turning of our cities over to Airbnb, which allowed young people and working-class people to be forced out of the cities they love. In my region, the housing and homelessness issue is at a crisis level. We never saw Doug Ford offer to build any houses in Timmins. He was willing to sell off the greenbelt, but we could use those houses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936857">This is the situation we are in, so people are frustrated. They deserve a straight vision. They deserve a commitment. How would that commitment look? Certainly, in terms of housing, we know that the market-driven solutions have driven us into this crisis. We know that what worked before, until the 1990s, when Paul Martin walked away on it, was the federal investment with the provinces and municipalities to build housing. The best solution is co-operative public housing that has mixed-income housing. That is what we need. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936858">I need to be able to go back to my communities with a commitment that these houses are going to be built. There is not a quicker driver to build an economy than housing. We could do that today if there was will in this House to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936859">We need to get serious with the CEOs. We have talked about a windfall tax, but we need to actually make them deliver, or we have to start talking about issues like price controls. We know that people are being gouged, and we are in a situation where we cannot allow the oligopoly of grocery chains, because there is no competition, to call the shots, as they are doing. We need to limit their ability to continue to spread their powers as we see Shoppers Drug Mart moving more and more into health care. We simply cannot trust them. We need to protect the public health care system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936860">These are all the issues that are coming toward us at this time. I mentioned it quickly, but I want to actually really focus on how we are also in the middle of a climate catastrophe. We need to talk about the climate catastrophe. We have the leader of the Conservative Party, the member who lives in Stornoway, a 19-room mansion with his own personal chef, who would make burning fossil fuel free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936861">We are at an absolute crisis on our planet. We are also at a time when the International Energy Agency said, as of last week, that the end of big oil is imminent because of the incredible investments that have been made all around the world, but not in Canada, on clean energy. There is no place in the world that has more potential for clean energy right now than in the province of Alberta, yet Danielle Smith shut down $33 billion of clean energy projects and rented a truck to drive around Ottawa, telling us that the power is going out in Alberta.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936862">Most premiers spend money to attract investment or to say their province is an energy superpower. Is that not what Alberta said? They said they were a province that could build energy projects and get them off the ground. Instead, she is paying for the gas to go around saying they cannot keep the power on in Alberta. That is the Conservative vision. They are wedded to big oil, an industry that has made billions in the last few years while we got gouged at the pumps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936863">We will never hear the Conservatives talk about the price gouging that we know is happening. When we go home on a Friday in northern Ontario, we know the price goes up right across the board on those long weekends at the same time; everybody knows it is price gouging, but the Conservatives say they will get rid of the carbon tax and make it free to burn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936864">I can ask anyone if they think big oil is not going to, if that tax came up, just hoover that up and put it into the profits of people like Rich Kruger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936865">We are at a time when Canadians are looking to Parliament to actually deliver. In the last election I went door to door talking to people about their concerns. I heard, again and again, that people could not afford to get their teeth fixed. People said they do not trust politicians anymore. They asked how they could get their kids' teeth fixed. I said that if they elected us, we would go back and get a national dental care plan. We are going to get that plan. The Conservatives announced they would spend all summer going around to try to stop that budget implementation, but we are going to get dental care for seniors and children this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936866">The other commitment we made, and I am putting the Liberals on notice, is that we made that commitment to pharmacare. We have two more years in this Parliament. If we do not see pharmacare, it is going to be pretty hard to go back and say that we hung out with the son of PIerre Elliott for two or three years. People ask why we are hanging out with that guy. We are hanging out here on this side to get something done. That is pharmacare and dental care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936867">If we go back to the Canadian people and say we did that, it shows them how Parliament can work and that we can work across party lines. We intend to make sure we can go back to the Canadian people who said that in a time of crisis, New Democrats were there on the issues that mattered to people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936868">We will stand up and fight for people who cannot afford to pay CEBA back, when the government only gives them an extra 18 days. We will fight for small businesses. We will fight for a cleaner climate. We will fight for the indigenous communities that continue to be ignored. We will fight for pharmacare, and we will fight for dental care. That is why we were elected and that is why we are here today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936904">It is a pleasure to rise once again to speak to my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, the financial protection for fresh fruit and vegetable farmers act. I am encouraged by the support this common-sense Conservative bill has had so far, but we need to keep pushing. It is all the more important as we look to address the high food prices, rising inflation and strained supply chains we see in Canada today. I will take the opportunity this evening to reiterate the urgent need for the financial protection of this bill and the benefits it will bring, and will address some of the questions raised at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936905">We all know we need a doctor maybe once a year and need a firefighter once in a lifetime if we are really unlucky, but we need a farmer three times a day, every day. That is a fact. Despite their importance in supplying local communities with safe and nutritious fruits and vegetables, there is not enough financial protection for Canadian fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers. In circumstances where buyers become insolvent and fail to pay for fresh fruits or vegetables they were supplied, farmers are out of pocket for those losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936906">To address this, Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> proposes to establish a limited deemed trust that would provide much needed financial protection for the entire fresh fruit and vegetable sector in Canada. This bill would give fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers priority access to the proceeds of sale, limited to the inventory, accounts receivable and cash on hand derived from the sale of the produce, during the bankruptcy proceedings of an insolvent buyer. This will help offset the loss of their sold produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936907">For too long, the existing provisions within the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and adjacent legislation have not provided adequate priority for fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers when insolvencies occur, as these provisions do not take into consideration the unique characteristics of the sector. While the act technically allows suppliers to recover their products following a bankruptcy, it provides no rights when the product has been resold, is no longer identifiable or is no longer in the same state, which is to be expected with most fresh fruits and vegetables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936908">Fresh fruits and vegetables are subject to rapid perishability. Their shelf life can be sometimes measured in mere hours. By the time insolvency proceedings have concluded, the spoiled product is no longer of any value and cannot be repossessed or resold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936909">The superpriority provision for farmers in the act does not address the needs of fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers, who regularly receive payments 30 days or more after they have delivered the product. These longer payment terms are typical in the industry. They accommodate the rapid pace of trade and complex storage and transportation arrangements that must be made between many parties to get fruits and vegetables to market over the course of a short growing season. As such, the requirement in the BIA that fruits and vegetables must have been delivered within 15 days of bankruptcy to be covered under the superpriority means that most fresh produce becomes unprotected. This lack of financial protection for Canada's fresh fruit and vegetable sector has had devastating consequences, as farmers and other suppliers find themselves as unsecured creditors with little recourse for their losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936910">It is well established that bankruptcies are considerably higher in this sector than in any other agriculture sector across Canada. They occur twice as often as those in livestock and are over 10 times the rates of the poultry and grain sectors, which are heavily regulated in Canada. The average net loss from non-payments, partial payments and delayed payments in the Canadian fruit and vegetable trade amounts to at least 1.53% of a supplier's gross revenue. This is a significant amount for those in the fresh produce sector considering their high overhead and capital costs, small profit margins and reduced risk management capability. While this amount is significant, it does not even capture the full extent of non-payment. Many firms simply close their doors and walk away from their businesses. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936911">These losses are routinely absorbed by farmers, but they are not captured in bankruptcy data. These losses are especially devastating considering that three quarters of Canada’s fresh fruit and vegetable producers are small businesses with sales of less than $85,000 per year, many of which rely on a single buyer for the bulk of their crop. These smaller-scale producers do not have the capability to make credit checks on their buyers, negotiate conditional sales agreements or take other safeguards typical in other industries. Their ability to pursue repayment and other forms of recourse when a buyer does not pay is also extremely limited. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936912">As one can imagine, bankruptcies within the fresh fruit and vegetable industry can jeopardize farms and livelihoods, and the constant fear of non-payment limits our farmers’ ability to invest in their businesses, grow and actually plan for the future. The bankruptcy of Lakeside Produce in Leamington, Ontario, this past winter demonstrated just how wide-ranging the impact that bankruptcy has had on the entire fresh produce industry. When it went bankrupt, Lakeside Produce owed $188 million to suppliers across the fruit and vegetable sector. There were 17 Canadian produce companies among Lakeside’s creditors, which accounted for $1.7 million in unsecured claims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936913">The lack of financial protection for the fresh produce industry in Canada also impacts our competitiveness and capacity to trade with the United States. Suppliers are no longer able to access the dispute resolution and financial protection processes that exist in the U.S. through the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, without incurring significant financial costs. This severely disadvantages Canadian produce businesses given the high volume of produce sold to buyers in the U.S. Having a financial protection tool in place in Canada would pave the way for the United States Department of Agriculture to restore Canadian produce sellers’ preferential access to the U.S. dispute resolution mechanism for fresh fruits and vegetables. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936914">With the adoption of Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, we could finally ensure that Canada’s bankruptcy laws work for fresh fruit and vegetable suppliers in a form that recognizes the particular needs and challenges of the industry. By doing so, there would be considerable benefits for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936915">The financial protection would strengthen a pivotal industry in Canada, increase economic activity and bring economic benefit to the entire fresh fruit and vegetable value chain. With greater certainty and reduced risk, we would see more investment and growth as Canadian farms and greenhouses expand their operations and return operations to Canada that had migrated to the United States when access to PACA was lost. These measures would also result in a reduction in prices for Canadian consumers, which I know is top of mind for all MPs in this House tonight. We would expect to see a decrease in prices for Canadians by as much as 15%, which would save families as much as $900 million on their annual purchases of fresh fruit and vegetables. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936916">While this bill was being studied at committee, there were questions about why the bill would extend the deemed trust protections to all suppliers of perishable fruits and vegetables, which is perhaps considered by some to be too broad. However, it is important to remember that within the fresh fruit and vegetable industry, the large retail trade, farmers’ markets, food service and hospitality trades are far less affected by the lack of financial protection. For the most part, it is the growers and others involved in the first sale, such as packers, brokers and shippers, who are most vulnerable to payment disruption and who would need the financial protection afforded by Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> the most. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936917">That said, this industry is highly integrated, and bankruptcies involving producers, dealers, shippers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers impact the stability of the market. A bankruptcy at any point along the supply chain can result in farmers going unpaid, so it is essential that all suppliers receive the necessary protection. Crucially, protecting fresh produce suppliers equally is needed to access the equivalent protection offered by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act in the United States, which covers all suppliers along the chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936918">Another question raised has been the impact of these financial protections on the banking industry. While it is true that by giving priority access to produce suppliers, banks will see their claims receive a lower priority, the benefits of protecting fresh fruit and produce suppliers outweigh the distributional impacts for the banking industry. Moreover, the banking industry would actually benefit from the increased predictability of payments when lending to those in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector. This has been the case in the United States under the PACA deemed trust, which has been reported to be a net positive to the banks, in addition to the produce sector itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936919">Canada relies on boots on the ground, hands in the muck and rubber boots on the farm to provide fresh locally grown produce to our citizens. When these farmers suffer losses due to buyer insolvency, it threatens our very food security by reducing the availability of Canadian grown products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936920">We already know this is happening. Earlier this year, a Statistics Canada report showed that there was a significant decline in fresh fruit and vegetable availability for Canadians in 2022. More than three-quarters of all produce consumed in Canada is imported. As access to fresh produce from foreign markets is increasingly jeopardized by climate change, carbon taxes, trade protections and supply chain issues, our food security becomes more and more threatened right here at home. For much of our nation's history, Canada was far more self-reliant in the fresh fruit and vegetable trade, with production far outpacing consumption, but the failure to reduce risk and provide certainty to the fresh fruit and vegetable sector has seen this decline significantly. This needs to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936921">Fundamentally, Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> recognizes the need to support Canada's produce sector, just as we support other agriculture sectors, by ensuring that Canada's bankruptcy laws recognize the particular challenges and demands of growing and selling fresh fruits and vegetables. Canada's fresh fruit and vegetable farmers should always be paid for the fresh fruits and vegetables they sell. By passing Bill C-280, we can ensure that our food security is protected and that our produce sector is strengthened. By putting this important financial protection tool in place for produce supplies, we will support the economy and lower costs for all Canadians from coast to coast to coast, so let us get it done.</ParaText>

He came to me saying, “Scot, I don't think I'm going to plant my field this year because I'm worried about getting paid.” He said, “Look, Scott, I'm not asking for any handout from the government. I'm just looking to get paid for the produce I sell.” </ParaText>

That is precisely why we are here this evening. We are debating Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C‑280</Document>, a very important bill for our farmers, especially for fruit and vegetable growers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936937">I believe that our agriculture and agri-food sector was very important to all Canadians before the pandemic, but it has become even more important since the pandemic. We think it is important to reinforce the supply chain, and bring in new investments and initiatives for our producers. Bill C‑280 is certainly the type of initiative that can ensure their success.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936938">Before I go too much further, I would like to thank and congratulate the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> for helping to shepherd this bill through the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936939">As I had the privilege of reporting this bill back before it came to third reading in debate, I know this is a bill that is supported unanimously in the House. This is an initiative that came back from the agriculture committee with no amendments and was widely supported. I would like to not only, of course, recognize the member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation>, but also recognize that there are many members of the House, in fact, all of us, who believe in this initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936940">I would be remiss without talking about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278491" Type="2">Glengarry—Prescott—Russell</Affiliation>, the parliamentary secretary to agriculture, who has been on the record for supporting these types of initiatives. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278712" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> in British Columbia has also been a strong champion. Any time we had a report where he could reasonably try to find a way to get “deemed trust”, which were the words that we were using, he would make sure they were included in the report. I would say that all sides of the House see the initiative. I send my congratulations to the member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> for bringing it forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936941">For those Canadians who are at home, perhaps watching and asking what Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> is, and wondering what these guys and gals are talking about in Parliament, this is about creating a priority under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to allow farmers who are shipping product to buyers who become insolvent to have a superpriority to be able to claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936942">I think back to my days at Dalhousie law school when we start talking about priority under provincial legislation. It is when one lines up and tries to reclaim some of what one is owed from the particular buyer or creditor who is required to be paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936943">It is very difficult, when one is talking about a perishable product, for that product to actually be claimed. It is not like it is a sack of potatoes, although even potatoes are perishable, but this is not something like grain, something that can be recovered and come back to the supplier to be resold or recaptured for the economic value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936944">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> talked about the fact that not only could a perishable product be perishable, it could also be transformed into a different type of product. One thinks about fresh strawberries that are then sliced and put into different fruit salads and things of that nature. It is impossible for our farmers who are selling that product to actually be able to, under the existing legislation, recoup the economic value associated with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936945">This is a type of legislation that has no cost. This is not going to cost the Government of Canada one single cent. This is about creating legislative change that prioritizes and empowers farmers to be able to support themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936946">I want to give members an example. The member opposite, of course, talks about the salad bowl of Canada. I do not know if we have the same connotation in the Annapolis Valley, but let me tell members, between our apple producers and our horticulture producers, I am very proud of the Annapolis Valley in Kings—Hants as a growing region.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936947">I have had the opportunity to talk to the farmers about what this type of deemed trust legislation would mean. I will give an example. Andy Vermeulen, a farmer from Canning, Nova Scotia, sells a variety of vegetables. He would normally look to Atlantic Canada, or maybe Ontario or Quebec, but he also ships to New England.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7936948"> The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> talked about the fact that there is no alignment right now between the dispute resolution that is available to the American producers and the Canadian producers who are selling into that market because we do not have an equivalent type of legislation. That is being proposed here in Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936949">This would allow our farmers to have the same access to those tools, such that if Andy Vermeulen sends his product to Boston, he would have some recourse if the seller went bankrupt or does not pay. It would give further teeth to our farmers to be able to re-collect the money that is owed to them.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936950">With the cost of living and higher costs, including for fuel, fertilizer and materials, it is very important to find a way to help our farmers financially.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="7936951">This is something that can ensure we have some financial protection. It does not come with a large cost. In fact, there is no cost to the treasury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936952">I think this is going to be something that is supported by farmers across the country. I will give the example from Nova Scotia. I am sure for my colleagues from Quebec, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, and everywhere in between, this makes sense. That is exactly why we can see that every member of the House is supporting it here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936953">The last thing I want to say is that I think there are more opportunities for this type of thinking. Those of us at the agriculture committee often hear that people would like to see not necessarily new program spending, although those programs are great. I will get to that in a moment about some of the things that I am very proud of that this government has introduced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936954">Sometimes it is these little legislative tweaks, or a regulatory change here or there, that really empower farmers and our agricultural community to continue to do the amazing work they have been doing. The member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> talked about the hardened hands of the men and women who do really important work, and the fact that we need farmers three times a day. I think those are extremely powerful words, which I would second.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936955">We should all be thinking about little measures that we can do, especially in the environment right now. The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has signalled this. The <Affiliation DbId="300030" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> has talked about program review and government being very smart and wise about how it spends money. I am fully on board with that, but let me also say that there is a lot that can be done on the non-cost side that could make a huge difference. We, all parliamentarians, should be looking at what we can do to build upon Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> to do even more in the days ahead. It is something that I look forward to exploring with my colleagues at the agriculture committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936956">One such idea is the opportunity for an expedited pathway for regulatory approvals around seeds, feeds and crop protection products. I have talked about this at great length, but I will continue to go on the record. I will have, hopefully, even something more to say in a couple of days with this piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936957">There is tremendous opportunity when we look at the applicants who come to either Health Canada, PMRA or the CFIA with existing approvals from what I would call trusted jurisdictions: the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. We know that, if a process was undertaken in one of these jurisdictions, it was science-based and credible. The likelihood of it being approved in Canada is extremely high. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936958">We have to create a model so that, if an applicant arrives at Health Canada in this country and wants to give those tools to our farmers, we can tighten the timelines between when that application is made and when the product can be registered on the basis of using some of the strengths of science in jurisdictions elsewhere. It is a really straightforward policy, and I think it would make a lot of sense. Again, it is another initiative that does not cost money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936959">I am proud of what this government has done on the agricultural side. I could go into it at great length, but I am proud of what we are all doing as parliamentarians here tonight to advance the interests of Canadian farmers. This bill, of course, has had Liberal support. We look forward to seeing this off to the Senate and hopefully get it into farmers' hands and available as soon as possible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7936960">Madam Speaker, I feel like starting my speech in a different way. I just heard that the Liberal government is supporting this bill. Everyone is pleased to be pleased, and everything is perfect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936961">However, we asked if it would be possible to seek unanimous consent to send the bill directly to the Senate. That way, it could move forward and produce growers could finally get some protection when they are not paid for their produce. It seems that some members withheld their consent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936962">There may be agreement, but some among us plan to take their time. I have a bit of a problem with that, because the request is clear and dates back to 2015. Furthermore, the Liberal government made very definite and public commitments in this file. I mentioned 2015, but the requests started in 2014. During the 2015 elections, the Liberal Prime Minister agreed to fix the problem. Now it is 2023. How is that for efficiency? We will not get far at that rate. For now, people are pleased to be pleased. They support the bill, and good for them, but I would like to see us move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936963">Now I will close that parenthesis and explain what this bill is about. This bill seeks to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act to put vendors of perishable products such as fruits and vegetables at the top of the list. When a perishable product is delivered to a purchaser, the value of the produce is deemed to be held in trust. Why is that necessary? It is necessary because producers of perishable products are in a vulnerable situation. We need to think of every scenario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936964">Not so long ago, we conducted a study at the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri‑Food on inflation at the grocery store. Grocery store CEOs came and swore to us that their profit margins were thin, just 2% or 3%, and that they were still the same. When we asked them to show us a breakdown of their profits, they refused, claiming that they are competitors. They promised to submit these figures to the Competition Bureau during its investigation. When we saw the Competition Bureau report, we discovered that they had not provided the figures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936965">When produce growers appeared before the committee, they told us they were seeing lettuce worth 99¢ being sold at a discounted price of $2.49, which means it normally costs more than that. I am talking about prices from March, and the situation is even worse today. The grower gets only 99¢, so I think the profit margins are over 2%. The profit margins are above 2% because it is a fresh product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936966">Negotiations are unbalanced. A purchaser can refuse the stock and say they will go and see another grower who has been negotiating for three or four days. If the grower's warehouse is full of fresh produce and they wait too long, their products will no longer be fresh and appealing. Consumers will not want them, and the grower will not be able to sell them. In that case, they will be forced to give in. This is just one example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936967">Government officials now agree, and that is good, but they told us for a long time that there were almost no bankruptcy filings and that the bill was therefore unnecessary. The truth is that there were no filings because there were no legal protections. Whenever it became clear that a customer was having trouble paying for merchandise or was on the verge of bankruptcy, arrangements could be made, similar to a kind of liquidation. Sometimes half the price, or even a quarter, would be accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936968">If an out-of-court settlement is not reached and the client goes bankrupt and the business owner does not have any protection, then the business owner would lose 100% of the production value. Business owners therefore end up agreeing in a panic to be paid 25% of the production value. These losses are not included in the statistics. Business owners seem as though they are happy to be paid, but they are receiving only one-quarter of the production value. That is why this is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936969">I have a hard time not getting upset about this, because I cannot understand why we have not yet passed such a measure. It would be easy to do, and we have been calling for this kind of measure since 2014. It is now 2023 and there is still no legislation. What is more, it is free. It will not cost the government a cent. What it will cost is to perhaps put fruit and vegetable producers first and bank creditors second. I think maybe that is why some members are hesitating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936970">There are a lot of discussions going on in the House, Madam Speaker. In fact, for the past little while, I have been speaking indirectly to the very people concerned in this matter. I would like them to listen to my speech.</ParaText>

Because the government is so slow at processing foreign worker applications and because governments failed to see the current labour shortage coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936976">I would like to say a thing or two about the labour shortage. I was a high school teacher. I was not an internationally renowned scientist. I was a high school geography teacher and, in the early 1990s, I taught my students that we would have a labour shortage now. Nobody did anything to avert that, and now people are stuck in this situation. They have no workers. Locals do not want to get their hands dirty, so people have to find other workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936977"> These folks are facing a labour shortage. They have to mechanize a lot of the production, and that means thousands if not millions in investments that generate debt. These people are heavily in debt. They called for help in spring and early summer, when torrential rains just about wiped out their harvest. Why did they call for help? They called for help because the crop insurance programs we have, the ones currently in place, the ones that the good old ministers refer us to whenever we ask them a question, do not work. Growers are not being adequately insured because the programs were designed 30 years ago in a more stable climate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936978">Yes, global warming exists. At the very least, I can tell the House that there is so much climate disruption that the last three years have been a disaster for produce growers. First, there was a drought. Then there were aphids. Why aphids? Because the hot season lasts much longer. The aphids moved further north. As they ran out of soybeans to eat, they moved on to fruits and vegetables. That happened last year. This year, there has been non-stop rain. We broke all-time records, particularly in the Eastern Townships, but just about everywhere in Quebec. It is all over the board. During the same period, there was a drought in Abitibi—Témiscamingue and northern Quebec as we tried to navigate our way through the smoke from the forest fires.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936979">All these things are real. As a society, we are going to have to sit down with these people and discuss how to share the risk factor. We cannot just keep asking growers to put $2 million, $3 million or $4 million into their fields in the spring and get nothing back but us thanking them for feeding us and telling them that if they run into issues, they will need to figure it out on their own. We cannot do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936980">I am digressing a bit from the subject of the bill to illustrate the fragility of this sector. I am a bit tired of hearing politicians talk about food sovereignty and how important it is to buy local. For 10 years now, we have been talking about this kind of simple, free measure that will not cost the government a thing, and yet it still has not been done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936981"> I wish there could have been unanimous consent to send the bill to the Senate this evening. I am angry and upset because people who are celebrating and congratulating the member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> on his outstanding leadership, who say they are so happy to be voting this way for farmers, did not give unanimous consent. That means we will have to spend who knows how much more time on this in the House before sending it to the Senate. We also have to hope that place will deal with this efficiently so it can come back here and be made law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936982"> Bills like this can be hard to implement. There are jurisdictional challenges that mean negotiations with other levels of government. That is important. We have to move quickly. Our fresh fruit and vegetable farmers are looking to us. They feed us now, but for how much longer? I think they are going to get sick of it and go find something else to do. Maybe grow field crops. Maybe sell their land. That is what we are up against. Let us pass this bill pronto.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7936983">Madam Speaker, I am extremely proud to be standing in the House on behalf of the fruit and vegetable farmers in my region of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. My region and the Cowichan region have a long and storied history in agriculture. I would like to remind all members that the Cowichan Valley is in fact Canada's only Mediterranean climatic zone. The Halkomelem language is the language of the Quw'utsun; the Cowichan name is the anglicized version of that, and it roughly translates into the “warm lands”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936984">We are an agricultural powerhouse in the Cowichan region. I have been proud to call that area my home for over 30 years, and I am proud to be standing in this House in support of Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>. This is a measure that has long been talked about in this very chamber, and we now have an opportunity to actually change the law. As many colleagues have pointed out, this is going to be of no cost but of huge benefit to the people it directly concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936985">I want to thank the people who have spoken before me: the sponsor, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation>; the member for <Affiliation DbId="278397" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>; and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278660" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>. I have the pleasure of serving with two of those colleagues on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. I have been the proud agricultural critic for the NDP since January 2018, so I know this subject very well. This is my third Parliament on the agriculture committee, and this subject has come up time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936986">I do not want to delve too much into the details. We know that this issue matters because of the nature of the product we are talking about. Fruits and vegetables only have a tiny bit of shelf life before they have no more value. This is a unique product, and that is why we need to have this kind of a deemed trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936987">It is not as though farmers, who are taking all the risk, can recoup losses by taking the product back; it is perishable in nature. We know that farmers deal with high costs. They have high input costs. It is expensive to buy machinery and erect greenhouses. In fact, almost all farmers' money is tied up in infrastructure, whether that is machinery or land. They are, in other words, land rich but cash poor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936988">This is a business model that is based on the tightest of margins, and anything the Parliament can do to ease up and make the payment process more guaranteed is something we should look at seriously. I am happy to say Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document> would do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936989">I would argue that, instead of this being just a Conservative bill, this bill is expressly non-partisan. I know the NDP has been fighting for this, as part of our electoral promise to Canadians, since 2015. Moreover, it is non-partisan by virtue of the fact that the second reading of this bill was unanimous. It sailed through committee. We had three meetings; we heard from a variety of witnesses. However, we decided as a committee to report this bill back to the House without amendments. It has the committee's stamp of approval, and I hope members in this chamber take note of that and seek to give it rapid passage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936990">This bill has been the subject of many committee studies. I have almost lost count of how many times, at different committees and different parliaments, we have seen a recommendation for this type of measure to be enacted by the House of Commons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936991">The time is now. I would like to see this bill pass through third reading, get to the Senate and start getting the traction it needs. The Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada, the Canadian Produce Marketing Association and the thousands of people they represent are watching us. They are waiting for action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936992">I will conclude my remarks by proudly saying that I will be supporting this bill, along with the NDP caucus. We look forward to its speedy passage to the other place; hopefully, it will eventually find its way to the Governor General's desk and receive the royal assent it deserves.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7936993">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278555" Type="2">York—Simcoe</Affiliation> for putting Bill <Document DbId="11818690" Type="4">C-280</Document>, the financial protection for fresh fruit and vegetable farmers act, forward. It is a very important bill, and it has been a long time coming. I was elected nearly four years ago and we have been talking about this through the last two Parliaments, and I know it was talked about long before then. It is great to see all parties come together to support something that will help our Canadian produce growers, packers and shippers immensely.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936994">During a Zoom call with The Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada, I heard that 52% of perishable product sales to U.S. customers from Canadian suppliers await payment from the United States. California producers and suppliers have a similar problem with their Canadian customers. On October 1, 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture revoked preferred treatment for Canadian shippers under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. This was taken in retaliation for an action on the part of Canada with regard to establishing some type of trust protection from bankruptcy for all fresh produce shipped into the U.S. Under that status, Canadian companies did not have to post surety bonds when trying to collect payments from delinquent buyers. No other nation had such status.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936995">Without the special status, a Canadian shipper must now post a bond for twice the amount they are seeking to collect. Taking action to recover $100,000 would require the purchase of a $200,000 bond. Current rules severely limit the ability of produce growers and sellers to collect payment in the event that their buyer declares bankruptcy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936996">While products like electronics can be reclaimed by the seller, highly perishable produce is lost because of the obvious. It spoils and rots very quickly, costing Canadian and U.S. firms that operate in Canada an average of $19 million per year, but there is a policy solution to this. In 1984, the United States Congress established “deemed trust” provisions through the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, also known as PACA, and that protected shippers in the event their buyer became insolvent. The PACA trust helps suppliers of perishable products ensure prompt payment by buyers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936997">The trust gives suppliers interest in a debtor's assets. Creating a reciprocal legal framework in Canada by federal statute for a PACA-like “deemed trust” would not draw on federal or provincial public treasuries but would offer Canadian producers and suppliers the means to collect on accounts payable from U.S. customers and give U.S. producers and suppliers the means to collect on accounts payable from Canadian customers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936998">My colleagues have gone into a lot of the details of this bill and I would like to take a bit of a different approach. I would like to give some personal perspective and a little history of my experience in the fresh produce sector to provide some personal context on how this legislation would benefit growers and shippers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7936999">I grew up on a produce farm. I am a third-generation farmer and my grandparents on both sides of my family were essentially pioneers in the produce industry in the area that I grew up in, which is my hometown of Grand Bend, Ontario. My dad's parents, my Oma and Opa, immigrated from Holland and were one of the first five families to start farming in what is called the Klondike marsh. My mom's parents immigrated to Canada from Poland via Germany and moved to Grand Bend after living in the Chatham area where they first started growing vegetables. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937000">They cleared their land and began farming in the Grand Bend bog, which used to be a shallow lake that was drained to become rich farmland. They grew potatoes, onions, carrots, lettuce and onion sets over the years. Eventually, my dad's parents retired and the family farm that my grandparents started, which now involved two families, took over growing some of the vegetables that my Oma and Opa used to grow. Farmers are innovators, and I would like to give one example from personal experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937001">When I was growing up, it would be time to harvest our potatoes and my dad would go out to the field and hand-dig potatoes to see what stage of growth they were at. There are many things that farmers can automate, but this is not one that can be automated. This is still done by farmers putting their hands in the dirt and digging those little nuggets out of the ground by hand. When my dad would do test digs, he would bring all these little potato nuggets home, and we would never waste them. We would cook them up and eat them for supper. I can tell everyone that those were the most absolutely delicious potatoes. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7937002">To provide some context, back in the 1980s when I grew up, the CFIA regulations stipulated that undersized potatoes could not be packaged, and so all of those small undersized potatoes that we harvested would either be discarded for cattle feed or put in a compost pile. There was an enormous amount of perfectly good eating potatoes that became food waste because of packaging regulations. There came a point where my mom thought, “Well, jeez, we're always throwing these undersized potatoes out and they're the most delicious thing ever. Why are we doing this when they taste so good?” These little mini nuggets were so delicious that we wanted to share them with everybody else. Our farm made an application to the CFIA asking that we be able to bag these mini potatoes and sell them. So, the mini gourmet potato bag was born, and our family farm became the first farm in Canada to bring mini potatoes to market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937003">Now, members are probably wondering why the short history lesson on my family farm. Well, I wanted to provide context from the unique perspective that I hold as the only parliamentarian who is still involved in the fresh produce industry and produce farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937004">Before my parents retired from farming, their farm was growing over 1,000 acres of potatoes in southwestern Ontario for grocery retailers. To meet grocery store expectations, we also relied on local smaller farms as well as smaller farms from across Canada in different provinces to supply us with Canadian product in our season. If we could not supply the grocery stores with the product they wanted when they wanted it, then they would not even consider us as a farm to be a supplier. However, the grocery stores had to supply year-round, and so we had to grow potatoes around North America in order to keep the supply going to supply grocery stores. We had farms contracted to custom grow for us in California, Florida, Idaho, North Carolina and Michigan. Our packing facility in Grand Bend used to process anywhere from 5,000 to 6,000 acres through it per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937005">Members can imagine the coordination that it would take to keep everything going when we have farms across North America supplying us. There would be a constant flow of trucks coming back and forth from all over the United States into Canada and from Canada into the States. The potatoes would be coming for us to process and package in our plant so that we could then give Canadians fresh potatoes on the grocery store shelves. We had to do this year round. With bringing upwards of 4,000 acres of fresh potatoes across the border to Canada from the United States every year, members can imagine the dollar value that would be for that product. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937006">However, not only did we pack potatoes from the U.S., we also exported our excess crop during harvest season to the United States. The growing season in the United States is different from Canada's growing season in many parts. Being neighbours, we rely on each other to ensure a fresh food supply year-round. Canadians grow an abundance of fresh, perishable food, far greater than what we consume, and we are blessed to live in a country to be able to do so, but with that comes a huge amount of risk. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937007">In this industry, it is standard practice to be paid 30 to 45 days from the time a product is received. As members can imagine, the shelf life of fresh produce is far less than the payment terms that sellers are working with. The intricacies of our supply chain for fresh food are far greater than anyone could ever imagine. When farmers are exporting millions of dollars in perishable food from the United States without a reciprocal agreement to ensure that they have a mechanism to be paid in the event of a dispute or a bankruptcy, it becomes a risky business. One bad deal or one dispute could literally bankrupt a family farm, especially since most companies could not afford to put up a bond worth double what they are disputing. Produce farmers work on such tight margins that one sale of a quarter of a million dollars or a half million dollars could be three to five tractor-trailer loads of goods to one customer in the States, which they might not get paid for. This could bankrupt a smaller farmer. While this might sound extreme, I have seen this happen to a young farmer first-hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937008"> In Canada, when there is a dispute between growers and sellers in this country, we have a mechanism to resolve those disputes, but without the deemed trust, we have no mechanism to resolve disputes between growers and sellers in the United States and Canada that is affordable for growers to access. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937009">I am very passionate about this industry, because it has literally been my family's bread and butter my entire life. I have friends across the industry who would welcome this important change, because it would help protect the livelihoods of families, their farms and their businesses. Creating this deemed trust and having that reciprocal agreement with the U.S. would protect farms from having to bear those losses in the event of a dispute. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937010">This will save family farms. I will always fight for Canadian farmers, their livelihoods and their legacies. At a time when food security and food sovereignty are top of mind, this is needed to protect this industry in Canada, and that is why I support this bill on behalf of my constituents and consumers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937026">Madam Speaker, Canadians have seen a very tumultuous year when they look at the cornerstone of our democratic system, Canada's Parliament. I found myself going back over the questions that I had put to the government that needed more exposition, further review and another opportunity for the government to answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937027">I was speaking with two great members of our team: Leah Young and Jordan Johnston. They do a great job. They are great Canadians. We were a little disappointed when we looked at the series of issues that Canadians had to witness in the news on a daily basis with respect to foreign interference and with respect to a failure to act by the government to address the real and present threats that our country has faced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937028">The question of the Trudeau Foundation and the foreign influence operation that targeted the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> through the foundation that bears his family's name is incredibly concerning. It gave rise, of course, to calls and demonstrated the necessity for Canada to have a foreign agent registry. This is a tool that is used by our allies and it is very effective, but there is no tool like it in Canada's tool box right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937029">What happened in this particular case? We saw cut-outs acting on behalf of the dictatorship in Beijing give $140,000 to the Trudeau Foundation in an attempt to influence or gain influence with Canada's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This is obviously incredibly concerning. What we saw in that same time period were two occasions where these individuals acting on behalf of the dictatorship in Beijing did get access to the Prime Minister, raising a question for Canadians: Is that the price it is going to cost foreign regimes to get access to our head of government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937030">The individuals pulled in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s brother. It was the first time in his involvement with that foundation that he was directly linked to donor activity like this, taking in this large six-figure donation. The question about whether or not the influence was effective and whether or not this operation by a foreign government was effective is what undermines Canadians' confidence and creates concern about the health of our democratic institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937031">Therefore, Canadians want to know this from the government, and I am looking to the parliamentary secretary for a response: On what date can Canadians expect to see the foreign agent registry, which is one of the critical tools necessary to help restore Canadians' confidence in our democratic institutions?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937032">Madam Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity today to, for the sake of accuracy, remind the House of a few things in response to the hon. member's question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937033">First, I want to point out that the agreement for the donation in question, to the Trudeau Foundation, which he raises, was made in 2014, prior to the 2015 election. Let us remember that at that time, the Liberals were the third party in standing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937034">Second, I will remind my hon. colleague of Mr. Alexandre Trudeau's testimony at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics on May 3 of this year, in which he stated:</ParaText>

That is why combatting potential threats to our democratic systems has been at the heart of our government's priorities, and we have maintained a clear and ongoing commitment to protecting Canadians democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937038">We are aware that threat actors have sought to erode trust in our democratic institutions and stoke tensions about government policies and decisions by targeting politicians, political parties and media outlets. Threat actors do this to influence public opinion and ultimately advance their interests, and that is why our security and intelligence agencies continue to support an integrated government response to those threats. Every day, Canada's security agencies, including the RCMP, undertake the work Canadians expect of them in order to ensure continued protection of Canadians and our democracy. Attempts to interfere in Canada's domestic affairs should not and will not be tolerated. We will continue to protect our sovereignty and our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937039">On September 7, 2023, the government announced a public inquiry into foreign interference in the federal electoral processes and democratic institutions. This announcement followed extensive consultations and agreements with all political parties represented in the House of Commons. The hon. Justice Marie-Josée Hogue was given a mandate to examine and address foreign interference by China, Russia and other foreign state actors or non-state actors, including any potential impacts on the 2019 and 2021 federal elections. Justice Hogue is also mandated to assess the capacity of federal entities to detect, deter and counter foreign interference targeting Canada's democratic processes, and to make any recommendations she deems appropriate to better protect Canada's democratic processes from foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937040">I would like to note that the government has, in addition, announced that it supports, as the member has raised, moving forward with a foreign agent registry.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7937046">Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise virtually this evening to pursue a question I initially asked on May 8, 2023. That question related to electoral reform, and specifically, I was picking up on the fact that, just in the previous weekend, at the Liberal Party policy convention, the Liberals had adopted a resolution very close to a motion that had been put forward by my Green colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278717" Type="2">Kitchener Centre</Affiliation>. Now the NDP has put forward another motion that is very similar, from the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278788" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation>, calling for a citizens' assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937047">The Liberal Party gathered in Ottawa and voted for holding a citizens' assembly to investigate electoral reform. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s initial response to the media was that there was “no consensus”, in his language, to pursue a citizens' assembly on electoral reform. When the hon. <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Democratic Institutions</Affiliation>, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="278102" Type="2">Beauséjour</Affiliation>, responded to me on that day back in May, he reiterated this notion that there was no consensus for a citizens' assembly, so let us just frame tonight's debate around this central point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937048">I do want to stop and thank the grassroots campaigners, who are non-partisan citizen activists of Fair Vote Canada, for pursuing this matter and demonstrating that the majority of Canadians want to see a citizens' assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937049">To say there is no consensus around getting rid of first past the post, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says, I think is debatable, but it is a move to a different voting system. To say there is no consensus and that therefore we will not pursue a method to find consensus is absurd. A citizens' assembly, a non-partisan citizens' assembly, on electoral reform is for the very purpose of finding consensus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937050">Bringing Canadians together who are chosen randomly, citizens' assemblies are a really fascinating tool in democracies. Canada has used them on this topic but only at the provincial level. There is great support for moving to a citizens' assembly on electoral reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937051">By the way, eight times since 1921, this House or various law commissions have studied first past the post, and in every instance since 1921 no body, as in a group of people, a House of Commons committee and so on, has ever found that first past the post is an appropriate system for Canada. That is because ever since the early 1920s, we have not been a two-party system. We have had three, four and, now in this House, five parties. Therefore, in an electoral system with a first-past-the-post system, inevitably and invariably the vote is distorted between the popular vote and the seat count.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937052">Especially, as I said, since 1921, every authority that has studied the matter has said that first past the post does not work for Canada. However, to find the new system, to develop consensus, a citizens' assembly is an excellent tool. I found it bizarre to be told in question period that we did not have consensus on the tool to find consensus. I note parenthetically that it appears to me the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will not think there is consensus on anything until everyone agrees with him, and that is not a tool for consensus. We absolutely must have fair voting so that Canadians have confidence that the way they cast their vote has an impact on the result.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937053">Madam Speaker, I know that my hon. colleague is incredibly passionate about this topic, and I enjoy listening to her. I take her feedback very seriously. I also wish her well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937054">We are committed to strengthening Canada's democratic institutions. Our electoral system, along with the fundamental rules that determine how votes are translated into seats in the House of Commons, is one of the most foundational pieces of our democracy. Among many things, it provides Canadians with a direct connection to their members of Parliament, who must work with each other to develop national policy and make political decisions, while engaging with and remaining accountable to their constituents in an increasingly digital and connected Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937055">Our current first-past-the-post system is not perfect, as the member acknowledges. She raises crucial points. However, no system is perfect. Ours has served Canada well for over 150 years, and it continues to advance the democratic values that Canadians want reflected in their system of government. This includes strong local representation, stability and accountability. How Canadians vote and how we govern ourselves are fundamentally important points that impact us all. Given that, the government's view has been very clear: Any major reforms to the electoral system should not be made without the broad support of Canadians. We consulted very broadly with Canadians, and a clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, did not emerge. Therefore, the government decided not to proceed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937056"> However, the government has continued to work to improve Canada's federal electoral process. Notably, in 2018, the government introduced the Elections Modernization Act, which represented a significant reform of the Canada Elections Act. Parliament passed this important legislation, which modernized the electoral process, making it easier for Canadians to participate in elections and further bolstering Canadians' trust and confidence in Canada's world-class and independently administered electoral system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937057">For example, these changes made the federal electoral process more accessible by reducing barriers for persons with all types of disabilities, Canadians living abroad and Canadian Armed Forces members, so they can vote and participate more fully in the electoral process. It has also made it easier for Canadians to vote by giving the chief electoral officer additional flexibility to run elections more efficiently, thereby reducing wait times, and to extend the hours for advanced polls and use mobile polls to better serve remote and isolated communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937058">I would also note that the supply and confidence agreement established in March 2022 between the <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader of the NDP</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> included several commitments aimed at maintaining the health of Canada's democracy and removing potential barriers to voting and participation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937059">We will continue to work with Elections Canada to explore ways to expand people's ability to vote, including by improving the mail-in ballot process. These are just some of the important issues that the government is focused on to deliver for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937060">Madam Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary claimed that first past the post has served Canada well. I had the honour to serve on the all-party select committee that studied the matter of electoral reform, and we heard from many experts that first past the post has not served Canada well. These experts included a former chief electoral officer, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, and a professor emeritus from the University of Toronto, Peter Russell. First past the post distorts results and leaves frustrated, unhappy voters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937061">When the parliamentary secretary says that they are committed to strengthening democracy, I would urge her to reflect on how that contributes to public cynicism and hurts Canada's democracy. When the Liberals leapt from third place to win a majority in 2015, it was largely because they promised 2015 would be the last election under first past the post. I note they have resurrected the 2015 election promise to get rid of GST on rentals. It is time to bring back the promise to fix our voting system.</ParaText>

Those meetings were very difficult, as everybody has very different opinions and is passionate about what is the best electoral process for Canada.

              <ParaText id="7937065">Madam Speaker, on June 9, 2023, I asked the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship if Canada was operating an apartheid era visa process in our high commission in South Africa. Canadians are proud of our country's role in contributing to the end of apartheid, and I think they would be shocked to know there are high commission staff who are perpetuating the racial injustices of apartheid in our name. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937066">Canada's immigration system has been facing challenges in recent years and has been overwhelmed with visa applicants experiencing really long processing times. While there has been improvement in some countries, it seems it has worsened in South Africa. My office has been inundated with calls from family and friends of South Africans who have faced visa wait times well beyond what applicants elsewhere face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937067">In India, a very busy mission, Canadian officials can turnaround a visa request in a month. In the Philippines, it is done in only 29 days. However, the current processing time for a visitor visa in South Africa now stands at 115 days, or nearly four months. There is something clearly wrong. Weddings and funerals are being missed. Children are fighting illnesses without their parents. This is unacceptable to me and the diverse constituents I represent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937068">There are also real economic consequences, as visa delays and denials impact work and study permits. Canadian employers are losing critically needed South African talent. A health authority with a long backlog for surgeries lost a new surgeon it had vetted and wanted to hire and is being forced to transfer patients for treatment to the United States. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937069">Immigration insiders have referred to this as Canada's Africa problem. Indeed, accusations of systemic racism have been levied at various visa posts around the world, including in Pretoria. Sadly, systemic racism among Canadian institutions is real, and IRCC is not immune to this often invisible disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937070">In May 2022, the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration released a parliamentary report that revealed “systemic racism” within IRCC that actually resulted in discriminatory results against people of colour. That is unacceptable. Immigration, like everything else, should be merit-based. It should not matter what the colour of one's skin is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937071">Canadian media has widely reported on visa issues vis-à-vis South Africa, and the Government of Canada has undertaken anti-racism training, which is great. However, we do not know the impact of the new training. One inconvenient truth is that some Canadian missions will delegate visa decision-making to locally engaged staff at non-priority visa posts. In the case of South Africa, I was told Canada relies predominantly on white local staff to accept or refuse applications from predominantly Black and Indian South Africans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937072">On September 12, 2023, on my own personal expense, I met with Chris Cooter, Canada's high commissioner, in Pretoria, South Africa, to ascertain the reason for abnormally high visa refusal rates among Black and Indian South Africans. Unbelievably, the high commissioner informed me that he was not aware of racism issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937073">Understandably, I was disappointed by his response. Indeed, why would there be global anti-racism training, including in South Africa, if such training was not needed? Why would a parliamentary report talk about systemic racism within IRCC if it did not exist?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937074">The Canadian government must get to the bottom of this. Canada stood up for Africa during the dark days of apartheid, and as a son of refugees, I feel a duty to ensure that future generations of new Canadians receive the same warmth, compassion and equity that my family did. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937078">Following the hon. member's question in June, we investigated the selection practices within the South African High Commission and determined that discrimination and racism should not be taking place as the filtering of visa applications by race does not occur. IRCC neither requests nor collects information on the race of applicants. These protocols were established to ensure maximum oversight and minimal risk of systemic discrimination in all operations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937079"> Indeed, the team in Pretoria has approved nearly nine out of 10 temporary resident applications filed by South African nationals since 2018, with the exception of the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Approval rates in Pretoria are higher in 2023 across all temporary resident lines of business compared to 2019. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937080">We recognize that addressing systemic racism and discrimination, whether overt or covert, requires constant and ongoing vigilance. We have a moral obligation to address institutional racism and end discrimination across government. Though we continue to make progress on this front, there is more work to be done. IRCC hired the independent research firm Pollara in 2021 and 2023 to examine the department's anti-racism efforts and how we can do better to serve clients of all backgrounds. While the results from Pollara's latest study published in August show progress, there is still more we can do to prevent discrimination and promote equity and inclusion in our staffing and procedures worldwide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937081">We have also created action plans for each area of programming to help identify and eliminate racism in program and service delivery. We are currently analyzing disaggregated data on race and racism in our workforce collected through our surveys. We have created new impact assessment tools, bias identification methodologies, guidance and training to address racial disparities across our programs and procedures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937082"> We also announced in August the creation of an equity secretariat, with an ombudsman's office that will support safe and independent channels to report instances of racism and discrimination. This will be an accessible, neutral and respected resource for our employees worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937083"> Finally, all IRCC employees receive training on inclusion and diversity. Our staff in Pretoria completed not only this comprehensive training, but also training adapted to include a specific focus on their clientele in April. The migration program manager in Pretoria additionally participated in workshops in Canada in January that included training on anti-racism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937084"> As outlined, we are taking various steps to address systemic racism within IRCC and ensure that we are promoting diversity and inclusion in all our efforts. Though there is more work to be done, IRCC takes seriously our responsibility to our employees, clients and everyone we serve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7937086">In May of 2022, Canada was host to the world AIDS summit. There were African delegates invited to our country on Canadian government letterhead who could not get visas, which were immensely delayed or outright rejected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937087">In October of 2022, Toronto, my home city, was supposed to host the Gabon-Canada trade investment forum.

              <ParaText id="7937090">Madam Speaker, recent investigations of the Pretoria office determined that visa applications are not and cannot be filtered by race. Its diverse selection team has, in fact, been approving nearly nine in 10 temporary resident applications filed by South African nationals since 2018, with the exception of the pandemic years of 2020-21. Approval rates are now higher across all temporary resident lines of business compared to 2019.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7937091">However, IRCC is constantly working to eliminate systemic discrimination and racism and promote equity in our staffing and procedures worldwide. It is doing this through independent research, training, a newly created equity secretariat and other measures. This work remains ongoing. We will continue to address systemic racism within our institutions and ensure transparency in our progress.</ParaText>
