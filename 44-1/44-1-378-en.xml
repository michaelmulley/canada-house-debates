              <ParaText id="8739071">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> sure is excited. He must not like what we have to say. Just last week, when the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of His Majesty's loyal opposition left, we gave him rousing applause because he did a great job. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a seal motion from his seat, as though implying we were all seals, although he talks about Conservatives being muzzled. Then we find out that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278597" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> was told there would be consequences if he did not fall in line. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739072">During question period yesterday, all we heard was why were those Conservatives being muzzled? We take pride in not being muzzled on this side of the House. We take pride in being able to ask questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739073"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> asks just about every single question when there are people behind him who are more than capable of asking them. On this side of the House, we believe that people should be unmuzzled. We are free to speak in our caucus. We are free to speak our mind. This is not something the Liberals can claim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739074"> The Liberals may say we are muzzled, yet that very day, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278597" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> said he could not vote for and serve his constituents as he wished because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanted to muzzle him. I believe the term used was shackles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739075">The Liberals do not like shackles. They hate mandatory minimums. They have allowed people to serve sentences of house arrest for violence, gun crimes like extortion with a firearm and drive-by shootings. People can serve those all now on house arrest because of the Liberal government. We know the Liberals do not like shackles, but the Liberal caucus is shackled in so many ways. There are encumbrances everywhere on the government benches. We cannot list how many encumbrances there are over there. Who gets to speak?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739076"> I spoke about the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, who has asked just about every single question in this debate. I think there have been maybe two people. There have probably been a thousand questions asked in this debate. For the Liberal side, I have seen that member ask probably 99% of them. The government has 158 MPs, yet only one member has asked most of the questions. It used to be two members. It used to be the member for Winnipeg North as well as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>. I guess the member for Kingston and the Islands has lost his mojo after that whole defamation thing. However, now the member for Winnipeg North is the only one being allowed to speak, yet we are the ones who are being muzzled? We cannot write this stuff. The Liberal caucus is just so muzzled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739077">I am looking over at the Liberals and there is so much despondency. We see them when they are in question period and have to give their rousing applause. We can see the thought bubble above their heads, “Please put me in cabinet.” That is what is going through their heads. Only a select few have asked questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739078"> Then we will go back to what we saw two weeks ago, which was the crossing of arms by the 24 who will remain nameless. However, they are absolutely united. They are absolutely muzzled while they are united. Why can they not tell us they are not united? Because they are muzzled. They are shackled. Finally, somebody like the member for <Affiliation DbId="278597" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> gets to tell us about the shackles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739079">We are talking about a privileged debate being led by one person from the Liberals. We are talking about massive fraud and the Liberals, particularly the member <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, love to tell us that the Conservatives did this or that. As I said yesterday, it is like the ghost of Stephen Harper is hiding under somebody's bed. They do not want to focus on the last nine years of complete and utter failure. The member keeps going on with his wink and nudge conspiracy theories as to what happened in the past with a security clearance. Never mind what happened with a reporter in the Kootenays. They will leave that one alone because they do not want to talk about that. I wonder if it would come up in a security clearance. </ParaText>

I said something, called out the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> for talking about his conspiracy theories of what was in the background and then asked why we were not talking about things in the background of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, like the reporter in the Kootenays. In response, the member for Winnipeg North said that maybe it was just a bad date. Then he stands and says that this is not what he meant. Canadians are not stupid, the Speaker is not stupid and I think the Liberals know, but there might be consequences if they speak out. In fact, the member should stand and apologize. I will stand here for five seconds and let him do that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739123"> Mr. Speaker, it was the shortest speech in the history of the Westminster parliamentary system, I would argue, but we will have to do some research on that. I thank you for adding the extra second to allow me 20 minutes to speak about the important issue before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739124">If someone were writing a Hollywood script, they could not write a better script than this. It has everything, and I am going to touch on that in a few minutes. It has intrigue, fraud, crime and a criminal investigation. All of it would make for a blockbuster Hollywood movie, yet here we are in the House of Commons playing this one out because of a minister who was using his position to further himself and his business with business partners who are suspect at best.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739125">I would like to revisit how we got here. As you know, in your ruling on the question of privilege that was brought forward by the committee, you agreed that privilege had been breached. An appropriate motion was moved at that time, effectively calling Mr. Anderson, the former minister's business partner, to the bar to answer the questions that he refused to answer at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739126"> In the 12th report of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, I was obligated by the committee, as its chair, to present the report to Parliament. It had to do with the compliance of a minister with the Conflict of Interest Act. It was really, in essence, about failure to respond to an order of the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739127">Of course, through the SDTC scandal and the fact that Parliament has been seized with that privilege motion as well, we understand that the supremacy of Parliament is paramount. When we at committee, or members, ask for documents to be received, the expectation is that those documents will be received, because, again, the supremacy of Parliament is paramount. We have the right to compel documents when we feel that they are not being provided to us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739128">To revisit this, I will quote from a report I wrote to Parliament:</ParaText>

In the end, he did not submit any documents”, despite the fact that, through an order, the committee had compelled him to do so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739138">Somehow there was a mistake made, and on more than nine occasions by his count, the “Randy” in question in the text messages was, in fact, an autocorrect. There were also some suggestions that it could have been somebody named Randeep, but there were only three directors of the company, and two principals, Mr. Anderson and someone named Randy, so it is highly improbable that there was a Randeep involved.</ParaText>

Fortunately, despite the obstructionist efforts of the Liberal members of the committee, the committee, in its wisdom, decided not to go in camera, and it asked Mr. Anderson to provide the name referenced by “Randy”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739140">Further, the committee noted the Speaker's ruling that the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, 3rd edition, 2017, at pages 1078 to 1079, reads, “Witnesses must answer all questions which the committee puts to them”. It goes on, but I am not going to read it as it is in the manual, but the committee also noted that at page 1081, the following is noted in relation to a witness: “Refusal to answer questions or failure to reply truthfully may give rise to a charge of contempt of the House, whether the witness has been sworn in or not.” This is really the point we are at right now.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739147">Well, Mr. Speaker, as you have indicated, the measures are to have Mr. Anderson, in a humiliating fashion, come before the bar of the House to answer the questions that were posed by the committee members. Once we dispose of the motion and vote on it, despite, as I said, many obstructionist attempts by Liberal members of the committee to not get to this point, we are at the point where Mr. Anderson will be called before the bar to provide answers to the questions that have been demanded of him, more specifically who the other Randy is. That is what we need to get to the bottom of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739148">As I said earlier, one could not write a Hollywood script better than this. It has it all, including the chance meeting of the former minister and Mr. Anderson on a flight coming out of Montreal, striking up a conversation about how it would be great if they got into business together. I bet that the former minister sure regrets that decision at this point, given the character he was aligning himself with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739149"> The company was set up after the chance meeting, and the connections are critical because the former minister was not in government at the time. He had been so previously, and he had gained a tremendous number of connections within government that could elevate and escalate the business into dealings that it would not otherwise have had.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739150"> Certainly over the course of the last nine years, the extent of insiders, the connected cronies who have benefited as a results of their connections to the Liberal Party, is well documented. Not the least of the issues are the SDTC scandal and Frank Baylis. The list of the insiders connected to the Liberal Party who have benefited as a result of that connection is as long as the day.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739151"> There was an opportunity for pandemic profiteering. We had gone to the height of a pandemic, and procurement was being done all over the country to try to supply PPE, for example, with contracts that were being sole-sourced. The opportunity was there for pandemic profiteering, a perfect storyline for a Hollywood script.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739152">There was fraud, which we have found out about since. Seven lawsuits have been filed against the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation>'s company, of which he was a director, seven civil suits for fraud. He was not supplying material that had already been paid for. One of the last straws, but not the only last straw, was the sworn affidavit just filed a couple of weeks ago that names the former minister as the Randy in question in one of those civil lawsuits. That sworn affidavit is certainly an indictment on who was involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739153">Then there was the famous fire at the company that still to this day remains unsolved. How was the warehouse set on fire that housed many of the products that GHI was storing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739154">There is a cocaine connection. One of the people involved with this company was found to be transporting cocaine on an airplane and shared a mailbox with the company. It is almost laughable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739155">Then there was the cover-up and the extent to which the cover-up went on. I mentioned this briefly in the information that I provided earlier. There were text messages that were not submitted after they were asked for. Those text messages are important because Mr. Anderson was directly communicating with the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> while he was at a ministerial retreat in British Columbia. There was denial after denial on the part of the former minister and on the part of Mr. Anderson, yet it has been proven through the text messages that they were communicating while the former minister was sitting around the cabinet table. It is more intrigue, as if it were a Hollywood script.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739156">I mentioned this earlier, but I think it is worth mentioning again. We saw many Liberal members trying to obstruct the committee's work by filibustering certain motions. The role of the ethics committee as an oversight committee is to get to the bottom of ethical breaches and violations, whether related to the code of conduct or the act itself, and the Liberals were obstructing that in every way. I finally had a sidebar conversation with the vice-chair, and I said to him that if he was willing to stake his political career and capital on defending that guy despite the amount of evidence that has been produced before us, with the text messages, the civil lawsuits and the sworn affidavit, it was not a hill that I would die on, quite frankly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739157">We have seen in recent news that he was let go, but, again, there is more intrigue. There is also the money, almost $110 million in contracts, and the half-million-dollar fraud case going on for not supplying PPE to a company that had already forwarded the money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739158"> Of course, we have heard about the indigenous connection too. The company claimed an indigenous connection in order to submit bids for indigenous procurement and contracts. The mighty OGGO has been dealing with that, as have other committees. The former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> embarrassingly had to step down, in large part as a result of the false claim of the indigenous connection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739159"> I think the icing on the cake, and the last straw, was the police investigation. Given that the Edmonton police are now involved and engaged in a criminal investigation into this company, I think the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had no other choice but to force the former <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">minister</Affiliation>'s resignation and have him stand down as a result of all of those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739160">It is a beautiful Hollywood script that would probably be a money-maker if it were to be produced. Of course, if we were to produce a movie like that, we would need a cast and an ensemble. Who would some of those cast members be?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739161"> Perhaps for Randy, we might look at Stanley Tucci or Jason Alexander from <I>Seinfeld</I>. I saw Stephen Anderson at committee, and I think he thought that he was auditioning for a reality TV show. Honestly, he lacked credibility, and the indifference he showed to our committee in requesting this information was quite something. Who would play him? Maybe it could be Brad Pitt or Charlie Sheen. Who would play the chair of the committee? Who would play me? Well, I think Mike Pence would be a good choice, but I am not sure that the former vice-president of the United States would go for that. I would settle for Tom Cruise, if that were the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739162">For the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, maybe Kevin from <I>The Office</I> would be a good choice. For the other ensemble members, Rosie O'Donnell would be there, along with Gérard Depardieu and my favourite actor, Denzel. Ryan Reynolds would be part of it, and we could get Cher in there, as well as Macaulay Culkin and Jude Law. I suggest that they would perhaps be good choices of actors for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>. Of course, Dog the Bounty Hunter would be himself because the committee has summoned both Mr. Anderson and the other one, Papineau, to the committee. We summoned them the other day, so we are hoping to see them. Maybe Dog the Bounty Hunter can find them because they are nowhere to be found on the radar. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739163">Seriously, the minister has been forced to step down as a result of all of the things that I have listed, which would make this a perfect Hollywood script. He said he wants to clear his name, that he is going to take time to clear his name, and he has not. I have not seen him since. I suspect that he is probably out there. I would like to give the former minister an opportunity to clear his name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739164"> Once this motion gets approved, Mr. Anderson will be appearing before the bar. The motion indicates how many members on each side would be able to ask Mr. Anderson questions. If the former minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, truly wants to clear his name, I cannot think of a better way to do that than in this place, facing his accuser. That would be a perfect opportunity. He should get out of the fetal position, lick his wounds, come in here and face his accuser. I want to give the member for Edmonton Centre that opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739165">Therefore, I move: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739183">What we have seen, more than anything else, is obstruction from the Liberal members of the committee. They have, on many occasions, filibustered when motions have been presented. The ethics committee is an oversight committee. We know that. It has a majority of opposition members on it for a reason. Like OGGO and public accounts, it is designed to hold the government to account. We have been seeing more of that lately. I am glad, and this is the reason we are at this point with Stephen Anderson. He has been called to the bar. It was not unanimous, but it was the will of the majority of the committee to report this to the Speaker, and the Speaker found that privilege had been breached with the lack of information that was provided to the committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739289">The tax holiday applies mainly to products for children, such as car seats, diapers, clothing and shoes. What we really want is to give Canadians some respite over the Holidays and during the weeks and months that follow. That is when they need a bit of a breather. There is a lot of pressure on parents and grandparents. They want to give gifts and take the kids out for a meal at a restaurant, for example. That is why we are trying to give Canadians a bit of a breather.</ParaText>

This tax break for Canadians during the holiday season through Christmas will make a world of a difference.

As we know, one in five children is living in poverty, two million people are at food banks and homeless encampments are popping up all over our cities all over the country. What is really interesting about this measure is that it almost seems like the Liberals are finally admitting that Canadians are struggling after nine years of their governance. What makes it a trick is that they are selling it as some big, grandiose gesture to bring relief when really it is for relatively few items for only a few weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739300">How can they possibly justify expecting all this praise when all it amounts to is a few bread crumbs for Canadians? What they need is large-scale permanent tax breaks, like axing the carbon tax. That is what Canadians need, not a few bread crumbs from the Liberal government for a few measly weeks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739331">La Ressource is much more than a simple corner store where people go to buy a quart of milk, a bag of chips or a case of beer. Over 25 years ago, in fact, these entrepreneurs were veritable pioneers when they made the switch to homegrown products from Quebec, in particular microbrewery beers. Entering the store is like entering Ali Baba's cave. There, patrons choose their beer the way they might sort through bottles at the SAQ. After some wise tips from their beerologist, they can chat with members of the family about the latest goings-on in the neighbourhood. Frédéric Desroches, part of the third generation at the helm of the family business, is every bit as involved and engaged in the community as his grandfather.</ParaText>

It should take this opportunity to take a step back and seriously rethink its priorities. This government is prepared to spend $6 billion to buy votes, but it refuses to improve the old age security pension for seniors 65 to 74, even though this would address the injustice they are suffering, not to mention cost half as much.</ParaText>

The government believes it has done enough for seniors, so it is hanging them out to dry. Some seniors will not even benefit from the GST holiday for Christmas, because all their income already goes towards their basic needs. The government can do something. If it can give $250 to everyone just to show how generous it is, if it can spend $6 billion to buy votes, then it can invest $3 billion in old age security.</ParaText>

One of my favourite quotes from a Conservative MP shows what Conservatives are saying about their leader: “He's the one who decides everything. His main adviser is himself”.

              <ParaText id="8739626">When we talk about the GST, the decision has been made. This gets to the flip-flop. We now have the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> telling Conservative members of Parliament that the law is they have to say no to their constituents about giving them a holiday on GST products. I find that shameful. At the end of the day, every Conservative is going to stand up and vote no to giving that GST break on numerous commodities to their constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739627">They will come up with all sorts of lame excuses as to why they say no. However, before they think about those lame excuses, I will remind them of what Erin O'Toole, the former leader of the Conservative Party, said. He said, “We will remove GST for the month of December on purchases from retail stores to provide immediate relief for cost of living.” This is what the then leader of the Conservative Party said. Interestingly, the current <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> not only liked the idea but also retweeted Erin O'Toole's tweet. For Conservatives who say they are not on social media, I trust they read their election platform book. If we look on page 51, it talks about a “GST holiday”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739628">On the one hand, the Conservatives are saying it is a bad idea today. On the other, not that long ago, they were telling Canadians that this is what they would do if they were in government. I want members to tell me something: How do we define hypocrisy? One only needs to take a look at this policy or the policy on the price of pollution. The price of pollution was also made reference to earlier today; we had 300-plus Conservative candidates going around to Canadians, just as they did on the GST break. They said that, in December, they were going to give Canadians a GST tax break; by the way, they also supported a price on pollution, which is a carbon tax. The Conservatives supported it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739629">The election came, and we got the Conservatives doing a couple of somersaults or flip-flops on the ideas. Now, all of them say no to the GST break we are trying to provide, which they supported in the last election platform, with their former leader tweeting on the issue. We see that every day. They are going to say no to that; at the same time, they no longer support what they told Canadians in regard to the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739630">To add insult to injury, instead of giving that tax break to constituents, they are also going to be cutting the carbon rebates, taking more money out of the pockets of Canadians. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has made it very clear that 80% of Canadians have a net gain when it comes to the carbon rebate versus the carbon tax. However, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has dictated to his minions that they have to say what he is saying; if they do not, they are in trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739631">We can ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="278549" Type="2">Abbotsford</Affiliation> what happened to him when he went offside after the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said he was going to fire the Governor of the Bank of Canada.

              <Affiliation DbId="278694" Type="2">Ms. Leah Taylor Roy (Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8739656"> Madam Speaker, today, as always, I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the constituents of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, especially since I am speaking on the positive measures that our government is implementing to support small businesses and restaurants, including the proposed removal of the taxes, GST and HST in some provinces, from groceries and other holiday items.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739657"> I would just note that many provinces, such as Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador, have already agreed that they will be removing their provincial part of the HST. They see the benefit of this through their leadership, even though the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> cannot see the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739658"> Now, I understand the holiday period is one of the most critical times for small businesses. They are making a significant proportion of their annual sales, helping them to achieve their annual goals. We had small businesses, and I know that the holiday season made a huge difference. Consumer spending and encouraging people to come out and buy things is very important to these small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739659">Thanks to our government's efforts, I am glad to report that Canadians from across the country will receive a tax break from December 14 to February 15, helping both consumers and businesses. This will make a meaningful difference for Canadians by making all food, as well as other holiday provisions and children's clothing and toys tax-free, providing real relief at the cash register. Importantly, it will also contribute to improved sales and greater revenues for businesses and restaurants from mid-December through to mid-February, as I have said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739660"> Many small business stakeholder groups have expressed appreciation and support for this. For example, Restaurants Canada has said, “This is a big win for the restaurant industry...restores some much-needed hope to our industry and we are optimistic it will translate to increased spending at local restaurants across the country.” Ultimately, this could mean a boost of up to 5% or close to $1 billion in additional revenue. That is significant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739661"> The Retail Council of Canada also welcomed the sales tax relief announced from the government, stating, “The removal of GST and HST on a sizable list of goods will create major tax savings for Canadians, along with economic stimulus for our industry.” Notably, they also reported that this stimulus will support businesses both through the holiday season and in the first six weeks of the new year, which is typically the slowest period of the year for retail and restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739662"> We expect the tax break will help restaurants and other small businesses across the country. I am glad that we can offer this support through the holiday season. I encourage Canadians to take advantage of the opportunity for savings and to shop local as they purchase gifts for friends and loved ones, and to patronize local restaurants if they are planning a holiday outing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739663">I also want to speak to many other initiatives our government is delivering to support small businesses. We will always support hard-working entrepreneurs who contribute significantly to their communities, support good jobs and enable economic growth. Our small and medium-sized businesses are the bedrock of our communities, and it is essential they thrive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739664"> From digital transformation to greening our economy while creating well-paying jobs, our government has an economic plan that will ensure businesses across the country continue to grow and thrive. That is why we are delivering $2.5 billion to close to 600,000 small and medium-sized enterprises by the end of the year through the Canada carbon rebate. In fact, the rebate checks have gone out earlier than anticipated and started to be sent out this past week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739665"> Reports say that 60% of small businesses are directly impacted by climate change. From floods and droughts to closures and employee absences caused by extreme weather events and illnesses, small businesses are feeling the impact of climate change. We are going to continue fighting it while putting money back into the pockets of Canadians and small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739666"> I am also pleased to report that we have negotiated agreements with both Visa and Mastercard to reduce their interchange fees by up to 27% or $1 billion over five years. This means that small businesses, like the businesses in my riding, will be able to keep more of their revenue and be able to invest in their operations, creating jobs and strengthening our overall economy. This will make a meaningful impact for these businesses, improving their bottom line. These are in addition to and build on our government's work to alleviate the global economic pressures that businesses have been facing, pressures such as inflation, interest rates hikes and worker shortages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739667">Then, to help Canadian businesses thrive even more, we have invested in them through the Canada summer jobs program, which we are doing again this year, and, in fact, that has just opened. There is also the My Main Street program. One of the first things that this government did to support small businesses was to lower the small business tax rate from 11% to 9%. We cut taxes. This was done in recognition of the vital role small businesses play in our economy and our communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739668">In 2024, estimates are that small and medium-sized enterprises will save $6.2 billion because of this decrease made to the preferred small business tax rate bias. To encourage Canadian innovators to turn their ideas into businesses, we announced the creation of the Canadian entrepreneurs' incentive that would reduce the inclusion rate on capital gains to one-third on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains. Combined with the increased $1.25-million lifetime capital gains exemption, the entrepreneurs' incentive would make eligible business owners better off when selling business shares worth up to $6.25 million.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739669"> The government's 2024 budget devoted $200 million to renewing the venture capital catalyst initiative, or VCCI, with a goal of supporting venture capital for entrepreneurs who are part of equity-deserving groups and investing in underserved communities as well as in entrepreneurs who live outside key metropolitan areas. This investment builds on the previous $821 million the government has already invested in VCCI, as well as the multiples of that amount that came in through private capital attracted by these investments and supportive of innovative Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739670"> Study after study show us that increasing diversity in business ownership responds to market needs, strengthens economic resilience and boosts the bottom line. We also know it is the best way to support economic growth, so we have created a suite of initiatives to ensure that all business owners have access to the capital they need to start or grow their businesses. We have given young people the option to choose entrepreneurship as a viable career path. That is why we invested $60 million in Futurpreneur Canada to help the organization increase its capacity to support young Canadian entrepreneurs. These investments will support shared prosperity long into the future. We are boosting government procurement in small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as supporting indigenous enterprises. We understand that the best products and ideas often originate here in Canada and we want to ensure entrepreneurs are equipped with the tools they need to bring their ideas to fruition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739671">I am confident that these combined measures will continue to make a real, tangible difference for all businesses from coast to coast to coast. In summary, this government has made unprecedented investments to support Canada's small business community, from important tax relief to a range of incentives to support business owners and entrepreneurs, to the extensive COVID support measures through the pandemic period. No other government has done so much for small businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739672">In closing, I urge all members of Parliament to vote for the legislation before them, quickly and unanimously, to ensure business owners and consumers can receive the benefits of these tax breaks and have more money and less stress during the holiday season. I ask members to not be a Grinch, even if their <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> is. I ask them to think of all the Whos in Whoville or perhaps all the constituents in their own riding and give them a well-deserved break this holiday season. </ParaText>

The member for <Affiliation DbId="278597" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> was stating quite publicly that he is not going to support this. He was threatened with unspecified consequences, threatened with punishment, because he did not want to support this. He even said caucus was not even consulted. This is highly unusual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739674"> Was the member consulted before the government brought this piece of legislation in, and which businesses in her community did she consult with? The business owners in my community are extremely worried about it, especially about the cost of reprogramming their computers and the costs that are going to be laid down on them. Could the member just let the House know if she was consulted, and then which business owners she consulted?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739675">Madam Speaker, in our caucus, we have been talking weekly about the affordability issues that Canadians are facing. We discuss this constantly. In fact, last week, we had a very robust discussion about such measures as these. We are constantly talking about it and I have been talking to business owners and consumers in my riding on a regular basis. Every time I am home, I go out door knocking, I go to events and I make sure that I check in with them. I know that they want some relief. I know that they are looking for these kinds of breaks this holiday season and I am so glad that our government has taken action to decide to do this. I just wish the Conservatives would get on board and help support their constituents too.</ParaText>

We are trying to make sure our constituents have some relief, and this is a great way to do it.</ParaText>

The rich in this country, the super-rich mega-billionaires, pay almost next to nothing because the government continues to keep the immense tax breaks brought in by Harper. We need tax fairness. The measure is, of course, a temporary one. New Democrats believe that the GST should be removed permanently from all essential goods.

They have doubled housing costs, doubled the debt, doubled food bank use and doubled gun crime. Food prices have risen 36% faster in Canada than in the U.S., a gap that opened up after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put a carbon tax on farmers and on the truckers who bring us food.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739696"> Can members hear the sound? It is the sound of the mass exodus of Canadian jobs fleeing to south of the border. Donald Trump loves our carbon tax.

He just does not know what he is doing, and now he has taped the agreement back together, desperately hanging on until February 25, 2025, the day his pension kicks in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739699"> The NDP leader has sold out Canadians yet again to the reckless Liberal tax trick that would push Canada even deeper into debt. The two-month temporary tax trick would be more than offset by the quadrupling of the carbon tax on heat, housing, food and fuel planned for next spring, so here is the trick, the scam: In just a few months, the Liberals will actually raise taxes on all the same things they are claiming that they are giving Canadians a tax break on.</ParaText>

Conservatives would axe the carbon tax permanently on everything for everyone for good and take the GST off new homes to save people up to $50,000 on a new home purchase and stimulate the building of 30,000 extra homes every single year. Only common-sense Conservatives will bring home powerful paycheques and lower home prices so people can afford food and a home in a safe neighbourhood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739701">I want to talk about how we got to this point. Members can imagine, if they will, a prime minister's actually saying that the budget will balance itself, saying that they do not think about monetary policy or saying to let the bankers worry about the economy. It seems unimaginable that a prime minister, responsible for the economy of this country, would say such things.

              <ParaText id="8739704">The quadrupling of the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre will stop our trucks from delivering parts to factories, clothing to stores and food to grocery shelves. Just last spring, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> actually admitted he does know at least one thing about monetary policy. I will give him that. He acknowledged, when sending out billions of dollars in cheques, that “as soon as you do that, inflation goes up by exactly that amount.” According to his own words, with the planned $4.6 billion spend for $250 cheques, he is committing economic malpractice. It will cause inflation. It will force the Bank of Canada to keep interest rates higher for longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739705">The Liberals like to say that most Canadian families get back more than they pay in the carbon tax. They completely ignore the findings of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who has said many times that when we take into account the economic knock-on effects of the carbon tax, 100% of middle-class Canadians pay more than they receive in the rebates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739706">On top of this, the inflationary effects of the tax mean that families will have to spend $700 more on food this year than they did in 2023. Since 2015, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to power, by the way, the price of food has increased by 35%. The price of gas is up nearly 50%. Rents are up 33% and mortgage interest is up 73%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739707">Canadians deserved tax relief before Donald Trump made his “I love tariffs” comment. He was elected three weeks ago, and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did nothing at all to head off the tariff. The killer tariff will devastate our economy when we have a weak Prime Minister who is panicking because he does not know what to do about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739708">However, there is a <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> who can stand up to Donald Trump and put Canadians first. The member for Carleton cannot become the prime minister soon enough.</ParaText>

The CFIB released a statement just today, saying that a majority of small businesses in this country oppose the policy. Only 4% of small businesses believe their sales will improve; 75% say it will be costly and complicated to implement the holiday, and 65% of businesses say there is not enough time to implement the change. This comes from a group that represents small businesses in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739710">The Liberals have also jacked up the capital gains tax. Economists like Jack Mintz say this will hurt way more people than just the 0.13% of tax filers who are directly affected, and will blow a $90-billion hole in our GDP, costing 400,000 jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739711"> Of course, there is the so-called luxury tax. The head of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada was at the finance committee a couple of weeks ago. He said that it has cost $1.8 billion in sales to the aircraft industry and $90 million in GST revenue. The government has collected only $15 million in luxury tax, while it cost it $19 million to administer the tax. Leave it to the Liberals to create a tax and lose money doing it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739712">The bottom line is that this country needs a prime minister who understands economic issues. Enough is enough. It is time for a prime minister who, as Wilfrid Laurier said, will put “Canada first, Canada last, and Canada always”.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8739727">Madam Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna—Lake Country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739728">I rise today to discuss the Liberal government's two-month temporary tax trick, which looks like it was written on the back of a napkin as a knee-jerk reaction to seeing some new poll. Canadians are smarter than that. Residents in my community, and all Canadians, expect better policies to make basic necessities, such as food, fuel and housing, more affordable and to address the causes of cost increases. The measures the Liberals have proposed would not address the causes of affordability or bring sustainable cost reductions. Many people and businesses are struggling after nine years of the costly <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his partners in the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739729">We have to wonder how the Liberals came up with this out-of-the-blue policy, which would be implemented literally just before Christmas, on the evening of Friday the 13th, no less. The Liberals do not have a one-for-one rule like that the Conservatives have proposed. The one-for-one rule is when, for every dollar spent, we need to find a dollar of savings, or for every dollar less in revenue, such as this Liberal measure, we need to find a dollar of savings. This is how households and small businesses operate. This is the principle used for the Conservative commitment to remove the GST on new home sales under $1 million to bring savings to home builders and families. Conservatives were transparent in how this reduction in federal revenue would be offset. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739730">The Liberal government does not operate or create policies like this. The measure we are debating today is not a tax cut and would only be inflationary, but the Liberals do not want to talk about that. Conservatives have real tax cut plans that would lower costs and spark production. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739731">It is also unbelievable how much Canada will be spending on servicing our debt. Our children and grandchildren will be paying for it. It is clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a spending problem. He also has no clue about fiscal responsibility. He stated that budgets would balance themselves and that he does not think about monetary policy. His latest statement is that bankers will look after the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739732">On addressing the rampant unaffordability we are seeing across the country, the measures we are debating today would not be a permanent solution. We know how bad things have gotten for Canadians after nine years of the Liberals being propped up by their NDP partners. The Liberals do not think Canadian families are struggling. They think that this is just in their heads and they are having a bad vibe. Statistics Canada figures show that food prices have increased by 35% since 2015. Grocery prices have jumped by 20% over the past three years alone. Food prices have risen 36% faster in Canada than they have in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739733">This gap can be said to have started when the Liberals introduced a carbon tax. This has increased costs throughout the agriculture and agri-food supply chain. These rising costs, which have not increased this dramatically since the 1980s, will see families having to spend $700 more on food this year than they did in 2023. The price of gasoline has also soared. Housing unaffordability has also risen to levels not seen before, with housing, rent and mortgage costs all doubling since 2015. This is real. This is not just in Canadians' heads and it is not just a bad vibe, as the Liberals believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739734">One thing with this temporary tax trick is that it picks winners and losers, this product over that product, rather than lowering the cost of everything. This Liberal measure does not acknowledge everyone's place in life or that their priorities are different. Another problem with this temporary tax trick is exactly that: It is temporary. It will not help address the causes of affordability over a longer time frame, and it is not addressing costs of basic necessities such as nutritious food, fuel or housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739735">This measure will also not help hedge against the impending almost 19% carbon tax increase that will hike the costs of food, fuel and housing. That is right. On April 1, the Liberal government, supported by the NDP, will increase the carbon tax again. Over the next few years, it will increase to a whopping 61¢ per litre.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739736"> Even worse, to add insult to injury, the excise tax is also set to automatically increase on April 1, and this is on liquor. Again, the Liberals are giving a slight, temporary tax reprieve so Canadians forget that they will be increasing those taxes in just a few months. These April Fool's Day tax increases are not a joke. They are real.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739737">Another thing the Liberals want to divert Canadians' attention away from is how the Canadian dollar continues to drop. It is now hovering around 70¢ compared to the U.S. dollar. The Canadian dollar is the lowest it has been in five years. This will make buying everything from the U.S. more expensive, whether it be a new refrigerator or food sold in Canadian grocers that came from the U.S. That is a lot of products, including everything from fruits and vegetables to cereal, which households, restaurants, senior homes, care centres, hospitals, day cares and everywhere else all buy. However, the Liberals and the NDP do not want us talking about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739738">They also do not want us talking about the fact that there is GST on the carbon tax, a tax on a tax, which is so wrong. Last winter I had many residents send me screenshots of their home heating bills, asking why GST was charged on the carbon tax. I just responded to another constituent asking about this the other day. On the measure we are debating today, one resident wrote to me saying, “We don't want the added burden of debt. We want real change.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739739">I also have a message from a local business retailer in my community. I need to paraphrase what he said because I cannot use that type of language here in the House of Commons. He is a merchant, and he said that the Liberals have “no clue” how much of a huge administrative and costly effort these temporary tax changes on select items is going to be. His staff and customers are already confused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739740">Businesses and organizations from across the country have also offered critiques of these Liberal measures. The director of the Huron Chamber of Commerce stated the government has “downloaded the administrative cost of this tax cut onto small business owners - and it's going to cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars”. The Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce CEO stated that these measures will be “very onerous for small businesses”. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business stated that these measures “may add confusion and complexity for general retailers with both taxable and new exempt items.” They went on to state, “Canadians need permanent, not temporary tax relief.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739741">Ian Tostenson, the president of the B.C. Restaurant and Food Services Association, said that the tax relief will likely have little effect in stimulating the restaurant economy. He said, “If you look at a restaurant bill of say $100, you’re talking here about saving $5. I don’t think that people are going to rev up their cars and head out for that, I really don’t”. He continued, “I think it's a misguided policy”. As described in an article, rather than a limited GST reprieve, “he'd like to see governments do more to increase consumers' disposable income, so dining out is back on the table.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739742">It has been reported that a “co-owner of Orca Dynamics, which provides point-of-sale products and services to businesses on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, said it’s a 'hellscape' out there for retailers who will have to deal with a tax change on top of their regular work.” He said, “It’s going to cost a merchant a lot of labour hours to go through all these products to exempt the GST for just a few months of transactions.... The maintenance side of this is a nightmare, a living nightmare.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739743">In closing, I want to describe what bringing home the promise of Canada would look like. It would mean lowering the cost of heat, housing and gas. It would mean lowering the cost of food so Canadians can afford groceries. It would mean having a long-term impact on the ability of Canadians to afford what they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739744">Let us axe the carbon tax on everything for everyone, forever. Let us axe the tax and bring home affordability for all Canadians. I have no confidence in the government. Let us call an election now so Canadians can decide.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739759"> Madam Speaker, it is always great to rise in the House and discuss important matters. Today, we are discussing making life more affordable for Canadians, Canadian families and hard-working Canadians, and continuing to grow the economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739760">I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278514" Type="2">Kingston and the Islands</Affiliation>, whom I have known for many years, and I know he presents his view in a very eloquent manner every time the hon. member rises to speak.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739761">I would quickly like to note that today is a good day for the Canadian economy. It is a really good indication of where we are. Foreign direct investment flows are something that, as an economist, I very much like. We are at $23 billion in Q3. Foreign outflows are at $9 billion. This is one of the largest-ever recorded foreign direct inflows into our economy. These are not securities. These are actually investment transactions by companies. This is confidence about where we are going as a country and where we are going as an economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739762">This is really important to note because it is something I believe in, whether it is the $10-billion Dow project or the $2-billion Linde project in Alberta, whether it is the Stellantis plant in Windsor, near my hon. colleague down the aisle, or whether it is the Volkswagen investment, which is literally transforming southwestern Ontario, in the St. Thomas area. It is just incredible to see those types of numbers presented. Again, there is confidence in Canadian workers and confidence in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739763">We are here to discuss giving Canadians some help and meeting them where they are. When I was growing up, we had this saying within the family that every little bit helps. Every little bit helps a family that is working hard, saving for their kids and for their futures, and looking forward to celebrating the Christmas holidays. I know that in my riding, a lot of families will be getting together, of course, just like they will all across this country. A lot of them will buy prepared meals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739764">In the city of Vaughan, there are a lot of entities that have these prepared meals, and they are going to be saving, literally, hundreds of dollars sometimes, when it is a large family, on a prepared meal. Those are real savings for families. In my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge, there are 368 food service establishments employing over 5,000 hard-working Canadians, and they are going to get a boost, from December 15 to the day after Valentine's Day, especially during January. It is the slowest period of the year for many businesses, including restaurants. They are going to get a boost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739765">I can name a few: Romano's, Castello, Via Mercanti, Giro d'Italia, Funghetto Trattoria, Desserts Plus, That's Italian. Zafferano and pizza restaurants are near my office. There are so many wonderful restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739766">In all of these restaurants, we are going to see groups of people before the Christmas holidays, during the Christmas holidays, having lunch. The Province of Ontario has signed on. That is for Ontarians, for the residents of Ontario. That is about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in tax savings from December 14 to February 15. These are real savings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739767">I am so proud. The day we made the announcement, Restaurants Canada was there to say that was great work. Its hard-working members need a break. Restaurants have faced higher costs from higher minimum wage, higher insurance costs and higher input costs. Of course, we are going to help them, and that is what it is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739768">I have a three-year-old, and most of the time, to be honest, my wife takes care of her because I am here in Ottawa. She goes out to buy diapers, and they are not cheap. We do not control the price of diapers. However, for parents with kids at home, we made raising a child more affordable, much like we did with the national early learning and day care plan. We reduced fees by 52%, again, working with the Province of Ontario. We will see further relief in January, down to, I think, 60%. Then in September, it will be down to $10 a day on average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739769">We are going to give Canadians a break. We are going to help them out because every little bit helps. These are real savings for hard-working families across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739770">If the Conservatives wish to vote against it, that is their prerogative. We all make our own decisions. That is fine. With the Canada child benefit, for example, in my city, 49,400 children and their families receive the Canada child benefit, and $192 million flows to the residents of the city of Vaughan, to those collecting the Canada child benefit, and the Conservatives voted no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739771">Let us be frank. With the Canada workers benefit, there are 19,000 people in the city of Vaughan who get the Canada workers benefit. There has been over $21 million delivered.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739772">Making life more affordable and growing our economy is what we are about on this side of the aisle, and we will continue to do that. Even in uncertain times, we will deliver for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739773">Regarding the Canadian dental care plan, when I first assumed office in 2015, I heard from seniors everywhere. The only place for a senior facing emergency dental work to go was York Region. There was no plan. However, over 21,000 seniors in the city of Vaughan, including nearly 12,000 in my riding, are on the Canadian dental care plan today. These are real savings. Canadians are saving, on average, $710. I have had seniors come to my office who, after nine or 10 years, have gone to a dentist. It was unfortunate to hear that one person had eight cavities, when I spoke to the dentist afterwards. That is real, tangible progress for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739774">We talk about our economy. In the city of Vaughan, we had a South Korean firm invest and create 300 jobs. It was a $100-million investment about a month ago. We had a food products company invest another $100 million. Every week I attend a new business opening, whether it is in Vaughan Mills or whether it is in my riding. I have probably attended 10 or 12 new business openings in the last two months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739775"> Canadians have been through a lot. We know it. There was a global pandemic, and there was global inflation, which impacted everyone and elevated prices. However, we have had the backs of Canadians, and that is what being in government is about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739776">We are now debating a bill to give Canadians some tax relief. I am all for tax relief. They better believe it. I know those hard-working restaurant workers are going to get more hours out of this. Those owners are going to get more profits. They also received the small business carbon rebate, tax-free, which is being delivered today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739777">I know that Josie and Patricia at Il Castello, and Francesco at Via Mercanti are going to get their tax-free small business carbon rebates back. They are going to get tax-free money, and they will actually receive a tax deduction up front. They are getting a double benefit, and that is very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739778"> I will talk about the Canada workers benefit because it is not in this bill, but we look forward to it in the future. It will help hard-working Canadians, who work hard every day and who do the right things. They save, invest, create jobs, pay taxes and do the right things for their services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739779">I look at the other items, some essentials, and I go back to prepared foods. At Brettone Catering in my riding, Romano's, Aidas and all those bakeries, their customers are going to go in at Christmastime, <I>Natale</I>, Noel, and are going to get a tax break. It is great news. Again, regarding the 13% HST in the province of Ontario, the province has joined us in delivering savings for its residents. That is something I am so proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739780">This is about making life more affordable, laying the foundations on social programs that strengthen our social fabric while growing our economy. I think of the Canada child benefit again. It is tax-free, monthly. Almost $200 million flows to the families in the city of Vaughan. There is the Canada workers benefit, the Canada child benefit, as I mentioned, and the national early learning and day care plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739781">We also eliminated interest on student loans and on apprenticeship loans for students in university. We raised the amount they can get before they start to repay those loans to get them back in and get them working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739782"> Canada is a work in progress, but we are the ninth-largest economy in the world. We have a AAA credit rating. Our debt-to-GDP is the lowest in the G7. Our deficit-to-GDP is around 1%, versus that of the United States at 7% or 7.5%, versus our European friends at between 3% and 5%. Ours is the lowest. That is being fiscally responsible, and it is something we need to celebrate. These are good foundations to continue to grow and to invest in our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739783"> There is uncertainty in the world. We know that, and we will continue to deal with it. That is what strong leadership is about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739784">I always look forward to getting up and debating in the House about the issues of the day, with my three daughters at home and with the family watching. It is always an honour to rise. I look forward to questions and comments from my most hon. colleagues. I wish everyone a wonderful afternoon.</ParaText>

Literally, we have a tax here that we are ready to axe, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> does not even want to axe it. This is the hypocrisy. Not only is it hypocritical in the sense that Conservatives are always running around talking about axing the tax, but this is a tax they proposed axing in the last election, literally.

Just to put it into context, they were not exactly friends; I would argue that they did not get along. Yet the member for Carleton, the current Leader of the Opposition, liked that so much that he was willing to put aside his differences with Erin O'Toole to celebrate the fact they had brought that along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739818"> Flash forward to now: Suddenly Conservatives do not want to axe the tax anymore. That is where we are. The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> is saying this is a phony scam that will result in nothing and this is just a trick. He should talk to some of the businesses and restaurants in downtown Kingston about whether or not it will be beneficial to remove the GST from takeout and from eating in restaurants in January.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739819"> When I was younger, in my 20s, I worked in the hospitality industry in Kingston. The slowest month of the year is January, and February would probably be the next slowest. This is the time when we can genuinely impact those businesses. We are very proud of the number of restaurants we have in downtown Kingston. I am not sure if it is because we are heavily populated by all the Queen's students, but we like to think we have the most independent restaurants per capita in the country. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739820">This will directly benefit them. This is not just about giving a break, although millions of people will benefit and will rejoice in it, not just the billionaires, as Conservatives would say. This is about helping our economy keep moving and helping those small businesses that would typically have a slower time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739821">I also hear Conservatives saying it is really difficult for small business owners to change the sales tax on their system for two months. Back in the 1990s, when I was doing it, we used to change it on a nightly basis based on drink prices changing every night. It is very simple to go in there and change what is currently marked at 5% to 0%. They can even do it now from a smart phone for all of the restaurants they might have throughout the country. They do not even need to physically be at the terminal to do it anymore. I am sure not everybody is using that technology, but the red herring the Conservatives are throwing around here, that it is just going to be a massive, complex thing for a restaurant or a small business to change the tax percentage from 5% to 0%, is nothing more than that: just a red herring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739822">It apparently was not going to be a problem when it was only going to happen for one month in December 2021, when Erin O'Toole proposed it and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>, the leader of the opposition, celebrated it. It would have been simple to do in 2021, but I guess in 2024, the technology has reverted back to the 1950s or 1960s and it will be next to impossible to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739823">Of course, I am dripping with sarcasm here because I cannot stand to listen to the hypocrisy over and over from Conservatives on this. They actively want to see something fail rather than try to support Canadians. They have a choice when we get to voting on this whether or not they want to give this tax holiday. By the way, we are not even the ones who most recently used the term “tax holiday”; it was literally in their platform in the last election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739824">Every Conservative sitting here agreed when they ran that for December 2021 that it was a great idea to give a tax holiday to consumers. Suddenly in 2024, it is the worst thing we could have ever thought up. It is literally the exact same program. This is just typical. It happens over and over. Conservatives continually do this. Every Conservative sitting here also ran on a platform of pricing pollution. What did they do there? They just completely flip-flopped on that. They suddenly said because they are not doing it, it is a horrible idea. That is not their job in here. Their job in here is to hold the government accountable, not make it their mission to see that absolutely everything fails to the detriment of Canadians. That is what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739825">Whether it is filibustering, or whether it is voting against measures for Canadians they dreamed up in the last election, they are always doing it. They just hate the idea. It is more important to them to see political failure on this side of the House rather than seeing Canadians get ahead. They are more interested in political failure and seeing the government fail than they are in helping Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739839">What we are debating is the outcome of a desperate gimmick announced by the government a few days ago, for which, somewhere on the back of a cocktail napkin, it cobbled together some kind of desperate ploy to buy Canadians' votes. The plan originally had more components than what is going to be voted on tonight. We are down to only voting on the GST elimination for two months because the Liberals blew it with the rest of the plan they tried to hatch. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739840">They also have a promise that is still hanging out there to give cheques to working Canadians who earn up to a net income of $150,000. This part of this half-baked scheme fell so flat that not only do Conservatives oppose that plan but the Bloc and the NDP have both publicly opposed it, arguing that it does not go to enough people, and Liberal backbenchers are unhappy, too. As the government tried to spray money as far and wide as possible, it was not far enough for the backbench. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739841">I do not know how, but the Liberals quickly whittled their bill down to that which they thought they could get passed tonight. Based on the comments from the NDP, it sounds possible that this bill will get passed later this evening, but I will vote against it because I have no confidence in the government's agenda whatsoever, or what even passes for an agenda these days. We see a desperate government desperately clinging to power with the NDP carrying it along as it limps through the final months of its mandate. We are dealing with an entirely unserious government that is not committed to real reform that would enhance the productivity of this country and deliver the powerful paycheques that people need to afford food, housing, transportation and, indeed, a few extra luxuries or a few Christmas presents for their families this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739842">When the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> made the announcement earlier this week, which included not just the two-month GST holiday but the other parts that the Liberals cannot even get their own backbench behind, she talked about a vibe session. What is this? It is like she is saying that all the people lined up at food banks because they cannot afford food are really giving off bad vibes and if the government could take the GST off a certain laundry list of items, then maybe it could improve the vibe of the millions of Canadians who are struggling to afford the basic necessities of life, which, by the way, are groceries and residential rents. These are GST-exempt already, so the argument has been made that people with more disposable income disproportionately benefit from this particular tax removal, and I think that is correct. That is demonstrably factual. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739843">Canadians are struggling and will take whatever they can get in terms of making life more affordable, but what they really need is a serious government that is prepared to tackle the very serious problems that this country faces. We are not going to get there by trying to shake off the bad vibes that have come about from a government that has presided over the doubling of the cost of residential rents and the more than doubling of an average mortgage payment in Canada. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739844">People are struggling with day-to-day life and affording the basics. It is almost like the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is blaming people for their bad vibes as they are struggling with what this country has become under nine years of the Liberal government's rule.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739845">Taking the GST off a specified list of things through this bill is not going to increase productivity. It is not going to stem the flow of investment that is leaving this country and taking thousands of jobs with it. Despite the comments from the previous speaker, it will create a burden on retailers, which may carry hundreds or thousands of items that would be affected. It may be easy for a restaurant to just take 5% off everything, but what if we go to a dollar store proprietor with a handful of employees? Do we tell them they need to re-mark some but not all of the things in their store for two months and then do it again two months from now? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739846">I spoke to a colleague who has a proprietor of dollar stores in his riding, and he knows what this is going to cost him. It is a true burden, and it is disproportionately felt by smaller retailers. Their systems cover less than those of a large chain, which might have hundreds of stores. That is just a minor digression about how this half-baked plan the Liberals came up with earlier in the week is not a solution for the affordability crisis and productivity crisis in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739847">Canadians need much bolder steps than that. They need a government that is going to axe the tax and fix the budget. We are going to axe the carbon tax when we form government. We will create far more affordability opportunities for Canadians by eliminating the carbon tax, which affects groceries, home heating, fuel, just about anything. These are necessities. We are going to axe that tax permanently for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739848">We will also have to deal with the budget. The government's deficit is a moving target that can never be predicted. We can go through each budget and each fall economic statement since the Liberals came into power and see that they have disregarded or blown through every fiscal anchor, guardrail or whatever they want to call it in the moment, including the current one. As recently as this spring, the Liberals projected a $40-billion deficit. The Parliamentary Budget Officer already had it up to $46 billion before the current announcement. The current announcement is going to take it over $50 billion. If the Liberals get through the $250 payment they want to give to Canadians this spring, for which they will need to gain the support of all parties, including their own backbench, they are going to be way over that amount with no plan whatsoever to rein it in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739849">We need to get Canadians back to receiving the services they need from the government. It needs to get serious about national defence and about public safety. These things will require enormous investment from the government, but we have only seen the bloat of bureaucracy without an improvement to service. We see chaos in department after department, such as Immigration, Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739852"> Madam Speaker, here we are again with private members' hour, which there are very few of nowadays because of what is taking place. I will get to that, but I want to emphasize that this particular private member's bill takes a step backward when it comes to the environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739853"> All political parties, with the exception of the Conservative Party, recognize that our environment matters. Canadians are concerned about our environment, contrary to what the Conservatives might believe. However, interestingly, this is not the first time we have a private member's bill that would not do very much for the environment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739854">When we look at the Conservative Party's approach to the environment, the highlight, as the member opposite just made reference to, is, as he said, to axe the tax. However, the theme behind axing the tax is to attack the price on pollution, and it is a common thing the Conservatives say inside the chamber. There is a reason they do that. Members may recall that, last week, it made national news that Conservative MPs were complaining and providing comment in regard to their “freedom leader no more”, as we found out that the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> not only watches very closely what his MPs are saying and doing, but also rewards good behaviour and punishes bad behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739855"> I say that because the member opposite just spoke about axing the tax, which is one of their slogans. What do the Conservatives have to say about slogans? I will quote directly from a news article that made headlines yesterday. Here is what Conservative MPs had to say: “If the leader invents a new slogan, ‘we know we'll have to use it’”. Reading further down in the story, it says, again coming from Conservatives, “‘If you repeat the slogans, you get rewarded,’ said a Conservative source. ‘You are celebrated in front of the entire caucus for being a good cheerleader.’” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739856">If one is in the Conservative caucus, one gets celebrated for repeating the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>'s slogans. That is why we often hear them saying “axe the tax” and the other slogans, the bumper stickers. </ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Kevin Lamoureux:</B> Madam Speaker, it is embarrassing; my colleague is right. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739859">Now we have this private member's bill. Anyone who follows Parliament would understand that we do not get to debate private members' bills that often. That is because the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is in essence holding the House of Commons hostage. It is unfortunate, even though I do not think that this particular private member's bill is that great. I believe the member might be trying to get a gold star from his leader, because what he is hoping for is that we allow and encourage plastic use in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739860"> I remember the days when I was a member of the Manitoba legislature. The thought at the time was that we encourage people to use fewer plastic bags. We tried to amplify that by talking about how long it takes a plastic bag to disintegrate. Members would be amazed by how long it takes. We are talking many years. The thought was that we should bring in private member's legislation to deal with it, to ban the use of plastic bags, as there are alternatives. I believe I even had support from some Progressive Conservatives. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739861"> There is a huge difference there: Members should not be confused by the current Conservative Reform Party we see opposite. There are Progressive Conservatives in the Conservative caucus today, just not very many of them. It is the progressive-minded ones who are designated to go to the back or leave caucus. However, there are still ideas there that are tangible and will make a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739862">We could google plastic bags and the nuisance and damage they cause to the environment. One of the pictures that come to mind right away is plastic bags in trees that stay there endlessly. When the wind picks up, they get carried into the trees and stay there for a long time. These are the types of things that I believe a vast majority of Canadians are very much sympathetic to. What can we do as a population to improve our economy and our environment?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739863">When we watch some of the nature shows, especially anything dealing with water, we see how plastics are harming our environment in many different ways. I made reference to plastic bags in trees. Do members remember the old plastic rings that would hold a case of pop together? We see fish that have been strangled by this plastic item. If we look at storms that come in from the coast, especially in some countries, we see literally hundreds of yards of plastic being washed ashore. If we look at the type of plastic we see when the water recedes, it is a very serious issue, as is the amount of plastic waste we see when we drive out to rural communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739864"> We see different levels of government as well as citizens trying to contribute to cleaning it all up through recycling programs. There are initiatives we can all take, including looking at ways we can ban certain single-use plastics. There is so much potential in what we can introduce, and I suspect a vast majority of Canadians would support it. However, I do not know to what degree we would get wide support for legislation that takes away from the value of protecting our environment from plastics. It seems to me that this is what this legislation is advocating for, which is consistent with what we see from the Conservative Party, as I said when I started to talk about the price on pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739865"> There was a time when individuals like Erin O'Toole and other Progressive Conservatives saw the value in things like a price on pollution and looking at ways to deal with single-use plastics. That is no more under this particular Conservative Reform Party <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>.

              <ParaText id="8739880"> Madam Speaker, the NDP has a long history of fighting against pollution and climate change.

                <B>Ms. Bonita Zarrillo:</B> Madam Speaker, in 2018, it was my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278703" Type="2">Courtenay—Alberni</Affiliation> who proposed a national strategy against plastic pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739885">I want to thank my colleagues for helping me out on this today. I just had a little trip in the hallway, and it has me a bit flustered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739886">My colleague proposed a national strategy against plastic pollution that was agreed to by all parties but has yet to be implemented by the Liberal government. Thanks to a motion by former MP Megan Leslie, in 2015, plastic microbeads are now banned in consumer products. In addition, Canada has made legally binding international commitments to reducing plastic pollution and to being plastic-free by 2030. This can only be done by advancing policies on plastic, not by tearing them down, which this bill does, but this is the culture of the regressive Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739887">Canada has a responsibility as a rich and developed country to reduce our waste and to be a climate leader on the international stage. We cannot let the regressive Conservatives, kowtowing to the petrochemical industry, set the tone for our international commitments to people. An NDP government would end all public financing and subsidies of petrochemical companies, meaning big oil and gas, that profit from producing more plastics. Corporations that are fuelling the climate crisis and our pollution problem should not be getting rich off their pollution, and they should definitely not be getting government handouts to help them do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739888"> Ending government handouts to fossil fuel companies is something the residents of Port Moody—Coquitlam want. They want their government to take real steps toward putting an end to pollution. They are also concerned about the proliferation of plastics in their lives and in the ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739889">The last NDP MP for my riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam was Fin Donnelly. He stood in the House over six years ago to share that it was Canadians who first proposed World Ocean Day at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. However, over 30 years later, the issues are more overwhelming than ever before. Climate change, plastic pollution, open-net salmon farming, illegal fishing and habitat destruction all need immediate attention. This cannot continue, and that is why New Democrats are moving forward to end plastic pollution. We are not going backwards as the Conservatives continue to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739890">Canadians want their governments to take action, and they are also taking action by organizing beach cleanups, banning plastic bags and saying no to more plastic. It is time the Conservatives also get a climate plan and address this pressing issue, although solutions to pollution and climate change require a belief in science, which the Conservatives do not know much about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739891">It was the Harper government that attacked science and scientists. An investigation by the Information Commissioner of Canada showed that the Harper government muzzled scientists. The investigation came about after a complaint by the University of Victoria's Environmental Law Centre clinic and the advocacy group Democracy Watch. The group submitted a report detailing a series of examples of Harper government officials blocking media access to scientists. In one case, the government scientist was ordered to get permission from the minister of natural resources before he could talk to reporters about a flood that happened 13,000 years ago, even though this research had been published in the journal Nature. Another example is that it took 11 government employees and 50 emails to decide how to answer a reporter's request to interview a Canadian government scientist who was part of a NASA team studying regional snowfall patterns.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739892"> It was shown that most of the muzzling involved scientists researching climate change. We cannot go back to the Conservative era. We know Conservatives do not have a climate plan; they do not believe in reducing fossil fuel emissions to slow down catastrophic climate change. In fact, the Conservatives are trying to reduce the very important climate change discussions down to a dislike of paper straws and coffee cup lids. They are deeply unserious, and they are not up to the challenges of the 21st century. In fact, if they could get their way, they would roll us all back to the years of bench seats in cars with no seat belts and no concerns for the emissions they produce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739893"> That is not the only thing they would roll back. They would roll back women's rights, the pension eligibility age for seniors, climate protection policies, affordable child care, dental care, pharmacare and indigenous sovereignty. We just need to look at what the B.C. Conservatives have already said: Provincially, they would undo commitments to UNDRIP. These are the realities that Canadians would experience with a regressive Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739894"> I want to go back to the oceans. Oceana published a report in 2020 called “Drowning in Plastic”. It shares that Canada introduces millions of tonnes of plastic, and 87% of it ends up in landfills or in the environment. Much of the plastic we discard ends up in the ocean, threatening whales, birds, turtles and all marine life. Canada has a national and global responsibility to stop the damage and do more, not less, to stop this pollution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739895">Unfortunately, doing less is what the Conservatives always do. In the three years the current Parliament has been sitting, they have done nothing for Canadians; the NDP continues to bring about wins for Canadians, such as in housing, child care, anti-scab legislation, dental care and pharmacare.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739896">With that, in closing, I ask for unanimous consent to table, in both official languages, the report I quoted earlier: “Drowning in Plastic” from Oceana Canada, dated September 2020.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739899"> Madam Speaker, the famous movie <I>The Graduate</I> had the well-meaning father-in-law whisper to the young Ben, played by Dustin Hoffman, one word: “plastics”. He said, “There's a great future in plastics.” In fact his advice was on the mark. The 20th century was dominated by plastics, which are light, versatile, inexpensive and inert. There was not a single country on earth that did not use plastics. There was not a human endeavour that did not benefit from this miracle material.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739900">We have reached the point where we carry plastics with us daily. Think how many credit cards we have in our wallet. How about bank notes? How about our phones, our computers, or even our eyeglasses? If someone has had bypass surgery lately, what were the stents made out of? How did we get here? We got here in a car made with a massive amount of plastic. By using plastics in that car, we save more energy and create less pollution than it took to make the plastic in the car in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739901"> Without a doubt, plastics are the miracle material of the 20th century. Will they continue to be the miracle of the 21st century? They will not if the hysterical and ill-informed climate radicals sitting on the NDP and Liberal benches have their way. Their war against plastics is to our detriment. It makes Canada less efficient and less competitive, and as the federal court ruled, banning plastics as toxic was unconstitutional. This is why I am so grateful for the chance today to speak in support of my colleague's initiative. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739902">Bill <Document DbId="12870953" Type="4">C-380</Document> would be an excellent first step in defending a substance with many applications, one that makes modern life possible. Have members ever wondered why we do not find plastic banknotes littering the streets? What insight does that provide into human behaviour? The absence of plastic banknotes littering the streets is indicative of human behaviour and the intrinsic value assigned to certain forms of plastic. When plastic is perceived as valuable, individuals are more likely to dispose of it responsibly, contributing to reduced littering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739903">If we assign a value to plastic instead of viewing it as toxic, the waste problem becomes solvable by market forces. Scrap metal is not a problem, because it has value. People make a part-time job of picking apart appliances at the curbside and make extra money by selling the metal to salvage yards that recycle it. Therefore if there were a market value for old plastics, likely the same would occur with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739904">Canada has the best engineers in the world, and the ones I have spoken to are working on and excited for recycling solutions. Recycling means plastics can be used over and over again without creating more waste, while protecting the health of our people and the safety of our environment. That is a common-sense solution. By establishing a market value for plastics, we incentivize recycling and responsible waste management practices, ultimately mitigating a waste problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739905">Plastics related to food are not just the straws, the forks and the coffee cup lids the NDP-Liberals demonize. Plastics also play a crucial role in food production and preservation. Plastics like films are essential for extending the shelf life of perishable foods, reducing food waste and ensuring food safety during transportation and storage. They enable us to distribute fresh produce globally, maintaining quality and accessibility for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739906">Canada imports over 80% of its fruits and vegetables. The distances travelled to transport this food are enormous. Plastics are indispensable in the agricultural sector, facilitating the transportation and preservation of fresh produce over long distances. Without plastics, we would see significant increases in food prices due to decreased shelf life and increased food waste. Additionally, compromised food safety could pose health risks to consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739907">Unfortunately, positive narratives about plastic recycling often go unnoticed amid sensationalized stories about plastic pollution. It is essential to amplify success stories and recognize the progress made in sustainable plastic management to inspire further action and innovation. For example, there is a small family-owned company in Woodbridge that I toured, Petro Plastics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739908">The company's stewardship initiatives help lead repurposing of plastic film and plastics, recycling roughly 100,000 pounds per month. It works with plastic recyclers in Ontario, and the recycled material is now being used in construction projects like building homes, something else the NDP-Liberal government is failing Canadians on.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739909">There is still work to do in increasing opportunities to recycle. Recycling plastics in specialized sectors like health care presents unique challenges due to stringent safety and regulatory requirements. However, innovative initiatives like the PVC 123 program demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of responsible plastic recycling, contributing to both environmental and economical sustainability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739910">Plastics are ubiquitous in hospitals. In fact they seem essential for health and safety. Plastic PPE is life-saving. Eliminating or restricting plastic in the health care space would come at a devastating cost.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739911">We should focus on optimizing plastic use, implementing recycling programs, and exploring sustainable alternatives where feasible. We know that plastics have become deeply embedded in our daily lives for food packaging and medical equipment, but banning plastics would undoubtedly have far-reaching implications, both economically and socially.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739912"> In Canada, food waste is already a $49.6-billion concern and growing, 60% of which is thought to be avoidable. Considering plastics as toxic and attempting to ban them would add an additional 50% in waste, further exacerbating the problem and driving up costs. The number rises to 150% once we consider the entire supply chain. This is without even going into the 44.2 million in GHG emissions related to food waste, to which banning plastics would add another 22.1 million in GHG emissions. For perspective, this exceeds 8% of total national GHG emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739913"> Environmentalists' targeting plastics leads to regressive outcomes. It shows that they care only about sensationalism and not about substance. Instead of solving problems, they are becoming part of the problem. Chris DeArmitt wrote a fantastic book that sums up the issue perfectly. It is called <I>The Plastics Paradox</I>.

              <ParaText id="8739915">Banning plastics would not solve the problem; it would create more problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739916">In the same Deloitte study that I mentioned earlier, it is estimated that the government's P2 plastics ban would create a $1-billion annual revenue loss for the plastics industry, a 60% increase to packaging costs and up to a 55% increase to operational costs should the agrifood sector lose access to plastic packaging. Fresh produce costs would increase up to 34%, and availability of fresh produce could be cut in half. This would be devastating to every Canadian who buys food, which is every single one of us. It also would mean roughly a $5.6-billion detriment to the Canadian produce industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739917"> Waste concerns are generated from the prediction that bulk packaging would be required to mitigate cost increases to farmers, who are price-takers, leading consumers to dispose of excess goods. Additionally, value-added products like pre-made salads or cut fruit, even fruit and vegetable platters, would no longer be viable without plastic storage, as there are no comparable alternatives readily available. Fresh produce represents less than 3% of the total plastic usage in Canada, and the NDP-Liberals' continued assault against plastics through bans would have a negligible impact on recycling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739918">Once again, let us take the information into consideration as we look to understand why the Federal Court overturned the single-use plastics ban, calling it “unreasonable and unconstitutional”. We should also note that it is saying that there is “no reasonable apprehension that all listed Plastic Manufactured Items (PMIs) are harmful”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739919">While the NDP-Liberals commit to an appeal, Canada's $35-billion plastics industry is not safe. I encourage sharing perspectives on the multi-faceted issue, considering both the challenges and the opportunities that a plastics ban might present. It is evident that while plastic pollution presents a pressing challenge, our focus should be on practical, actionable solutions rather than on radical bans not based in evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739920">We should seek predictability and manageable regulations that foster innovation and incentivize responsible behaviour. By fostering a culture of responsible consumption and waste management supported by clear and consistent regulations, we can make meaningful progress toward a more sustainable future.</ParaText>

It is ignoring the science, common sense, the cost of living crisis it created and the courts, when it tries to ban plastics. The NDP-Liberal government hates the facts on plastics. If Canadians are suffering now with skyrocketing bills, wait until the full ban of plastics is in effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739926">Plastics make modern life affordable, reliable, practical and enjoyable. There are no Canadians left who can say the same about the Liberals. Wet, limp and utterly useless are paper straws, which Canadians are forced to use. They suck. Paper straws have a higher carbon footprint than plastic ones, making them worse for the environment. All the environmentally conscious people on the other side of the aisle, and we are conscious of the environment on this side, should remember that emissions are higher with a paper straw, and paper straws are worse for people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739927">Square this one for me: Canadians are suffering with the high cost of heating right now, which was driven up on purpose by the carbon tax to lower emissions. Although it is not working, that is the Liberals' intent. The same government is banning common consumer goods that have lower emissions than their replacements. The government is driving up emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739928">Someone please make sense of this. Grandma is turning down the heat this winter to lower emissions so the radical left can force Canadians to increase emissions in other parts of their lives. Does this make sense?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739929">It is not just for the environment that paper straws suck; they are worse for our health. The science shows that the chemicals that coat paper products, making them somewhat waterproof, also unfortunately leach chemicals into our food and drink and then ultimately into our body. This is what the NDP-Liberals are forcing Canadians to use instead of plastic straws: an inferior product that is worse for their health. Is that not wacko? What they are doing is completely wacko.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739930">Even as the science shows that the policy would hurt the environment and Canadians' health, it is also bad for Canadians' pocketbook during a cost of living crisis. Paper products cost more money than plastic ones. The ban would also make food more expensive because plastic extends the shelf life of food. That is why plastic-wrapped cucumbers last over two weeks longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739931">Banning plastics would only drive up food costs, sending even more Canadians to the food bank. We know that over two million Canadians have to rely on a food bank because of the situation they find themselves in with the policies from the Liberal-NDP government. Conservatives will stop this soon. Do we want to make things cheaper for Canadians? We need to stop banning more affordable products. What Canadians really want is a ban on banning things, and the courts agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739932">For the millions of Canadians who are thirsty for a common-sense change, dawn is breaking. There is a failing regime that is desperate to attract the most radical environmentalists to its cause. It has gone too far. Common-sense Canadians will soon punish the Liberal government, during a carbon tax election, for ignoring the science, ignoring the facts, ignoring the common sense, ignoring the provinces, ignoring the Constitution and ignoring its citizens. I believe that is why most Canadians are ignoring the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739933">In the end, it is not really about straws that suck or do not suck, or about flat wooden spoons, weird forks or even plastic itself. It is about power and control and about an out-of-control Liberal government that does not want to find practical solutions to problems but wants to virtue-signal for its shallow political interests; that is all the government is about right now. It is using the heavy hand of government to get its way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739934">We need a new government that is about practical solutions and not about feelings and virtue signals. Does the government even care about the garbage in our environment? This is the most infuriating thing for me: There is an issue here, and the government is addressing it with a ban that obviously has had zero effect on our climate and our environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739935">Between 88% and 99% of the garbage in our oceans comes from 10 rivers in the developing world. Instead of the millions of dollars that we have wasted on the ban, what if we took a bit of that money and tried to introduce a waste disposal system in the developing world, which has the 10 rivers that are causing the majority of the problem? That is a common-sense approach: not to ban waste but to manage it, reuse it and ultimately recycle it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8739965"> It is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents and residents of Simcoe North to talk about a very important issue. We are talking about tax relief for Canadians. If government members wanted to provide relief to Canadians, they would have done it in an easy way. They would have taken the GST off of everything. They would have made it administratively simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739966">The Liberals want to talk about how in the previous election campaign, the Conservative leader at the time and the Conservative Party campaigned on a cut. They are trying to say this is the exact same cut the Conservatives ran on in the 2021 campaign. That is false. The Conservatives ran on a one-month GST holiday on everything: on fuel, on food, on every single item GST is charged on. That is not the same plan the government is proposing here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739967">We should also talk about control. This is yet another example of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wanting to control our lives. He wants to give us a tax break, but only on the things he agrees we should get that tax break on. Let us go through the list. If I want to buy a hard copy of the Toronto Star, that counts for the tax break, but if I want to buy the renowned magazine The Walrus, I still have to pay GST. Christmas trees are on the list, thank God, but not decorations. I cannot buy that star to put on the top of the tree to get that tax break. I cannot buy that wreath to hang on the door to get that tax break. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739968">Jigsaw puzzles are on the list. I can spend three weeks hiding out, putting that 1,000-piece puzzle together, but if I want to build something in my garage and use a jigsaw, I do not get the tax break on that. If I want to put my feet up and have a Coors Light, it is under 7% so there is no GST, but if I want to have a Boneshaker, at 7.1%, from Amsterdam Brewery, it is not going to be on the list. Maybe someone wants to go and talk to the Kingston brewery that makes Oats &amp; Cream IPA, which has over 7% alcohol. It is not on the list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739969">Let us talk about some other things: candy and snacks. Why on earth would a government specifically single out sugar for a tax break, when many stakeholders, like Diabetes Canada, the Heart and Stroke Foundation, and the Canadian Cancer Society, have been promoting a special sugar tax? I do not think they are too happy with this tax break. Also, the Canadian Cancer Society came out publicly and said the government should not be taking tax off of alcohol.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739970"> Why are the Liberals picking and choosing these special things we might put in our grocery carts? Some are in and some are out. It is absurd. It is a list that only pointy heads in some government agency or department could put together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739971"> I was at a local restaurant last night, a wonderfully run restaurant, and the proprietor said, “I do not even know how these rules are supposed to work. I called the GST line at CRA, and they did not even know how they are supposed to work. What if I am selling tickets to a party that has food and beverages, but some of the spirits do not have the the tax break and some do, and I am selling food, and I am selling those tickets today for a party that happens on New Year's? Do I charge the HST on those tickets today?” It is unclear. It is completely absurd.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739972"> The government should have either taken the tax off of everything or left it on everything. That is not to mention that we are in a deficit position. If the government had said it was going to spend $2 billion on this, and this is where it found the savings to pay for it, maybe that would have been a different conversation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8739973">Let us talk about the NDP. A previous principled NDP stood in this place and decried, absolutely criticized, reducing the GST. Why is that? NDP members criticized reducing the GST because, as I will quote from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which the NDP likes to quote very often in the House, imagine a tax cut that you only get when you buy stuff. In relation to GST cuts in a previous government, it said that this was a tax cut that disproportionately favoured high-income families. For every dollar of this tax cut received by low-income families, $3 went to families who were not low income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739974">What could the government have done? The government could have just doubled the GST credit, which, by the way, had the support of all major parties in the House just two years ago. Every party in the House agreed to increase the GST rebate cheque that goes to low-income households. Eleven million people would have doubled up on the payment that they got. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739975">We believe that we should help the lowest-income people possible, but this is not a measure targeted to low-income people. This measure goes to every single Canadian, whether they need it or not. It is costly to administer and it is also costly to the treasury. The government is already in a deficit position. It could have come up with a dollar-for-dollar rule, to say that this is how it is going to pay for it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739976"> Let us also remember, just two weeks ago, that the Governor of the Bank of Canada said, “The fight against inflation is not over”. When a government runs deficits, that is fiscal stimulus. The Governor of the Bank of Canada also said, almost two years ago, that if you want to help people with the effects of inflation, or those that have a problem with affordability, those measures should be very targeted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739977"> It would have been very targeted to give an additional doubling of the GST/HST credit that low-income individuals have. It would have only gone to 11 million people. It would have reduced the overall cost. It would have been administratively very easy to deliver. We would have just doubled the payment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739978">By the way, when we talk about the cheques that will be going out, guess what? The people in this chamber get the cheques. Why on earth would they design a program to give cheques to members of Parliament when there are low-income people who do not work, like seniors who do not work or people with disabilities who do not work, who get nothing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739979">It makes absolutely no sense. Not only that, economists said, just two weeks ago, before this announcement, that the Bank of Canada was on track to reduce the interest rates by 50 basis points. Those same economists now say that the Bank of Canada cannot reduce as much. It might only reduce by 25 basis points or hold interest rates steady.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8739980">That means that when politicians spend, Canadians pay more for their mortgages. Conservatives are for permanent tax reductions, shrinking the size of the deficit and making sure that Canadians have more money in their pockets long term.</ParaText>

I have been sitting here, for 10 minutes, listening to a Conservative member talk about taking care of the most vulnerable people in our community like he somehow cares. Are we kidding? He is trying to lecture us on giving supports for the most vulnerable in our communities. He has voted against every single measure. His former government, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, told seniors that they had to work two more years before they could retire. On every measure we brought along, lowering the tax on the middle class, increasing OAS, increasing GIS, he voted against and his party voted against.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740001"> I am thankful for the opportunity today to debate Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740002"> The past few years have been challenging. It feels like the price of everything has gone up, thanks to global inflation and the need for central banks all over the world to raise interest rates in response to the after-effects of a once-in-a-generation global pandemic. While inflation has cooled and interest rates are dropping, we know that Canadians are not feeling that in their household budgets quite yet. Our government obviously cannot set prices at the checkout, but we can leave Canadians with more money in their pocket to help them afford the things they need and save for the things they want, which is where the measures in Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document> come into effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740003"> Starting December 14, we are proposing to give a tax break to all Canadians. With a GST/HST exemption across the country, Canadians would be able to buy things like prepared foods, snacks, kids' clothing, Christmas trees, books, puzzles and other children's toys, all tax-free. Lasting until February 15, 2025, this tax break would essentially make all food GST/HST-free and would deliver meaningful savings for Canadians with real relief at the cash register. This relief is about saying to Canadians: “Yes, things have been hard, but they are going to get better.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740004"> Inflation was at 2% in October, which means that inflation has been within the Bank of Canada's target range all year long. The bank has cut interest rates four times now this year. Our economy looks like it is having a soft landing from a COVID recession. We are providing this new support for Canadians who have really gotten our country through a tough time. We are counting on powering a very strong recovery at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740005">This new support is about making life a little bit easier at this time of year when costs are highest, because we have the space now to do it. With good economic news, and I just mentioned inflation cooling and interest rates dropping, we are able to do so in a way that is not going to stimulate inflation, but rather is going to help make ends meet and continue our economic growth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740006">Canada has one of the strongest balance sheets in the world, and the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. We have a strong fiscal position, and we are putting it to work to support Canadians with our temporary GST/HST relief. This can also help sustain the pace of our economic recovery. For example, consumer spending per capita has remained somewhat subdued, reflecting a lowering of household purchasing power due to higher inflation, elevated shelter costs and the impact of high interest rates over the past two years. Thankfully, inflation has cooled, interest rates are coming down and our government is delivering a plan to make housing more affordable. However, with some heightened global economic uncertainty, we have witnessed consumers and businesses adopting a more cautious approach when it comes to spending. We all know that the effects of lower interest rates can take time to be felt throughout the economy and make their way to impacting the pocketbooks of everyday Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740007">Really, the Canadian economy has been operating below its potential capacity for over a year. This has largely been by design, as excess supply has put downward pressure on inflation, and as the monetary policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and other central banks around the world have done their job to stabilize inflation. Rather than reignite inflation, this time the GST relief would simply help Canadians to bridge that gap. It would build on actions that are already saving families and individuals thousands of dollars a year, like the Canada-wide $10-a-day child care system, which has already cut fees for regulated child care to an average of $10 a day or less in over half of all provinces and territories and by 50% or more in all the others. The Canadian dental care plan and the national school food program are saving Canadians hundreds of dollars a year, especially for those Canadians who are least able to carry the costs associated with those expenses. The Canada child benefit continues to lift children out of poverty, and then the Canada workers benefit provides a meaningful boost to our lowest-paid and often most essential workers. These are just a few of the ways that our government is already supporting Canadians, making everyday items cost less and putting more money back into middle-class pockets.</ParaText>

It would immediately give from 5% to 12% relief, depending on the province. That is, consumers will pay less when they go to the till, so the relief would be immediate. It will carry forward into the new year, but there is nothing about the new year itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740012">I think the misrepresentations about the carbon rebate have been misleading. The last time the House heard about carbon, gas prices went down.

Global inflation is, by definition, a world phenomenon that has impacted the middle class and lower-income populations in particular, and we see that effect in Canada, too. The past few years have been very difficult for Canadians. They have counted on a federal government that has been there, that has seen them through the most difficult years of the pandemic and that has put in place landmark policy, groundbreaking policy, that is intended and is having the effect of helping make everyday costs more affordable.</ParaText>

The only difference is that Brian Mulroney and his government were an example of a Progressive Conservative government. They tried to put in place a national child care program at that time, but because of political reasons, it did not work out. Certainly, former prime minister Martin and people like Ken Dryden attempted as well. Also for political reasons, that did not work out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740029">This government was able to get it done. We see that in excess of 110,000 women have been able to re-enter the workforce now because of a child care program that is affordable. In fact, the economist Jim Stanford says that over the next 10 years, he expects 1 million women to be able to re-enter the workforce because child care is now going to be so affordable in this country. It turns out that social policy is good economic policy. This is something Conservatives have never, unfortunately, understood.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740030">There is the school food program to make sure kids are able to go to school and have some food in their bellies, that they have what they need to succeed as children. We are ensuring we have that fundamental basis of dignity to make sure kids in this country have what they need to succeed. That is not asking for too much. In fact, Canada is one of the advanced democracies that has come to this late, unfortunately. It was the government, working with other interested parties in the House of Commons, making sure we were standing by our constituents the whole way. That is now moving forward to ensure elementary schools and high schools will have the opportunity to offer hot meals to kids, whether it is breakfast programs, lunch programs or whatever the case might be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740031">We do have examples of that in Canada, but it is a patchwork quilt. It has been volunteer organizations that have offered it in the main. Here, we have a federal government that is going to fund that work. This is tremendously important for our future as well. We have put in place these measures, but we still see challenges. While inflation has come back to normal levels because of the financial stewardship of the government, we have to make sure that we continue to be there for Canadians who are faced with a difficult time when it comes to the cost of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740032">I hear it from my constituents. We all do. When they go to the grocery store, it is difficult. When they go to purchase clothes for their kids, it can be difficult. When they want to go eat out, whether it is just as an individual or as a family, it can be difficult. If we go out to an average family restaurant, as a family of four, that bill is going to be a high one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740033">The federal government has recognized that people are going through these challenges, so it has put forward a tax break, a tax cut. This is something Conservatives talk about a lot. However, today we saw the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> announcing, in a declarative tone, which he seemed to be very proud of, that they are not going to support this measure of lifting GST/HST for the period starting on December 14 and continuing past Valentine's Day, ending on February 15.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740034">The Conservatives are in a party that says it is for the everyday person, apparently. It is a party that says, only apparently, that it stands for tax cutting. No, it does not. In fact, we should not be too surprised at all, because when this government moved ahead not once but twice to cut taxes for the middle class, who stood against it? The Conservatives did. When this government moved ahead and cut taxes for small businesses, who stood in the way? The Conservatives did. However, we were still able to get those measures through. When we were able to, in the pandemic years, stand by small businesses to make sure they had the emergency supports they needed, who stood in the way there too? The Conservatives did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740035"> They do it every single time. They present this mirage, a kind of fiction, that they are there for the everyday person, whether it is the worker, the family or the small business owner, but they do not believe in those things, as it turns out. What we have in the House of Commons that really shows what we are all about is our vote. The vote does the talking every single time, and the Conservatives' votes are where the proof in the pudding is. There is not much proof there; there really is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740036">We have a measure that would go a long way for everyday people, for people in the middle class and for people working hard to join the middle class. In question period today, I talked about a young family, and I am a relatively new father myself. Child seats are expensive things, running into hundreds of dollars. We are going to lift the tax on them. I think of what that would mean for the young couple getting ready to start a family. It is expensive. They have to worry about all of the essentials and pay tax on top of that, but we would lift the tax on, for example, child seats, diapers and children's clothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740037">Those are just examples that pertain to a young family. What about a family that wants to spend more time together, maybe take a bit of a load off, go out and enjoy a restaurant? The tax would be lifted there too. Who benefits? It is not just that family but entrepreneurs, who continue to be the backbone of this country's economy. That is something this government recognizes and something that parties in the House that will support this measure recognize.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740038"> I just heard my colleague from the Green Party say that he is onside with this. That is a very good thing. I know that NDP members have said they are onside with this, but I wonder where the Conservatives are on this, the so-called party of entrepreneurship and free enterprise. I want the Conservatives to go back and look at what Restaurants Canada has said. It said in a very clear statement that not supporting a measure like this would be irresponsible, because a measure like this would not just be good for families, as I said, for individuals and for businesses, but would also act as an economic stimulus during challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740039">We have weathered the storm quite well. We still see historically low, at least relatively, unemployment rates in this country, just in excess of 6%, but that has come down significantly in the past few years. We see a AAA credit rating. We see the lowest debt and deficit in the entire G7, and Canada, according to the International Monetary Fund, is poised to lead economic growth in the coming years in the G7. I know my Conservative friends are not in the habit of quoting what they call “elite organizations”, but I think the views of the IMF should be taken seriously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740040">The economic fundamentals are quite strong. That puts those in the middle class and those with a lower income on a good footing for a good future, but they need this support right now in the immediate. That is why the government is seized with this kind of vision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740041"> We are going to continue to be there for Canadians every step of the way, for my constituents in London and for constituents across the country. The Conservatives still have some time. I just hope they reverse their decision on this and stand up for a responsible vision. This policy is responsible. They should stand up for the idea that they have to be on the side of the people and have their backs during tough times. That is exactly what we are going to continue to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740060">In the past 24 hours, we have seen the tired, weak and desperate Liberals use closure and programming motions to avoid accountability for their scandals and to attempt to distract Canadians with their temporary, two-month tax trick. What is interesting about Motion No. 43 is that it is a guillotine motion that has itself been guillotined by a guillotine motion. This is a motion that would introduce closure on a motion that is about closure and stopping debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740061">Here we are this evening debating Motion No. 43. I want to say that Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document> was written on the back of a cocktail napkin, but it seems more appropriately to say the bill was written on an Etch A Sketch. The Liberals have taken it, shaken it and changed it a few times to try to get the NDP on board, and no one knows exactly what the next shake will do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740062">The <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> has shut down debate on not one but two matters of privilege today so that the Liberals can force through their temporary, short-sighted tax trick legislation. The problem is that the Liberals are afraid of the Canadian people. They know that their parliamentary calendar is slipping away and that the days they have left to bring legislation before the House of Commons are limited. They know that a strong, common-sense Conservative government is on the horizon. When our common-sense Conservative Party takes power after a carbon tax election, we will be able to deliver for the hard-working Canadians we have the honour of representing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740063">We know the Liberal government has allowed its entire legislative agenda to be paralyzed. Why is the House paralyzed from considering all other pieces of legislation? It is because the Liberals violated an order of the House of Commons from June 10 wherein they were required to table documents with the clerk so they could be turned over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This begs the question: What is so damning in those documents that the Liberals would shut down Parliament for two months to prevent the Mounties from getting them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740064">What does this programming motion today actually do? It shuts down debate on Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document>. In the House, there are 338 seats, yet all but five of the hon. members who sit in those seats will be prevented from debating this piece of legislation. Billions of dollars of spending will not be debated in the House because of this programming motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740065">Even more egregious is that the Liberal programming motion means the temporary tax trick bill would skip the committee process altogether. This means it would not go to the finance committee so we could hear from experts. It would not go to the finance committee so we could hear from the Canadians who will be affected by the bill. It would not go to the finance committee so we could hear from the small businesses and small business workers who would be affected. There would not be an opportunity to make amendments to this piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740066">No sensible legislative body ought to agree to this process outside of an emergency situation. Let us be clear: Plummeting Liberal poll numbers may seem like an emergency to the Liberal government, but it is not an emergency for the Canadian people, who we have the great honour of representing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740067">If we read this programming motion, this guillotine motion, it has the wording “deemed requested, “deemed referred”, “deemed considered”, “deemed reported”, “deemed concurred in” and “deemed read a third time and passed”. It is as lazy as it is reckless. This programming motion is not democratic. In fact, it is an affront to transparency and Canadian democracy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740068">Why is the Liberal government doing this? Why would the Liberals bring forward this temporary tax trick at this time? It is because it is a distraction from the other scandals that they are involved in. There is the ArriveCAN scandal, in which two guys in a basement were paid millions of dollars for no actual IT work. There is the $400-million Liberal green slush fund, which is currently under consideration in the House as a matter of privilege. There is the ever-evolving scandal around the disgraced former minister of employment, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, who falsely claimed indigenous status in order to gain contracts from the Liberal government; this has also led to its own question of privilege. The misconduct and ethical lapses of the Liberal government are outright disgraceful. Finally, last week, after weeks of opposition members' demanding action, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> stepped down from the Liberal cabinet. However, I can assure members that the good people of Edmonton Centre are watching. I know that, after the next election, they will remove him as the member of Parliament for that riding so that a common-sense Conservative member can represent those fine people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740069"> What happened right after the member quit being in cabinet? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> obviously took to Google and typed in “ways to distract Canadians”. They came up with this new temporary tax trick. The Prime Minister may have been googling it at the Taylor Swift concert as he kept changing different ways of doing that. However, Canadians do not just see this as bad vibes, as might be noted, but as a real challenge for going forward and for their livelihoods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740070">As I know many colleagues on this side of the House do, I talk regularly with local constituents and local small business owners. These small business owners may have one, two, three or four employees. They put in long hours, late into the night, and they are up early in the morning before the sun rises in order to build a business for themselves, for their families and for their communities. While I have been speaking with local businesses over the last few days, they have told me of their real concerns about the impact this temporary tax trick will have on their businesses, on their point of sale and their computer systems. They will have to shoulder the costs of updating those systems for December 14 and then again on February 15, which is Flag Day in Canada, and they are going to have to bear those costs. They are also concerned about the potential for audits down the way for incorrectly applying these new rules, albeit through no fault of their own. What is more, because this falls over the new year, it is two fiscal years for most businesses, and so they would have the double challenge of being audited twice for the challenges of this program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740071">I have received a number of emails, and I will read one from a small business owner, who wrote that the “Federal government DOES NOTHING but expects us to eat the cost of trying to Make the Federal government look good” and “we then must do more work to turn all of this off in February”. He concluded, “[S]orry if I'm not very supportive of this very badly thought-out policy.” That is from a small business owner who is expressing the concerns that so many of us have heard about how this program was brought about. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740072">Let us talk again about the temporary nature of this program. It goes until February 15. What happens about six weeks after that? First, the escalator tax on wine, beer and spirits goes up automatically. Even worse, on the Liberals' way to quadrupling the carbon tax on April 1, we will once again see the carbon tax rise on the way to costing 61¢ per litre. This is simply unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740073">This policy is poorly thought out. We should not have been at this point in Parliament, with the Liberals so desperate to implement a temporary tax trick to try to distract Canadians from their poor record as a government. The Liberals have made the House unworkable. This is not the policy that we should be going forward with. We should be having a carbon tax election so that Canadians can make the decision that they want to see a strong, common-sense Conservative government after the next election. </ParaText>

The people I talk to who are having trouble and challenges finding a place to live that is in their price range will benefit from that, and it will spur growth in our communities, be helpful for the economy and ensure that the cost of living goes down for Canadians.</ParaText>

Then there is the $15 tip. If the government removes the GST on restaurant meals, this family will save $5. Will that really make a difference? Will that really make it possible for an average family with financial difficulties to go to a restaurant, or is the government just blowing smoke?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8740084"> Madam Speaker, it is an honour to join in this debate tonight. A desperate government makes a transparent attempt to distract Canadians, Canadians who have been suffering. I listen to constituents in my riding of Fundy Royal, where individuals and families are struggling to make ends meet. They are struggling to put food on the table, to pay their mortgages and to pay their heating bills. Why is that? It has something to do with a government that has doubled the cost of a mortgage, doubled the cost of rent and increased the cost of groceries. Every April 1, by increasing the carbon tax, the government is also piling on new costs for people to drive their kids to a hockey game or to get themselves to work. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740085">The government offers up what amounts to a tax trick after piling all these costs on Canadians, after making it so difficult for hard-working Canadians. I include small businesses in this, which I am going to speak about shortly. If it was not so serious, if people were not hurting so much, it would be laughable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740086">Who would think of an idea to lift the GST off a Christmas tree but only if someone buys the Christmas tree December 15. If they buy it before then, they do not get the break. This is just a small example of the kind of complication this is going to add and the misery this is going to pile on small businesses at what is sometimes their most challenging time of year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740087">Today I had the opportunity to speak to an individual at a small business in my riding of Fundy Royal. It is in a small community. Small businesses in my riding are the backbone of our community. They give back so much. They are the ones coaching and providing support to charities in the region. They are the ones helping out those who need a hand and providing employment in small communities. This individual, with desperation in her voice, was telling me that, after everything they had gone through with the pandemic, after barely hanging on, she cannot implement this change the government has brought in. At her busiest time of year, she does not have the resources to change all her systems over to accommodate what the government has just dumped in her lap. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740088">Any one of us would struggle to decipher what the government is doing. The CRA, which is ever so helpful, has come out with some guidelines, and we need to take a look at them. Exempt now for two months from the GST are toys that “[i]mitate another item, whether real or imaginary” or “[i]nvolve building, creating or assembling structures, objects or models by using pieces, parts, materials or modelling compound”. Okay, that makes some sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740089">However, not exempt are “[t]oys and model sets that are marketed for adults (for example, adult Lego or train sets)”. How is the small business owner in my riding supposed to decipher those things? The CRA directive on what qualifies as a toy includes this: “Card games, including playing cards and Pokémon cards”. A Pokémon card is eligible for this two-month reprieve. However, if someone buys their kids hockey cards, that is not eligible for the exemption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740090">Physical video games will be tax-free. When I was growing up, we finally got the opportunity to get an Atari because someone else had bought a Nintendo. It played physical games. When someone else got a Super Nintendo and I got a Nintendo, again, this played physical games. However, young people are now downloading video games. They are not buying physical games. According to the CRA, thanks to what the government has done, physical video games qualify, but online-only and downloadable video games are not included. I can assure everyone that the people on that side of the House, the Liberal government members, do not understand the confusion they have just wrought; Canadians are certainly not going to understand it. The person who will be responsible for all this will be the small business owner.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740091">The individual I spoke to today told me how horrified she is that, in trying to interpret this mess, she will be on the hook and that CRA and the government will be coming after her if she gets it wrong and charges GST where she was not supposed to or exempts it when she was not supposed to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740092"> Let us talk about children's clothing and footwear. “Sports clothing, dancewear, such as jerseys, ski jackets, leotards and dual-purpose swimwear that can reasonably be worn outside of sports or dance activities” are exempt. However, “Specialized clothing and footwear designed exclusively for sports or [those same] recreational activities” are not exempt. “Adult clothing and footwear...if it's purchased for a child”, so if someone buys clothing for a child, but it happens to be adult size, again, are not exempt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740093">It goes on when we are talking about physical books. They say on the other side that physical books are tax-free. Okay, that is simple enough to me, but now look at how the CRA helpfully explains that. “Guidebooks and atlases that do not mostly contain street or road maps” are exempt so if they do contain mostly street or road maps, they are not exempt. “Magazines and periodicals (that have no more than 5% of their printed space devoted to advertising)” are exempt, so for the entrepreneur in my riding who owns her business, who has to do all the accounting, if she sells a magazine that has 6% advertising, then it is not exempt, but if it is 5% advertising it is exempt. How is she, at the busiest time of year, supposed to decipher this mess?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740094">The Liberals tell us that books are tax-free; however, “Colouring books, scrapbooks, sticker books, sketchbooks”; “Books designed primarily for writing on, such as address books, diaries, journals, and notebooks”; “Certain directories and collections of street or road maps”; e-books and audio books are not GST-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740095">That is just a short example that just scratches the surface. I guarantee no one in here understands what I just said, and the individuals in my riding who are trying to run a small business should not be expected to have to deal with this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740096">At a time when people are suffering, on this side of the House we are offering actual help; we are offering to axe the carbon tax that has increased the cost of everything for my constituents who are seniors, have young families, are entrepreneurs or are farmers. The carbon tax has increased the cost of heating their home, driving to work and taking their kids to hockey. The government has increased the cost of food because it is taxing farmers, truckers and everyone along the supply chain who puts food on a family's table. In Canada, our food cost increase has outpaced the U.S. by 36%. What is the difference between us and the U.S. right now? We have a carbon tax and they do not. Canadian families suffer from the misguided policies of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740097">According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, “Only 4% of small business owners believe they will have stronger sales as a result” of these temporary measures. However, they go on to say that “small firms”, perhaps like the constituent I was talking to today, will face approximately “$1,000 in additional costs to reprogram their point-of-sale system to remove and then reinstate” applicable taxes. I think in some cases that $1,000 may be underestimated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740098">A constituent of mine, who is a business owner, wrote to me today, “The GST holiday is crazy. To take the GST off takeout, restaurant, alcohol and, considering the fresh, healthy groceries don't have the tax...is only taking taxes off less healthy junk food options.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740099">My constituents get it, small business gets it and we on this side of the House get it. We are going to provide real tax relief for Canadians by axing the tax and we are going to stand up against the Liberal government's gimmicks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740117"> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the member. It has been a long day in the House of Commons. Yes, I know Erin O'Toole was never the prime minister, but he was the leader of the Conservative Party. When Erin O'Toole was the leader of the Conservative Party back in the fall of 2021, when inflation was over 4%, he recommended a GST holiday in Canada to provide some tax relief to Canadians. That was bad timing. It was terrible timing, in fact, because inflation was going like this. It was 4.1% in the summer of 2022 and It went up to 8%. When inflation is on the rise, it is not a good time to do these types of measures. However, right now, inflation is on its way down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740118">This is good news for Canadians. We need to find ways to stimulate our economy and provide relief and affordability measures. That is why, over the last couple of years, through our economic measures and the hard work of Canadians, our policies have all reversed and reduced inflation in Canada faster than other countries have achieved that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740119">I had a meeting recently with somebody from Australia, and they were talking about how they have not seen an interest rate cut, and inflation is still quite high. Inflation is persistent in some places around the world, but our economy is recovering from the COVID economic downturn here in Canada. I want to credit Canadians with that. I want to acknowledge that a lot of our economic policies have created the terrain for that change, but this is really good. The inflation situation has abated a bit and that means it is a good time for this. This is a timely measure, supporting our economic recovery with a responsible affordability measure for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740120"> Our economy is actually recovering better than anticipated. Canada is in really good shape economically and fiscally. The Conservatives want to suggest everything is broken in Canada, but I will not tolerate that. Canada is the best country in the world to live in. It is a great country. We are strong. We are economically durable through these challenges. We endured the economic downturn of 2009 quite effectively, and we did this one too, and that is because of the hard work of Canadians, because we have a good regulated banking system and because we are used to challenges in Canada. When the snow falls, we get outside with our shovels and we shovel our neighbours' driveways. We do not sit around and complain and say everything is broken, because it is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740121">All that work, the perseverance of Canadians, has paid off and we can afford nice things. We can afford to do nice things for Canadians right now because of the expediency with which our economic recovery has taken place. We have been through a lot over the last couple of years. I know the Conservatives want to heckle me and they want to suggest Canada is not in great shape, but I will not tolerate that. Canada is the best country in the world and Canada is in great shape because of the hard work of Canadians, not because of complainers, not because of people sitting in the back rows complaining, providing no solutions to anybody's problems but just barking, yelling and screaming about how everything is broken, because it is not.

The irony and the hypocrisy are not lost on me, but it is also ironic that the Conservatives like to consider themselves the economic stewards, the stewards of the economic purse. That is absolute horse crap. It is not true. That is clear because at a time when inflation was going up, they wanted to do a GST cut, and now that inflation has abated and is on its way down, they do not. That is just basic Economics 101.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740125">The Conservatives have demonstrated time and time again that they do not know how to manage an economy. It was clear when Harper was the prime minister. It was clear when the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation> was their failed leader. They always put forward economic policies that will not help Canadians, but this will. A two-month break on GST and HST between the Christmas holidays and Valentine's Day is going to help Canadians. We are going to give them a little bit of a break because they deserve it, because they have worked really hard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740126">A lot of Canadians right now do not feel like their hard work is paying off. It is a really challenging thing to go into work every day, similar to going to the gym, and not see that work paying off. We want to see the hard work that Canadians are putting forward pay off. We want to make sure they have a great holiday. If that means they want to go out to dinner with their family and their friends, 13% off of that bill is going to help. Restaurants Canada has come out and said this is great and we will see more people in restaurants. They are going to see a bit of a bump. That is something our economy could use right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740127">As the holiday season approaches, a time when people spend a little more on quality time, with some time off from school or work, whether they are sharing meals with loved ones, buying gifts for the kids or just ordering some takeout and chilling out, they deserve a break and our government is there for them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740128">Canadians deserve this quality time, after the tough years they have been through. Our goal with this bill is to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from it. As the holiday season draws near, people need a helping hand. We want to give them that help. In fact, we are giving them two helping hands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740129">First, there is the tax holiday for all Canadians. In concrete terms, what we are proposing is a nationwide exemption from the GST and HST on certain products. It would start on December 14 and last two months. That would mean not paying tax on the purchase of clothing, shoes, children's toys, diapers, prepared foods and snacks. There would also be no tax on restaurant meals, beer, wine and Christmas trees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740130">The purpose of this tax break is to make the holiday season more affordable, especially for families who find this time of year difficult because of the extra expenses that come with it. The GST and HST holiday will make the holiday season more enjoyable for these families. That is the first helping hand, which is included in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740131">The second helping hand we are proposing is a $250 rebate for millions of Canadians. We will have time to debate that rebate in due course. The tax holiday is what is more pressing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740132">We know that the holiday season is the most expensive time of year for Canadians and that the new year does not always get off to a good start once people have paid off all the holiday spending.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8740133">I would also like to point out that we, as a country, can afford to offer this help to Canadians. Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is well below that of our G7 peers. The Conservatives suggest Canada has a balance sheet they would like to change. We all want to make sure that we are paying down our debt, that our debt-to-GDP ratio is going down and that our deficit is reduced, but the Conservatives did not do that when they were in power. Mr. Harper saw inflationary deficits and added to our debt without experiencing a global pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740134">Liberals are good stewards of the Canadian economy, and our recovery is evidence of that. We are one of only two G7 nations with a AAA rating by at least two of the three major global credit rating agencies. That is good news for Canadians. This has been achieved through a responsible economic plan that has put Canada in a really strong fiscal position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740135">It is also time to put that to work for Canadians. Removing the GST from these qualifying goods for two months will provide an estimated $1.6 billion in federal tax relief. That means $1.6 billion is going to stay in the pockets of the people who earned that money, Canadians, hard-working Canadian families. When they earn that money, it is their money. They will not be spending that money on taxes on goods, and we should debate in the House whether these are things that should ever be taxed, like prepared food in grocery stores or diapers, whether for babies or for adults. That is a debatable topic. We should talk about whether or not those are essential items and perhaps this bill will provide us the opportunity to talk about some of those things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740136">Budget 2024 removed the GST on psychotherapy and mental health counselling. That was a good move. We should have done that, and we did it. It is a breath of fresh air to talk about a bill like this in the House of Commons. It is a good opportunity to discuss those and more issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740153">Quebeckers and Canadians have been asking for tax relief for many years, and we recognize that. However, people want permanent relief, not this temporary relief for just two months. If it is not permanent, it should at least be long-term. This measure offers only a two-month break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740154">The measure proposed by the government and supported by the NDP does not meet public expectations in many respects. To illustrate that, I want to go over the bill briefly, even though all my colleagues have already done so and pointed out certain inconsistencies. I will explain why this measure is aimed at the wrong people. This measure will also be very costly for business owners. In the end, it may be much less beneficial than some people think, not only for the poor, but also for the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740155">The bill provides for a GST exemption or holiday. In Quebec, by the way, the GST amounts to 5%. In other words, there would be a $5 discount on every $100 in taxable purchases. At the grocery store, clients who limit their purchases to staples like bread, milk, eggs, vegetables, fruit, flour, sugar and meat would not have picked up any taxable items. That means they would have saved no money on any of their purchases. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="278284" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> pointed out earlier, when someone buys ready-made sandwiches or roast chicken instead of preparing their food at home, they will save a few pennies, because these items are taxable. However, unless they buy $200 worth of roast chicken or $200 worth of sandwiches, they will save only pennies. Since people rarely buy $200 worth of sandwiches, this person will save just a few cents on their groceries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740156">The bill includes alcohol, candy and video game cartridges. Physical video games are included, but, I assume, not video games bought online. We have to read between the lines. There is no mention of sports equipment, aside from balls. Books are covered, which is good. However, there are a number of restrictions when it comes to books. There cannot be too many maps or too much advertising. There cannot be this or that. It will be a nightmare for retailers. Parents will find it hard to know which books they can buy without paying the GST.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740157">Then there is the list of toys. In fact, it is more like a description of eligible toys. It is like the government asked all of its employees to go to a department store that sells toys and describe each and every one of them without actually naming them. Those are the descriptions. Retailers and parents will probably be wondering whether a toy is taxed or not. They will wonder if they will save $1 on a $50 toy. Actually, let me recalculate: They will save $2.50 on a $50 toy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740158">We are also talking about clothing for children under the age of 14. That is something that I mentioned in one of my questions. I am five foot four, which is fairly normal. My husband is five foot nine, even though he claims to be five foot ten. That is fairly normal too. We are very normal, or so we hope. However, our youngest son is 14 years old and wears a size 9 shoe. He wears pants with a 32-inch waist and 32-inch inseam, so he does not fit into the category of children under 14, according to the definition. I will not even talk about the oldest of my three sons. When he was 14, he was nearly six feet tall and wore a size 14 shoe. For him, it is very clear. If he were 14 right now, he would definitely not meet that definition. There may be a bit of an issue with the definitions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740159">As I was saying earlier, we need to think about the fact that we are talking about essential products. During the holiday season, I can understand wanting to buy a bag of chips, especially since they are often two for $9.50. I would not buy them a few years ago because they were too expensive. A few years ago, I would not buy them because they were too expensive, at two for $5. Now they are two for $9.50. It is nice to be able to afford a little treat when you cannot usually afford it. It is nice when a bag of chips or a bag of candy, whatever it is, becomes the treat of the month. That is great. However, 5% off $9.50 is about 25¢ off the big treat of the month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740160">Furthermore, when people are struggling financially, they do not think about dining out. As I explained earlier, instead of spending $100 at a restaurant, plus $5 GST, plus $10 Quebec sales tax, plus $15 tip, which is a minimum, a family of four in financial difficulty will go to the grocery store with that $130. They will not go to a restaurant. As long as they only get $5 off $130, they will head to the grocery store and have a nice meal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740161">I invite folks to look at their grocery receipt to see how much tax they pay. If they have bought household goods and, yes, diapers, it will bee a few dollars. Actually, I do not understand why diapers and feminine hygiene products are taxed. Those things should never be taxed. In Quebec, total sales tax is 15%. Divide that by three to see what the GST savings will be. It is not very much. People will save a few cents on groceries a week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740162">Getting back to the bill, it would allow people to save the GST on catering. To be honest, ordinary people do not hire caterers, especially not if they are struggling financially. For the most part, this measure will help people with money. It will help people who already have money save even more money. They will save $50 in GST on a $1,000 catering bill. That means someone who can afford something that costs $1,000 will be able to save much more than someone who saves 25¢ on their grocery bill or a bag of candy, yet the person saving 25¢ is the one who needs it most. This measure is not targeting the right people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740163">There has been a lot of talk about business owners. Earlier, there was one member who mocked people, saying that 30 years ago, prices used to change every week. Yes, prices used to change every week 30 years ago because all we had to do was turn the dial on a little machine and re-label the products. Then computers came along, but they were often the 1980-88 models with the spinach-green screens. That was not the same level of programming at all. I used to work at grocery stores back then. I know how much time it could take. Then there are the extra costs. There is the cost of the time it will take to check the inventory, to determine what is taxable and what is not. Reprogramming will also cost thousands of dollars. In Quebec, there is the cost of administering the collection of the GST. This is going to be complicated, and there is nothing in the bill to support Quebec and the provinces, which will have to deal with the chaos that will be unleashed for two months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740164">To close, when I look at this, I see some things that are good, like books and diapers. I agree, but it should target the people in greatest need, the poorest, and this bill does not do that. It really seems like a purely vote-seeking strategy thought out by people who tried to predict who is going to vote. Will it be those with the most money or those with less? Will it be people who live day-by-day, or those who can see beyond the end of their noses?</ParaText>

Another reason is that it will enable the least fortunate to save roughly 25¢ to 50¢ per week, while the wealthy, who can afford to pay for catered meals, will be able save $50. Let us look at children's clothing. Things are simple enough for parents who have a young child, but if they have a teenager or someone under the age of 14 who does not fit into children's clothes, that slips through the cracks.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740170"> Mr. Speaker, my colleague gave a nuanced, thoughtful speech that raised some good points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740171">We in the NDP said that we wanted a permanent tax break on essential items, including heating and cellphone packages. Naturally, the Liberals presented a temporary half measure accompanied by a very haphazard list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740172">However, I have to disagree with my colleague when she says that this will help the rich more than the poor. I think that is a fundamental error, because the GST is a regressive tax, meaning that the proportional impact hurts the middle class and the poor more than the rich. When someone earns $200,000, a 5% tax on consumer products does not really affect them. If they earn $20,000, a 5% tax represents a considerable proportion of their available income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740173">Therefore, the measure helps the poor more than the rich because the GST is a regressive tax.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740174">Mr. Speaker, I agree in principle with what my colleague just said. I know that a 5% tax does not make as much difference to people making $200,000 than to those making $20,000. That is what I made for years, so I understand perfectly well. However, saving $1 per week over two months amounts to $8. That buys four extra litres of milk for two months. It is not enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740175">I agree with my colleague. If they are going to do this, it should be on very targeted products and on a permanent basis. This, however, is a sop that, in the end, will not help those who really need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740176">There are questions about removing the 5% for two months. Will that also be deducted from the GST rebate at the end of the year? </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8740184">Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by addressing some of the people in my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740185">I want to acknowledge the people who are still fighting for employment insurance reform, because they are already in the spring gap. They will not make it to Christmas. Never mind Christmas trees and all that; they will not even be able to put food on the table, not until April. They know all about vulnerability. Earlier, members were talking about sloppy, temporary half measures and so on, but these people have been waiting for more than 20 years, probably since the Axworthy reform, for a way to make it to the end of the year. That is why I want to acknowledge them and thank them for keeping up the fight, because this is another battle the entire Bloc Québécois is fighting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740186">I also want to acknowledge the people in my riding who live in remote communities. The government is talking about a 5% tax holiday for two months. However, there are people in my northern riding who live in isolated areas where there are no roads. There are sometimes boats and planes in the winter. Otherwise, people have to use snowmobiles to get around. These people are already struggling to afford groceries and the cost of living. They do not just need a 5% tax break so that they can buy a lavish amount of food or a case of champagne. I want to recognize the Canada Post employees who are on strike, but also the residents of the Lower North Shore, who are having a hard time right now because Canada Post is the only carrier in their area and one of the things it delivers is food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740187">That said, these are really tough times for everyone. It is not necessary to broaden our perspective to know that this bill is a bad piece of legislation. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278647" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation> explained that earlier, perhaps more calmly than I am now. I know she is very passionate and outspoken. She said that the bill is very flawed and that we cannot afford to support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740188">First of all, people are going on and on about the idea of essentials. I have been hearing about all kinds of lists throughout the day. For example, a puzzle and a pair of dice are now essentials. This bill seeks to remove the 5% tax on dice, which will apparently bring great relief to part of the population for two months.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740189">I know that is a ridiculous example. Not everyone is in a position to read bills, but I am, and I really have to wonder why the list contains toys and other items that will save people maybe a few pennies off the purchase price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740190">Of course, members have talked about food. My colleague talked a lot about that. This measure will not really help anyone. It will cover candy, catering services, alcohol, prepared foods, which are more expensive because they are prepared, and restaurant meals. I heard the party opposite say over and over again that, now, people will be able to go out to restaurants. For a family, dinner at a restaurant costs $100, $150 or sometimes even $200. For a family of four, five or six, going to a restaurant does not just cost $20. I have a family of six, and it is a lot more expensive than that. This measure does not cut it. This is not the kind of help that people need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740191">People here in Ottawa are living in a bubble. Perhaps the government should get out into the real world sometimes, rather than hastily cobbling a bill together without really thinking about how that bill will actually affect people. Then it might understand that this bill is not a real solution for ordinary folks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740192">My colleague opposite talked about heating, and I agree with him. Perhaps heating is an essential when compared to some of the items listed in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740193">The Bloc Québécois has a problem with a second aspect of the bill. We tried as hard as we could to find a way to improve it, but we cannot amend the bill. We are in the House and things are moving very quickly. I saw it. Members were practically trying to keep me from speaking by saying that there was not really time for one last speech. Meanwhile, we had time for quite a few bells today. That is exactly why we need to take the time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="00">(2000)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740194">It is a technical issue. We are here as legislators to reflect and propose new ideas. We are not here simply to oppose in a foolish and stubborn way, but to oppose in order to improve things. Even if we are not voting in favour of the bill, the government still needs to listen the legislators. The Bloc Québécois proposed an amendment. I know that there are other parties that agree with this amendment proposed by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278737" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation>, who is calling for the bill to be studied in committee and for the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to come testify.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740195">Legislation cannot simply be introduced like that. All of this was clearly improvised. Earlier, one of my colleagues from the Conservative Party said that December 14 was too late to buy a Christmas tree, even if it will supposedly be cheaper then. When a measure arrives this late, it is obvious that it was thrown together quickly in the hope that it will not be so bad and no one will notice the glaring flaws. That is truly what is happening. The Bloc Québécois would have liked to simply discuss it, but that is not going to happen. I can say that I had a taste of that medicine earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740196">I would also like to talk about other aspects, like business owners, for instance. This subject has come up a number of times, here and there. It is true that, as a society, Quebeckers are strong supporters of small businesses. My constituents on the north shore are no exception, and I cannot help but think about these businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740197">The government is proposing a measure, but it is not thinking about how things work in the real world. In a bar, it is not that easy to know what percentage of alcohol is going into a cocktail. Will it be exempt from the GST or not? Should bartenders start measuring everything proportionally to make sure they are really following the rules? Again, it may sound far-fetched and absurd, but we need to think of every possibility when drafting bills in order to see where the blind spots are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740198">It sounds like a great idea. Then again, I do not know if alcohol counts as an essential, although I do want to encourage our business owners. I thought of a joke there, but I am not going to share it. I was going to say that maybe alcohol is an essential for those who have to think about this bill. There, I said it. Still, we have to think about the blind spots and try to identify what is not working in the bills to help businesses. Walmart and Costco are not the only ones that will be selling discounted products. Sometimes I get the impression that the government is only thinking about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740199">Where I live, we have a Walmart, but no Costco. We have some very small businesses too. These small businesses are going to have to change their programming, and that does not happen with a snap of the fingers. Changing programming takes technicians. Where are people supposed to find technicians when there is already a shortage of technicians? On top of that, this all needs to be done right across the country. That requires technicians, and they do not work for free. Then they have to come back again mid-February to do exactly the same thing. Small businesses have fewer staff and will be forced to take on an extra burden at their busiest time of the year. People may be getting a 5% tax break to go to a restaurant, which amounts to a $5 discount, but businesses are having to spend $3,000 out of pocket to implement this measure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740200">I would like to remind the government that businesses are owned by people. These are people who put their heart and soul into their business all the time, who work seven days a week, who are trying to improve their companies, who also have to hire people and who also have families. They are also going to be affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740201">In light of all that, I am wondering whether this is really going to be worth it. The government has not considered all these consequences. They did not think it all through, so they assumed it would be easy. My colleague gave a detailed list of all the difficulties that businesses could face. They will have to identify which products are be tax-free. It could be tough.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740202">I heard a government member say earlier that adult diapers would be exempt from the GST. I would have liked to ask him about that again. I checked the bill. I could not find it in there. I do not know where he saw that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740203">If it is hard for a government member to keep straight the contents of the bill he is defending, and if the government does not want us to study it in committee because it wants to move really quickly, why should we pass something like that? The member does not even know what is in his own bill. I do not have the bill in front of me. Let us say I have it here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740204">How are the businesses back home going to sort this out? How are the parents or the people buying the products going to sort this out? Are they going to walk around with a copy of the bill in their hands and look at the shelves and ponder whether the item is truly a soft toy with accessories? That is how it is worded in the bill. Are they going to check whether an item matches what is written in the bill? Is a parent really going to do that? In the bill, books are GST-exempt, but cut-out books are not. The parent will have to check the books to see if there are any cut-outs or stickers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740205">It will get complicated. I think it is too daunting. Consumers might not want to bother doing all that for the sake of 30¢. Maybe people will decide to take the item anyway because it is what they want, so who cares if it is not GST-exempt. I do not know if this measure is going to be as effective as the government thinks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740206">Members have been talking a lot about families. That makes sense. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278647" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation> said, it is the holiday season. Of course, not everyone celebrates Christmas, but it is the holiday season. Yes, there will be celebrations and family gatherings, so we want to help people. At the same time, the date is arbitrary. The list of goods that will be exempt from the GST and the timing are both very arbitrary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740207">I am the mother of three children, two of whom are over the age of 14. Parents are well aware that there are certain times of year that are more difficult, and I want to stress the word “times”. Ideally, there should be a GST exemption on children's clothing year-round. That is a huge burden on families. Let us not forget that, every year, in August and September, we hear about how expensive back-to-school time is. Lunch boxes, school bags, school supplies, clothing: all of those things are expensive. Then, of course, parents have to pay to register their children in this or that activity. In short, yes, back to school is a very expensive time of year, and Christmas is too, so we need to ask ourselves another question. Is this measure needed only at Christmastime?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740208">I saw costumes included on the list of products in the bill. Maybe people need costumes. In any case, there is a big difference between costumes and clothing. What do people really need? What is the government really trying to give people?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740209">Once again, it all boils down to the same thing. I apologize for repeating myself, but there is no thinking behind this. I have not talked about it yet, and I myself do not understand why. It is probably because the idea behind the bill was not properly thought out.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740210">It was not about making a perfect bill. The goal was probably just to grab some media attention by telling people that the government was going to hand out a goody, a big treat. People were led to believe that it was a treat. Anyone with any sense at all quickly realized that this makes no sense. It is really just electioneering, but they are trying to pass it off as a treat. I almost said they are giving people a trick instead of a treat. It is too easy to make puns with this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740211">I am about to wrap up. Maybe we need to think about other things. This measure tells people to spend money on things that are not necessarily useful. I am not saying people do not want to go to a buffet every now and then for a festive occasion, or that they do not feel like cooking some nights because they are exhausted. Sometimes I pick up a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store, and that is on the list of GST-exempt products. It happens to us, too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740212">That said, is spending really saving? They say they want to help people. Are people really saving when they are spending money or when the government is trying to make them spend more? As I said before, these are not essential things. The Liberal-NDP government is so proud of itself, but this is not actually saving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740213">Besides saving money, the other thing we are interested in this evening is not the GST part, it is the part that has been set aside for the time being, the $250 cheque. I hope we can get back to that, because I have just as much or more to say about it. It is a measure that excludes people. The GST measure excludes things that people might appreciate having a discount on. It excludes some products that could really help people. The $250 cheque excludes some people outright.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740214">It excludes people who do not have a lot of money, like seniors and students. Students may decide not to work during the year so that they can focus on their studies. It also excludes people with disabilities. It excludes people and actually penalizes them, if members can believe it, for not currently being in the labour market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740215">When people need housing, when they need food, when they need clothing—we cannot forget Maslow's advice to always go back to basics—a bill like this one, or a one-time cheque for $250 that goes to a select number of people, is not what they need. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740216">I would like to talk about the amount. The Bloc Québécois introduced a bill for seniors, Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C-319</Document>, presented by my colleague from Shefford. It seeks to end discrimination. I just talked about discrimination when I spoke about the people who may be excluded from receiving the $250 cheque, but the same holds for seniors. We want to restore fairness and fix the situation, but the government refuses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740217">It says this would make the measure way too expensive. However, between the $250 cheques and the $1.7 billion, at a minimum, for the GST break, that is already double what the Bloc Québécois was asking for. This may be a clue that what the government is really trying to do with its tax break and its $250 cheque—which should of course be coming soon, although we might not get it until April—is simply buy votes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740218">As I read the bill, something occurred to me. It is important to have a sense of humour. People are going through a tough time. Our constituents are struggling. When a bill like this comes along and we get the impression that what will be exempt from GST is what people might need to celebrate Christmas and New Year's Day, or perhaps even the Epiphany, since the measures will be in effect until February, it occurred to me that it is a good thing this was not introduced at Easter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740219">Imagine if the bill had been introduced at Easter. What goodies would they have given out? We would have had tax-free chocolate eggs, little pet bunnies and maybe yellow, purple and pink clothing. I am being sarcastic, but when a bill like this comes along, it is not hard to believe that this was the degree of thought that went into it. It is all about buying votes.</ParaText>

It is great to stand up when we are going through legislation that is going to provide tax relief during the Christmas season and into Valentine's Day for the benefit of all Canadians. </ParaText>

As an individual who grew up in a very humble household, every dollar counts, every little bit helps and I am so proud of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740238"> Also, as an economist and someone who had the chance to work on Wall Street and Bay Street for a number of years, it is great to see what a number of my former colleagues and people I have known for many years are commenting on exactly what Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C-78</Document> is.

BMO Economics is boosting Q1 GDP growth from 1.7% to 2.5%, with 2024Q4 and 2025Q2” being even bigger and having a larger impact. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740240"> Derek Holt at Scotiabank said, “That, in turn, would lift GDP growth by about two percentage points above our baseline forecast.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740241"> The Retail Council of Canada came out with some comments about its members and what they see: “Retail Council of Canada (RCC) welcomes today’s sales tax relief announcement from the federal government.

              <ParaText id="8740254">Mr. Speaker, making life more affordable for all Canadians and putting out social programs is what our government has been about. It is the Christmas season, so <I>buon Natale</I>, <I>Feliz Navidad</I> and merry Christmas. It is a beautiful time of year, and Canadians are going to have more money in their pockets. That is what this government is about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740255">We brought in a middle-income tax cut; the Conservatives voted against it. We brought in the Canada child benefit; the Conservatives voted against it. We brought in the Canada workers benefit; the Conservatives voted against it. We brought in a national early learning and day care program; the Conservatives voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740256">We brought in a Canadian dental care plan, and over 21,000 individuals in my riding are already benefiting from it. We have not even offered it yet to 18- to 65-year-old Canadians, which will happen in 2025. Almost three million Canadians from coast to coast to coast are using this program, and over a million Canadians who have visited an oral health care provider have been provided $710 on average. There are seniors in my riding, across the city of Vaughan, who have not gone to the dentist in over 10 years because they could not afford it and now they are going. That is progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740257">Let us be straight. Every Canadian needs to know that the party opposite will cut those programs. Every senior needs to know that the Conservatives will attempt to cut those programs. The Conservatives have indicated it. This is not a personal comment; this is a policy comment. The Liberals reduced income taxes for some, and we raised them for the wealthiest in this country. The Conservatives voted against that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740258">We must continue to help Canadians. Christmastime is coming, and in a few weeks, Canadians will gather with their families and their loved ones. They will go to church, like me, and do other things. Our Jewish community will celebrate Hanukkah. They are all going to be talking about how our government is saving them money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740259">The Liberals also want to introduce the working Canadians rebate for hard-working Canadians, and we will do it in the coming months. It is tax-free help because we know Canadians have been through a lot: the global pandemic, global inflation, a war in Ukraine, the events in the Middle East and a changing of administrations south of the border. There is a lot of uncertainty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740260">The one certainty Canadians can count on is a government that always has their backs, every day and every hour, and, with no pun intended, a government they can trust and have faith in and that keeps its word in what it will do and implement. For our hard-working seniors, that means a 10% increase in old age security for almost four million seniors.

              <ParaText id="8740264">Mr. Speaker, I was saying that the former leader of the opposite party, who was in Switzerland, raised the retirement age from 65 to 67. There are bricklayers, electricians and labourers who work a very long time. Those extra two years of work are laborious. That is not fair to them. That is not fair to Canadians. It was not fair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740265">When we got elected, we promised we would return it, and we did. That is approximately $17,000 more in the pockets of retirees today than there was nine years ago. The opposition party, which was in government at the time, raised the retirement age without consultation, without doing it in this country, while it was overseas, just like that. We returned it. That is leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740266">On the middle-class income tax cut, literally billions of dollars will be returning to Canadians because we cut that middle tax bracket from 22% to about 20.5% in year one. We did that. On the Canada child care plan, $10-a-day day care is saving parents in my riding, including myself, and I am blessed, over $10,000 of after-tax income. We can do the math of what that means for before-tax income. We have continued to invest, and we will continue to invest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740267">There was a chart out the other day showing that rental construction in this country is booming right now. It is outpacing population growth because of the policies we have implemented. Going into Christmastime, in a few weeks, when we all get to spend time in our communities with our residents and our families, we should go to our local restaurants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740268">There are over 5,000 hard-working Canadians in Vaughan—Woodbridge right now who work for restaurants. They and their employers are going to see an uptick in business. Restaurants Canada has applauded this. It was there the day of the announcement because it is a great thing to do, and it is going to carry them over into January, which is a tough period for many businesses because of their seasonality. That is great news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740269">The Province of Ontario has signed with us for the national school food program, much like it did for the early learning and national day care plan. Again, they have joined us to provide tax relief to the residents of Ontario and to the wonderful citizens I am blessed to represent in the riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge. This is something we should applaud. This is progress we should applaud. Hard-working Canadians go to work every day, and they deserve a break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740270">We need to meet Canadians where they are today. As a son of very humble immigrants who came to this country and worked very hard at a pulp mill and a fish plant, I can say that every little bit helps. Every little bit helps all the time, and that is where we are at. The residents in my riding can put their trust in me. They have, and they will because we keep our word.</ParaText>

He has put his pension over Canadians and country. He helped the Prime Minister add more debt to Canadians than did every single prime minister before him combined, which has resulted in the cost of living crisis for Canadians and has increased food bank usage. Food bank usage has doubled since 2019. Now, more than two million Canadians are visiting a food bank in a single month in this country, a third of whom are children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740294">One in four Canadians has started skipping meals, and one in five children is living in poverty now.

People just want their Canada back, the one they once knew and still love, the one where they put in hard work and earned a powerful paycheque and the one where they could afford their rent or mortgage payment and go to the grocery store and afford groceries again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740297">That is the kind of Canada people want back, but there is only one way to get that Canada back: It will happen in a carbon tax election when Canadians fire the incompetent Liberal-NDP government with the weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and replace him with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation> and a common-sense Conservative government.

Here is the reality: A report that came out said only a mere “4% of small business owners believe they will have stronger sales as a result” of this tax trick, and “75% say it will be costly and complicated to implement”. We are hearing from businesses that the minimum cost will be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 because they will have to change their POS system not once, but twice. The government is doing it at the worst time possible. This is one of the busiest weeks for businesses. It is Black Friday tomorrow, and this is the time they chose to do it. This is pure incompetence on full display. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740304">A majority of businesses say that “there is not enough time to implement [it]”. A majority of businesses say that “it will be difficult to determine which items are temporarily tax-exempt”. Most “retailers of goods subject to the holiday report consumers will delay purchases”, messing with business projections and stock. A large majority says it will benefit the “big businesses and online giants”, meaning more money for Liberal-NDP friends, such as Galen Weston's family, and pain with no gain for small businesses. This is the reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740305">It does nothing for the productivity crisis the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> created, in which we are seeing our investments flee to the U.S. Canadian workers are now $32,000 poorer than U.S. workers. If the incompetent government had just kept pace with the golden plate former prime minister Stephen Harper left in 2015, workers would be $4,200 richer in Canada. Instead, they are much poorer. It is clear to see. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740306">The population growth created a worse housing crisis. Now students are living under bridges. Teachers and people with good jobs are living in cars. People who used to donate their time at food banks are now standing in line at food banks. There are husbands and wives at home, both earning good paycheques, who are going there. It is not just us saying this; proud Liberals such as David Dodge, a former Bank of Canada governor, has said that this is not the right package. It is a little candy today for pain down the road. I would say that this pain did not start today, but nine years ago. Our kids, their kids, their kids' kids and even their kids will be paying for this absolute incompetence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740307">However, we can put an end to this today. It was not like this before the incompetent Liberal-NDP government came in, and it will not be like that after it is gone. Can it find the courage to call a carbon tax election so that Canadians can fire the government? If so, a common-sense Conservative government will bring real relief. We are going to axe the tax immediately. We are going to bring down the cost of gas, groceries and home heating. We are going to axe the sales tax on newly built homes under $1 million so that 30,000 new homes can be built a year. People will save on their mortgages and the cost of homes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740308">We are going to fix this Liberal-made productivity crisis by unleashing our economy and our energy sector, which is keeping the government from bringing Canada into a recession. That is the sector it keeps attacking with its ridiculous policies, such as the oil and gas cap, which is actually a production cap that is chasing our resources, money and jobs out of Canada. We are going to unleash the economy once again so that Canada can become the Canada we once knew and still love. We are going to bring that home under a common-sense Conservative government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740330">Mr. Speaker, how about some mixed Liberal-NDP improv? The theme is: climbing in the polls. The duration is: the length of time allocation. This is like bad improv. Quebec's national improv league could do better—at least they are prepared for what they are getting into. I am ashamed of what I am seeing. I wish it were a joke or just a skit, but unfortunately it is not. What we are witnessing is total and complete improvisation by the government and its dance partner. No one in Laurentides—Labelle has ever talked to me about a GST holiday, not once. It will have a direct impact on businesses, but will be of very little benefit to the people . We all agree that the die has already been cast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740331">When someone's entire income goes to meet basic needs, the GST holiday offers very little. Rent is already zero-rated. Groceries are already tax-free. Heating is taxed, but Bill <Document DbId="13446559" Type="3">C‑78</Document> does not remove the GST from heating. It does, however, remove the GST from alcohol. If I decide to go to a restaurant for dinner and treat myself to a nice bottle, it seems only fair that I should pay GST on a luxury product. However, the government has decided that it is a good idea to give a GST rebate to those who can afford a bottle of Veuve Clicquot this holiday season. In fact, some people may have had some tonight. They can go out and buy it by the case. For members' information, this morning I checked the website of the SAQ, Quebec's liquor board, and a 750-millilitre bottle of Veuve Clicquot sells for $84. That is definitely a luxury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740332">A tax holiday is being offered to the well-heeled. Those with the bare minimum in their bank accounts count every dollar, and every expense counts. Moreover, those expenses are for products that are already tax-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740333">Earlier, I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="278270" Type="2">Alfred-Pellan</Affiliation> say this will help business owners. A person would have to be completely out of touch to say that. The government definitely did not think of small businesses owners, who are struggling to keep their businesses afloat. I know this because it is something I myself will go through. Let me name just one of the people who contacted me. Marc Hallée, the owner of Bistro des Chutes in Chute‑Saint‑Philippe, contacted me this morning. He was irate. I get it. He said this measure makes no sense. There is one technician for about 300 businesses. How are they going to reconfigure their cash registers? It will cost thousands of dollars. They will deal with it, but they definitely will not be ready by December 14. What will they do on February 14 to reinstate the GST on February 15? Nobody knows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740334">This is a double standard for a measure that will end up forcing business people like Marc Hallée to bring in technicians twice, and that will cost them money. I do not get it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740335">In the restaurant industry, profit margins are slim. I am thinking of everyone tuning in right now. This is really detrimental to the small business ecosystem. It is happening because the government and the NDP are so far down in the polls that they are looking for a gimmick that will help them claw their way back up into the light. Let us be honest. That is what is really going on here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740336">I am thinking of the businesses that ship products across Canada. Billing is done according to the province where the product is ordered and delivered. Imagine the headache for a business that is shipping products for Christmas. Honestly, it is a nightmare. No, this is not going to help businesses. It is going to help the large multinationals and big box stores. No shops on main street in Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Jovite or Mont-Tremblant, or on Madone street in Mont-Laurier is applauding this measure. These people are tearing out their hair trying to figure out how they will manage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740337">Wanting to give tax breaks to the rich makes even less sense coming from left-wing political parties. It makes no sense. We know that the Liberals are going to blame us for voting against the measure. I can hear it, but that does not bother me because I do not underestimate people's intelligence and they understand us. We are voting against this measure because it is a bad measure for Quebec and Quebeckers. A GST holiday is not going to help those who struggle to feed their family, those who have to wait in line at a charity or a food bank. These people need direct help and support for their real needs. Let us just say it: The purpose of this measure is to support consumer spending of the well-off. The Liberals and the NDP would rather support champagne socialists than help people who really need it. That is the reality. I cannot get over the NDP supporting this. They may change their minds yet. There are still a few minutes left.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740338">It is also strange to see that, in the provinces where the sales tax is harmonized, no one in the government, not the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation> or anyone in their offices, thought it would be a good idea to warn the provincial governments. The provincial governments found out about this 24 hours before the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> held his press conference in a chic kitchen in Toronto. That says a lot. First, it proves just how much contempt the federal government has for the provinces. Second, it proves just how quickly this measure was thrown together. Everyone here is talking about this measure this evening without really having had the chance to think about it. There is more. This might be news to my English Canadian colleagues, but Revenu Québec collects the GST in Quebec. The federal government pays Revenu Québec for that service. However, the Liberal-NDP alliance—people like to call it that, so I will too—did not seem to think about that and did not consider compensating Quebec for that. We are not talking about huge amounts here, but it shows how the government is making things up as it goes along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740339">I am going to close by telling the House that I am totally opposed to this bill. I do not want to vote in favour of a tax holiday for the wealthy. I care too much about people who are in need right now, who are living in extremely vulnerable situations. If any parliamentarian wants to criticize the fact that we are opposed to this, they should come and see me. We will have a nice little chat. I will introduce them to some people. The purpose of taxes is to provide services and help people. I am telling the citizens of Laurentides—Labelle that the government is not doing its job. The government is throwing this at us before Christmas, business owners are stuck with it, people are furious and, honestly, using time allocation is an insult to the power of legislators.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740346">Mr. Speaker, my question for my colleague from the Bloc Québécois is quite specific to the provincial jurisdiction side of this. A number of agreements have been signed with provinces that have a harmonized sales tax and also with provinces that just have the GST, or that have the GST and the HST. There are aspects of the act that governs those, which actually seem like what the Liberal government has proposed and are supported by the NDP. They would actually be in violation of those things, which would then, in fact, be a direct attack on provincial jurisdiction. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740347">I wonder if my colleague from the Bloc could talk about whether she has heard that.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8740350"> Mr. Speaker, millions of Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. We have a cost of living crisis and an economy that is seeing an ever-widening gap between the wealthy and the rest of us. A few stark facts bear this out. According to Statistics Canada, nearly half of Canadians report that rising prices are greatly affecting their ability to meet day-to-day expenses. Rent has increased by over 21% and grocery foods have increased by over 20% over the last three years. According to Equifax Canada, 50% of Canadians are now living paycheque to paycheque.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740351"> Income inequality in Canada has hit the highest level ever recorded. The top 20% of Canadians hold more than two-thirds of our country's wealth. By comparison, the bottom 40% of Canadians account for only 2.8% of our country's wealth. According to the Salvation Army, one in four parents cut back on their own food consumption this year to ensure their children had enough to eat. Eight in 10 Canadians, or 80%, believe that owning a home in Canada is now only for the rich. Seven in 10 say they have given up on ever owning a home. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740352">A majority of Canadians say that thinking about holiday spending causes them financial anxiety and 80% plan on cutting back on spending during this holiday season in a few short weeks. That is why the NDP recently pledged to permanently remove the GST from daily essentials and monthly bills, such as grocery store items, including pre-prepared meals, diapers, children's clothing, Internet, home phone and cellphone bills, and all types of home heating. We will note that all of these items are unavoidable expenses. Everyone has to heat their residence and buy food at the grocery store; cellphones and Internet are now essential utilities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740353">We estimate that our plan would save an average family over $500 per year. This commitment stands in stark contrast to the Conservatives' proposed cuts to essential programs, such as dental care, child care and pharmacare. Losing that support would cost families thousands of dollars per year. That is money they cannot afford. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740354">We would finance this permanent tax cut with an excess profits tax paid by very large corporations that abuse their monopoly market power and unjustifiably hike their profit margins. Canadians should know that excess profit or windfall taxes are used worldwide, including in the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia. In fact, Canada has a history of using excess profits taxes. During both world wars, excess profits taxes were implemented to help fund the war effort and ensure that companies did not engage in profiteering. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that an excess profits tax would have generated almost $8 billion in federal revenues for 2020. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740355">The Liberal government responded to the NDP's tax-free essentials plan but, in true Liberal fashion, did so only partially. Instead, it proposed a two-month GST holiday on certain items, starting December 14, and a one-time payment of $250 delivered in spring 2025 for individuals who reported net employment income of up to $150,000 in 2023. It has completely ignored the NDP's call for an excess profits tax on large corporations, which are making huge, historic profits. This is far from the substantial, fair and permanent relief the NDP wants to give Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740356">As usual, the Liberals are letting people down with their choice to make this a short-term tax holiday on a limited list of items. By leaving out things like home heating and cellular and Internet bills, their scheme also largely fails to capture the life essentials that the NDP plan captures. New Democrats are profoundly disappointed that the Liberals have chosen to exclude the most vulnerable Canadians from their one-time payment proposal. Perversely, the Liberals have chosen to send cheques to individuals earning $149,000 or couples earning $298,000 a year, but not to seniors on fixed incomes of $25,000 or people with disabilities so severe that they cannot work. That completely defies logic and fairness. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8740357"> This plan was announced without consultation or negotiation with the NDP. Our position is that everyone under the income threshold should receive the $250 payment, and we will not support the Liberals' rebate payment unless this support is expanded to include everyone in need. The NDP forced the Liberals to split these two measures into two, so we could proceed with the GST holiday right away to give people immediate relief, while we continue to pressure the Liberals to fix the $250 benefit to include all vulnerable Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740358">New Democrats will vote for the GST holiday proposed in the legislation before us today because working and middle-class families are desperate for relief, even if it is temporary and less than ideally aimed. We will continue to campaign hard on permanently scrapping the GST on daily essentials and on monthly bills. We will continue to fight for a fair taxation system through which the rich pay their fair share and all working and middle-class Canadians can live comfortable lives with dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740359">I have a few words with respect to the bill before the House. This legislation would amend the Excise Tax Act to implement a temporary GST/HST holiday between December 14, 2024, and February 15, 2025 on qualifying goods. This would help Canadians by lowering the cost on a range of products that are particularly needed during the upcoming holiday season. These would include children's clothing; footwear and diapers; children's car seats; food and beverages in grocery stores and restaurants; children's toys, including games, building sets, puzzles and video consoles; print newspapers; printed books; and even Christmas trees or similar decorative trees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740360"> Removing the GST from these goods for two months would provide an estimated $1.6 billion in federal tax relief. A family spending $2,000 on qualifying goods would realize GST savings of at least $100 over the two-month period, but in provinces where the HST would also be removed, such as Ontario and the Atlantic provinces, further savings would be realized. The same $2,000 basket of qualifying purchases would realize a savings of $260 over a two-month period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740361">The Liberals' plan to only offer temporary GST relief would not only provide to families less than half the relief that the NDP's plan would have provided, but also present a significant burden on business owners, especially small business owners, who would have to adjust their cash registers and payment systems twice in two months. That is yet more reason that the NDP plan to permanently eliminate the GST on these essential items would be better for business owners and better for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740362"> I would like to address one of the major reasons that Canadians are feeling such economic pressure, and that is corporate price gouging. New Democrats understand that the inflation over the last two years was not caused by unreasonable wages, increased demand by consumers or even excess government spending. It was caused by corporations who inflated prices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740363">Canadians are eating the same food they did before inflation. They are driving the same cars the same mileage they did before inflation. Frankly, people are probably eating and driving less. Governments have been running large deficits for almost 20 years by both Conservative and Liberal administrations without causing rampant inflation, so that cannot possibly explain why grocery prices are through the roof, suppliers are shrinking their portions and oil companies have jacked up their gas prices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740364"> Here are the real facts: Profit margins surged in early 2022 following the COVID pandemic, when many sectors used the cover of the pandemic as an excuse to raise prices. Despite the normalization of supply chains, easing of shortages and weaker consumer demand, aggregate corporate profits hardly changed in 2023. Last year, corporations in Canada recorded $644 billion in pre-tax profits, which are 54% higher than they were in 2019, the last prepandemic year, and over double the average profit level of the prepandemic decade. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740365">A quick look at three highly concentrated industries, the grocery, telecom, and oil and gas sectors, revealed this clearly. Coming out of the pandemic, operating profits in the oil and gas sector increased tenfold from $6.6 billion in 2019 to $66 billion in 2022. That is the highest profit ever recorded in Canadian history. Grocery giants' profit margin doubled from 2% prepandemic to 4.1% in 2023. A 1% increase in gross margins at grocery stores adds over $1 billion to Canadians' food bills. The telecom sector reported total revenues of $66.8 billion in 2022, which is another all-time high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740366"> Why do we have high prices in Canada? It is because large corporations raise them. Why do we have a problem with productivity in Canada? It is because corporations are not investing in machinery, equipment, technology and employee training. The NDP will continue to fight for working and middle-class Canadians and bring a fair taxation system in for this country so everyone has a real shot at a good life in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740367">Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about the cost of food being higher in Canada than in the United States. That is true, but there are many reasons for that. One is economies of scale. The United States has a much larger population. It is the same reason the price of food is lower in cities in Canada than in the regions. Another reason is that wages are much lower in the United States. For example, in Canada the minimum wage ranges from $13 to $16.77, and in the United States the federal minimum wage is $7.25.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8740380"> Mr. Speaker, the debate is a tough one, because we were told about the original plan that there would be a $250 cheque to certain Canadians, not to the people most in need but to people who worked in 2023, which would not include many people living on very fixed and small incomes, people on disability benefits and seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740381">We were the first party to notice that it was not a fair plan. On November 22 we put out a statement asking how we could give a cheque of $250 to some Canadians but fail to notice that it would not apply to retired Canadians living on a fixed income and would not apply to people living on disability benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740382"> After all the time that we have in the House called for a Canada disability tax benefit, it has still not been delivered, and the $250 cheque was dangled out there. We do not know where it has gone now, because in the last 24 hours it has crystallized that we were going to be debating in this place and fast-tracking only a GST tax holiday on only certain goods that would qualify as necessities. Furthermore, it would be for only a two-month period on and around Christmas. It would be at a cost of $1.6 billion from the treasury of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740383">It is a tough issue. It is less difficult now that the government has pulled away the $250 that should have been targeted at people who need it most. Who knows? Maybe it will come back to us in some other form, but there is something about it. I struggle with it. I probably have to say, knowing how much Canadians need a break right now, that I do not know that I can vote against a GST tax holiday on certain goods over a two-month period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740384">However, I have to say that it makes me feel queasy. It makes me feel as if I am voting for something that Doug Ford would have come up with. In fact I think Doug Ford did come up with it, and it is not good policy. Whether it is good politics, we will see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740385">It would be a GST tax break on certain items. I heard earlier from a Conservative in this place that it would apply to jigsaw puzzles, and I thought, “Well, we do not have to worry about that.” We have all seen the Conservative commercials. We know the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation> has jigsaw puzzles. We get to see them on TV quite a lot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740386"> It is not good policy when it is not targeted to people who need it the most, and it is not good policy when it is $1.6 billion without the government's saying it is going to pay for it with an excess profit tax on the big grocery stores and their corporate management and corporate greed. It is not good policy when we do not say that we are going to actually pay for the GST tax holiday by finally applying an excess profit tax on big oil and the obscene levels of corporate profits they have been making, especially since Putin invaded Ukraine, which amounts essentially to war profiteering by big oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740387">Therefore we struggle with this, and as Greens we struggle with it, because we know Canadians need a break on things that are essentials, but there is a very complicated list of what would be considered essential and what would not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740388">The break would also not be permanent. We look at it as a two-month break over the holidays. It is transparently a vote-buying scheme. Would it deliver relief to people who need it the most right now? It certainly would be of benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740389"> I think of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. It is very clear that the retail sector does not see that the tax holiday would help it a lot through the Christmas season. However, it would help restaurants with respect to both in-restaurant meals and takeaways, and that is a perk for families and for people who have been pinching pennies. Nonetheless, the people who have been pinching pennies and not going out for restaurant meals are not the same people who are lining up at the food banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740390">I have to say it is rare for me and my colleagues here to struggle with how to vote on something. I am usually pretty darn sure from the get-go. I read a bill and I think, “Well, this is something I can get behind. This is something I believe in.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740391">What do Canadians really need right now? We need a comprehensive security policy that protects us from the ravages of the climate crisis, which itself drives up grocery prices, makes food more expensive, makes life in Canada more precarious for those who live in flood plains, who are flooded year after year, or who are in communities that get fire evacuation orders year after year, or who live with the ongoing trauma of the effect of living through a heat dome in British Columbia. There are numbers of people who still feel that trauma, or the trauma after hurricane Fiona.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740392"> We need comprehensive policy that makes sense. While the Conservatives want to axe the carbon tax, that tax is rebated to people. The GST is something that was put in place under the Mulroney government. The GST, overall, is not a progressive tax; everybody pays it. If people are buying really big luxury items, they are going to pay more. This tax holiday for a two-month period is at least not designed around really large luxury goods.</ParaText>

My gift to my daughter for her baby, Lily, will not get a GST tax break because it is a service. My daughter and my granddaughter will never see a throwaway diaper because they are buying cotton diapers. I got them a laundry service. That actually saves people a lot of money. Buying throwaway diapers costs about $6,000 a year for the average infant. Buying cloth diapers up front costs a bit more. It is just the work and the labour for a new mom to have to do all that laundry. It is usually the new mom and not the new dad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740394"> I do not want to dive into all the questions of what really costs in our society, where we can save money by doing things differently, by avoiding the throwaway or by investing in something that is a service in community. There is a small business that delivers, every week, clean and healthy cotton diapers for babies. That is not what anyone means when they talk about how everybody needs diapers when there is a new baby. The whole time my daughter was in diapers, I did not buy a throwaway diaper, not once.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740395"> I did not suffer for my sacrifice. I had really good, reusable diapers, and I still have one left. I treasure that one diaper left from my 33-year-old daughter. My gosh, it is the best rag ever for washing up a mess. They cannot be bought anywhere; people just have to save them if they were smart enough when they had a new baby to invest in cotton diapers. It is a really good product.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8740396"> I am struggling with this because I do not know that a two-month GST tax holiday on some goods and not others is what Canadians really need the most. What we really need is to eliminate poverty, focus on food security for all, invest in our society with the kind of tax changes that make the biggest difference, and give Canadians the chance to know that this is a caring society that has eliminated poverty with a national, guaranteed, livable income for all. That makes real change. This makes small change.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740398"> As the member said, it is a difficult decision for her. However, at the end of the day, how do we say no to constituents and to providing them a bit of support during the holidays? The member made reference to restaurants. For restaurants and those working in that hospitality industry, it is going to have such a wonderful, positive impact. I think February 15 is the deadline. February 14 is Valentine's Day, and we know that is a busy time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8740400"> Mr. Speaker, I know that Canadians are feeling a sense of deep anxiety about our future. Going back to the question of affordability, for most people the idea is about buying a home. We also have people who are looking at living rough, living in encampments and living in tents. I can hardly believe that in a country as wealthy as Canada, we are prepared to tolerate people living rough and outdoors in a country that has bitter winters. We can do better and we must do better.</ParaText>
