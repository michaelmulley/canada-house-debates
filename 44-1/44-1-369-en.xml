              <ParaText id="8685774">I am now going to read my decision on the point of order that was raised late during yesterday's sitting. A point of order was raised by the <Affiliation DbId="311620" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to the government House leader</Affiliation> in relation to language used by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278749" Type="2">King—Vaughan</Affiliation> when quoting from correspondence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685775">In quoting from the said document, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278749" Type="2">King—Vaughan</Affiliation> had taken the appropriate step of replacing the name of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> by his title; however, she did read into the record a relatively strong and offensive term in relation to that member. In his intervention, the parliamentary secretary argued that one should not do indirectly what cannot be done directly. As we were getting close to the Adjournment Proceedings, I undertook to take the matter under consideration and come back to the House if necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685776"> First off, it is an acceptable practice for members to quote from correspondence they receive. As mentioned in the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, at page 614:</ParaText>

                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There is no Standing Order which governs the citation of documents; the House is guided mainly by custom and precedent. Generally, the reading of articles from newspapers, books or other documents by a Member during debate has become an accepted practice and is not ruled out of order provided that such quotations do not...use language which would be out of order if spoken by a Member.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8685780"> This principle has been confirmed by multiple rulings by Speakers. For example, in Speaker Milliken’s ruling of November 8, 2006, on page 4895 of the Debates, he pointed out, and I quote:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8685785">Madam Speaker, I just want to remind the House that I am continuing my intervention from last night where I was reading into the record correspondence I received from Stephanie. These are her words. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685786">“I am watching clips of what is going on in the House of Commons and in Parliament all the time and we are going in circles. It does not matter how many scandals or how much corruption has taken place with these [NDP-Liberals]. They are getting away with all of them. It is as if they are completely above the law. What will it take for an election to happen? How much more damage will this [Prime Minister] and his little sinister sidekicks do between now and the next election? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685787">“We are all reeling here about what has happened to a member of our work family in our community. Do we collectively stop giving a cent to the CRA? Do we have any power at all? Is it all a ruse? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685788">“I'm counting on the leader of the Conservatives for change. I'm deeply concerned and devastated by what has happened to my country and what a mess my kids now have to navigate. I have a message for the Liberal-NDP MPs in Ottawa next time you see them, if you will kindly oblige me. 'To all of you sitting on the Liberals' side, you, who are fully aware by now of the criminal acts and corruption of several members of this government. You made a promise to your constituents to represent them in Ottawa, yet you are sitting here today saying and doing absolutely nothing. Somehow, I don't think the people who elected you would be okay with $400 million unaccounted for and the multitude of scandals that have taken place with the government in the last nine years, and brazenly stolen tax dollars on the backs of hard-working Canadians who put their trust in you. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685789">“The member from Vaughan—Woodbridge even tried to gaslight Canadians by telling them that this is their decade and they have never had it so good. Are you kidding me? Have you actually spoken to anyone in Woodbridge recently? I have and I beg to differ. Take a good hard look at yourselves. Did you not go into this line of work for the love of country and your communities? I find it very hard to believe that every single one of you went into this to steal, lie and deceive. It can't be possible. Yet here we are. Your collective inactions are complicit, and your complicit behaviour is treasonous. Shame on all of you.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685790"> The Liberals will be held to account when the next government takes over and has to clean up the mess they have created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685791">The correspondence from Stephanie continues:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685792">“[To the] cowards wanting a secret ballot because you know that what is going on is wrong and you are not willing to speak the truth, you should be calling their crimes out from the rooftops in full light of day. We are looking, we are listening and we are watching. We will not forget. What do I say to my friends and family to give them hope and convince them to cast their vote despite their fatigue and frustrations? We need inspiration here. We are tired, we are sad and we don't recognize our country anymore. You and the leader of the Conservative Party got my vote. Please do not let us down. Please, continue to fight hard and give us hope.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8685794">I hear her anger, I feel her frustration and I share her concerns. She is not alone. I hope the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and all the supporters in the NDP-Liberal government, who have remained quiet, heard her as well. She has touched so many issues and concerns in her letter that are shared by many Canadians. Crime, lack of transparency and continuous scandals and corruption have led to their fatigue and frustration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8685795">If Stephanie is watching, here is our promise to her. Conservatives will axe the tax, which will make the cost of everything more affordable. Conservatives will build the homes so that our children can realize their dream of home ownership. Conservatives will fix the budget and stop the crime in the hope that no other little boy will ever have to witness his father being shot and feel it was his fault. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685796">I will leave the NDP-Liberals with a sentiment of British philosopher Edmund Burke that has been quoted by many others over the years, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men [and good women] to do nothing.” These are the words of constituents from my riding of King—Vaughan. </ParaText>

While the opposition parties were involved in petty politics, we were working hard for Canadians. With our actions and programs, the inflation rate is at a historic low, interest rates have been cut four times and the consumer price index is at a 30-month high. Rents in Toronto have fallen by 9.4% year over year. These are the kinds of things we are focused on. We are working hard for Canadians while the Conservative Party is playing petty politics.</ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> refuses to get security clearance so he can get that information. He refuses to get security clearance, period. Even if he did not want the information about how his own party is implicated in foreign interference, even if he did not want the information about the leadership race that put him in the position he is in and how it was corrupted by foreign interference, he could still get his security clearance, except he has chosen not to. </ParaText>

She told me that she went to the dentist for the first time and got dentures. She had been living without teeth for years. She could not eat an apple. Her nutrition and her overall health suffered. She got dental care, primary health care, because of what the NDP has done in Parliament. </ParaText>

We are not talking about just $400 million. How many other scandals are there? There is the $60 million scandal. It totals in the billions. Let us be honest here. The money wasted because of the NDP coalition with the Liberals could have helped millions of seniors, but they refuse to stand firm.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8685820">Madam Speaker, I am always pleased to rise in the House on behalf of the great people of Sturgeon River—Parkland to talk about their priorities in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685821">After nine years, the evidence is clear that the NDP-Liberal government has proven too costly in terms of crime, taxes, corruption and just plain incompetence. I am proud to rise in the House once again to hold the Liberal government to account for its corruption and incompetence before Parliament, for our democracy and for all Canadians. In Parliament today, we are speaking about a ruling the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> made that the Liberal government violated an order of the House of Commons by refusing to submit full, unredacted evidence for a criminal investigation into a $400-million green slush fund scandal. This ruling, combined with the government's actions, has paralyzed Parliament, which is preventing us from focusing on issues, such as the skyrocketing cost of housing, Liberal inflation's effect on food prices and the rising rate of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685822">Today, we are dealing with an issue of the Liberal government's incompetence and negligence in the form of $400 million of inappropriately diverted money at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. It was funnelled into the hands of directors who had a conflict of interest. They had a financial interest in the companies they were sending taxpayer money to. The directors were appointed by the Liberal government; they were accountable to the Liberal government and the Minister of Industry, yet the government refused to act while $400 million in taxpayer money was misappropriated for personal gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685823">Until the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> meets our demands to release the full, unredacted documents to the RCMP, Parliament will be forced to continue with this very important privilege debate. Until then, Liberals will find no rest. Conservatives will continue to fight tooth and nail to stand up for the rights of Parliament in the House, stand up to the government's corruption and ensure that taxpayers get every single stolen dollar back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685824">We are talking about parliamentary privilege. For those Canadians who are tuning in and may not understand what parliamentary privilege means, it means that members of the House of Commons have rights. This is a sacred principle we inherited from the mother of parliaments, Westminster. The Liberal government has violated the rights of Parliament by refusing to release documents that Parliament demanded. These powers to call for documents are rooted in the very Constitution of this country, from 1867, and in the Parliament of Canada Act. This issue is so significant that the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> had to rule on it. We have been debating it for weeks in the House, to the exclusion of all other issues, because the government continues to paralyze Parliament and refuses to hand over the documents Parliament requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685825">If the Liberals think they have a mandate from Canadians to refuse to hand over documents Parliament has demanded, they must take it to a higher power, the people of Canada, to get a mandate to withhold these documents. They do not have that mandate; they do not have the courage to call an election, so we are here today with a paralyzed Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685826">The Liberals have claimed that they cannot release these documents because that would infringe on charter rights. This is a very novel argument. It is an appeal to ignorance, one would say. They say that releasing the documents might infringe on rights, so they must withhold them, but they do not offer any clear or concrete evidence to back up this claim. I say that the charter was created to protect Canadians from the excesses and evils of government, not to protect government from accountability, Canadians or Canada's Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685827">The documents that were provided were heavily redacted, censored and blacked out. This level of secrecy in a country such as Canada, or anywhere across the world, is wrong. It is preventing us from holding the government to account for the way it spends our money. Parliament has the authority to spend taxpayers' money. These are hard-won privileges; they were fought for in the 1600s and 1700s in the British Parliament, and we inherited them here in Canada's Parliament. There were literal wars fought over the rights of Parliament to raise and spend money and to hold government to account. In fact, a king was killed because he refused to submit to the will of Parliament. That is how serious a precedent this is, and it is why the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> had to make a ruling that Parliament's rights were violated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685828">Before this matter can go to committee, we have to insist that the RCMP and Parliament have full access to the information we have called for. This issue deserves to be handled with the utmost seriousness, and it needs to be made a priority for Parliament. All opposition parties agree that this demand must be met, except for the Liberals. They do not have a majority, and they do not have the right or the votes to defy the will of the House.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8685829">If they want a mandate to defy the will of the House, they need to take it to the Canadian people. That is something they refuse to do, because they know exactly what is going to happen if they ask Canadians whether they support their move to withhold these documents. It is not going to look pretty for them. This is a scandal that reflects on all the Liberal scandals we have seen over the nine years of the NDP-Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685830">Why is the government working so hard to hide these documents? When we are talking about $400 million, it is not chump change. As Canadians are facing a cost of living crisis across this country, it is more important than ever to ensure that every single taxpayer dollar is spent rightly and efficiently and has the best possible result for Canadians. Canadians need to hold the government to account in the next election, but as the government refuses to call an election, it is up to Parliament to hold it to account. While the ballot box might be the ultimate judge, the government refuses to let us go to the ballot box, so we are going to keep fighting tooth and nail until it gives Canadians the documents they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685831">We are in an affordability crisis, and the Liberals are acting in exactly the opposite way that Canadians would expect a government to act, especially a government they only gave a minority and expect to work with other parties in the House, not defy the will of Parliament. Instead of finding ways to serve Canadians, we have to sit here and discuss the government's negligence, its incompetence and its ongoing corruption and refusal to be transparent and hand over documents about its mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685832">According to the 2024 HungerCount report, food banks have recorded over two million visits this past March, and more than a quarter of those visits were by children. We are discussing these things today because the government has paralyzed Parliament. It is removing our ability to discuss how to bring results for Canadians. While the government holds Parliament hostage by preventing these documents from going forward, we cannot deal with the very important issues Canadians want to deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685833"> Getting back to the issue of SDTC, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> is the main perpetrator of this scandal. He violated a House order. I want to go back to a document the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> released back in 2015 when the Liberals first formed government. In 2015, the Prime Minister sent each cabinet minister a letter entitled “Open and Accountable Government”. It outlined their responsibilities. I want to quote from the document today:</ParaText>

This is not merely a matter of adopting the right rules, or of ensuring technical compliance with those rules.

This is an obligation that is not fully discharged by simply acting within the law.</QuotePara>

In our system, the highest manifestation of democratic accountability is the forum of Parliament.” That does not sound like the government of today. It does not think the forum of Parliament is the authority in this country.</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685838">We have come a long way since 2015. I doubt the government would put out a letter like this to cabinet ministers today with a straight face, because that is not the NDP-Liberal government we have been seeing over the past nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685839">The document further says that ministers must answer Parliament's questions on how “public monies were spent, as well as to account for that use. Whether a Minister has discharged responsibilities appropriately is a matter of political judgment by Parliament. The Prime Minister has the prerogative to reaffirm support for that Minister or to ask for his or her resignation.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685840">The government is refusing to hand over documents about how $400 million of taxpayer money in the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>'s portfolio was misdirected to insiders. Some of the insiders are very close to the Liberal government, including the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>, who still holds shares in one of the companies that received at least $10 million through this program. Before he became the environment minister, he was a very effective lobbyist for it. This is an insider thing. This is Liberal cronies at the trough with taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8685841">“Open and Accountable Government” says, “The Prime Minister has the prerogative to reaffirm support for that Minister or to ask for his or her resignation.” I just want to think about the past history of Liberal ministers who have resigned in the government. It seems like the only ministers whose resignation the Prime Minister has ever asked for or ministers whom he has forced to resign have been the ministers who have stood up to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685842">Why is it that only the ministers who stand up to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are asked to resign? It is not the ministers who misplaced $400 million of taxpayer money because they were not holding their board of directors accountable under conflict of interest rules that the ministers fully knew were being violated. In fact, members of the board even raised the conflict of interest rules to the industry minister at the time and were ignored. They knew full well that there were conflicts of interest going on, and they did nothing to prevent it from happening. Now $400 million has been misspent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685843">Why is the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> not being held to account for the mismanagement? It just does not appear that mismanagement or negligence is really a cause for firing in the Liberal government. The only thing that is a cause for that is standing up to the boss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685844">Parliament is all about standing up to the powerful. It is all about standing up against the sort of obscurity and the sort of opaque government that refuses to hand over documents and be fully truthful and honest about how things went down, who got rich and how they were connected. If one can cover up those things, they can be in cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685845"> If we stand up, let us say if there is a scandal related to a company that is facing prosecution and we are facing pressure from a prime minister and a PMO that are calling for us to intervene in an active investigation by asking a special prosecutor to give a deferred prosecution agreement, that is not allowed. We are out of cabinet. However, if we allow $400 million of taxpayer money to be misspent, there are no consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685846">Has the government met its own standards of integrity and accountability? As outlined in the 2015 document, I think it is very clear to all Canadians that they have not. Canadians do not expect perfection. They know that governments are going to fail and that mistakes are going to be made, but they do expect accountability. They expect openness, honesty and transparency, and they expect that the trust they put in the House and in the government is going to be respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685847">I know there are many Liberal MPs in their caucus who agree. I encourage them to have the courage, like the ministers the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fired for standing up to him, to stand up to the Prime Minister and to the government for their mismanagement. Unless more members of the House stand up to the Liberal government's mismanagement, its negligence and its corruption, we are not going to get any results until we have an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685848">The debate today brings up another issue from the past: the sponsorship scandal, which involved over $40 million and led to the collapse of the Liberal government at the time. The green slush fund is a $400-million scandal. I know inflation is bad under the Liberals but it certainly has not gone up 1000%. The cost of Liberal corruption inflation appears to be about 1000%. It was $40 million in the 90s and 2000s. It is now $400 million today. That is inflation. The Auditor General found that the green slush fund violated conflict of interest laws 186 times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685849">The Liberals also showed massive indifference during the arrive scam scandal of $56 million and change. Developers who came forward said that they could have done the app for a fraction of the cost, less than a million dollars, yet we had sole-source, backdoor contracts going toward a company that was not actually even making the app. It was all being fed to subcontractors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685850">This is what we have seen after nine years of the Liberal government: We are not able to do the kind of things that we used to be able to do in this country; we have to contract them out to somebody else, and they cannot even do it. They are a middleman and have to subcontract it to the people who actually do the things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685851">When there are multiple levels of contracting and subcontracting, the costs keep going up. People know that the Liberal government is not watching the cash register. It does not care how much money is going out. Very quickly, something that should have cost less than a million dollars is costing $56 million. That is the cost of Liberal inflation, Liberal negligence and Liberal mismanagement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8685852">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not seem to think the rules apply to him. We saw this when he travelled to a private island, despite conflict of interest rules and ethics rules showing that taking private planes and going to islands owned by private interests was wrong. In fact some very interesting revelations have been made years later about how people in the Prime Minister's Office did not even know that the Prime Minister was going to be going. When they did find out, they begged him not to go, but nobody was going to convince the Prime Minister not to go on that bleep trip. I am not going to say their exact words in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685853">That is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s arrogance. He was not going to be dissuaded from something he wanted. People look at leadership and ask what our leader is doing. When they see what the Prime Minister of Canada is doing, it gives them an opportunity, the licence, to do the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685854">Therefore it is no surprise that under the Liberal government there have been cabinet ministers who, when they were in the private sector between elections, allegedly claimed that they had indigenous heritage in order to try to score lucrative government contracts. Ministers appointed their friends to boards where they would be in a massive conflict of interest. In the case of SDTC, hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money were being misdirected to companies where there were conflicts of interest. It is because of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, and it has filtered down into his cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685855">The fact is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has set a precedent. He has made it very clear that if someone does what he says; if they cover up; if they deny, deny, deny; and if they keep pushing forward and do whatever he says, they will be protected and will still be in cabinet. However, if someone stands up to what the Prime Minister is doing and says he is wrong, they are out of cabinet. That is what happened with Jody Wilson-Raybould and with Jane Philpott. They stood up to the Prime Minister and suffered the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685856">The message has been heard loud and clear in the Liberal Party. It is why its members have to ask permission to even stand up at the microphone and speak in their caucus meetings. It is why they have to beg for the opportunity to have a secret ballot in this country. A secret ballot is a fundamental part of our modern democracy, and someone is not even allowed to have it inside the Liberal caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685857"> A whistle-blower testified, saying, “I think the current government is more interested in protecting themselves [and letting the public nightmare continue]. They would rather protect wrongdoers and financial mismanagement than have to deal with a situation like SDTC in the public sphere.” They also said, “It's one thing to say nothing has been found as of yet, but that obfuscates the fact that nothing was looked into, for that matter.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685858">Conservatives, unlike the Liberals, applaud the whistle-blowers who stand up for Canadians. It should be the Liberals going to the department, asking the questions, finding the truth, and saying that this is what happened, here is who is responsible, here is how we are holding them accountable and this is what we are going to do to make sure it never happens again. However, the Liberals are preventing us from doing that. They are withholding the documents and they say that the RCMP says it does not want them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8685859">Even if the RCMP does not want the documents, the Liberals can send them and the RCMP can do whatever it wants with them. It can use the documents or it cannot use them. The fact that the government seems so eager to defy the will of Parliament to prevent the documents from seeing the light of day is really suspicious. Why are the Liberals burning weeks of parliamentary time on the privilege debate, all to prevent the documents from seeing the light of day? The Liberals say the RCMP says it might or might not use them—</ParaText>

An article recently came out that said Canada needs to stop chasing American-style GDP as if GDP was a theme, not an economic indicator. Under the Liberal-NDP government, every single Canadian is worse off, other than Liberal insiders in this scandal, perhaps, who are very well off. The GDP per capita of this country is collapsing under the Liberal government, and our dollar is losing strength. Our dollar underpins our purchasing power, and inflation will rise when the dollar falls because of the Liberal government's policies.</ParaText>

All Canadians benefit from the support of our oil and gas sector, in terms of jobs, investment, royalties, taxes and, perhaps most importantly, our dollar. This production cap will mean fewer jobs, less investment, less taxes to fund hospitals and schools and higher inflation on everything, as our dollar collapses against the U.S. Meanwhile, there are more jobs for American energy workers and steelworkers.</ParaText>

Canada's overall emissions are the lowest they have been since 1997, the year Connor McDavid was born, and they are going down thanks to climate action undertaken by this Liberal government. The Alberta oil sands are by far the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, and the Conservatives want to turn a blind eye to unlimited pollution in the oil sands. Alberta's far-right Premier, Danielle Smith, has spent $7 million on a misinformation campaign here in Ottawa to make polluting free again. That is $7 million that could have hired new teachers, new nurses, new doctors, but instead she is shilling for big oil and gas, and these Conservatives are helping her do it.</ParaText>

Under the Conservatives, Canada's economy grew and emissions actually went down, but under the Liberals, Canada's GDP per capita is collapsing under the weight of tax hikes.

Under this government, we have brought it down under 750 million metric tons, after it was rising under the Harper government, to an average of under 700 million metric tons over the past three years. Under a Conservative government, emissions were projected to be 41% higher by 2030.

              <ParaText id="8686186">With regard to parts (a) and (b), the Canada fund for local initiatives, CFLI,  is an international assistance contribution program under the authority of the Minister of Foreign Affairs with an annual operating budget of $26.89 million. Each year, the CFLI supports over 800 small-scale, high-impact projects with an average budget of $32,000, implemented in over 120 official development assistance, ODA, eligible countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686187">The department undertook an extensive preliminary search in order to determine the amount of information that would fall within the scope of the question and the amount of time that would be required to prepare a comprehensive response. The response would require the retrieval of information stored in various databases for over 820 contributions agreements. The department concluded that producing and validating a comprehensive response to this question would require an extensive collection of information that is not possible in the time allotted and could lead to the disclosure of incomplete and misleading information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686188">CFLI contributions of a value above $10,000 are subject to proactive disclosure and are published on the Open Government site under proactive disclosure at the following link: https://open.canada.ca/en.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686189">CFLI initiatives align with the six action areas established under Canada’s feminist international assistance policy and seek to contribute to advancing democracy, protecting and promoting human rights, and ensuring security and stability. The CFLI is also geared to assist in the advocacy of Canada’s values and interests and the strengthening of Canada’s bilateral relations with foreign countries and their civil societies. CFLI funding can also be deployed for humanitarian assistance in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters and other emergencies. By funding and supporting projects developed by local organizations that may not otherwise qualify for funding from larger donors, the CFLI program fosters stronger and more resilient civil society sectors among ODA-eligible countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686190">The recipients of CFLI contributions are, with few exceptions, local civil society organizations, CSOs, active at the community and grassroots level. While the CFLI does on occasion partner with local government entities when deemed strategic to do so to meet Canadian objectives, it is rare. For example, the CFLI partnered with government entities in 1.25% of projects in programming in the fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686191">The selection of CFLI projects is performed on an annual basis by designated committees within 69 implementing missions and with initiatives being submitted through calls for proposals published on a dedicated website: https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/funding-financement/cfli-fcil/index.aspx?lang=eng. Projects are selected based on criteria identified by the program’s terms and conditions, including the degree of alignment with Canada’s international assistance, as well as its foreign affairs priorities and interests. The financial authorities for the CFLI are held by the head of missions. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686231">Mr. Speaker, that does not take away from the behaviour we have seen from the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. At the end of the day, we have a Conservative motion on the floor indicating that the Conservatives would like to push the issue at hand to the procedure and House affairs committee. I would suggest that is the right way to deal with the issue. In fact, all members of all political parties except for the Conservatives, who have proposed the motion, want the motion to be accepted so the matter can go to the procedure and House affairs committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686232">The Conservatives have not only moved a motion, but moved an amendment to the motion and a subamendment. Then after they had 100 members speak to the subamendment, they allowed the subamendment to drop and moved another subamendment. The purpose of this is to paralyze the House, as they continue to stand up for speech after speech while not necessarily being relevant to the motion. Rather, they focus on what I would suggest is the ongoing issue of character assassination. They started with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> back when he was elected leader of the Liberal Party when we were the third party inside this chamber, and nothing has changed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686233"> The Conservatives today are saying they want unredacted information, and they believe they have an entitlement to it because they say that a majority of members of the House argued for that and voted in favour of it. There are two quotes that I would like to bring forward to the Conservative Party, particularly the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686234">First and foremost, what the Conservative Party is asking for is inappropriate. It is a Conservative game. It is a multi-million dollar political game that serves the personal interests of the <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party as a whole. The Conservatives are asking us to give out unredacted documents from a collection, handing them not only to opposition members but directly to the RCMP. This is what the RCMP commissioner has said regarding that: “There is significant risk that the Motion could be interpreted as a circumvention of normal investigative processes and Charter protections.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686235">The Conservative Party does not give a darn about that. The Conservatives do not care about charter protections. They are not listening to what the RCMP is saying, and the RCMP is not alone. The Auditor General has also been critical of the tactic being used by the Conservative Party. The former law clerk is critical of the tactic being used by the Conservative Party as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686236">The Conservative Party is saying to wait a minute; it wants people to believe the Conservative Party over the RCMP, the Auditor General of Canada and other professionals and experts out there. The Conservatives know full well that we are not going to do that, as well we should not. That is why the Speaker's ruling tells us to send this matter to committee and allow the committee to review it. However, the Conservatives do not like that, and that is where, in my opinion, they are borderline in contempt of Parliament. I would articulate that to whomever. The Conservative Party is saying that they are not going to allow the House to deal with any issue until this matter has been resolved to their liking. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8686237">I would like to quote a story from The Hill Times. We have a one-week break, and I would like every Conservative member, because we are going to hear from another 100 of them no doubt, to say they read The Hill Times story from October 31 that Steven Chaplin wrote and say they disagree with that individual. If they are not prepared to say that, then they should look at themselves in a mirror and recognize the reality of the type of abuse the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has been putting into the House of Commons for weeks now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686238">I will not read the whole article, but for those following the debate, Steven Chaplin is the former senior legal counsel in the Office of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel. He is someone who truly understands this. He is apolitical. I could not even identify him on the street or the sidewalk. Here is what he says as an expert: “It is time for the House of Commons to admit it was wrong, and to move on. There has now been three weeks of debate on a questionable matter of privilege based on the misuse of the House’ power”. He wrote this story last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686239">The article goes on, and here is what members really need to appreciate. A member could think of themselves as a parliamentarian first, believing that serving their constituents is the most important role they have to play, but they should also recognize they are a parliamentarian. Every parliamentarian of the House of Commons needs to listen carefully to this statement. Again, this comes from Steven Chaplin: “It is time for the House to admit its overreach before the matter inevitably finds it way to the courts which do have the ability to determine and limit the House’s powers, often beyond what the House may like.” That is a warning to all parliamentarians about the abuse of power that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> is imposing on his Conservative caucus, which none of them is taking seriously based on the discussions and debates we are hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686240">I am not surprised that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> continues to push this issue. I am not surprised because we see that in his history and his pattern of behaviour. Stephen Harper was the only prime minister in Canada in the British Commonwealth to be held in contempt of Parliament. Guess who his parliamentary secretary was. It was none other than the leader of the Conservative Party.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686241">The <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the Conservative Party is the only leader in the House of Commons without a security clearance. Leaders of the Bloc, the Greens and the NDP, as well as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, all have a security clearance. Outside the Hill, there is a serious concern in regard to foreign interference. We have seen the killing and murdering of individuals and extortion. We have seen the influencing of parliamentarians, both past and present, of different political parties. That means the Conservatives also. We have seen serious allegations that the leadership convention in which the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> was elected had foreign interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686242">Every leader in the House of Commons today is saying they recognize the seriousness of this, and they got the security clearance necessary to be informed by Canada's agencies, including the RCMP, about the personalities and information that are vital to know as a leader, except for one. The only leader who refuses to get a security clearance is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation>.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686243">Does that surprise people? It should, actually. Yes, the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> was the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who was held in contempt. Yes, he continues to play an abuse of power on the floor of the House of Commons, which is ultimately leading to challenges for all of us as parliamentarians. Yes, he has been manipulating the floor and concurrence reports to take control over standing committees in the last week. We have witnessed that on at least two occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686244">Now, we even get Conservatives who stand up on points of order to try to censor the types of things I am saying in the House, because they do not like to hear the truth. The truth is that the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> owes it to Canadians to get that security clearance, and if he is not going to get that security clearance, then he had better tell Canadians why not and tell Canadians what he is hiding. I believe that he is hiding something from Canadians, and that is the reason he does not want to get that security clearance, yet Canadians have a right to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686245"> What is it about the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>'s past, or is it strictly in regard to the leadership?

It is highly irresponsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686246">I go back in terms of the motion itself, because the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> has chosen to play this multi-million dollar game. As a direct result of his behaviour, we are not able to deal with important issues that are affecting Canadians throughout the country. The leader of the Conservative Party has made the decision to put his self-interest and the interests of the Conservative Party of Canada ahead of Canadians, and that is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686247">I think collectively the Conservatives need to start listening to what the experts are saying, in terms of what their expectation is as an opposition party, not just as Conservatives, and think of their roles as parliamentarians. They should recognize the abuse that we are witnessing every day, for weeks, and start holding their own <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> accountable to their own caucus, if not all Canadians. If the Conservatives are not prepared to do that, at the very least, let us get the leader sharing with Canadians why he refuses to get security clearance and why he has chosen to be held, from my perspective, in borderline contempt of the House of Commons by not allowing work on issues like the Citizenship Act; the military court and the civilian court for sexual complaints, which would be dealt with through Bill <Document DbId="12960457" Type="3">C-66</Document>; the online harms act to protect our children; the rail and marine safety legislation to support supply lines; or the fall fiscal statement.</ParaText>

Does he think it is a game that $400 million of taxpayer money has been given in conflicts of interest, sometimes to companies that cabinet ministers are invested in? Does he think it is a game that, contrary to the government's own rules that when it wrongly gives out money, it has to get it back, the government has gotten zero taxpayer dollars back? Does he think it is a game to keep hiding the truth of these documents from Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686276">When I think about the incredible responsibility of being a member of Parliament and being able to stand in this place, especially during weeks like this, as we lead up to Remembrance Day, I think of those who have fought throughout the course of our history in world wars and conflicts. I think of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice while trying to keep the peace around the world, defending democracy and standing up for the rule of law, human rights and human dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686277">I think about that often as I stand here. I think of the blood that has been spilled, the lives that have been lost and the families who have been decimated by war to allow us the privilege, all 338 of us and those who have come before us, to stand up in this place and defend the values they fought for. We can never repay those sacrifices. However, it is incumbent upon us to treat this place with the respect and reverence it deserves because of the bloodshed that happened in order for us to be able to do that. That is our responsibility as parliamentarians, </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686278">The context of what we are talking about today is the obstruction of documents and the lack of respect for this institution. We are talking about the fact that Parliament is here to function in what is supposed to be a functioning democracy, yet we have a government that is obstructing the will, the right and the privilege of Parliament. It is doing so because it does not want to turn over documents that Parliament has rightly asked for and requested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686279">This obstruction is an affront to democracy and to the very values that many fought and died for in defending this institution before us. I do not think it is the right tribute to be paying to them, quite frankly. This standoff has now effectively been going on for a month, yet the government has talked about the fact that it is not going to hand over these documents. Of the ones that have been handed over, many were redacted. We are aware, for example, that there are 11,000 documents from the Department of Justice that have not been handed to the parliamentary law clerk, not to mention all the other documents related to this SDTC scandal that have not been sent to the parliamentary law clerk for Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686280">Innovation and Science is where this whole scandal started. What conversations were going on between department officials? We know that there were some taped conversations, and we know Doug McConnachie, who came before the ethics committee, spoke on tape about how upset the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was that this was going on. He talked about this being on a sponsorship scandal level. The sponsorship scandal was $40 million, and it took down the Chrétien-Martin government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686281">This is a $400-million scandal in which insiders, who were connected to and appointed by the Liberal Party, were free to make decisions, regardless of any conflicts. There were many conflicts, but they did not care about them. These insiders were benefiting and funnelling taxpayer money to their own companies, to the tune of $400 million. My wife's Uncle Jackie was killed in a Lancaster bomber on his last mission over Poland, defending democracy and the rule of law. He and millions of other Canadians have fought for this country and defended democracy and those rights I spoke about earlier.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686283">It is absolutely absurd that we are in this position today, especially from a government and <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said in 2015 that they were going to be open and transparent by default. Every one of the ministerial letters he sent reminded ministers that they were to be open and transparent by default. What did that mean? Maybe there were good intentions at the time, but after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government, we see that it is not open and transparent by default.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686284"> It is not just with this scandal; there have been other scandals. The Winnipeg lab documents scandal is the one that stands out for me. The Liberals were going to take the Speaker to court in order to protect those documents from being publicly released and given to parliamentarians after a very similar situation occurred where Parliament ordered documents to be handed over. They prorogued Parliament. That is how bad this scandal was and how bad they did not want the information to come out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686285">Here we are again in not the same but a closely similar situation to what we were dealing with before. It speaks to contempt of Parliament, the decline in democracy. The fact is, this is a government that holds this place in contempt every chance it gets, and we are in this standoff now because we and other parties in this place are trying to do the right thing. I believe the Speaker did the right thing in his ruling regarding the privileges of the members of this place, which are paramount and supreme in this land when it comes to calling for document production. He made the right decision. That is why we are in this place today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686286">I want to focus on the context of what I said about those who defended democracies, those who stood up for the rule of law, those who defended human rights and human dignity, because we are heading into a very critical weekend. The most important day of the calendar year is Remembrance Day. That is arguable, but that is my opinion.

I see the member for <Affiliation DbId="278403" Type="2">Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte</Affiliation> has been there, but 99 hands would go up, because if they trained at Base Borden, many a time they would end up in downtown Barrie at the Queens Hotel. </ParaText>

There were roughly 30,000 people at Vimy Ridge celebrating the 100th anniversary of that great Canadian battle. I knew Craig was there, I was not sure how I was going to find him and the students among 30,000 people. All of a sudden I heard faint voices in the crowd yelling my name.

              <ParaText id="8686298"> We are talking about veterans who fought for this institution to function, who fought for democracy and fought for the rule of law. There are a few I want to mention in the short time that I have. Marcel Vigneault, who is the president of the Barrie Legion, is doing great things with outreach to veterans and their families; Phil George is the past president; and Steve Glover is the public relations officer. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="278403" Type="2">Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte</Affiliation> knows Steve very well. He is one of the historians at the Barrie Legion. He does a terrific job with commemoration and making sure that not just the legion but our whole area in Simcoe County is aware of that military heritage. I cannot say enough about Fern Taillefer as the first VP. He is the veterans service officer. Fern will be front and centre, I am sure, at the Barrie Remembrance Day parade as the sergeant-at-arms leading the ceremony that day. Tim Shaughnessy is the second VP. There is, of course, Judi Giovannetti who is a conflict resolution officer there and a former district commander of the Royal Canadian Legion. They do some great work there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686299">The Innisfil Legion will be having its ceremony on Sunday. Denis Mainville is the president there. It will be in Lefroy. About three or four years ago the member for <Affiliation DbId="278403" Type="2">Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte</Affiliation> and I started a poppy launch campaign. We invited people from all over the county, politicians, to amplify the start of the poppy campaign. We held it about two weeks ago when the poppy launch was initiated. We had the honour of presenting, on behalf of the Ambassador of Kuwait, a Kuwait service medal, to Denis because he served in the Persian Gulf War. The mayor of Innisfil, Lynn Dollin, was the one who presented it and pinned it on Denis. It was a really special moment. Again, that is all part of that military heritage. Laurie Sprink is the vice-president of the Innisfil Legion and Olga Cherry is the second vice-president. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686300"> Of course, there will also be the Sandycove veterans I mentioned earlier. We have a terrific ceremony happening on Sunday afternoon. Fred White is the president, and I cannot say enough about Ted Gemmell and the work that he has done, really, in putting on this ceremony. Hundreds and hundreds of people from the Sandycove Acres community will be at that Remembrance Day ceremony. There is something special this year. This is Marilyn Sehn and her volunteers. They started this in the summer, and they have crocheted and knitted poppies to honour military members, past and present. All of that will be on display at the Sandycove Acres Remembrance Day ceremony on Sunday, and it happens at two o'clock. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686301">The Innisfil ceremony is going to be happening on Monday. I know that the Innisfil ideaLAB and Library is holding a special presentation on November 9 from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the branch in Cookstown, telling stories of veterans from the town of Innisfil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686302">When we talk about those stories, I cannot help but speak of Brigadier-General John Hayter, who served in the Canadian Forces from 1951 to 2009. In 1952, General Hayter joined the Grey and Simcoe Foresters, of which I am an honorary member. At the age of 18, he began training at CFB Borden, and then headed over to the Korean War. Just this past summer, the City of Barrie renamed a community centre, the Southshore Community Centre, as the General John Hayter Southshore Community Centre. This is a fitting tribute for a man who has dedicated so much to his community and so much of his life to this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686304">I mentioned Craig Froese, the Nantyr Shores teacher who does great work with young people.

              <ParaText id="8686305">We are so lucky, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278430" Type="2">Simcoe—Grey</Affiliation> and I. We have Peacekeepers Park in Angus, which has been there for a long time; it is a tremendous tribute to those who have kept the peace around the world. There are memorial walls. There are LAVs. It really is a destination. I encourage anybody from across this country who is passing through Angus, Ontario, which is just next to Base Borden, to visit Peacekeepers Park and pay tribute to those peacekeepers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686306">It has not only been Fern Taillefer, in the Canadian Association of Veterans in United Nations Peacekeeping, but also Bob George and Don Ward, who have done all the graphics displays in that park. They have just been incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686307">Of course, we have had those who have passed away in the service of our nation. As we head toward Remembrance Day, I think of Private Kevin McKay, who was 24; he was killed in Afghanistan two days before his tour was to end. Of course, I think of his Silver Cross Mother, Elizabeth, and his father, Fred. I think of them as we head toward Remembrance Day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686308">Sapper Brian Collier, who died in 2010, grew up in Bradford. I think of his mom, Carol, and his father, Jim, who attended the poppy launch a couple of years ago. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686309">This is the 100th anniversary of the RCAF. As I said earlier, we have a proud tradition at Base Borden because it is the home, the birthplace of the RCAF. This year marked a very special centennial celebration at Base Borden, with the addition of the Ad Astra monument, “to the stars”, and it really was the community that came together. I want to commend Wayne Hay and Jamie Massie for the work that they did. We know that 133,000 aircrew trained at Base Borden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686310">As we get into the weekend, as we get closer to Remembrance Day, poppies are being sold all over Simcoe County. Tomorrow, for example, at nine o'clock, I am going to be at the LCBO in Alcona for a couple of hours with members from the Innisfil Legion to sell poppies. Every dollar that is raised in that poppy campaign will go toward helping veterans and their families. I want to give a special tribute to the cadets, Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Vents, high school students, veterans and many other members of our community who have kept that legacy alive. They are out there selling poppies so that our veterans can be looked after in the way that they have earned and the way that they deserve.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686345">Madam Speaker, that is probably the greatest news I have heard all week. That was very well done by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278418" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>; I thank him so much. It puts a big smile on my face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686346"> I also want to acknowledge my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278574" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation>, who just gave a very compassionate and passionate speech and did an excellent job. He stole a bunch of my thunder, so I guess I will be somewhat sticking to the reason we are really here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686347"> I am honoured to represent the people of Essex and to address the House today. I will discuss the ruling of the Speaker regarding the production of documents ordered by the House on the scandal involving Sustainable Development Technology Canada. The Liberal government refuses to comply with an order from the House to produce unredacted documents regarding the $400-million green slush fund scandal. This is truly a disheartening example of governance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686348"> Again, I want to highlight the government's mishandling of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, which is often called the green slush fund. The program was created in 2001 to support innovation and sustainable technologies, and it ran smoothly under both Liberal and Conservative governments until the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686349">It is unacceptable that the Liberals refused to hand over all the documents related to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s green slush fund to the RCMP within the required 14 days. I, along with my colleagues, am frustrated by the lack of transparency, which only fuels distrust and frustration among Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686350"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>-appointed board began approving funding for companies where executives had clear conflicts of interest with SDTC members who were already receiving money from the board and were still appointed to it despite knowledge of the conflicts. This is truly unbelievable. Governance standards at the fund quickly collapsed under the leadership of the new chair, Annette Verschuren. Following whistle-blower allegations of financial mismanagement, the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner each launched separate investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686351"> The government's sheer lack of attention to detail is staggering, leading to avoidable errors and costly oversights at every turn. The negligence not only wastes taxpayers' dollars but also undermines the public's trust in its ability to govern effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686352"> After nine years of the NDP-Liberals, the situation is so bad that there are now 1,400 homeless encampments in Ontario alone. In my riding of Essex, I am constantly hearing about the struggles my constituents face regarding the cost of living. Last month, CBC reported on how homelessness is increasing in the Windsor—Essex area. According to Jeanie Diamond-Francis, manager of community services for County of Essex, the need for affordable housing in that county is “consistently” growing. The latest number of people experiencing homelessness in the region is over 900, and that is only capturing people who are experiencing such homelessness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686353"> While many Canadians are struggling with rising housing and food costs, it is deeply disappointing that we are still talking about the Liberal government's $400-million slush fund scandal. The Liberals do not care about everyday Canadians; they care only about making their insider friends richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686354">However, it is not just my constituents who are struggling; Canadians across the country are struggling more than ever. Food Banks Canada's 2024 poverty report card shows that almost 50% of Canadians feel financially worse off compared to last year, while 25% of Canadians are experiencing food insecurity. On top of this, Food Banks Canada reported that the cost of living has become so high that there has been a 50% increase in food bank visits since 2021. As a direct consequence of the Liberal government's inflationary spending and taxes, millions of Canadians are struggling to keep their head above water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686355">New research from the Salvation Army shows that nearly one-third of Canadians continue to feel pessimistic about the future of their personal finances, while 25% of Canadians continue to be extremely concerned about having enough income to cover their basic needs. The Salvation Army also reported that nearly 75% of Canadians face challenges managing limited financial resources, which has contributed to a wave of Canadians who, for financial reasons, continue to deprioritize seeking medical health. For this reason, Food Banks Canada downgraded the Liberal government's grade of B in 2023 to a D minus in 2024.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686356"> Whether it is the stress of an uncertain economy, increased living expenses or inflation, Canadians are in urgent need of assistance. Nevertheless, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appears more disconnected from the realities that ordinary Canadians face.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686357">The Auditor General has made it clear that both the former and current Liberal industry ministers are responsible for this debacle as they failed to properly oversee contracts awarded to Liberal insiders. This lack of oversight has severely undermined public trust, particularly at a time when transparency and accountability are more important than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686358"> A scandal involving the misappropriation and transfer of $400 million in public funds to political insiders has engulfed the Liberal government. The Liberals are focused on defending their own interests, while working Canadians bear the expense, rather than tackling these pressing challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686359"> It is understandable that Canadians are beginning to recognize the NDP-Liberal administration for what it is: a government that rewards its allies while making life more difficult for families. Costs, taxes and corruption have all increased throughout the past nine years. In addition to mismanaging public funds and giving preference to their political supporters, the Liberals have burdened Canadians with policies like the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686360"> Canadians have to deal with the fact that they are paying more and receiving less. For example, after nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, the Canadian dream is lost. The dream of owning a home is slipping away from countless Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686361">As I said earlier, I hear from my constituents every day about how they are grappling with the harsh reality of affording basic necessities. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to lower the price of housing, rents and mortgages, which have since then doubled. Middle-class Canadians are forced to live in tent encampments in nearly every city across Canada. Before the Liberal government in 2015, it took 25 years to pay off a mortgage. Now it takes 25 years just to save up for a down payment. Things have gotten so bad that some families have been forced into 90-year mortgages that they will never pay off.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686362"> A woman in my riding reached out to me in desperation this year. She had one very touching story. She is a mother who gets up, works, prepares dinner and then goes to bed, just to do the same thing all over again. She said there are a lot of bills, and she is having a hard time making ends meet. Despite her best efforts to shield her kids from the stress, she is forced to tell them that she cannot even keep the lights on because of the $2,000 monthly rent. She lives within her means, works hard and pays her taxes, yet the government that promised to support her is making things more difficult for her. She is not alone in feeling this way, and she is drowning. Many people in my riding and across Canada are having the same difficulties, and they are worthy of better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686363">The NDP-Liberal government's preference for rewarding its political allies over tackling the problems that ordinary Canadians face is becoming more and more obvious. Costs have increased, taxes have increased and corruption has spread unchecked over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686364"> The Liberals have not only mismanaged public funds, but also increased the cost of life for Canadians by enacting measures like the carbon tax. Canadians are getting less in exchange or paying more for everything including groceries, gas and heating. This is the unpleasant truth that many families, both in Essex and nationwide, must deal with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686365"> A government that prioritizes the demands of its constituents before those of its wealthy friends is long overdue. The growing cost of living is a major issue for all Canadians, but things are just going to get worse. For already struggling families, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s proposal to double the carbon tax by 2030 will only make matters worse. Despite our repeated calls for a carbon tax election on this side of the House, we continue to be bogged down in document cover-ups rather than tackling the underlying problems. The idea that Canadians receive larger carbon refunds than they pay in taxes is one of the most common myths we encounter, and the carbon tax raises the cost of everything, particularly food.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8686366">In my riding of Essex, I have been deeply involved in the community for many years, even serving as a municipal councillor before coming here. Local government works because it operates with transparency by default. Every council meeting and committee session is open to the public, except in rare, exceptional cases. Everything else is accessible and transparent. Local governments would not survive long if they were as closed up as the Liberals have been with their green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686367">Trust in every political system, whether municipal, provincial or federal, is based on accountability and transparency. The people should not have to put up with being kept in the dark, particularly when taxpayer funds are being mismanaged. How harmful a lack of transparency can be is demonstrated by the Liberals' failure to be transparent about the $400-million slush fund scandal, which funnelled money to political insiders. In local politics, we are aware that leaders are promptly held responsible when the public loses faith in them. At the federal level, the same ought to hold true. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686368">As I mentioned in my speech just over a week ago, the heart of the issue is the Auditor General's finding that Liberal appointees allocated $400 million in taxpayers' money to their own companies, resulting in 186 documented conflicts of interest. Transparency is desperately needed, and this is more than simply a scandal. It is a breach of the confidence that Canadians have in their government. This money could have gone back into the pockets of hard-working Canadians or toward beneficial programs that help our communities. This money could have been used to support neighbourhood projects, support the growth of small enterprises or lessen the financial strain on families dealing with growing expenses. It is a lost chance that may have had significant impact on the lives of regular people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686369">Again, we are talking about $400 million in taxpayer funds that may have been wasted or stolen while everyday Canadians struggle to afford food, heating and housing. This situation is unbearable, especially when so many are suffering due to the government's lack of accountability. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686370">When discussing the Liberal green slush fund, in which $400 million from taxpayers has been spent, Conservatives focus on issues that actually affect Canadians. Rather than using taxpayers' dollars to enrich friends, my private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="11540871" Type="4">C-241</Document>, focuses on hard-working Canadians, specifically tradespeople, and how they are struggling to make ends meet. The purpose of Bill C-241 is to amend Canada's Income Tax Act to permit eligible apprentices and tradespeople who travel to a job site 120 kilometres from their primary residence to claim a tax deduction for their temporary relocation and travel expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686371">Despite being the backbone of our economy, these men and women are expected to work all over the region, giving up valuable family time to ensure that their kids have access to necessities like food and medicine. What do they receive in exchange? They receive a meagre $4,000 tax deduction, which is insufficient to pay for living expenses and transportation when living far away from home. In comparison to the millions the government is wasting on questionable, unaccountable projects, it is an insult. This goes beyond oversight. It is about acknowledging the needs of Canadians who are putting in a lot of effort to grow our nation, while the Liberals are squandering funds on vanity projects that do not actually advance the common good. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686372">Bill <Document DbId="11540871" Type="4">C-241</Document> is more than simply a fair travelling tradesperson's bill. It is about justice for the workers who drive our economy, and I am honoured to support them, particularly in light of the green slush fund incident and other instances where our tax dollars are being misspent. My Conservative colleagues and I are aware of the true issues, and I am determined to see that they are addressed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686373">The NDP-Liberals must put an end to their cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police. Only then can Parliament get back to its critical work of serving the interests of Canadians. Their continued obstruction is unacceptable. The division between those in government and regular Canadians who must deal with the fallout from such carelessness is only widened by this incident.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8686374"> If the Liberal government would only produce the records it has been required to release, Parliament could return to addressing the problems that are most important to Canadians, such as family and affordability. It is really that easy. The government could resume its task of addressing the growing cost of living that families in Essex and throughout the nation face if it put an end to this cover-up and turned over the proof to the authorities. Rather, the Liberals keep blocking progress, putting their personal interests ahead of the pressing needs of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686375">Helping Canadians make ends meet is what really matters. Therefore, it is time to end the secrecy. Why will NDP-Liberals not stop hiding behind the green slush fund and release the required documentation so Canadians can have the openness and accountability they deserve? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686376">We hear from dozens of people every day, regular Canadians, who are having a hard time making ends meet. Whether they are workers in Canada dealing with the rapidly rising cost of living or families in the Essex neighbourhood, they are battling insane food costs, expensive housing and a government that appears to be losing touch with reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686377">The Liberals, however, are still committed to supporting their political friends and allocating public funds to special interests and insiders, while abandoning regular Canadians to fend for themselves. It is now painfully obvious the government would rather enrich its own elite and the wealthy than deal with the problems hard-working Canadians face. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686378">The people of Essex and in communities across this country deserve better than a government that only looks out for itself. For over a month, the Liberals have offered shifting excuses for not complying with the House's clear demand for documents, despite knowing the House has full authority to require the release. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686379">Only our sensible Conservative colleagues will put an end to the turmoil and corruption, figure out what happened to the $400 million and provide some justice and clarity to the people of our nation. As we return to the privilege motion before us, it is not just about the production of documents. More importantly, it is about the message the government is sending to the entire country that corruption is acceptable and the mismanagement of public funds would be tolerated. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686380">Lastly, I want to note this is not a partisan issue. Weeks ago, the Speaker ruled on a question of privilege raised by the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">House leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>. His ruling confirmed what Conservatives have said all along, that the government violated the extensive powers of the House by failing to surrender crucial records related to SDTC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686381">In his ruling, the Speaker referenced page 985 of the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, affirming, “No statute or practice diminishes the fullness of that power rooted in House privileges unless there is an explicit legal provision to that effect”. This clearly establishes that the House has the inherent authority to compel the production of the documents vital to our oversight functions. We must ensure the House retains the authority to demand accountability from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686382">Ultimately, the Speaker of the House, the highest authority in Parliament, ruled that the government, specifically the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, was required to hand over the documents to Parliament. Even though the Speaker is a member of the Liberal Party, he upheld Parliament's authority. What action did the Prime Minister take? He acted as though he were above the law and Parliament. He disregarded the order and simply produced censored documents rather than following it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686383">As I close, I just want to echo the comments of so many of my colleagues today and thank every single veteran who has served and continues to serve. They have given me the opportunity to serve our great country of Canada. Without them, quite frankly, I would not be here and I would not have the opportunity to leave the world a better place than we found it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686405"> Madam Speaker, Parliament is still at a standstill after six weeks because the Liberals refused to turn over documents related to their Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, SDTC, or better known by Canadians now, more accurately, as the Liberal green slush fund. Common-sense Conservatives want transparency and accountability for Canadians about the Liberals' repeated pattern of entitled and immoral abuse of Canadian tax dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686406">None of the money belongs to government; it belongs to the people.

              <ParaText id="8686413">Common-sense Conservatives are here to hold the government accountable for its failures, corruption and wrongdoing. MPs request the documents for scrutiny, not only by the RCMP but also by members of Parliament, as is our duty to Canadians who sent us here to represent them. In response, government departments either outright refused to comply or heavily covered up the documents they did provide, using the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act to justify the hidden sections.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686414">The truth is that nothing within the House order justified such redactions. The House of Commons possesses absolute and unrestricted power on behalf of all Canadians, grounded in the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act, to order document production, unbound by statutory limits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686415">After the government blocked out and withheld the requested documents, our common-sense Conservative House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278258" Type="2">Regina—Qu'Appelle</Affiliation>, brought forward the motion because MPs' rights to get information for Canadians had been violated by the government's refusal to comply. Personally, I hate the use of the customary word “privilege” for such debates because, for me, what it is actually about is my duty as an elected representative and the rights of my constituents to know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686416"> While it is sad to say, the scandals and cover-ups of the current government are no longer surprising. After nine years, the Liberals have shown shocking disregard for transparency and for adherence to the rule of law. It has never been more clear that the government, backed by its accomplices in the NDP, is not worth the cost or the government's corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686417">Of the billion dollars involved in scandals, nearly half is now in question for being distributed inappropriately. That is no small amount, especially when Canadians are struggling with historically high living costs and financial burdens because of the federal government's inflationary tax-and-spend agenda. The $400 million in tax dollars could have been used to aid vulnerable people, stop crime, build homes or fix the budget, or it could have been kept in the pockets of Canadians in the first place. Instead, the NDP-Liberal coalition is digging in to carry on its cover-up while blaming everyone else, as usual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686418">Five months ago, the independent Auditor General revealed that nearly half a billion of those tax dollars were funnelled by officials to their own companies through improperly awarded contracts. The AG found there were 186 conflicts of interest in the corrupt in-and-out scam among politically appointed senior government officials and superwealthy elites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686419">It is particularly appalling that during the six weeks of the NDP-Liberals' cover-up, Food Banks Canada's new report indicated that food bank use is record-high, worse than last year, which had already set a horrifying record. Two million Canadians are forced to go to food banks in just one month. The most heartbreaking part is that a third of the visits are by people desperate to feed children. This is all caused by the NDP-Liberals' inflationary taxes, spending and red tape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686420">St. Paul's food bank in Lakeland has served over 5,000 adults and nearly 4,000 children so far in 2024, in a town with fewer than 6,000 people. The Vermilion Food Bank struggles with a 7% increase in the number of adults and a 46% increase in the number of children it is supporting this year compared to last year. Food bank users report in conversations that the cost of food, housing, utilities, power, and fuel affects and hurts them the most. After nine years, the NDP-Liberals have made everything too expensive for everyone, while they are making out just fine for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686421">Ten years ago, a headline from The New York Times read, “Life in Canada, Home of the World's Most Affluent Middle Class”. That was in 2014, under the former Conservative government, when Canada had the richest middle class in the world and the median income was higher than in the United States. Today, Canadian workers earn $34,000 less than their American counterparts after the Liberal tax hikes and economic vandalism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686422">What happened in 2015? The Liberals came to power. Today, they have hurt Canadians everywhere. Life has never been so difficult for everyday Canadians, but it has never been so good for rich, elite NDP-Liberal buddies and cronies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686423"> It was only after the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked Liberal board members were installed that the slush fund began approving excessive amounts in tax dollars for itself while hiding the corrupt redirection to companies owned by board members. In fact, SDTC was deemed in good standing before the board members were appointed by the Liberals. Even though the Prime Minister was warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair, she was still appointed to chair the board, which did not even have the minimum number of members required by law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686424">It is really obvious that the government has lost its moral compass, that it knew there were conflicts of interest and that it was warned. It just did not care.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686425"> All of this could be resolved right now if any Liberal would stand up and announce that all documents Parliament has requested will be produced, but they will not. Instead, they distract, evade, divide and gaslight. The blindingly obvious question is why. Canadians can be forgiven for suspecting that they are full of details the Liberals want to hide. Canadians are rightfully concerned about all of this Liberal corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686426">Kyle from Lakeland said, “I'm absolutely horrified that people still put trust in this Liberal government. It's very hard for people to buy gas and groceries nowadays and I'm just absolutely upset.” Nick from Lakeland said, “Not only are Canadians fed up with [the Prime Minister] and his party's actions, they are losing faith in the very institutions of freedom and democracy, which are being made a mockery of by this government.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686427">It was the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who victoriously said in 2015, “Sunny ways, my friends, sunny ways.... You want a Prime Minister who knows that if Canadians are to trust their government, their government needs to trust Canadians, a PM who understands that openness and transparency means better, smarter decisions.” After nine years, they are worse and dumber decisions, are they not? After nine years, a flailing PM and the Liberals are the opposite of everything they claimed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686428">This ongoing cover-up speaks to the very core of Canadian democracy and the accountability we owe to the people that each of us represent here. It is not just about some bureaucratic documents, it us not about some parliamentary procedure, it is about upholding the principles of good governance that are crucial to maintain already almost non-existent public trust in government and elected representatives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686429">The ongoing redactions and refusals to release key documents reveal much about the real character of the government and its allies. These are not the actions of people with nothing to hide. One of the worst offenders is, of course, the radical, previously arrested <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>. He continues, even today, to profit off the corruption in his government's green slush fund. Cycle Capital received hundreds of millions of dollars from the slush fund, but the environment minister lobbied the Liberals on behalf of his company, Cycle Capital, nearly 25 times before he was elected in 2019. One of the Cycle Capital board members now admits to committee that several of her companies received millions of dollars from the slush fund while she sat on the board of the slush fund. Still today, the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> holds interests in Cycle Capital while it receives tax money. Talk about a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686430">No wonder the NDP-Liberals are working so hard to cover up this massive scandal. Of course, it is far from the first time the Liberals have breached Parliament's and government's rules. Take the Winnipeg lab scandal, where scientists gave a hostile regime classified information from Canada's top virus lab for foreign intervention. What was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response to the House's demand for transparency? He chose to sue the Speaker to prevent disclosure and then called an election to try to get away with it all, even though the Speaker had formally reprimanded the Public Health Agency of Canada in an unprecedented act for a Speaker in nearly a century. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686431">Then there's the net-zero accelerator, another costly Liberal sham that fails to deliver, just like almost every single thing they say on the environment. Similar to the Liberals' housing accelerator that does not actually build houses, the net-zero accelerator is not about proven emissions reduction. According to the environment commissioner, $8 billion was handed out to ineligible companies that lacked any real emissions reduction plans or outcomes. Only six months ago, his report highlighted that this money was “not part of any coherent...policy on decarbonization”. He reported that the vast majority of funded projects had no formal commitment to cut emissions by any specified amount. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686432">Now, to no one's surprise, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite new economic adviser, carbon tax Mark Carney, was also flagged in a potential conflict of interest with the government and his company Brookfield Asset Management, which could involve billions of Canadians' money. The Globe and Mail reports the government is in talks to give Brookfield $10 billion of Canadian tax money, where carbon tax Carney is the chair and holds $1 million in stock options. This screams conflict of interest, but once again the Prime Minister turns a blind eye because this kind of behaviour always starts at the top. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686433">It is outrageous that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave carbon tax Carney the position to advise on economic and fiscal policy when it does relate to the very company he chairs, but he has been shielded by it so that he will not have to declare his conflict of interest being a political adviser. It is clear that the Liberals know he is in a conflict of interest, but still appointed him and deliberately hide the facts from Canadians. That begs the question of how much he will personally profit from in his conflict of interest with Brookfield and the government. While that is obvious to all Canadians, the NDP and Liberals worked hard to protect him from answering questions at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686434">Despite what the Liberals claim, pushing for transparency is not a threat to privacy or due process. It is a call for accountability. Including the Privacy Commissioner and other officials in the investigation is a necessary step toward a fair and comprehensive review. Of course, this is all a recurring pattern. Time and again, information is kept from Canadians and the official opposition as the government prevents Conservatives from getting that information for Canadians about government fiscal mismanagement and scandals. Canadians deserve to know exactly what governments are doing with their money and exactly what the hell is going on here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686435"> Unlike many officials, the Privacy Commissioner did provide unredacted documents and walked the talk on transparency that aligns with principles of public trust and accountability. This is notable as the Privacy Commissioner is perhaps the most qualified authority on the delicate balance between privacy and transparency. He knows the complexities and potential risks, but ultimately found it reasonable and responsible to release them in full. He signals a commitment to transparency and trustworthiness that is in stark contrast to the persistent opposition from the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686436">The NDP-Liberals claim the release could infringe on privacy rights or cause other issues, while they themselves perpetuate harm to the public's trust. If the Privacy Commissioner, who is a literal expert in privacy rights, believes unredacted disclosures are appropriate, then it is fair and necessary to question the sincerity of the government's resistance. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686445">Despite all the Liberals' claims, they repeatedly opt for secrecy over openness and avoidance over accountability.

              <ParaText id="8686457"> Madam Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the experiences Canadians are having. Let me talk about that. Due to global inflation, Canadians have faced a lot of cost of living increases and affordability issues. While the Conservatives wanted us to have austerity measures, we continue to invest in Canadians, and our actions, our programs and our policies have helped Canadians. Inflation has come down to a historic low of 1.6%. The Canadian consumer price index has risen to a 30-month high. Interest rates have been cut four times. The stock exchange, where a lot of Canadians invest, which lost in 2022, year to date has made 18%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686458">Canadians did face a lot of issues due to global inflation, and our actions have brought back economic prosperity. Going forward, we are going to look much better, so that the IMF has projected that Canada will be the best-performing economy among all G7 countries. I would like to have the member's opinion on that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686459">Madam Speaker, the member of Parliament seems like a very kind gentleman, and I appreciate his demeanour in the House of Commons, which is certainly one that I cannot claim to have, and the way in which he made his comments. However, I would just say that it is exactly that kind of answer that Canadians watch and that makes them think elected people, particularly government members, literally have no idea what is going on in their real lives. He can rattle off a bunch of cherry-picked stats in the context that he wants to have them, but every single day, Canadians are losing hope for their futures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686460">Every single day, young people know they are staring down a future that, for the first time in Canadian history, looks worse than it did for the generations before theirs. Every single day, people are making choices between essentials that they need and that are not luxuries in our big, cold country. They are deciding between food and how to heat their homes, whether they can drive, whether they can take their kids to any kind of recreational activity and whether they have a little extra to support their senior relatives. People cannot find jobs. They cannot find homes. This is what is actually going on in the everyday lives of Canadians, and I just think it is answers like that member's that show exactly why, in the next election, if given the chance, Canadians are going to say that time is up.</ParaText>

They help fuel and power our country, and we need them more than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686465">The member is exactly right. Nine years of coercive chaos and corruption, increasing crime and scandals have Canadians wondering exactly what the heck is going on here. It is also nine years of layers of patterns of anti-energy policies, taxes and laws that have driven billions of dollars into the United States, including jobs, money and technology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686466">The Liberals' latest wacko plan to be the first among all oil and gas-producing jurisdictions in the world to cap oil and gas in our country helps the United States.

It is punishing them with its carbon tax on everything, while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> jet-sets across the country for vacations and photo ops, and does nothing to help Canadians who are struggling just to feed themselves and their families and to put enough gas in the car to get to work.

To everyone watching, I am very fortunate to have Base Borden in Simcoe-Gray. Not only do I represent all the people there, but I represent the largest training base. The military is an important part of our community, and not just for what its members do in the military, but for what they do for all of us citizens and civilians, whether it is by volunteering for hockey teams, baseball teams or whatever else. Hopefully, everyone has an opportunity to go to one of those services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686482">I am pleased to rise today to speak to the amended motion concerning the Liberal green slush fund. Known to some as Sustainable Development Technology Canada, this fund has become arguably the biggest transfer of contracts and tax dollars to Liberal friends since the sponsorship scandal, which toppled the Paul Martin government. However, there is one fundamental difference between then and now: It was not as hard to make ends meet back in 2004.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686483">While Liberals rewarding their friends is nothing new, back in 2004 people just saw it as business as usual. In 2004, yearly inflation was 1.27%. Most people had jobs, and this allowed them to pay their bills and save for a vacation and for their future and children's future. The Liberals' waste was frustrating, definitely, but that is just how Liberals do business. People were not struggling as they watched Liberals line their friends' pockets with tax dollars back then. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686484">Let us fast-forward to 2024 to see how things have changed. We have tent cities in the major centres, and now they are even in small towns in my riding. Crime rates have soared. Daily essentials are no longer affordable since double-digit inflation has driven up the price of almost everything. It is difficult to save for family vacations. Liberals here in the House even mock Canadians' desire for a great summer road trip. It is near impossible to save for retirement or to put money away for our children's future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686485">A good government would do whatever it could to lower the cost of living for its citizens, but we do not have a good government here in Canada. The Liberal-NDP government instead raises taxes and takes more money from all of us, making it harder and harder for a regular middle-class family to get ahead. It takes all that money and hands some of it back to certain targeted groups, and then screams that Conservatives are going to all of a sudden take it all away. This is how Liberals operate: take from everyone and then throw some pennies out to Canadians and have them fight it out among themselves. “Tax, divide and conquer” is the ethos of today's Liberal Party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686486">However, Canadians, now more than ever, see through this strategy. Canadians who have done everything they were told to do are finally fed up. Getting an education, working hard, being honest, obeying the law, paying taxes and then being rewarded seems like a quaint idea. Instead, Canadians watch more and more of their paycheques get taken by a federal Liberal-NDP government that continues to get bigger while it spends their hard-earned money on pet projects and sweetheart deals for its friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686487">In 2004, Liberal corruption and mismanagement annoyed Canadians. In 2024, it has made them angry. The most surprising thing about this is that Liberal-NDP government members seem to be in shock as to why Canadians are so angry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686488">When I last spoke to the green slush fund a couple weeks ago, I outlined that this was just another in a long line of Liberal scandals. There was WE Charity and the billion dollars it was given after hiring the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s brother and mother. There was SNC-Lavalin, which had the Prime Minister personally intervening to help it get out of fraud charges for the low cost of $100,000 in donations to the Liberal Party. There was also the Aga Khan scandal, which saw the Prime Minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="299807" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278109" Type="2">St. John's South—Mount Pearl</Affiliation> and their families get a $271,000 vacation in exchange for $50 million in tax dollars. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8686489">We cannot forget the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation taking money from a Beijing-connected billionaire in exchange for future considerations from the Communist government. I barely even got to touch on the $237 million that former Liberal MP Frank Baylis got for ventilators, which may not have even been delivered, or GC Strategies, which got $20 million to build the arrive scam, which was supposed to only cost $80,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686490">Most Canadians are not better off after nine years of Liberal corruption and mismanagement but their insiders and friends are way better off, friends like the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation>'s former boss, the founder and owner of Cycle Capital, Andrée-Lise Méthot. While Ms. Méthot sat on the board of the green slush fund, she helped herself to $114 million in tax dollars, which she funnelled to companies she had invested in. Her then-senior adviser, the current Minister of the Environment, had 25 meetings with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Department of Industry to help seal the deal. Ms. Méthot says her company tripled in value during this time. We know that the environment minister remains a shareholder in this company to this day. He will not say how much he owns but he certainly has personally benefited from this overt corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686491">It may be hard to believe for many of us but the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> was actually a very wanted commodity by the federal Liberals in 2019. How better to demonstrate our adherence to the climate change agenda than by recruiting one of the most radical environmentalists out there? Despite some association with Quebec separatists and his public support for socialism, the Liberal Party was desperate to improve its image among eco-activists, so landing the present environment minister was a challenge the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> relished, but what did it cost?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686492">How many of the 25 meetings were also about recruiting the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> to run for the Liberal Party? What was the price to get a rumoured separatist and committed socialist to become part of the pipeline-owning Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686493"> Canadians are frustrated. They are frustrated because, in Canada, for the longest time, we were told that if we work hard, we will get ahead, and that if we work hard and pay our taxes, we will be taken care of when we retire, but those promises have been broken. After nine years of the Liberal government, the Canada so many of us grew up in is gone. People are working harder than ever before. The price of housing and the commute to get to work have grown while the wages of the working people have stagnated in Canada. What is worse, the Liberal government has overseen the biggest increase in the cost of living since another Trudeau was prime minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686494">Under the Liberals, we pay more for groceries. We pay more for gas, for our home, for our family, and we drive longer to get to our job but since our wage has likely not increased much and the cost of everything has skyrocketed, our quality of life and the time we enjoy with our family have declined. This is a reality for many Canadians as they watch Liberals, their friends and insiders get multi-million dollar contracts and sweetheart perks they can only imagine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686495">Every day I get people in my riding either phoning or emailing the office saying how frustrated they are or how hard it is to get by. I say “to get by” because that is all. They have given up on getting ahead under the government; they just want to get by. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686496">I think of people like Carolyn, a senior in my riding. Carolyn turned 65 in March. She had been collecting CPP and expected to automatically receive OAS after her 65th birthday as her husband had. When May came and she had not received anything, she contacted Service Canada. She was told it does not necessarily start automatically for some people and that she needed to apply. Carolyn completed her application and submitted it. She was told that it would take over 100 days to process, so she waited. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8686497"> Over 100 days, in fact, she waited and nothing: crickets. She contacted Service Canada again and again, only to be told that she had missed completing one small section in her application. No one ever thought to tell her. Despite 100,000 new bureaucrats being hired since the Liberals took office, over 100 days went by and not one person at the Government of Canada thought it might be a good idea to reach out and let her know. She was told to start over, apply again and wait 100 more days. There was no “let's fill that section out together” or “let me fill it in for you” or “apply again, but we'll process it immediately because it's already been 100 days.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686498">She applied again from scratch, but she also contacted my office shortly thereafter to let us know how ridiculous this whole process was. We pushed on her behalf. Now she will be getting her arrears in five days, and regular payments will start at the end of this month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686499"> We have lots of stories like this about the frustration of dealing with the biggest, most expensive government in Canadian history. Carolyn faced an unresponsive bureaucracy for months to get the few hundred bucks she was entitled to as a senior, while Liberal friends and insiders continued to get millions of dollars in contracts and zero accountability. That is really why people are so frustrated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686500">What about people like Travis in my riding? Travis works hard. He pays his taxes. Travis is proud of his family. Travis has lived in Angus since 1996 and in the same home since 2007. Recently, though, there has been a lot of growth in this area, with many new developments taking place as people have left Toronto for slightly more affordable properties, and obviously better federal representation, and moved to Simcoe—Grey. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686501">There has been so much growth that Canada Post had to change postal codes. Inexplicably, it was the existing residents who were given new postal codes, instead of the people moving into the new developments. What is worse is that, when these residents began updating their new postal codes with their insurance companies, their rates jumped. In Travis's case, his home insurance went up 50% and his car went up 50% as well. That seemed bizarre, so my office investigated it further. It turns out the new postal codes put long-time rural residents like Travis into what is now considered an urban postal code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686502">Because crime is now out of control in our cities, thanks to the Liberals' soft-on-crime policies, insurance rates have skyrocketed. If we are lucky enough to have what is considered an urban postal code, our rates will have jumped as well, even if we are in the same house for many years. Since Canada Post is about as accountable as the Liberal government, Travis was stuck trying to appeal this rip-off to the ombudsman, but even they could not help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686503">There are hundreds of people in my riding who have faced that this year. I have been bombarded with calls because their insurance went up, but they have not moved. It is ridiculous right now because people are having a tough time getting by. It has been extremely frustrating and expensive, and it has been a hassle for all these hard-working people just trying to get ahead. All the while, Liberal insiders are getting millions of dollars, no questions asked. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686504">Liberal members pretend to be outraged as to why we are still talking about this matter. How dare opposition members take them to task over corruption and complete mismanagement? It is because of people like Travis and Carolyn, who play by the rules but have a harder and harder time getting ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686505">How about Colleen, another constituent of mine in Simcoe—Grey? She contacted my office back in March when the CRA sent her notice that she had an $8,000 debt dating back to 2017 for benefits she was not entitled to. CRA took issue with the fact that Colleen had said she was separated but was still living in the same house with her former partner. Life is really expensive for Canadians post-COVID, but even in 2017, it was difficult for those going through a divorce or a separation to get a new home.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="25">(1425)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8686506"> Colleen took the advice of her lawyer and, for financial reasons, remained in the lower level of the house until it could be sold. The sale took a year. Colleen is not the only person who has faced this sort of situation. I am sure some of the members in the House are aware of similar cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8686507">Colleen and her husband's separation was documented as of May 1, 2017. They began separate lives. They even had separate schedules to use the one kitchen in the home. Oddly, while the CRA came after her demanding $8,000 in payments, it accepted the date of separation for her now ex-husband, who was living at the same address.</ParaText>
