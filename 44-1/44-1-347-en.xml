Once again, the Bloc Québécois chose instead to turn its back on Quebeckers and support a government that has made their lives a misery for the past nine years. What did the Bloc get in return? It got nothing, not even the cancellation of the Liberal order that could wipe out Quebec's forestry industry. The reason is simple: The Bloc Québécois does not serve Quebeckers. It serves the Liberal Prime Minister. How very strange for a sovereignist party.</ParaText>

Trevor Tombe, economist, wrote that ” If Canada had simply kept pace with the U.S. over the past two years, our economy would be 8.5 percent larger”.

Over the past years, residents and leaders within Jasper have been exemplary in making sure they were doing everything they could to protect their community. This fire was a treetop fire. It jumped from treetop to treetop and threw flaming pine cones kilometres ahead of it, which is what set the burn. It is a result of climate change, climate change that he does not want to fight.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8577775">Mr. Speaker, today, we are debating the Liberal government again snubbing its nose at Parliament and at members of Parliament. A parliamentary committee rightfully requested documents on Sustainable Development Technology Canada, otherwise known as the $1-billion green slush fund. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577776">What we know already smells terrible, and I will get more into this. The Liberals produced documents, but what they presented was all censored, all blacked out. Why is this? We have to believe it would be even more incriminating for the Liberals than what we know already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577777"> The Auditor General found that 80% of the contracts she examined were awarded to people on the board. This equals $380 million. If we extrapolate that to the entire fund, it equals about $800 million, including the money in the contracts she did not examine. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577778">The Liberals have been known to be very extravagant in their spending, but one thing they decided to tighten up was the Auditor General's budget. Why would that be? It is because this office holds government to account, and the Liberals are not too keen about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577779">What happened? In 2019, the minister of industry appointed someone as chair of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, and this person's companies had received contracts, money from the government. The minister was warned not to do this, because it was improper. However, that does not seem to be of concern to the Liberals, and he went on to appoint the chair and other people on the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577780">What did members of the board do? They awarded contracts to each other for hundreds of millions of dollars. One appointment made by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was that of Andrée-Lise Méthot, who owned Cycle Capital. This was very curious. She received $250 million in grants for her company. That is a quarter of a billion dollars, and about half of that money was awarded when she was on the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577781">Someone very interesting worked for Ms. Méthot for many years as a lobbyist with Cycle Capital. This person lobbied the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberals for the company 25 times before getting elected. Who might that be? It is the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577782">We have heard in the House how the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> continues to have shares in this company. Do the redacted documents incriminate him and other Liberals? We do not know. Canadians have a right to be suspicious and to be concerned. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577783">The Liberals, who are kept in power by the NDP and Bloc, have a long rap sheet, right from the top down. I am sure the Speaker has taken blood tests. I have, and most people have. When someone gets a blood test, they get a sample of what is in the system and they can then find out if there is a disease. This right here, from what we can see and have seen, is throughout the body. What we see with this scandal is symptomatic right across the board. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577784">We saw that with the WE Charity. In June 2020, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that he had chosen the WE Charity to run the $912-million Canada student service grant. Why would he do this when there was already a system within government paid by taxpayers to run it? The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister's immediate family benefited from hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees. There was public uproar that led to the Liberals hastily cancelling the contract with the WE Charity. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8577800">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278547" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577801">I rise today to speak to a serious violation of the privileges of parliamentarians stemming from the government's refusal to comply with a Conservative motion passed on June 10 of this year. As the Speaker unequivocally stated, the House of Commons holds the undeniable right to compel production of documents necessary for fulfilling its duties. Exercising this right, we ordered the government, Sustainable Development Technology Canada and the Auditor General to submit specific documents within 30 days.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577802">The documents, created or dated since January 1, 2017, include all correspondence among government officials regarding SDTC, contribution and funding agreements involving SDTC, financial records of companies where current or former directors had ownership or financial interests, all conflict of interest declarations, minutes from the board of directors and project review committee meetings, all correspondence between directors and management, and additional documents used by the Auditor General in preparing her report presented to the House on June 4.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577803">Interestingly, the Liberals were the only party to vote against the motion. Now, over 30 days have passed since the adoption of the motion, and members of the House, along with Canadians, are still left questioning how the government's green slush fund improperly dispersed around $830 million in taxpayer dollars. The lack of compliance in providing requested documents completely undermines Parliament's ability to conduct a thorough oversight, especially regarding taxpayer money management and government programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577804">Such shortcomings erode public trust and hinder effective governance, something the Liberals are far too comfortable with. In a democratic system, it is paramount that the government remain accountable to the people it serves. The people are not here to serve the government. The ruling should serve as a wake-up call for the Liberal government to respect, once and for all, parliamentary protocols and to ensure transparency when using taxpayer money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577805">I want to remind the House of the mandate letter written by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself to Canadians in 2015, which expressed his deep commitment to our nation and gratitude to those who placed their trust in him. He stated, “I am committed to leading an open, honest government that is accountable to Canadians, lives up to the highest ethical standards, brings our country together, and applies the utmost care and prudence in the handling of public funds.” What an abject failure and what a joke on Canadians that was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577806">Fast-forward to today, and we see a stark contrast between those aspirational words and the actions of the government. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> were truly committed to the promises he made, he would stop evading accountability, listen to the concerns of the House and release all unredacted documents. Instead, the government is taking unprecedented steps to withhold information related to the green slush fund. All that the letter does is serve as a testament to his litany of broken promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577807">The motion follows the AG's damning and explosive report on the SDTC, also known as the Liberals' green slush fund. The Auditor General took only a sampling of the funding and found that 82% of that sample was marred by conflict of interest totalling $330 million. Clearly there are secrets that the Liberals do not want Canadians to uncover. I wonder why.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577808"> The Auditor General also found that SDTC did not follow conflict of interest policies in 90 cases, spent nearly $76 million on projects connected to the Liberals' friends appointed to run SDTC, spent $59 million on projects that were not allowed to have been awarded any money, and spent $12 million on projects that were both a conflict of interest and ineligible for funding. In one instance, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked SDTC chair siphoned off a whopping $217,000 to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577809">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew, and he refused to stop the Liberals' friends at SDTC from engaging in this blatant level of corruption. The AG made it clear that the blame for the scandal falls squarely on the Prime Minister's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders. There is no such thing anymore, under nine years of the current government, as ministerial accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577810">The scandal is not merely about mismanagement; it also raises serious concerns about how taxpayer money is being funnelled to Liberal insiders. The findings indicate a systemic failure in oversight and governance within SDTC. The AG pointed out that significant funds were allocated without proper scrutiny, allowing conflicts of interest to flourish. The implications extend beyond just financial mismanagement; they highlight a culture within the Liberal government that seems to prioritize loyalty and connection with insiders over transparency and accountability to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577811"> SDTC was intended to support innovative projects that would benefit Canadians, but instead appears to have been transformed into simply a tool for political patronage. The fact that 123 million dollars' worth of contracts were awarded inappropriately only compounds the concerns. How did the Liberals respond? They responded the only way they know how: mislead and deflect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577812">Just last week, the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">government House leader</Affiliation> posted a video in response to our motion demanding the release of the documents and exposing the massive corruption we have called upon the RCMP to investigate. Instead of addressing the elephant in the room, which is the misuse of taxpayers' money, the member resorted to denial and deflection, absurdly claiming that by insisting on transparency and accountability, the handing over of the documents, we as Conservatives are somehow attacking Canadian charter rights. This is a blatant attempt to shift focus away from the Liberals' reckless spending and corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577813">To clarify for those at home who might be puzzled by the member's comments, let me make it clear: The motion is solely about demanding the release of documents; it is not related to Canadian charter rights. Since when has anyone on the Liberal benches shown any real concern for defending the charter rights of Canadians? Where was the supposed commitment when the Liberals invoked the Emergencies Act in 2022, only to be severely embarrassed by Justice Mosley in his federal court ruling that claimed there were serious violations of the charter—</ParaText>

The company was also run by a former Liberal minister and the brother of a sitting Liberal member of Parliament. That essentially took almost 500 jobs from the town of Grand Banks in Newfoundland and awarded it to another group. Luckily, we exposed it and we were able to get those jobs back for the town of Grand Banks.

              <ParaText id="8577849">Sustainable Development Technology Canada is a federally funded not-for-profit that approves and disburses millions of dollars in funds annually to clean technology companies. SDTC was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies that promote sustainable development. It is an arm's-length, not-for-profit organization that was created to support projects that develop and demonstrate new technologies that address issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577850">It should be noted that in 2017, SDTC received a clean bill of health. All the findings at that point showed that everything was above board. Then along came the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers. They hand-picked the board members and the chair, who then proceeded to spend almost a billion dollars of taxpayer funds. There were 186 times that the Auditor General found conflicts of interest, meaning the board of directors and the chair hand-picked where funding was going. Some of that funding went to their very own companies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577851">This House ordered an investigation and that the papers be delivered so the RCMP could have a look to see if indeed there was some criminality involved. That was an order from the Speaker. That was an order from this House. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ordered that those papers would be delivered, but they would be heavily redacted so that no investigation could be done. It begs the question: What more are the Liberals hiding? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577852">Up to that point, SDTC continued to operate, but all of a sudden, its annual reports have ceased and it is refusing to answer questions. Over $330 million of taxpayers' money were directed to companies where the very board members who approved the funding had clear conflicts of interest. Additionally, the Auditor General found that the board authorized another $59 million in projects that were beyond the foundation's legal mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577853">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked board members, including the chair, found themselves in positions where they could directly benefit their own companies. We mentioned that. They funnelled taxpayers' dollars, unaccounted for and unchecked, to their own companies. Nine directors were found by the Auditor General to be responsible for the 186 conflicts of interest. It is unbelievable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577854">The Conservatives want to get to the bottom of this. We want to hold the government accountable, and it is only the Conservatives who are doing this. The Canadian people deserve to know how their money has been misused. The NDP-Liberal government must finally be held accountable for the actions of its hand-picked appointees, and the Conservatives will be the ones to do it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8577864">Mr. Speaker, as my colleague knows, the NDP is supporting the motion. We believe in getting to the bottom of the SDTC scandal. The reality is that the misspending needs to be explored, and we absolutely believe in transparency, whether it is a Liberal scandal or a Conservative scandal. We also thank the Auditor General's department for having exposed the possible misspending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577865">Members will recall that under the Harper regime, Conservatives slashed funding to the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer, in other words constraining the ability of those independent officers of Parliament to do their jobs. We saw the results. We lived through a number of Conservative scandals under the Harper regime that Conservatives blocked investigations on, such as the anti-terrorism funding of $3.1 billion, with absolutely no paper trail, and the Phoenix pay system, at $2.2 billion. We continue to pay for that today. There was also the F-35 procurement scandal, the G8 misspending of $1 billion and the ETS scandal of $400 million. That is not even including the Senate scandals and all the other scandals that we saw over this period, with Conservative members of Parliament, at least in one case, going to jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577866">Why did Conservatives block all of that transparency, refuse the investigations and refuse to have Canadians know the truth about Conservative scandals?</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I have a question to ask on behalf of every Canadian before more stories surface, because they will. How many more Liberal-connected friends, families and insiders have had their palms greased and have personally financially gained from this pandemic at the expense of Canadians who have suffered so much during this crisis? Will the Liberals be honest for once or do we have to wait for the Auditor General to tell us?</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577874"> Well, the Auditor General has been telling us. Several investigations later, we have landed on the SDTC scandal, and what a scandal it has become, with Liberal-connected insiders and cronies greasing their palms to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars without any thought of conflict of interest and somehow without any thought to putting measures in place that would stop the fleecing of taxpayer dollars by the board of directors running SDTC. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577875">It is important that we remember what got us to this point. It was the Auditor General who found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. I remember being at the meeting where she presented her report and how she talked about the malfeasance that was going on within SDTC and the fact that there was very little oversight and a whole lot of conflict of interest going on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577876">I have heard some of the questioning today from the Liberal side about criminality. It was not the Auditor General's task or role at the time to look into criminality. What she was looking for was how taxpayer dollars were landing in the hands of Liberal insiders without any regard for conflict of interest rules. That is what she was looking for, that is what she was reporting on and that is what shed light on the extent and scope of the scandal that the ethics committee was looking into almost a year earlier.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577877">The other thing the Auditor General found was a recording of a senior civil servant who slammed the outright incompetence of the government, which gave out 390 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately. The whistle-blower was speaking about the very things that were going on. I recall that we had Doug McConnachie at the ethics committee. He had been recorded by the whistle-blower. They were talking about this scandal, and even Doug McConnachie was saying that this was a sponsorship-level scandal. The sponsorship scandal was $40 million, which is enough money, and we all know what happened there. It led to the Chrétien government being brought down. This is upward of $400 million of taxpayer dollars being funnelled to Liberal-connected insiders and cronies without any oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577878"> The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects and that it, on occasion, could not demonstrate an environmental benefit, not one environmental benefit, or the development of green technologies. Over 186 cases, $334 million went to projects for which board members held a conflict of interest. It is unbelievable that $58 million went to projects without ensuring that the contribution agreement terms were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577879">I think of the coordinated effort that it takes among those boards of directors and the people involved to distribute that amount of money to what we now know, in many cases, were companies that they had a financial interest in. If that does not border on criminal, there is nothing that does, quite frankly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577880">The Auditor General also made it clear that the blame for this scandal falls on the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation>, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders, so it was common-sense Conservatives who really started the process of trying to get to the bottom of this. We had the industry minister in at the ethics committee, and we had an audit report that was done on this that we had asked for. We got it back, and it had been redacted. Then, the ethics committee had asked that we get the report unredacted and that the report actually come to us, and it did, finally, after a lot of push and pull.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577881">However, I think it is important to really talk about why these oversight committees are so important to Parliament. The standing committees on ethics, public accounts and government operations, or “the mighty OGGO”, as we like to say, are important because they are chaired by opposition members. I have been the chair of the ethics committee now for two years, and that is why I am glad to speak to this. In my role as chair, there is a level of neutrality that is required, and we have to make sure that we are operating in a neutral way, in a neutral function, and giving a fair chance for all members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577882">However, these committees are run by the majority opposition members, and their intent is to hold the government to account. In the case of the ethics committee, we deal with ethics issues, and we have been dealing with a lot of ethics issues. I refer to it as the “shooting fish in a barrel” committee because of the amount of ethics scandals that we have been dealing with, and I will touch on those a bit later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577883">The mighty OGGO deals with government operations and contracts. Through OGGO, we found the arrive scam scandal and how that played itself out. Of course, there is public accounts. Quite frankly, this issue has been touching many committees, not just the oversight committees that are led by the opposition. We have been trying to do our job, our constitutional responsibility as His Majesty's loyal opposition, to get to the bottom of the many scandals that have been occurring, and we have been doing a very good job at that, sometimes with some opposition from the opposition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577884">We have not always had team players within other parties. We certainly saw that when the coalition agreement was on between the NDP and the Liberals. The NDP would provide cover in many cases for motions that we were trying to pass to shed light on many of these scandals.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577885"> We have seen, what I would call hopeful, signs that they have backed away from that, and we are getting to the bottom of many of these scandals, not the least of which is the “who is Randy” scandal that the ethics committee, and now Parliament, is currently seized with. When we look back on SDTC and we look at what its mandate was, it was, and still is, a federally funded non-profit that approves, and was supposed to disperse, $100 million in funds annually to clean technology companies. The key problem, of course, as I mentioned earlier, is that SDTC executives awarded projects, for which they held conflicts, amounting to over 330 million dollars' worth of taxpayer funds. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577886">In 2019, when there were not any scandals in relation to the fund, former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains began removing Conservative executives from SDTC and started replacing them with Liberal-appointed executives. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s newly appointed board began voting in companies for which the executives of held active conflicts of interest in SDTC funding. Governing standards at the fund deteriorated rapidly under the leadership of the new chair Annette Verschuren, who was appointed by the Liberals, and who we had at the ethics committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577887">In July, the Auditor General and the Ethics Commissioner initiated separate investigations after those whistle-blowers came forward with allegations of financial mismanagement at the fund. The Auditor General's investigation, as I said, found severe lapses in governance standards and it uncovered almost $400 million in funding that was awarded to projects that either should have been ineligible to receive funding or were awarded to projects in which board members were conflicted during that five-year audit period. This is just incredible stuff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577888"> I wanted to talk a little about history. It is not just the SDTC scandal that we or Canadians should be focused on. It is a myriad of other scandals as well. As I said, as chair of the ethics committee, I have had a front-row seat over these last two years to many of these scandals. I also had a front-row seat when I was opposition House leader under our interim leader, Candice Bergen. At that time, we were really dealing with the Winnipeg lab document scandal. The government had not provided documents that were asked for by Parliament. In fact, it dug its heels in so much that the government took the Speaker to court to prevent these documents from being released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577889">We are seeing a very similar situation here. There was nothing in the order by Parliament, and Parliament is supreme. When committees ask for documents, there is an obligation on behalf of the government to provide those documents, and if documents are asked for in an unredacted manner, there is an obligation, because of the supremacy of Parliament, to provide those documents unredacted. That was not the case here with the SDTC scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577890">When I go back to the Winnipeg lab scandal, almost the exact same thing had happened. The documents were not provided. What did they have to hide? Who was connected? Who is further connected to the SDTC scandal that the government does not want us to understand or know about? Why would the Liberals not want the potential criminality to be exposed in this scandal? These are questions that the government and its members are going to have to answer when, and if, we get to an election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577891">However, it was not just Winnipeg labs or SDTC, it was also the arrive scam scandal. Over $60 million was given to Liberal-connected insiders for the arrive scam application. There were no answers, and the government pushed back. We had to call Mr. Firth to the bar, proving the supremacy of Parliament and the fact that we are the arbiters of what we need to determine and what we need to get to the bottom of. There is also the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which we have been dealing with at ethics committee, and foreign interference. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577892">Oversight committees are intended to hold the government to account. Whether the government likes it or not, that is our constitutional role, and it is our constitutional role as His Majesty's loyal opposition to push and fight to make sure that government is on the up and up and that we are the stewards of taxpayer dollars. We will continue to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577893">Now, we are dealing with another situation, as I said earlier, which Parliament is now seized with, and that is the ruling of the Speaker on the question of privilege that was brought up by the member for <Affiliation DbId="278390" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>, whom I sit with on the ethics committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577894"> However, we are dealing with another question of privilege, which I am sure the House will be seized with over the next few days, and that is with respect to the “who is Randy” scandal and the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="300005" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was seemingly operating his business while he was a minister. The conflict of interest in that is palpable. The illegality of that is real, and we need answers to that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577895">Back in July, the ethics committee had a meeting. We had requested documents from a witness, Mr. Anderson, who failed to provide those documents to the committee. We gave him a timeline for when we needed them, and he failed to provide the information that was requested. Again, asserting ourselves and the supremacy of not just the committee but Parliament, I reported to the House what had happened, as was the committee's wish. The member then rose on a question of privilege and the fact that the privileges of the committee and the privileges of its members were not adhered to by Mr. Anderson. The Speaker ruled that the question of privilege is now before the House and the motion has been duly moved. It is a motion that we will be debating, likely over the next couple of days and perhaps even into next week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577896"> Part of that motion is to have Mr. Anderson come before the bar of the House to not only be admonished by the Speaker, but also, more important, to answer the questions that parliamentarians have been asking for him to answer. That is our job, not just on ethics, but on the mighty OGGO and, of course, on public accounts as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577897">As I know members have heard a couple of times, it all goes back to 2015, when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood up before Canadians and said that the government will be transparent and open by default. In fact, it was in the throne speech of 2015. All of the examples that I have been citing over the last few minutes prove that it is a government that has not been transparent, accountable and open by default. In fact, it has been anything but.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577898">Part of our responsibility on the ethics committee is to deal with access to information. We issued a report on access to information a few months back after studying it and having experts come in, including members of the media who have been involved in the access to information system, and it is broken. Often, the wait times for access to information documents are months, if not years. Information comes that is redacted. That is not open, transparent and accountable by default. That is anything but. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577899">Therefore, as I conclude, it is not just the system that is broken in this country in many ways, such as the affordability system, housing and the fact that young people have lost hope and are despondent now of a prosperous future for themselves. The division that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has sown in this country along regional lines, race lines and faith lines, pitting neighbour against neighbour, are all things that are broken. The worst part about what is going on right now is that we have a decline in democracy as a result of the government's not being open, transparent and accountable by default. It really speaks to the diminishment of our institutions and the ability of Parliament to ask for the information that it requires to protect the people of this country and to protect their money.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577900">I will conclude by saying this: I am extremely disappointed that we are on this path once again. The only thing that is going to change it is a change of government to a common-sense Conservative government. I hope that happens soon. </ParaText>

I know we are in the major league playoffs here, but I do not know what it is with these guys. It has to be in their DNA. We have seen scandal after scandal come up, where Liberal-connected insiders and cronies have benefited as a result of the relationships they have with the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577922">I mentioned a few of them off the top. Probably one of the most absurd ones was former MP Frank Baylis getting a sole-sourced contract for hundreds of millions of dollars for ventilators that were not even used. It was a sole-sourced contract, which means that the Liberals did not put it out for other bids. They gave it to Liberal-connected insiders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577923">We have seen these palms being greased since the beginning of the Liberal government.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8577928">Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise in this chamber. Interestingly, my great friend from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>, whose office is directly across from mine in the Confederation Building, has been talking about this scandal now for the better part of a year. When we begin to look at the sordid details that exist in this particular case, it is very disheartening for me, as a Canadian. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577929">I would also suggest that it is disheartening because there have been so many scandals from the NDP-Liberal government that Canadians have tuned them out. It is $50 million, $100 million or $300 million; sadly, Canadians have said, “Well, whatever.” Another thing I wonder is how the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to get a free pass on these scandals. It is absolutely shocking to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577930">I realize I have only been in this place for three years, so I am not going to get in the DeLorean that my wonderful friend from <Affiliation DbId="278574" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation> was in. That is not the road I want to go down. However, that being said, I would suggest that we need to prosecute the issues that are in front of us at this time. Certainly, the SDTC scandal is front and centre, and it involves hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps almost a billion dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577931">If I might, I would like to go back a bit to look at the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund. It was established in 2001, and when we look at the mandate of the actual fund, it seems to make sense. It is a federally funded non-profit that approves and disburses over $100 million in funds every year to clean technology companies. We are in an era when we understand that there are certain things we need to do to help protect the climate. A theme that has resonated on this side of the House forever is that we need to use technologies and not taxes. This is a fund that would actually seem to make sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577932">The ISED website states, “through the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act, [SDTC is used] to fund the development and demonstration of new technologies that promote sustainable development.” As we look at the set-up of this fund, it makes sense: “It is an arm's length, not-for-profit...organization that was created to support projects that develop and demonstrate new technologies that address issues related to climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil.” In my estimation, these are all good things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577933">The website also says, “SDTC is responsible for the administration of the SD Tech Fund in accordance with the...guidelines per the Funding Agreement with ISED.” As we look at those things, on the surface, we would say that this makes sense. I was a family physician before I came here, so politics was not top of mind, and one always wonders about these things. We hear about people being appointed to boards, and we wonder what they do and whether they make money doing this. People really have a difficult time understanding this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577934">From my perspective, this brings forward a significant underbelly of what everyday Canadians hear about someone serving on a board. People wonder what they do. What did the people who have served on this board do, including the chair? I am not entirely sure, but as I read the documents, it would appear that they used their influence, sadly, to award at least 330 million dollars' worth of taxpayer funds to corporations they control. This created significant conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577935">As we look at that, we wonder how board members make money if they do not get paid to be on a board. Apparently, this is one way they do it: They prop up a company that they have a significant financial interest in and award it taxpayer dollars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577936">What else happened here? We know, as I said, that this fund has been ongoing since 2001. Indeed, the Auditor General did an audit on SDTC in 2016 and praised it for its great work and how well it was run. It had 15 years of being run very well. Things changed thereafter.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577937">Many people here would know who Jim Balsillie is. He was the chair of this committee and he began speaking out against certain legislation that the Liberal government at that time was bringing forward. It would have caused a scandal to get rid of him. That being said, when his contract came to an end, the Liberals decided not to renew his contract. Of course, that left them in a bit of a quandary to appoint someone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577938">In 2019, former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains began appointing conflicted executives to be in charge of SDTC. He was warned against this. He was warned that Annette Verschuren would have significant conflicts because the companies she historically had some dealings with had already received funds from SDTC and continued to receive them on an ongoing basis. As we look at this, we begin to understand the troubles that existed from the very beginning of the appointment of the new chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577939">What happened then? The Auditor General and Ethics Commissioner initiated separate investigations because whistle-blowers came forward. If we have time, we have some testimony from whistle-blowers that is actually shocking and needs to be read into the record. They had allegations of financial mismanagement and that is why those investigations were initiated. I will have more to say about the Ethics Commissioner as we go forward. I took an opportunity to sit on committee and hear the testimony of the Ethics Commissioner, which, in my mind, was quite shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577940">The Auditor General's investigation found a severe lapse in governance standards and uncovered that $390 million in funding was awarded to projects that either should have been ineligible to receive funding or was awarded to projects in which board members were conflicted, and that was only during a five-year audit period. As we begin to look at those numbers, we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577941">Realistically, the change began in late 2018-19 when former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains decided that SDTC needed a new CEO and chair, even though he was warned that there were significant conflicts. The Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office, who were warned about appointing a conflicted chair, decided to move forward with that regardless. There was not just one warning, but there were repeated warnings to say this was going to cause chaos and conflict.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577942">The new chair went on to create an environment where conflicts of interest were tolerated and “managed by board members”. What happened then? Of course, SDTC went on to award funds to companies in which board members held stock or positions. That is allowing the person who has the keys to the cabinet to go ahead and disburse the funds for their own benefit. I am not sure there are many things that are worse than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577943">As my esteemed colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278574" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation> said repeatedly, we are charged with several things here in this place, and one of them is to be good stewards of taxpayer money. It became very clear here that did not happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577944">As this conflict of interest environment went on, Minister Bains appointed two other controversial board members who engaged in unethical behaviour in breach of the Conflict of Interest Act by approving funds to companies in which they held ownership stakes. Not only do we begin to see that the chair of the board allowed this environment to cultivate, but we see other members of the board who saw that this was done and benefited from it themselves. As an elected official, I find that this is very unsavoury behaviour.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577945">Officials from ISED were also there watching what was going on. They observed these 186 conflicts of interest and also, sadly, did nothing. In November 2022, whistle-blowers started raising concerns with the Auditor General about these unethical practices, and the Privy Council was also briefed by whistle-blowers about these allegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577946">As I said, I have been hearing about this from my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation> for more than a year now. In September 2023, the whistle-blowers took the allegations public, and the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> agreed to suspend the SDTC funding. Is that a good thing? It is, until we come to the rest of the story, which we will in a few minutes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577947">In November of last year, the Auditor General announced an audit, and then in June of this year, the Auditor General's report was released, finding severe governance failures at SDTC. Of course, in June, there was the motion adopted in this place for the production of various documents, to be turned over to the RCMP for review. In response to the motion, and this is actually shocking, departments either outright refused the House order or redacted documents turned over, citing provisions of the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577948">Certainly, here in this place, we did not contemplate that there were going to be redactions. We would also argue on this side of the House that the House itself enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents that is not limited by statute. These powers, of course, are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577949">In response to this failure to produce documents, the Conservative House leader raised a question of privilege, arguing that House privilege had been breached due to the failure to comply with the House order, and subsequently, of course, here we are arguing the point over and over again. Realistically, in terms of a charge of corruption and a lack of transparency, certainly on this side of the House we believe there is ample evidence to prove that charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577950"> I might just cite some examples that are a matter of public record but I think are very important. I will talk briefly about the environment that was cultivated at the top by the chair of the committee, Annette Verschuren. There were two other people who were appointed by Minister Bains and by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They were both directors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577951">One was particularly aggressive, appointed in 2016 by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: Andrée-Lise Méthot. She runs a venture capital firm that is called Cycle Capital, and this story gets to be very interesting. Cycle Capital, of course, invests in green technologies, and when we begin to look at this, her company, before her appointment, had received $250 million in grants from SDTC. This is already, obviously, a conflict when someone says, “my company has already benefited from being here, so I think I will get on this gravy train”. When she became part of the board, what did she do? She allowed $114 million more to go to green companies that she had invested in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577952">During Ms. Méthot's time on the board, the value of her company, Cycle Capital, tripled, because it was getting money on a regular basis from SDTC, stamped by the Government of Canada, and that allowed that company to profit. It could raise other funds, and, as I said, the value of her own company tripled in that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577953">The other strange part of it is that, sadly, her in-house paid lobbyist for 10 years before he was elected to this place was the current radical <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation>. While he was a lobbyist for this company, Cycle Capital, he received, shockingly, and I know that everybody in this place will gasp when I say it, $111 million.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577954"> Yes, it is incredible. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, according to the registration of lobbyists portion of the Lobbying Act, lobbied the Prime Minister's Office before he came to this place. As for the industry department, he lobbied all of these folks 25 times in the year before he was elected. All of this is shocking. We cannot even believe it. Of course, for all of this hard work, he also owns shares in Cycle Capital, and, not surprisingly, he still owns the shares in Cycle Capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577955">When the question is put to the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> as to the value of these shares, as we all know that, of course, they have likely gone up in value because they were granted before the company was given the incredibly generous support of SDTC, the minister refuses to provide the value of those shares. It is shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577956">As we begin to look at the depth of what is happening here, it is way beyond what anybody would actually expect. The amoeba of this culture of entitlement and thievery from the government came forward and said that the director, Ms. Méthot, went on to the Canada Infrastructure Bank board. The first thing that she did there was award $170 million of Infrastructure Bank money to a company owned by the chair of the green slush fund. Talk about not just patting ourselves on the back but patting our friends on the back, and, for the friends who sent us someplace, giving them a gift as well. There are gifts for everybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577957">Annette Verschuren sought $6 million for the creation of the Verschuren Centre at Cape Breton University, because it was failing. Not only do we raise the money for it but we name it after ourselves. It is all incredibly strange. Maybe this is a little tiny shining match of a light: SDTC said no when they went through the process because there was a conflict. However, there is more to the story. In emails, it said that SDTC would help her find the money from other government departments. Soon after that, the Verschuren Centre received $12 million from ACOA and ISET, sadly enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577958">Her other companies received $50 million from Natural Resources Canada, and then, of course, there was the Infrastructure Bank money as well. If at first we do not succeed, as the old saying goes, try, try again. As I said, these stories are actually beyond belief and there are many other things that we could talk about here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577959">A gentleman named Guy Ouimet admitted in the committee that $17 million of green slush fund money went to companies that he has a financial interest in. He said it was a small amount of money. I do not think $17 million is a small amount of money. Interestingly enough, his actual shares in those companies, and this is an investment that anybody would love to have, went up 1,000% since that investment was made in 2019. It is gobsmacking. It takes our breath away when we hear these actual numbers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577960">In this place, I would suggest that we are charged to look at these things. I would say that one of the saddest days was when I went to watch the committee in action for a very short period of time. The Ethics Commissioner was there and was giving witness testimony and was questioned by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278139" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margarets</Affiliation>. My friend from South Shore—St. Margarets asked the Ethics Commissioner why he had not investigated the other eight Governor in Council appointments put out in the Auditor General's report as having conflicts of interest, where money flowed to companies they had an interest in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577961">Shockingly, the Ethics Commissioner asked what the point would be of investigating these Governor in Council appointments of people who are no longer on the board because he could not influence what happened to them. We now have an Ethics Commissioner who says that because they are gone now, he does not think we should investigate them, even though we know that 186 conflicts of interest happened, and now at least almost $400 million worth of taxpayers' money is gone and we need to shine a light on this.</ParaText>

Then the public gets to hear the entire story and not be left wondering where the $500 million of taxpayer money, at least, has gone. Perhaps, as we look at the numbers, it is all the way up to 800 million dollars' worth of taxpayer money. I personally think that is a lot of money, and we have the opportunity to understand where the money has gone.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8577973">Madam Speaker, I appreciate working with the member on the health committee, and the motion is something that the NDP is supporting. We believe in getting to the bottom of the SDTC spending scandal. It is important to have transparency. It is important to know how taxpayers' money was spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577974">I want to flag, and the member has flagged as well, the important work of the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Budgetary Officer, independent officers of Parliament. They get the straight goods to Canadians. This is vitally important. We can never forget this, but it was forgotten during almost a dismal decade during the Harper regime, where the Harper Conservatives basically slashed funding to the Auditor General, funding to the PBO and funding to independent officers of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577975">We know why. It is because the Harper Conservatives, unlike now when we are getting to the bottom of things, did not want the Canadian public to actually know about their spending scandal. My colleague talked about the money involved here with the SDTC as being a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to what the Harper regime misspent. I will flag just a certain number of figures: the anti-terrorism funding, no paper trail, $3.1 billion; Phoenix pay system, $2.2 billion; the F-35 procurement scandal, billions; the G8 misspending, a billion; the ETS scandal, $400 million. I could go on.</ParaText>

The Auditor General said that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on occasion could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or the development of green technology. It also gave $334 million in over 186 cases to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. It also gave $58 million to projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were met.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8577986"> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to address the House today, as always, on behalf of the people I respect in Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, and to do my best to advance the common good for Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577987"> We are here in the House of Commons, which is appropriately named because we are here to represent the common people and advance the common good, which is the history and the mission of this place; and to represent the common people possessed of common sense, which is the wisdom that is accrued through normal life, and the common good, which is the good of the common people; as well as policies that are for the common benefit of all citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577988">I want to observe at the outset of my speech that in the course of the history of democracies, there has often been a tension between the interests and concerns of the common people and those of governing elites. These tensions are actually deeply embedded in the rituals of this very place. When a Speaker is first elected, he or she is dragged from their place. The history of that is that early on, Speakers were reluctant to take their place because there was significant risk of their being beheaded by the monarch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577989">Now there may be other reasons why the Speaker is reluctant to take his or her place, but they are different than they were in the past. The earlier reason is based on the fact that the Speaker, as the servant of the House, represented the efforts of the chamber of the common people to challenge the monarchy in its efforts to exercise what it saw as its own privileges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577990"> In all democracies, and this continues today, particularly in large representative democracies, the existence of some kind of governing elite is always inevitable. If we look back at history, we can see how monarchs, aristocrats, parliamentarians, public servants, public intellectuals, recognized media commentators, corporate managers, identified experts and so on have fulfilled some kind of elite function. Whether they have been praised or criticized, depending on the circumstances, every society has had something like elites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577991">This is because most people, normal people, have busy lives and by necessity focus on taking care of their families and contributing to the work of the productive economy. A society would not work very well if it were not the case that most people are focused on the work of production in an economy and on taking care of their own family and the well-being of their own immediate community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577992">While most people focus on their own life and well-being, the day-to-day operations of governing institutions, even in a democracy, fall to a group of representatives and experts whose lives, paradoxically, are not representative of the lived experience of most people. This is the reality of the relations that exist in a representative democracy and to some extent that exist in all societies. There are challenges built into this very reality that will be largely unavoidable in any place and time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577993">However, a good society is one in which governing elites understand their function as being that of serving the common good. In properly ordered societies, the common sense that has accrued through normal common life, the common sense that is the natural wisdom of the common people, provides the North Star that governing elites pursue. Elites in a democracy should always recognize, as the end of their activities, the advancement of the common good, noting, of course, that if they fail to advance and serve the common good, representative democracy provides the tools for removing governing elites from their positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577994">With that in mind, I would observe that, sadly, over the last nine years, the relationship that should exist between governing elites and the people has gone way out of balance. The current Liberal government, along with its circle of managerial elite insiders and friends, has sought to use its power to advance its own elite interests and to protect its own elite privileges rather than to advance the common good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577995">Liberals have sought to control the various parts of our social and political elite. They have sought to reduce the corporate sector to a high degree of dependence on government. They have sought to bankroll like-minded civil society organizations while punishing civil society organizations with different opinions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8577996"> They have sought to buy off traditional media through subsidies, undermining its independence. They have sought to elevate their corporate capitalist cronies in exchange for the willingness of those cronies to use their corporate power to push leftist causes. Liberals have sought to capture the elite and use the elite to advance their own ideological interests and causes, and to do it at the expense of the common people and with no regard for common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577997"> Liberals have sought to insulate themselves from the realities of life in Canada under their watch. Taxes are up, costs are up, homes are becoming increasingly unaffordable and crime is out of control, yet Liberal elites remain removed from these realities, protected by the walls of their gated communities, protected by their public subsidies and protected from the realities of the cost and pain that have resulted for most people from the government's policies. This is why we feel the urgent need to bring common sense and the voice of the common people speaking for the common good to this House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577998"> Liberals have the audacity to complain when we critique the failures of governing elites. They complain because they do not like it when we give voice to those who have lost trust in their decisions. Paradoxically, the Liberals even try to suggest that the criticism of insider elites is an attack on democracy. However, the ability to critique and replace a governing elite is the very essence of representative democracy. It is what it means to be a representative democracy. The common people should have the capacity to insist through elections that the governing elite is representative and responsive. The need to remove the current Liberal government from office is why so many Canadians want a carbon tax election now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8577999">This breakdown in the relationship between governing elites and the common people, in particular the betrayal of trust by the Liberal elites, is causing the corruption of our government. I want to therefore reflect on the word corruption. It is obviously a sensitive term, but one that we must attach to the activities of the NDP-Liberal government over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578000">Corruption has two distinct meanings. One way of understanding corruption is as the transgression of some established rule or the breaking of a defined rule of conduct. This is, in practice, how we most commonly use the word corruption to describe instances where the rules that are supposed to prescribe the conduct of those in power are broken for some personal advantage. That is one meaning or understanding of corruption. Another meaning of corruption, though, and also an important one, is a process of degeneration, when something becomes corrupted and the rules that are supposed to hold an institution or an entity together themselves no longer uphold any kind of rational purpose. We can therefore think of corruption as describing both the transgression of established rules and the process of degeneration whereby the actions of those in power, even when they conform formally to established rules, nonetheless are clearly contrary to any rational purpose and in particular are contrary to the pursuit of the common good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578001"> When I reflect on corruption under the current government, we should notice that we are talking about corruption in both senses of the term. We have clear cases where rules have been broken, and they start at the very top with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and flow throughout government. There are various scandals where we can see that particular kind of corruption. We also see more broadly a tendency within the government to define the objective as being the advancement of its own elite interests and those of its friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578002"> Before I talk about the specifics of SDTC, I want to highlight one other contemporaneous example, and that is the situation of carbon tax conflict of interest Mark Carney.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578003">It has been very interesting to hear the exchanges about Mark Carney's role in government during question period. Conservatives have critiqued the fact that Liberals have tried to find a way around the rules by making Mark Carney an economic adviser to the Liberal Party without him nominally officially having a role within the executive exercise of power of the Government of Canada. That is their way of trying to get around the rules that require certain kinds of disclosures and protections from conflicts of interest for someone who is entering government formally as a public office holder, a senior staff member, an elected official or a parliamentarian. Certain conflict of interest rules would bind his activity if he were to take on a formal advisory role for the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578004"> The Liberals think they have come up with something very clever to try to skirt the rules. They claim that he is not an adviser within the government; he is an adviser to the Liberal Party of Canada. Most Canadians are aware of the fact, even if they do not like it, that the Liberal Party of Canada is in government. When we have a well-connected member of the elite with specific personal economic interests that involve decisions being made by the Government of Canada who is also able to advise the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, cabinet and senior decision-makers throughout the party, it is clearly an effort to skirt the rules to protect the interests of elite insiders. It allows Mark Carney to continue to get the advantages of his business position while having close access to government and being able to use that access to advocate for policies that may benefit his private interests without any kind of proper disclosure or transparency. This may not be corruption in one sense of the word, but I think it demonstrates corruption in another sense of the word, which is a degeneration of respect for the common good in the exercise of public functions by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578005">We are here debating a question of privilege, and the need to raise a question of privilege is in itself a demonstration of a kind of corruption within the relationship between Parliament and the elites. Questions of privilege have to be raised not in every case where something inappropriate has happened, but in cases where Parliament has certain entitlements that it is not able to see fulfilled. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578006">In this case, we are dealing with Parliament having ordered that certain documents be handed over, and the government has refused to hand over those documents. This is not the first time this has happened with the Liberal government. Many of these privilege issues have been raised at various parliamentary committees. I believe this is the second time that a question of privilege specifically relating to the government handing over documents to Parliament has had to come before the House. The last time this happened, the government tried to bring the sitting Speaker to court over it and then called an early election, which had the effect of avoiding that order. Then it made its coalition deal with the NDP, and the NDP covered for it to prevent the further request of those documents. I am talking about the Winnipeg lab documents affair. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578007">There have been multiple instances where the government has refused to hand over documents, where officials have refused to appear or where insiders, be they contractors or other officials, have come to committee and point blank refused to answer questions. This is a demonstration of corruption within a governing elite. There is a lack of respect for basic democratic principles and norms when government officials and well-connected insider friends and contractors feel that they can defy the orders of Parliament and get away with it. It is as if they are not acquainted with the basic principle that the House of Commons, the representative body of the common people, is supposed to be able to direct the actions of elites. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578008">The fact that there have been multiple instances of people called to the bar, with likely a third coming, and many instances of refusal to hand over documents demonstrates the basic problem that our governing elites under the Liberal government increasingly feel that they do not have to follow the direction of the common people's House and the elected representatives of the common people. This is a corruption of the proper relationship that should exist between governing elites and the common people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578009">The common people's House, the House of Commons, should be recognized as supreme in our system of government, and under the Liberals, it is not. They think they can defy the direction of the House of Commons. We will hear in debates the Liberals offering various reasons why they did not like the motion that ordered the production of these documents, and they are welcome to that opinion. They are welcome to vote against motions of the House or motions at committee to order the production of documents. However, whether they like the motion is a different question from whether they should recognize the supremacy of the House of Commons and the obligation of governing elites to adhere to the wishes of the representatives of the people's House acting in concert. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578010">Of course, we need to talk not just about how we got here with this privilege question or the broader issues of corruption in the government, but the outrageous and salacious details of this particular green slush fund scandal. What happened with the green slush fund, very simply, is that a group of elite insiders, on behalf of the government, were allocating money to various companies and were, outrageously, voting to allocate government money to their own companies. In some cases, the direct beneficiaries stepped out of the room for that vote, and in other cases, they did not. The Auditor General found $58 million went to 10 ineligible projects and $334 million in over 186 cases went to projects in which board members held a conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578011">Imagine a bunch of people sitting around a table deciding which companies get taxpayers' money. Bob says he would love for his company to get $20 million and they should all vote on it, but he will abstain. Next they vote on giving money to Bill's company, but he will abstain, sometimes. We cannot make this up. A group of well-connected, elite insiders had a massive pool of taxpayers' dollars, money worked for and earned by everyday Canadians that was given to the government in taxes, and this group, appointed by the Liberals, was sitting around deciding how to give out that money, in some cases giving it to ineligible projects and in many cases giving it to companies and projects that were directly benefiting those same people sitting around the table. This is outrageous. This is a clear demonstration of a basic corruption in the operations of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578012">Did it violate established rules? Yes, it violated established rules, but moreover, how could anyone think it was acceptable? Regardless of what the specific rules said, is it plausible that anyone could think it was acceptable to cast a vote to grant taxpayers' dollars to their own company? It is utterly insane. However, this is demonstrative of where we are with the corruption that has been sinking into the Government of Canada over the last nine years, whether we are talking about this particular scandal or other scandals that are currently being investigated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578013">There was the arrive scam scandal, where senior public servants are still blaming each other because a <Affiliation DbId="278567" Type="2">former minister</Affiliation> said he wanted someone's head on a plate over it. We are currently investigating the outrageous abuses of the indigenous contracting program. Non-indigenous elite insiders were able to take advantage of this program, in some cases by pretending to be indigenous, taking money that was properly supposed to benefit indigenous people. </ParaText>

This is why there has to be those kinds of conflict of interest protections.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578027">What happened in that government? Twice the Conservatives were found in contempt of Parliament, for the first time in history. They had a multi-billion-dollar loss of taxpayer dollars in the Phoenix pay scandal. Former cabinet minister Tony Clement directed a $50-million slush fund, funnelling millions to his Muskoka riding, including a $100,000 gazebo, only to leave the House after a sexting extortion scandal. They shovelled hundreds of millions of Canadian tax dollars to Conservative ridings after the 2008 recession, often displaying them on Conservative Party logo cheques. The PM's chief of staff paid for Senator Mike Duffy's legal fees, and there were four Conservative senators who had to be suspended without pay.</ParaText>

Let me try to go in order and see how far I get. He said “contempt of Parliament”, right? This was a motion from the opposition that the opposition parties voted in favour of that criticized the government. This was not a finding by some objective body. This was opposition parties voting an opinion in the government, so that happened, but it was not a demonstration of anything other than the fact that other political parties in this place were not keen on what Conservatives were trying to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578030">The Phoenix pay system was launched by this government and this government was responsible for the decision to push the button on that. Yes, Conservatives in government made spending decisions that benefited all parts of this country, regardless of who represented them. What became the major focal point for the opposition parties was apparently a scandal about how money was paid back to the taxpayer in the wrong way. Compare that to the scandals we are seeing under the Liberal government where hundreds of millions of dollars not being paid back is considered a normal day under the Liberals.

              <ParaText id="8578035"> Madam Speaker, this is indeed the application of the kind of McKinsey model to Mark Carney. This is the model where we have very close relationships between elite insiders and the government. Those relationships may not be defined in traditional ways that trigger traditional conflict of interest mechanisms; nonetheless, they are close relationships that allow these insiders to have access to power and also to benefit personally and to have their company benefit. We saw this with Dominic Barton at McKinsey, and how Mr. Pickersgill, who was the leader of Canadian operations, was both supplying analysts to the government for work on the Advisory Council on Economic Growth and selling to the government, so he was able to drive up McKinsey's take from the government. It is the same model for the last nine years, benefiting well-connected insiders at the expense of the common people.</ParaText>

If they are going to make accusations during questions and comments that the parliamentary privilege motion offends the Charter of Rights and Freedoms or that the Auditor General is very uncomfortable with the document production order, I would invite them to table the document or read specifically from whatever they purport to be quoting so we can determine whether they are stretching the truth. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578045">If I look at the motion, it says, “the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel shall provide forthwith any documents received by him, pursuant to this order, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for its independent determination of whether to investigate potential offences”. It is completely up to the RCMP whether it looks at the documents. It is completely up to the RCMP whether it decides to conduct an investigation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578046">Now that I have put government members on notice, I will get into my remarks, and I will ask the Chair for her indulgence. I will bring it home for members and put it all together, but to start, I will note that I had the great pleasure of being with a group of individuals at the Present Island beach club for what is called the muskie weekend. What do we do there? We share food, we share fellowship and we share fishing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578047">The individuals who were there, well-esteemed members of the community and great Canadians, had two challenges. One was about the capital gains tax, which is not the purpose of tonight's debate, so we will park that for now. The other was about corruption. A couple of members pulled me aside and asked me why it seemed that well-connected insiders have an inside track to government contracts. When regular, everyday Canadians are asking questions about corruption and about well-connected insiders having an inside track to government contracts, that pretty much tells us all we need to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578048">I would note, from the letter the law clerk provided, that it is well within the right of the House to request documents. Page 2 of that letter reads, “I note that the Order is an exercise of the House of Commons' power to send for documents. This parliamentary privilege is rooted in the Preamble and section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as well as section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578049">The Parliament of Canada and this chamber are able to ask for documents. They are able to ask for documents to be produced and are able to ask for documents to be made public. However, the Liberals do not share a great relationship with following House orders. We need only think about the Winnipeg lab documents, where they took the Speaker to court to prevent those documents from being made public. The documents have subsequently been made public, but the government was willing to take the Speaker of the House to court over them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578050">By the way, this motion was supported by a majority of members in the House. However, we can wonder why we would include the ability to send these documents to the RCMP should it wish to receive them. It is because the RCMP has identified multiple occasions where it has not been able to get documents from the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578051">Do we need to remind government members about SNC-Lavalin? Do we need to remind government members about WE Charity? Do we need to remind government members about waiving parliamentary privilege to provide documents for the foreign interference scandal or, again, the Winnipeg lab documents, as I already mentioned?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578052"> There are Criminal Code provisions for breach of trust by public officials. It would be completely up to the RCMP whether it chooses to look at the documents and whether it chooses to allow those documents to inform an investigation if an investigation exists. We are not confusing “directing” with “making sure that the RCMP is informed”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578053">This is a government that has a challenge with the definition of the word “directing”, when we think about the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> directing an Attorney General to provide a break for a well-connected Liberal firm or the minister of public safety directing the head of the RCMP to improperly release documents with respect to the tragic shootings and killings in Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578054">This speaks to a broader issue of disrespect for Parliament. The government seems to treat this place like an inconvenience. Liberals seem to treat the House of Commons like an inconvenience and parliamentary committees as an inconvenience. Ministers routinely do not show up to committees when invited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578055">Let us just take a step back, regarding the respect for this place that the government does not have. During the pandemic, the government tried to shut this place down and give itself unlimited taxing and spending powers without the oversight of Parliament for two years. It prorogued Parliament in the middle of a scandal investigation of the WE Charity issue in order to prevent that investigation from being completed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578056">I already mentioned that it was willing to take a Speaker to court to prevent the release of the Winnipeg lab documents. How could we forget the Emergencies Act, which the government invoked? It provided no evidence to Parliament and had ministers going out and giving press conferences, giving misleading and false information to members of the press on the basis of which the Emergencies Act was invoked in the first place. This is a government that has no respect for the House, no respect for the chamber and no respect for the orders or motions that are passed in this place. The House is merely an inconvenience for the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578057">If the government cared about institutions as it says it does, it would abide by motions passed in the House by a majority of members. It is no wonder that Canadians are losing faith in their institutions. The government does not even have faith in this chamber or this institution itself. Why should it expect that Canadians would continue to have faith in this institution?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578058">If conflicts of interest were cookies, the government would have found its hand in the cookie jar way too many times: the Aga Khan conflict of interest; spouses of ministers or spouses of very senior staff lobbying improperly for their clients, especially during COVID; SDTC, the entire purpose of this debate tonight, where the AG found 186 conflicts of interest and called into question almost $400 million of that fund that was spent. The self-dealing at SDTC is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578059">I have a theory about why the government has a problem understanding what conflicts of interest mean. I believe that Liberals believe that everyone, under all circumstances, will always act in the most altruistic fashion. That is, they believe that if someone's intentions are pure in their heart, they can do no wrong. I actually think that, instead, temptation overcomes those altruistic intentions. That is reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578060">Conservatives believe that, even when altruism and pure intentions are present, we have to protect against the temptation for people to act improperly. It has nothing to do with whether there is an actual conflict of interest, even though the Auditor General identified 186 conflicts of interest. Rather, it has to do with whether there was a perception of a conflict of interest. There is no better example of this than when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried to appoint former governor general David Johnston as a special rapporteur. Mr. Johnston is a great, eminent Canadian, a wonderful person and a good man. However, he was a very wrong choice for the role that the Prime Minister believed he could fill. Why was that? It was not because there was an actual conflict of interest, although there might have been, but because there was a perception of a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578061">When reasonable people ask why well-connected insiders are getting rich, it tells me all I need to know. A conflict of interest exists. It is not about whether someone's heart is in the right place, whether their motivation is pure or whether there is an actual conflict of interest; it is about whether there is a perception, whether a reasonable person could perceive there to be a conflict of interest. The other side has a lot of lawyers. I have a hard time understanding why members of the government, time and time again, fail to grasp a very basic legal concept about conflicts of interest, because they continually offend it. It is a simple legal test. Whether a conflict exists is a question of law. It is whether there is a perception of a conflict by a reasonable person. As I mentioned, regular Canadians are asking why it looks as though well-connected Liberal insiders have the inside track in getting rich off government contracts. They are reasonable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578062">In the United States, there's something called the False Claims Act; under this act, whistle-blowers can get financial compensation for pointing out frauds on the taxpayer, when money is then recovered. We should seriously consider whether Canada needs its whistle-blower protection laws to be enhanced so that they would provide financial compensation. Given the frauds that we have seen exposed and the fact that the government did not support a very reasonable Bloc bill on enhancing whistle-blower protections, this is something we should look at. We can think about arrive scam. Maybe we would have found out about that and recovered government money sooner. Maybe we could have prevented more money from being wasted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578063">Let us go back to SDTC for a minute and talk about the actual conflicts of interest that existed. As I mentioned, the Auditor General found 186 conflicts of interest. An individual, Ms. Andrée-Lise Méthot, was a board member at SDTC. I do not enjoy naming individuals in the House, so I try not to on most occasions. To be fair to that individual, I have never met her. For all I know, she is a very wonderful person and took on that role to do a great thing for the country when she was asked to sit on the board of the SDTC.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578064">However, the Auditor General found conflicts of interest where this individual was present and voting in favour of awarding money to companies in which this individual had a financial interest. It would appear that the temptation to enrich oneself overcame the initial pure intentions, and it gets worse. Even in the face of an investigation by the Auditor General and an internal investigation, this individual, Ms. Méthot, was given a promotion. She was appointed to the board of the Canada Infrastructure Bank.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578065"> Why would the government appoint an individual who was the subject of an investigation for self-dealing and conflicts of interest to another job? The facts were well known to everyone at the time of the appointment and, even if they were not well known to people in government at the time, those facts were made public eventually and everybody knew. The government did not have to wait for the end of the investigation to see the documents that show that this individual was present at board meetings where she approved, or partially approved, money going to companies in which she had a pecuniary or financial interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578066"> Getting these documents is a right of Parliament, the House and the chamber. It is a right of all of us as members in this place to request documents. We have established that it is a right of the House to request documents. They can be made available to the media. They can be made available to the RCMP. When those documents are provided to the House, maybe some members will post them online. If the RCMP wishes to ignore them, that would be up to its officers. If the RCMP officers believe they may not be able to rely on those documents in an investigation, that is their choice. If a member from the justice department, who is being consulted on a breach of trust, a breach of fiduciary duty or a breach of trust by a public official, which are Criminal Code acts, chooses not to rely on those documents, that is up to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578067"> Nowhere in the motion today, or in the original motion, does it suggest that the RCMP take any action or that the Auditor General take any action. It is up to them. Even though she has said she did not find any criminality, that is not what the Auditor General was looking at. The Auditor General was looking at whether there were conflicts of interest and, boy, did she find a lot of them. She found 186 of them, calling into question up to $400 million of the fund that may have been improperly paid through self-dealing or to ineligible recipients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578068"> I would completely defer to law enforcement officers on how they choose to deal with the information should it be made available to them. That is unlike the government, which tried to strong-arm an Auditor General in a criminal investigation to help its friends or, whether it was directed or not, or whether it was wise for them, tried to improperly pressure the commissioner of the RCMP to release information about the firearms that were used in the absolutely disgusting tragedy in Nova Scotia while that investigation was under way because the government had a piece of firearms legislation, and it wanted to benefit politically by having that information made public. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578069">I would welcome the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader's questions on any of these matters. If he wants, we can go back and forth for the full ten minutes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578071">Having said that, I do not think the member really understands what the Conservative Party is asking. The government understands what has taken place and the need to freeze funding, replace the board and have the two internal audits. We recognize that the Auditor General has good recommendations, which we support. We will ensure there is a consequence for those actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578072">The issue at hand is the motion, which says the Conservative Party of Canada believes that it should gather information through the privileges of the House and then submit it directly to the RCMP. Many legal experts would challenge the Conservative Party on that idea. At the end of the day, it could have charter and constitutional impacts, and all the Conservatives will say is to name them. The Conservatives have lawyers within their own caucus who should have a sense of what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578073">The provincial auditor and the RCMP have felt uncomfortable with this. Why does the Conservative Party not feel uncomfortable with it?</ParaText>

I open my eyes and think: here we go again.” It is another Liberal scandal. It is another case of Liberals benefiting Liberal insiders, Liberals blocking the legally ordered production of documents and the Liberal government disrespecting Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578100">Those watching at home ask, “Which scandal are we talking about?” This includes my colleague's son, who is probably one of two or three people still watching on CPAC. They want to know which scandal; there have been so many. Are we here talking about the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which the government interfered with a justice case so that their preferred company, SNC-Lavalin, would escape being banned from bidding on government procurement projects?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578101">Are we here talking about the WE Charity scandal, in which the government used taxpayer dollars to hire and pay off the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s family? They bailed out the broken company of the creepy WE founders, who were famous Liberal Party promoters. The new Quebec Liberal lieutenant, the current <Affiliation DbId="300006" Type="4">Minister of Procurement</Affiliation>, who was the Treasury Board minister at the time, broke and violated the Official Languages Act to ensure that a sole-sourced $950-million contract was given to WE Charity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578102">We can think about that. A man from the government, someone who was supposed to be representing Quebec interests, violated the Official Languages Act so that a unilingual company made up of friends of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> got a sole-sourced contract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578103">Of course, we remember that the finance minister at the time, Bill Morneau, received a $47,000 gift from WE Charity to fly his family on a luxury vacation. This is the same WE Charity he was funnelling money to with his budgets and that also employed his daughter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578104">Is it the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s vacation scandal? We ask, “Which one?” I should be more specific. Is it the billionaire island scandal, in which the Prime Minister received a free trip from a registered lobbyist? Is it perhaps the surfing holiday scandal? On the very first officially recognized Truth and Reconciliation Day, the Prime Minister headed off to Tofino to go surfing. Perhaps it is the most recent Christmas scandal, in which the Prime Minister went on vacation to Jamaica. He received a $9,000-a-night gift from a friend who is also, of course, a donor to the Trudeau Foundation. Luckily, this time, it was not a Trudeau Foundation donor linked to the PRC, at least not that we know of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578105">Is it perhaps the ArriveCAN scandal, in which the government gave millions to companies to do no work for an app that did not work? The app sent 10,000 Canadians into quarantine by mistake. When we had the government in the mighty OGGO committee, we actually heard that they did not even test the app upgrade that they paid millions for before releasing it and inflicting it upon Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578106">I would like to continue with some of these scandals. How much time do I have for this speech? I only have 16 minutes, so I do not have enough time to cover the rest.</ParaText>

                <B>Mr. Kelly McCauley:</B> Madam Speaker, I am going to move on. I am going to talk about the green fund spending scandal. However, again we ask which one. Only the Liberal government could actually have a scandal with subsets to it. We are looking at three different green spending scandals right now: scandal A, scandal B and scandal C.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578109">There is the environment green grants audit scandal, in which the internal audit audited the grants and contributions of the department of the environment. We found that the government is giving out millions to superprofitable companies that have been cited for massive pollution problems.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578110">In fact, I have the last couple here. Rio Tinto, which is worth billions of dollars, received millions from the Liberal government with very little oversight. Lafarge Canada, another foreign company, received millions from the government, again without oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578111">The government funded, it subsidized, foreign universities in the U.S. that have billions in endowments. Taxpayers, through the Liberals, decided that we were going to subsidize those universities. It also gave money to a foreign country to study fauna. I think that was to New Zealand. What that has to do with the Canadian environment is beyond me. What we found out through the audit is that the government did not provide proper oversight and governance. Of course, there is the green net-zero accelerator fund scandal, as shown by the environment commissioner, who works with the Auditor General, at $8 billion of Canadian taxpayers' money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578112"> At the same time, in my riding there is an association, a not-for-profit charity, called the Veterans Association Food Bank, which serves veterans, RCMP veterans and police veterans. There is actually a food bank in a city as wealthy as Edmonton, in a country as wealthy as Canada, for veterans who cannot feed themselves, but Canada has an $8-billion accelerator fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578113"> The Auditor General reports that the Liberal government did not track value for money, the ability of any of the companies receiving $8 billion, and whether they were actually using the money to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Think about that: $8 billion to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but we were going to give it to companies that we were not actually going to ask to prove that they were using the money to reduce greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578114">Twelve of the 17 companies provided zero plans to actually reduce greenhouse gases. This is a comment from the Auditor General's office to the environment commissioner: “Due diligence was not followed by the Liberal government before shovelling Canadian tax dollars out the door.” If we think about that, billions of dollars were given away. We received a list of just eight of the companies that received money through the fund and that had not provided any proof that they were going to use taxpayers' money to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The total market capitalization, which is the value of the companies, exceeds $1 trillion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578115">Canadians are struggling at home, and 25% of them, I understand, are under the poverty line now. Two million Canadians go to a food bank every month. We cannot provide our soldiers with ammunition or even sleeping bags, and there are veterans going to food banks in Edmonton. However, the government has $8 billion to give to corporations worth over $1 trillion, and it cannot even bother to say, “You know what, for this $8-billion gift, could you like maybe, please, pretty please, prove to us that you're actually going to reduce greenhouse gases with the money?”. Of course not; the current government does not do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578116">Of course, now we are on to the third scandal of the green spending money, the one we are debating here tonight: the green slush fund. I will summarize the scandal. The Auditor General found that the Liberals turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. A recording that was leaked, of a senior civil servant, slammed the “outright incompetence” of the Liberal government, which gave 390 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately. Where have we heard this before, money given out inappropriately?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578117"> The Auditor General found that SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on occasion could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. Again, where have we heard that? Oh, that is scandal number two. But at least this time, and I give the government credit, it was only $58 million it gave away for no reason, down from the $8 billion it gave away. Mind you, it is from the same department, which is unfortunate.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8578118">A third of a billion dollars was given out in over 186 cases to projects in which board members had a conflict of interest. We would think that if the Liberals had a third of a billion dollars to hand out, they would make sure the people receiving the money were not the same people deciding who receives the money. Some $58 million went to projects without ensuring that contribution agreements and terms were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578119">This is the same issue we had with the audit of the administration of grants and contributions at Environment Canada, where money was given out without proper oversight. To quote from that report:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578120">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The structural and strategic foundations needed to support the program delivery model—such as governance, processes, systems, compliance framework, training, and capacity-building...did not adapt in a manner that effectively supports the scale and complexity of the current number of programs....</QuotePara>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578121">It also noted, “inconsistent financial management approaches that do not fully support...efficient program delivery.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578122">We have had this issue before after a parliamentary committee has demanded documents. Members may remember the McKinsey scandal, which I forgot to cover earlier. Dominic Barton was a friend of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and his company received 10 times the number of contracts than under the previous government. It is the same McKinsey responsible for “supercharging” the opioid crisis in Canada, probably one of the most vile companies in the entire world. The government operations committee demanded documents from the government and the government refused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578123">We have various levels of the government stating why, saying that Parliament, much as we are hearing from the Liberals, is apparently not supreme. We heard government officials at the the Privy Council Office, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own department, telling us that information and privacy laws supersede the will of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578124">Here we are back again. It is the same issue, the same attitude from the government the same cover-up. This time, at least, unlike with McKinsey, we have the Bloc and the NDP supporting us. We will get to the truth of part three of the green slush fund.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578126"> Madam Speaker, this is the time of the parliamentary day when we change agenda items. We go from discussing one Liberal corruption scandal to discussing a different corruption scandal, so it is a completely different mind frame. Previously, we were talking about the Liberal green slush fund scandal. Now I am going to follow up on a question I had asked about the arrive scam scandal. There is an expression: same stuff, different day. We see so much corruption under the NDP-Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578127">We continue to see new revelations in the arrive scam scandal. Right now, the government operations committee is doing a study on the Liberal indigenous contracting scandal. This is a scandal involving how Liberals misused the indigenous contracting system to allow well-connected, in many cases non-Indigenous, elites to take and benefit from resources that were supposed to be going to support indigenous communities. We had testimony from the AFN that suggested that a very small percentage of those allotments for indigenous contracting are actually going to real indigenous companies. This is another contracting scandal the government operations committee is investigating, but it comes out of the arrive scam scandal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578128">The arrive scam scandal, which revealed just how broken government contracting was, involved $60 million being spent on a glitchy app that did not work very well. A company was hired to build this app, GC Strategies, which is not an IT company. It does not actually build apps. The Liberals thought they would hire someone to build an app and went to a company that does not build apps. It was two people in a basement. What they did was receive the contract and pass it on, so the government went and hired someone who went and hired other people. One of the companies that got business as part of this was Dalian Enterprises, a company on the government's indigenous contracting list, but also a company that did not actually do any work on it. It simply received contracts and subcontracted. Part of the corruption we are seeing is that the government is using tiny companies, made up of well-connected insiders, that receive contracts and then subcontract.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578129">The concept of this is very simple. Hypothetically, let us say that I needed to have someone come in to replace my bathtub, so I went out and hired someone. I pay them a certain amount of money, but they do not actually produce bathtubs or know anything about them. This person simply gets the contract from me and goes out to subcontract it, to buy a bathtub from someone else and then sell it to me for a markup. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578130">That is what happened with ArriveCAN. A company was hired. It took the contract, hired someone else to do the work, and got the contract at a markup. It does not make a lot of sense in the interest of taxpayers that this would happen, but well-connected insiders have continually profited under the government. The Liberals have ran a government with the purpose not of serving Canadians in general, but of allowing well-connected elite insiders to take advantage of programs that are supposed to be benefiting Canadians as a whole. We see this with ArriveCAN, an app that did not work very well, and that accidentally sent over 10,000 Canadians into quarantine. It is an example of these tiny middleman companies being able to make massive markups. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578131">Now we are seeing the same thing in the abuse of indigenous contracting, where non-indigenous, elite insiders are able to take advantage of the program and take for themselves money that should be benefiting indigenous entrepreneurs and indigenous communities across the country. The contracting system in the government is broken. Well-connected insiders are taking advantage of it, and it is not producing value for money. Will this government apologize for the arrive scam scandal and commit to real meaningful change, or will it take a Conservative government to replace—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8578144">Madam Speaker, it was on May 10 of this year that I posed a question about the Liberals' risky and failed experimentation program in British Columbia with the free distribution of hard drugs to our most severely addicted neighbours. Specifically, I wanted to know whether the Liberal members of Parliament would be voting with us, the Conservative members of Parliament, on a common-sense motion that we had put forward a couple of days earlier to ban hard drugs and offer recovery and hope instead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578145"> I thought it was a fair question because, at that time, it had become abundantly clear that the free drug experimentation program in British Columbia had been an utter failure. Even the left-leaning NDP Premier David Eby was admitting failure and was demanding an immediate stop to the pilot project. The vote came up a couple of days later and the Liberals and the NDP, of course, voted against our common-sense motion, because that is what they always do. They always vote against our common-sense motions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578146">However, I wonder, if that same motion were tabled today, whether they would vote with us now, being five months later. I ask it in this context. Looking at how these two parties and their counterpart in British Columbia, the NDP provincial government, have been flip-flopping on issues relating to the toxic drug crisis, it is hard to say how they would vote today. They really believe in harm reduction, safe supply and decriminalization, even if those beliefs are based more on ideology than on evidence and data.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578147"> The harm reductionists, the academics, the leaders and even the government's own professional advisers were calling on the government not to abandon the project, but to expand it to make more government-issued narcotics available for more people in more parts of the province. It is hard to shake people from their ideologically held beliefs, even if the evidence is clearly contrary to those beliefs, because it is just so easy to dismiss inconvenient evidence to the contrary as misinformation. That is what the Liberals tend to do, except, of course, when the evidence is the latest polling data showing many formerly safe NDP and Liberal seats leaning Conservative if an election were to be held today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578148"> This is particularly worrisome for provincial Premier David Eby, who is facing the fight of his political life right now. An election is just a couple of weeks away. Therefore, what does he do? Well, he takes a look at what the Conservatives are doing right, at what is moving them ahead in the polls. He adopts some of their policies and now he is trying to convince British Columbians that this is what he believed all along anyway and, this time, it really is going to work. I am hoping, together with many other people, that British Columbians are done with the NDP experiment altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578149"> Now, I will get back to our Conservative Party motion, here in the House of Commons back in May. I am going to read just a small part of it. The motion states that:</ParaText>

Would they change their mind, given that their counterpart in British Columbia flip-flopped on the radical decriminalization program earlier this year and how now, in the heat of an election campaign, he is flip-flopping on what he calls compassionate intervention programs, treatment? The emphasis is now on treatment. Therefore, I am wondering how Liberals would vote today, and their NDP counterparts—</ParaText>

It was incredible to hear the answer the minister tried to pawn off on us, saying that the government has stood up for steelworkers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578169">I have met with steelworkers and the steel industry, and I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has as well. What the steel industry has said unequivocally is that if the carbon tax goes up, as it is scheduled to, there will be no steel industry left in Canada. The government's plan to quadruple the carbon tax will effectively drive the entire steel industry in Canada out of business. If that is what standing up for steelworkers means to the government, I think it has the definition wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578170">What we have seen in the steel industry as a result of the carbon tax is that the carbon tax makes Canadian steel very expensive, far more expensive than that of all their competitors. We now see that 61% of steel in Canada comes from foreign countries, they are imports, and every year it gets worse. Why? Because the carbon tax makes Canadian steel far more expensive than any other steel in the world. In fact, the country is now being flooded with very cheap, dirty Chinese steel. Chinese steel is more than two times more polluting with carbon emissions than Canadian steel. The government is driving out the steel business in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578171">Steel accounts for about 120,000 direct and indirect jobs in this country. The carbon tax is going to effectively kill those jobs. We know that the carbon tax has done a whole bunch of things. We now have two million people going to food banks because the carbon tax has made food so expensive. We have tent cities all across the entire country, hundreds and hundreds of them, because housing has become so expensive under the Liberal government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578172">My question to the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was that if he thinks the carbon tax is so great and so beneficial not only for Canadian steelworkers but for Canadians in general, why do the Liberals not just call a carbon tax election and let Canadians decide? I think Canadians will unequivocally and resoundingly say they have had enough of the carbon tax. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578173">The carbon tax is driving jobs out of this country. It is making food more expensive. It is making Canadians line up at food banks because they cannot afford food.

              <ParaText id="8578178">Canada has put a price on carbon pollution but is taking a flexible approach. Industries across all sectors have said that they support pricing because of this flexibility. They have said that pollution pricing allows them to invest in cleaner processes without the government telling them how to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578179">Carbon pricing is an economic policy that works by ensuring that our industries remain competitive in a decarbonized world. The federal system allows provinces and territories to maintain their own systems if they meet minimum national standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578180">Carbon pricing has been in place across Canada since 2019. Many provinces, such as Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, have had carbon pricing for even longer.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578181"> All the money paid by industries gets given right back to the province it comes from to invest in clean-energy projects for industry. For every dollar that has been invested in industry through these pricing proceeds, three dollars have been mobilized, essentially tripling investment in clean industrial projects. By putting a price on pollution, we send a signal across the economy to encourage households and businesses to change their behaviour and find new and innovative ways to use less-polluting energy products and services.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578182">The industry remains competitive, both through the incentives provided by carbon pricing to develop new technologies and through smart pricing design for heavy industry across Canada. Our approach keeps overall costs low while continuing to drive emissions reductions and keep Canada competitive internationally. That is why economist after economist supports carbon pricing as the cheapest and most efficient tool we have to fight climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578183">Carbon pricing is a central pillar of Canada's climate plan, because it reduces emissions, accelerates the use of clean technologies and fuels, and supports good jobs in a diversified economy, but also because it complements and amplifies the impact of other aspects of our climate plan. Carbon pricing lays the foundation for over 140 measures in Canada's emissions reduction plan, including the clean fuel regulations, which reduce the carbon intensity of diesel and gasoline, and the proposed clean electricity regulations, which will help deliver a net-zero grid.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578185">The steel industry has made it very clear that if the carbon tax continues to go up, steel producers will be out of business. I know the investments they have made. They have produced the greenest steel in the world and should be rewarded for that. Instead what the government is doing is punishing them for that by promising to quadruple the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578186">The fact is that the member can say what she wants if she thinks carbon pricing is great. However, the steel industry is on record saying that if the carbon tax goes up as planned, it will be completely out of business. Sixty-one per cent of the Canadian steel market is already taken up by cheap, dirty steel imports. The industry itself is saying, “This will be the end of us.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8578188">Madam Speaker, I said that because it is true and because all economists are saying the same thing. Canadians across the country are raising the alarm on climate change. They can see it with their own eyes: longer, fiercer wildfire seasons; the hottest summers in history; and floods in urban and rural areas across the country over the last few years. I could go on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578189"> Experts tell us that from 2015 to 2025, climate change impacts have shaved $25 billion off the GDP. That is half a years' growth. Without significant additional actions to reduce emissions, those costs are projected to grow to $35 billion in 2030. That is what scientists predicted a long time ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8578190">We need to take ambitious action now to avoid drastic changes to the trajectory of the climate on earth. Pricing pollution is an essential strategy because it simply cannot be free to pollute.</ParaText>
