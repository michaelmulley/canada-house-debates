It has not been voting on crime bills that would actually stop criminals from victimizing more Canadians.

The number two person in the government, who chaired the most senior cabinet committees, is gone suddenly on the morning of the fall economic statement. It is not us saying that these are election gimmicks coming up in the fall economic statement; this is in the letter. The former finance minister herself said that this what it was going to be.

There is only a singular issue that the New Democrats could be counted on to vote for, and it is on behalf of not all Canadians, but one Canadian. They have been singularly focused on ensuring that their leader is eligible for that pension. No other Canadians in Canada believe anything they have to say. I would not be surprised if, later today, we saw the leader of the NDP become Canada's next finance minister.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802402"> Mr. Speaker, to say that I, my colleagues and opposition members in the House have been thrown a curveball would be an understatement. I had originally thought that I would be talking for the third time about the green slush fund and the various amendments to the motion brought before the House, trying to impress upon my Liberal colleagues, for one last time in this calendar year, why they should finally relent and release the unredacted documents so that we can get back to the business that the people here in Canada elected us to do. However, to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278420" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation>, we are definitely in uncharted waters. It is historic, it is unprecedented and it deserves the attention of my intervention today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802403"> However, before I do that, I want to start on a happy note. As I indicated, this is my last official speech intervention in the House for 2024. I want to take the opportunity to wish the Speaker and his family a very merry Christmas and a very prosperous new year. I wish all the chair occupants, individually, as well as all of our fine clerks, our House staff, our pages and my colleagues, a very merry Christmas and a happy new year. I wish for them time to reflect and have a relaxing time with their families in their ridings. I offer the same greetings to all my opposition colleagues and to members of the government, as well as to the Liberal caucus. We all play a pivotal role here in the exercise of democracy, but it is important to take a step back and thank those who assist us in that process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802404">However, getting back to the reality of the situation, I know some of my colleagues have read out various excerpts of the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">deputy prime minister</Affiliation>'s official letter of resignation, but I want to take the time to actually read it out and to reflect upon it for a moment.

Jody Wilson-Raybould is one example.

She was bullied, threatened and intimidated to make a decision that not only compromised her role as the attorney general, but also compromised her sense of right and wrong, her integrity and her ethics. She refused to carry the water for the Prime Minister to ensure a sweetheart deal for a Quebec-based company under the proviso of terms, which turned out to be completely false, as advanced by the Prime Minister and by the Liberal government.

We know that he has lost two ministers of finance since 2015. The former minister of finance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">University—Rosedale</Affiliation>, was the deputy prime minister. She carried an extremely important portfolio and carried clout. She was his biggest cheerleader. She withstood numerous complaints and concerns. She was forever loyal to the fake feminist Prime Minister. What did she get in return? She was left dangling in the wind, literally, all of last week, when the rumours were circulating that she wanted to deliver the fall economic statement in a direction that was not approved by the Prime Minister. Political staffers started to leak stories to the press. It is understandable why opposition members would use that as an opportunity to clearly demonstrate how the Prime Minister has lost not only the confidence of Canadians but also the confidence of his own cabinet. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802431">The <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former deputy prime minister</Affiliation> listened.

The writing was literally on the wall. In fact, I think only one other female minister came to her aid last week, and demonstrated her credentials and what she has done for this country. I will disagree until I am blue in the face about the failed direction she has taken this country, and it is not only Conservative members who agree with that statement, but also Canadians. Canadians, for years, have lost complete faith and trust in our federal institution. They have lost faith and trust in the Prime Minister. They had no faith and trust with the former deputy prime minister and minister of finance. </ParaText>

A Liberal cabinet minister was smiling away, in various aisles in a department store, highlighting that there was no GST on car seats or on teddy bears, and then she pulled out a bottle of wine, saying there was no GST on that.</ParaText>

The CBSA agents at our porous borders are struggling to inspect all those containers coming in. As the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party of Canada</Affiliation> stated last week, which was confirmed by the CBSA, 1% of those containers are inspected.

              <ParaText id="8802462"> Mr. Speaker, for two and a half months, the House has been seized with this privilege motion. We are still waiting on documents that were ordered by the House months ago, documents that would shed light on the misuse of taxpayer dollars through the Sustainable Development Technology Canada green slush fund. Despite a clear parliamentary order, the Liberal government has refused to comply, obstructing the vital work of Parliament and undermining the principles of transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802463">Meanwhile, Canadians are hurting and the NDP-Liberal government is failing them. The issues facing Canadians are only growing more and more severe, yet the Liberal government persists in its efforts to evade transparency and accountability. From the skyrocketing costs of housing and basic necessities to the ever-increasing food inflation, the pain felt by everyday Canadians is undeniable, yet instead of tackling these issues head-on, the government has chosen to prolong its cover-up of ethical failures. Canadians are left to suffer while the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government are busy protecting their own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802464">After nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership, the price of groceries has skyrocketed and food insecurity has become one of the most urgent issues facing Canadians. Food Banks Canada reported that in March of this year, there were more than two million visits to the food bank. That is a staggering increase of 90% since 2019. Canadians are already struggling with the cost of food, but unfortunately, things are set to get even worse. This was confirmed by Canada's Food Price Report 2025. The average Canadian family of four will have to spend $800 more on food in the coming year. That $800 is on top of the year-over-year increases on food, bringing the average total family spend on food to $16,833.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802465">Meat and vegetables are expected to see an even higher price hike, with the cost of meat rising from 4% to 6% and vegetables by 4% to 5%. The rise in costs for nutritious food are particularly alarming given the growing number of reports of scurvy here in Canada. It has gotten so dire that doctors in Canada have been warned to consider scurvy as a potential diagnosis for their patients.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802466">In northern Saskatchewan, 27 cases of scurvy have been diagnosed. In all of these cases, the patients had one thing in common: a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables in their diet. This was once a disease that was associated with sailors on long sea voyages and is now a growing concern in Canada due to limited access to affordable and nutritious food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802467">To be clear, the NDP-Liberals' two-month tax trick on chips and chocolate is not going to provide vulnerable Canadians with the nutrition they so desperately need. Scurvy should be unimaginable in Canada but that is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s record. The rise in food insecurity is a direct result of the Prime Minister's carbon tax. Food prices have risen 36% faster in Canada than in the United States, where there is no carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802468">The reality is simple. If we tax the farmer who grows the food and the trucker who ships the food, ultimately we end up taxing the family who buys the food.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802469">Instead of giving Canadians tangible, permanent relief, the NDP-Liberal government is preparing to hike the carbon tax again next year. In the middle of a persistent affordability crisis, it is hell-bent on making life more expensive for Canadians. The carbon tax-obsessed <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is determined to quadruple the carbon tax to 61¢ per litre by 2030. Canadians want a carbon tax election, but the NDP-Liberal coalition continues to hold the interests of Canadians hostage. With its lust for power and backroom deals, the NDP-Liberal coalition is refusing to face the consequences of its policies at the ballot box.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802470">Canadians cannot afford to wait any longer for relief from the damaging policies of the government. That is why, in light of the fall economic statement being delivered today, Conservatives have one simple demand: to stop. The government needs to stop all planned tax hikes, especially the carbon tax hike that would further increase the cost of food, gas, home heating and basic necessities. It needs to stop fuelling inflation by cutting wasteful inflationary spending, like the 390 million dollars' worth of contracts handed out through the Liberals' green slush fund. That includes the 58 million taxpayer dollars that went to 10 ineligible projects, the 334 million taxpayer dollars that went to 186 projects that involved conflicts of interest and the 58 million taxpayer dollars given to projects without ensuring the terms of the contribution agreement were met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802471">However, that is not enough. The Liberal government needs to stop adding to Canada's debt. Conservatives are calling for a dollar-for-dollar law that requires new spending be offset with an equal amount of savings. This afternoon's fall economic statement should confirm that the deficit for this year and last year has not risen above the already reckless $40-billion guardrail the former finance minister promised in this year's budget. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or Mark Carney, the phantom finance minister, will heed our common-sense recommendations or, at the very least, maintain the already reckless so-called fiscal guardrail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802472">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the deficit could be as high as $46.5 billion. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s former budget director has come out and said, “over the past few years, the federal government has consistently prioritized short-sighted decisions over long-term fiscal and economic stability.” The Prime Minister's own former budget director does not have faith that the government will show the fiscal restraint that is needed in the fall economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802473">It is far from just the former budget director raising concerns with the anticipated fall economic statement. This morning, the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">deputy prime minister and the minister of finance</Affiliation> resigned from cabinet. She has arguably been the most loyal cabinet minister to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but even she is now raising alarm bells in the face of the Prime Minister's bullish tactics to spend taxpayer dollars rashly in a reckless attempt to save himself. The now former finance minister has admitted that excessive spending drives inflation. Her letter of resignation this morning confirms the Prime Minister's decisions are short-sighted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802474">Today's decisions will have long-term repercussions for Canadians. That is why the former budget director also warned, “You can't pick and choose fiscal anchors as you go, and renege on a commitment you made only a year ago.... The fact of the matter is this government is losing control of public finances and Canadians are noticing.” Canadians are indeed noticing. Canadians cannot help but notice because it is Canadians who will always pay the price for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his costly failures.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802475"> It is Canadian taxpayers who are on the hook for the waste and the mismanagement in the green slush fund, but it is not just for the green slush fund. The Liberal government's mismanagement is a pattern. The Auditor General has now revealed that the Liberal government's $50-billion CEBA program is its latest boondoggle. The Liberals paid out $3.5 billion in taxpayers' money through the CEBA program to over 77,000 recipients who did not meet eligibility requirements. That means 9% of the program's recipients were ineligible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802476">The Auditor General's report determined that the Ministry of Finance failed to provide effective oversight of the CEBA program. Even worse, the Liberal government awarded 92% of the total contracts to Accenture in a non-competitive process. Accenture took that money and then performed much of the work in Brazil instead of Canada. That work was done in Brazil, despite the Liberal government's claims of supporting Canadian jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802477">This is a government that has no regard for taxpayers' hard-earned money. The NDP-Liberal coalition's failures are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they are real costs to Canadian families who are already struggling with skyrocketing costs of living. The Liberal government's high-tax and high-deficit agenda is fuelling inflation and it is the most vulnerable who are the hardest hit. Lower-income Canadians are disproportionately suffering from the government's inflationary policies. It is time for a government that puts Canadians first, not its own political interests. Canadians need a prime minister who understands the economic realities they are facing, who is focused on the long-term prosperity of Canadians, yet what have we heard from the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? “I'll let the bankers worry about the economy.” That recent display of incompetence from the Prime Minister follows memorable comments like budgets balance themselves and “you'll forgive me if I don't think about monetary policy.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802478"> After nine years of his failed leadership, it is no wonder Canadians are struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on their table. Everything is broken. The NDP-Liberal government has doubled the debt, doubled housing costs, caused the worst inflation in 40 years and sent two million people to the food bank. Canada's GDP per capita is smaller than it was when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. Canada has the most indebted households in the G7, with the worst housing inflation, and food prices have risen 37% faster in Canada than in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802479">Our economy is teetering on the brink of collapse and now Canadians are faced with a threat of 25% tariffs on our shrinking economy. Canadians need a prime minister with the brains and the backbone to stand up for Canada. Canadians deserve a prime minister who actually worries about the economy, who will work for their future and who will take action to fix the mess the current government has created, a prime minister who will restore the Canadian promise that hard work leads to powerful paycheques and pensions that buy affordable groceries and homes in safe neighbourhoods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802480">The clock is running out on the NDP-Liberal coalition's backroom deals. Canadians will go to the polls in the coming year and they will have a clear choice: a choice between the NDP-Liberal coalition, which will continue to tax Canadians' food, punish their work and let crime spiral out of control, or the common-sense Conservatives, who will axe the carbon tax, build affordable homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Our common-sense plan is one of opportunity for all Canadians, a plan that rewards hard work, not who someone knows.</ParaText>

The issues surrounding the Liberal’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada green slush fund are far from isolated incidents; they have been part of a disturbing pattern of mismanagement, lack of accountability and outright disregard for hard-earned taxpayer dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802482">That is the legacy of the Liberal government: an increasing cost of living that is making it difficult for Canadians to afford basic necessities, while demonstrating a blatant disregard for transparency and accountability. Canadians cannot afford the corruption of the NDP-Liberal government. The failure to provide the documents ordered by the House is not merely an obstruction; it is also an affront to the very principles of transparency and accountability that are essential to the proper functioning of our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802483">It is not just a matter of parliamentary procedure; ultimately this comes down to the health of our democracy. That is why Conservatives are persistent with our demands. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could bring the months-long debate to a close if he respected the motion passed in the House and delivered on the production of documents. The refusal to fully release the requested documents is a deliberate attempt to prevent the Canadian public from understanding the full extent of the Liberal government’s corruption and mismanagement. With the refusal, the people responsible get to evade accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802484">The Liberal government has shown time and time again that it values protecting its own interests over the interests of Canadians. Whether it is allowing the $400 million in misused funds to go unchecked or failing to address the growing economic hardship faced by millions of Canadians, the government’s actions, or lack thereof, speak volumes. Canadians cannot afford to continue down this path of unchecked spending and hidden truths.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802485">Accountability is not a luxury; it is a necessity in a democracy. The time for cover-ups and evasive behaviour is over. Canadians deserve a government that upholds its duty to them and a government that ensures that every dollar is spent responsibly and that the people responsible for mismanagement are held accountable. The green slush fund scandal is just one example of how the NDP-Liberal government’s lack of transparency has eroded public trust. The longer it continues to obstruct the production of documents, the deeper the damage to our democracy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802486">It is time for the Liberal government to stop protecting insiders and start listening to the Canadians who elected its members. It is time for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government to stop hiding and to start facing the reality of their actions. It is time for them to end the cover-up, restore trust in our public institutions and begin putting Canadians first. Canadians need transparency, accountability and, most of all, a government that works for them and not for itself. It is time for a carbon tax election.</ParaText>

I was at the grocery store on the weekend, and I saw people who had to take things off the conveyor belt to put them back. What is baffling to me and what I do not understand is that what we are debating today is the Liberal government's failure to produce documents that they were ordered by this place to produce, and the lengths it would go to to cover up. Whatever is in the documents must be very damning if the government is willing to go to this extent to keep covering up the corruption and the mismanagement of taxpayer dollars, which is ultimately hurting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802505">As I said in my remarks, it is hurting the most vulnerable of the most vulnerable, the people who are on the brink of losing their house and those who are not feeding themselves. I referred to scurvy; there are scurvy diagnoses happening in Saskatchewan, in Canada. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802513">We are here today debating the privilege motion, which is the failure to produce documents pertaining to SDTC and the corruption that ensued from that.

We have had elections over it in the past, and here we are again today, debating a production of documents privilege motion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802514">What is the debate about? It is about an organization called SDTC, which is responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding to companies to pursue so-called green technologies, and this organization has been tasked with divvying out this money. It turns out, as we have heard from the Auditor General, that nearly $400 million this organization has given out was done under a cloud of conflict of interest, where people who were sitting on the board were giving their own companies money from this organization. That may come as no surprise to Canadians, as Canadians have come to expect that from this government, and Conservatives have been holding the government to account on this for a number of months now. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802531">That is the letter that was written to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> this morning. It was shocking news for all of us, and it speaks to what Conservatives have been calling for, for a very long time, which is that there is no confidence in the government. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802532">We have been saying this for quite a while. The Bloc has recently joined us in this as well. Now the former finance minister is suggesting that Canadians have no confidence in the government. What is increasingly concerning or confusing to me is the fact that the NDP continues to prop up the failed government, continues to provide confidence in the Liberal government, despite the fact that we are now seeing that even top-level members of the cabinet no longer have that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802533">We saw the resignation of the <Affiliation DbId="278112" Type="2">housing minister</Affiliation> earlier today in a press conference where he said he is no longer seeking re-election. He has resigned from cabinet as well. We see that the troubles of our country are piling up. The government is in chaos and unable to address the issues. Conservatives have put forward a common-sense plan to axe the tax, to get rid of the carbon tax, to free up our economy and ensure that Canadians can afford food. When we tax the farmer who grows the food, we tax the trucker who drives the truck to deliver the food and we tax the grocery store that sells us the food, Canadians cannot afford food.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802534">We have seen this over and over again, and we have been relaying this message to the government, pointing out that more Canadians are visiting food banks than ever before. We have been calling for a common-sense plan to remove the carbon tax, to make us competitive with our neighbouring countries, like the United States, which is our biggest trading partner in many ways but also our competition in an increasing number of ways. To have our economy saddled with the carbon tax while the Americans are not puts us at a significant disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802535">I think that the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> recognized that. She recognized that, so she chose to resign today. We noticed last week already that there seemed to be some daylight between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former finance minister around a fiscal guardrail. We heard repeatedly from the former finance minister that she was concerned about the finances of our country and that she wanted to keep the deficit to $40 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802536">From my perspective, a balanced budget is the thing we ought to be pursuing, not a deficit of $40 billion. However, it appears, in the fall economic statement the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> was expected to deliver today, even that target would not have been met. We see that, increasingly, Canadians are lacking confidence in the government. The former finance minister is lacking confidence in the government, and Canadians are feeling the weight of the carbon tax, which is hampering our economy and making life unaffordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802537">If that were not enough, the government intends to triple the carbon tax. As if life is not difficult enough in Canada, if we cannot afford to heat, house and eat in Canada because of the carbon tax at its current level, imagine what it is going to be when it triples over the next number of years. It is not an April Fool's Day joke, but every April 1, we get an increase in the carbon tax. This happens over and over again until Canadians cannot afford to live.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802538">It is interesting as well that the <Affiliation DbId="278112" Type="2">housing minister</Affiliation> resigned today. Common-sense Conservatives have put forward a plan to build the homes across Canada by removing the GST on new home builds. This would save on average about $50,000 per new home build and would stimulate new home builds across the country. We are building fewer homes than we did in the 1970s, yet our population growth is dramatically higher than it was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802539">I would also point out that the <Affiliation DbId="278112" Type="2">housing minister</Affiliation> formerly was the immigration minister. In some ways, he was responsible in his former role for the problems in his current role, which he was unable to fix and now is resigning from that position altogether. I wish the former housing minister well in his new endeavours. I hope he is more successful in those endeavours than he was as the minister of immigration and then housing, as he seemed to have been a total failure in both of those.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802540">It is interesting we get two ministers of the cabinet resigning on the same day, with one very clearly outlining that they have lost confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is also interesting to note that, in the resignation letter of the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation>, she talks about “keeping our fiscal powder dry”. Conservatives have been arguing for a long time for that: to ensure that we balance the budget and keep the fundamentals of our fiscal home in order. This is something that the Prime Minister, from the get-go, has been loath to achieve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802541">I remember back in 2015, when I was first running to be a member of Parliament, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he was going to run small deficits. I also remember former prime minister Stephen Harper, at the time, pointing out that they were going to run these very small, very tiny deficits. Those deficits have ballooned dramatically. Never, ever, I think, in the entire tenure of the Prime Minister, has the deficit been $10 billion. It has always been dramatically more than that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802542">We have seen the initial four years of $10-billion deficits grow into multi-billion dollar deficits, $60-billion and $70-billion deficits, for nearly a decade. After nine years of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the national debt has doubled. The Prime Minister has taken on more debt than all other prime ministers combined. To say that we need to keep our fiscal powder dry is almost somewhat humorous. I am glad that the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> is pointing this out today, but the Prime Minister has failed to do that for nearly nine years and came in on a promise to run deficit budgets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802543">I do agree with the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> when she says that we are facing “grave” challenges with the prospect of a 25% tariff. Particularly where I come from in northern Alberta, softwood lumber is a major part of the economy. I always say to everybody that I come from the promised land. We do forestry, oil field and farming where I come from. We have been suffering under double-digit percentage tariffs on our softwood lumber for as long as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been the Prime Minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802544">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has totally failed to secure a softwood lumber deal with the United States. He has put our industry at a significant disadvantage. He has failed to not only defend our industry against American tariffs, but also failed to defend our industry here at home when provincial governments worked very hard to shut down the forestry industry. Then he has failed in terms of forest management when the federal government is involved in it. In Jasper National Park, the federal government is entirely responsible for forest management, and we saw large swathes of the national park burn because of poor forest management practices over the last 10 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802545">We know what it is like to live under these tariffs in one particular industry, and we are concerned about the possibility of the entire Canadian economy suffering under a 25% tariff. We need a government that is focused on Canada first. We need a government that is focused on ensuring we have a united front here in Canada. From the Liberal government, we see chaos. We see finance ministers resigning, a <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">deputy prime minister</Affiliation> resigning her post, because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> no longer has confidence in them and they no longer have confidence in the Prime Minister. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802546"> Conservatives have been calling for a carbon tax election, and I think that there is no better time than right now to call that election, to ensure that we can have a government that has the confidence of Canadians, that can negotiate with the United States and that can ensure that we do not face the 25% tariff that the Americans are threatening. Then we can fix some of these other problems and disputes that we have with the United States around software lumber. We can then restore the dream of North American free trade, which I have lived under my entire life and which, I think, was good for North America in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802547">We need a government that can combat the buy America policies of several of the American states, so that we can ensure that we have a fortress North America rather than a conflict between Canada and the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802548">I note that the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> did not mention, in her resignation letter, the fiscal anchor that she had put in place for herself. I would note that this was, I think, the third fiscal anchor. A declining debt-to-GDP ratio was the first one, but when that no longer held, she then moved to this $40-billion deficit. I note that she does not mention it explicitly in her resignation letter, but we did note last week that there seemed to be a number of rumblings coming not only out of the Liberal caucus, but also out of the ministry, around a dispute between the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the former finance minister over these fiscal guardrails that the former finance minister had put in place and whether the Prime Minister was willing to abide by them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802549">What seems obvious from the letter that we have from the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> is that there was a significant disagreement and that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> chose to fire the former finance minister rather than abide by the fiscal guardrails. The letter notes that, “On Friday, you”, referring to the Prime Minister, “told me”, that is, the former finance minister, “you no longer want me to serve as your Finance Minister and offered me another position in cabinet.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802550">That is effective dismissal. The finance minister is generally noted to be the most high-ranking minister in the cabinet. It is generally the most prestigious position. A transfer out of that position to any other position would be seen as a demotion, which is an effective dismissal. I would say that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> fired the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802551">This has happened before to cabinet ministers who have stood up for Canada and who have stood up for what they believed to be right. We need to look no further than Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was in a very similar position. She felt that the defence of SNC-Lavalin should be done by the company itself in court and not by political interference by the justice minister, and she got into a dispute with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802552">We saw a significant level of pressure brought to bear upon her to skirt around justice. We saw what happened to her as well.

Therefore, we see that this is an MO of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, that he wants to get his way. No cabinet minister may push for what is good for Canada or for what is good for their ministry. It is insisted that they abide by the whims and wishes of the Prime Minister.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802581">For those watching at home, here are the facts. The Auditor General found that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada into a slush fund for Liberal insiders, with $58 million given to 10 ineligible projects that could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or progress in any green technology, $58 million given to projects without any effort to ensure the terms of the contribution agreements were even met, and $334 million funnelled to 186 cases where board members held a conflict of interest. The very people trusted with safeguarding taxpayer dollars were funnelling money into projects they were connected to. The NDP-Liberal government shovelled the working man's pay into the pockets of elitists who provide no value to the country, in the amount of $400 million. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802582">Canadians who are barely scraping by are watching the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> waste 400 million of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. It is a lot of money and it is hard to think about how big the amount actually is. Here is what that $400 million means for Canadians. The $400 million could cover the costs for about 89,000 kids to play hockey. Let us think about that. With rising costs, families are barely able to put food on the table, let alone pay for a season of hockey to keep their kids active. The $400 million could cover a month's worth of groceries for over 300,000 families of four. Right now, one in five kids are facing poverty and two million Canadians are going to food banks. The $400 million could feed hundreds of thousands of them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802583">For seniors watching their pensions go up in smoke because of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s carbon tax and inflationary spending, $400 million could cover a year's worth of housing for around 10,000 of them. The $400 million could have gone toward our health care system, where one in four Canadians are set to lose primary care within a couple of years. The $400 million could hire 4,700 more nurses or 1,700 doctors to ease stress on the system. What was done with the $400 million? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802584">The SDTC scandal is just one example of the moral and financial corruption of NDP-Liberals. A few hours from now, we were supposed to hear the fall economic statement from the now <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation>, but she will not be delivering it because she is gone. She, like millions of Canadians, has no confidence in the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. In her resignation today, she said the government needs to keep its “fiscal powder dry” and avoid “costly political gimmicks”. Even she admitted the government has abandoned our people, saying Canadians know when government is focused on itself. Finally, she conceded the inevitable truth that the NDP-Liberal government will come to an end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802585">However, let us not forget that this is from the same disgracefully awful <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> who blew up the deficit, raised taxes on hard-working Canadians and could not even stay within her own fiscal guardrails. Her legacy is inflationary spending, higher taxes and broken promises.

              <ParaText id="8802588"> To quote Jody Wilson-Raybould, “When the general is losing his most loyal soldiers on the eve of a...war, the country desperately needs a new general”. I agree. For the sake of our country, Canadians need a carbon tax election today. This is not a serious government, and the matter we discussed today, the green slush fund scandal, one of the many scandals of the current government, has led us here to this very moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802589"> A question I am always asked by my neighbours back home is, how do we get out of this mess? How do we fix all that has been broken and get back to the country we all know and love? How can Canada go from middling power to the major power it could be? For starters, we can scrap these payouts to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s corporate cronies for so-called sustainable development projects. We can axe the carbon tax eating away at our paycheques, our industries and our trade, and shift our focus to the power of our resources sector. It is time for us to put Canada first above all else: our workers, our paycheques and our people. Our resources represent trillions that would fuel, feed and secure the world; bring home paycheques for our people; build energy projects, reducing emissions; build economic reconciliation with first nations; and rebuild our armed forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802590"> For many, Canada's role in the world is often centred on what we can do with our intellectual and cultural talents. We see ourselves as a country best suited to act as a teacher, a mediator or a good example. We cling to a Canadian diplomacy from an international order of a different age, but this excessive focus on Canada's social capital can distract from the fact that we actually are distinguished on one important front: energy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802591"> Canada is a world leader in its supply and mastery of virtually every energy resource and technology known to man. With this enviable access to the assets that fuel 21st century life increasingly reflecting real political power, Canada has the ability and the opportunity to present itself as a true leader. The sheer size of Canadian energy interests ensures virtually no corner of this planet is beyond our influence or our contribution, and should we choose to seize it, we have a unique opportunity to supply our allies with the energy they need, while also lessening the energy influence of the world's bad actors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802592">As economies require more and more energy, and rely more and more on supply routes from undesirable sources, the stakes and the upsides for every Canadian are high. China's energy imports have mirrored larger trends in its decisively illiberal foreign policy. Close relationships with Iran, Russia and Venezuela have kept China awash in petroleum, while Beijing plays defence for the atrocities of Putin and Maduro regimes in international forums.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802593"> In the Middle East, continued bad actions by the state of Qatar, including housing Hamas terrorists, have resulted in appropriate calls for the country's diplomatic and economic isolation. This provides ample opportunity for any nation willing to offer itself as an alternative to Qatari oil and gas, which is currently exported everywhere, from Morocco to Europe and Japan. Canada already has nuclear co-operation agreements with Jordan and the UAE. These agreements should be animated with long-term Canadian supply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802594"> It is perhaps in Europe, however, where the geopolitics of energy are most fraught and most open to Canadian supply. Vladimir Putin spent years choreographing Germany's dependencies on Russian oil. Having exploited that to shake down Europe, he intervened in Syria and Libya to subvert pipelines that would supply Europe and amplified misinformation against our own Canadian energy, ensuring a steady stream of revenue for Russia's war machine of nearly $1 billion a day, with $250 million a day from Germany alone, to fund his war machine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802595"> When Germany finally realized the costs of this, Chancellor Scholz and, subsequently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came knocking on our door for Canadian energy and both times we turned them away. The leadership Canada can demonstrate in offsetting these negative trends for energy, sustainable energy and energy technologies is clear. We should fearlessly pursue our economic interests by making Canadian energy resources and technologies accessible to those who want them, offsiding allied dependence on worse alternatives.</ParaText>

With growing uncertainty about whether this country has the capacity to get its energy to overseas markets, Canada has to do better. It is insufficient to merely repudiate the anti-energy agenda. A comprehensive Canadian energy action plan is needed to advance the essential resources that support the Canadian social safety net and can deliver Canadian leadership to a world that demands it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802597">We must liberate Alberta's oil sands from their landlocked status to dramatically increase Canadian oil exports and, at the same time, Canadian power on the international stage.

It has made us less competitive. The carbon tax is the source of much inflationary pressure on our goods and services in the marketplaces across the country today.

              <ParaText id="8802637">For those watching at home, SDTC was established by the Government of Canada in 2001.

              <ParaText id="8802638"> For many years, SDTC operated responsibly and earned a generally good reputation for its work. However, that all changed in 2019, when former Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains appointed Annette Verschuren as chair of SDTC. The issue at hand was a matter of conflict of interest. Verschuren was an entrepreneur who was already receiving SDTC funding through one of her own companies, and now she has been appointed by the NDP-Liberal government to hold responsibilities for overseeing those very SDTC funds, the same funds her company was receiving. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802639">That fact alone should have resulted in alarm bells and red flashing lights to alert everyone in the government about this obvious conflict of interest. In fact, it was no secret. The then minister, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office and the Privy Council Office all knew. They were warned of the risks associated with appointing a conflicted chair, yet those warnings fell on deaf ears and were taken with indifference; Verschuren was appointed by the Liberal minister anyway. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802640">We can tell a government has lost its moral compass when it makes poor decisions, such as this one, without concern for doing the right thing and without fear of consequence. Only two years later, in January 2021, former minister Bains announced that he had decided to step away from politics and not run again in the upcoming federal election. That same year, SDTC entered into a five-year, $1-billion agreement with the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, or ISED.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802641">If we fast-forward to this fall, it is clear the Liberals are trying desperately to run away and wash their hands of this mess, which they laid the foundation for through their own actions. This has especially been the case since the Auditor General released a scathing report about SDTC in June. The AG found massive issues, which resulted in the current <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice—Champlain, abolishing SDTC and immediately transferring its funds over to National Research Council Canada instead. These are truly astonishing developments in just three years for something the Liberal government does not want to talk about anymore. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802642">What did the Auditor General find that was so bad and caused all this carnage? In June, the AG found that SDTC demonstrated “Significant lapses in governance and stewardship of public funds”. In fact, nearly 20% of the SDTC projects examined by the AG were ineligible based on the government's own rules for funding, with a total price tag of $59 million. There were also 90 instances in which SDTC ignored conflict of interest provisions, awarding $76 million to various projects. Indeed, the AG found 63 cases in which SDTC agency directors voted in favour of payments to companies in which they had declared interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802643">Further, there were serious matters of governance, including the fact that the board did not even have the minimum number of members required by law. The report concluded, “Not managing conflicts of interest—whether real, perceived, or potential—increases the risk that an individual’s duty to act in the best interests of the foundation is affected, particularly when making decisions to award funding.” It also blamed the government's <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, whose ministry did not sufficiently monitor the contribution agreements with SDTC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802644">Members can believe it or not, but it gets far worse. In June, the Auditor General found that directors had “awarded funding to projects that were ineligible” and that “conflicts of interest existed”. The Auditor General found that over $330 million in taxpayer money was paid out in over 180 cases in which there was a potential conflict of interest, with Liberal-appointed directors funnelling money to companies they owned. Time after time, the Liberal government and its <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have shown total contempt for Canada's ethics laws. In fact, the Prime Minister himself has been the subject of three ethics investigations; twice, he was found guilty of breaking ethics laws. The Liberal government allows the culture of law-breaking to persist, and six Liberals have been found guilty of breaking ethics laws.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802645"> Liberals have gone through these ethical scandals before. That is why they are withholding these documents, breaching parliamentary privilege and trying desperately to sweep this mess under the rug and move on to the next thing. Common-sense Conservatives are not going to let them get away with it. We are holding the corrupt NDP-Liberal government to account. It will be held responsible for its carelessness, recklessness and, indeed, corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802646">That is why, on June 10, the House of Commons adopted our motion, which has led to this ongoing debate in the House. Let us not forget that the common-sense Conservative motion passed in this place with the support of the New Democrats, the Green Party and the Bloc Québécois. Only the Liberals opposed it. To be clear, nothing in that motion ordered the RCMP to conduct an investigation. The House simply asked that documents be turned over to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802647">Again, it has been 189 days since this motion passed. This is a horrible look for the Liberal government. Further, nothing in that House order contemplated redactions to documents being made by the government. That is because the House of Commons enjoys the absolute and unfettered power to order the production of documents, which is not limited by statute. These powers are rooted in the Constitution Act of 1867 and in the Parliament of Canada Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802648">In response to the Liberal government's failure to produce the documents, the <Affiliation DbId="291267" Type="7">Conservative House leader</Affiliation> rightly raised a question of privilege, arguing that the House privileges had been breached due to the failure to comply with the House order. In September, the Speaker agreed; now, nearly three months later, we continue our important debate on this matter. The Speaker ruled that the government has violated a House order to turn over evidence regarding the latest Liberal $400-million green slush fund scandal to the RCMP. The Liberal government's refusal to respect the Speaker's ruling has paralyzed Parliament, pushing aside all other work to address issues such as the cruel and crippling carbon tax, the cost of living crisis that Canadians face and the increasing crime, disorder and chaos on our streets and in our communities and cities. On top of all of this hardship, the incoming president of Canada's biggest trading partner is now threatening our country with 25% tariffs on all Canadian products exported to the U.S.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802649">If the government fails to improve Canada's border security and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs, such as fentanyl, from crossing into Canada's borders, what will the president-elect do?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802650">Since the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office in 2015, 47,000 Canadians have died from drug overdoses. That is more Canadians than we lost in the Second World War. It represents a 200% annual increase in drug overdose deaths after the Prime Minister's radical liberalization of drugs. After nine years of the NDP-Liberal government, it should not take U.S. tariff threats for our federal government to take action on this hugely important issue; however, as we have seen, issues only become important to the Liberals when their political fortunes are at stake. Canadian workers, Canadian families and Canadian businesses should not have to suffer the brunt of the pain and hardship caused by the NDP-Liberal government. They deserve so much better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802651">One of the drivers of this hardship is the cruel NDP-Liberal carbon tax. In fact, the carbon tax will cost the average Ontario family $903 this year. This is completely unacceptable to the constituents in my communities of Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Fort Erie, who work hard for their money, save carefully for their future and dream of a better tomorrow. Instead of doing anything about climate change, the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is impoverishing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802652">Recently, the PBO confirmed that Canadians will suffer a net cost, paying more in the carbon tax than they will get back in rebates. Unfortunately, the NDP-Liberal government does not care. Instead of giving Canadians the tax relief they deserve, they hiked the carbon tax by 23% last spring as part of their plan to quadruple the carbon tax by 2030. That is not all. They plan to hike the carbon tax again this April.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8802653">It turns out that the NDP-Liberal carbon tax is not an environmental plan at all. It is simply another tax grab, put in place so the government can continue its reckless spending frenzy, which we will hear more about. We were hoping to hear about it today, when we would have had the fall economic statement, but we simply do not know where that stands. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802654">The SDTC scandal is also happening at a time when costs are up on essentials, such as food. In fact, families will be spending $700 more this year on food than they did in 2023. When we tax the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who ships the food and the store that stocks, stores and sells the food, we end up taxing the families who buy the food. As Sylvain Charlebois, director of Dalhousie University's Agri-Food Analytics Lab, has said, the costly NDP-Liberal carbon tax “likely adds a significant cost burden to the Canadian food industry.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802655">Because of the NDP-Liberal government's inflationary spending and punishing carbon tax, food bank usage has increased every year it has been in office. This was confirmed recently by Feed Ontario, which revealed that a record one million people visited a food bank in Ontario in 2024. This is a dramatic increase of 25% from the previous year. In fact, Feed Ontario's CEO told media that day, “I never thought I would see this day.” Food Banks Canada reported earlier this year that it had seen a 50% increase in visits across Canada since 2021, with food banks handling a record two million visits in a single month. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802656">In my community alone, Project Share, for example, saw a 20% increase in people served this year compared with the previous year; 4,740 people accessed its services for the first time and 120 families, on average, accessed its essential support services per day. Let us think of the 13,995 people who were served last year at Project Share, which equates to one in seven residents of Niagara Falls having accessed its essential support services. We should be debating these issues, and we could do so if the government would simply abide by the Speaker's ruling and provide the documents the House has requested. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802657">Why are the Liberals hesitant to do what is right? Is it that they do not want to speak to the situation facing young Canadians and first-time homebuyers, which is so bad that the Canadian dream of home ownership is dying? Two-thirds of young people believe they will never be able to afford a home. There are almost 1,800 homeless camps in Ontario alone. Crime is also getting worse under the watch of the Liberal-NDP government. The issues I noted and so many more like them, such as the skyrocketing crime rate, are all pressing issues. Parliamentarians should be debating them instead of the SDTC crisis and scandal, but the House of Commons has been seized because the government refuses to comply with the House order to hand over these documents to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802658">It is time for us to get to the bottom of this and, more importantly, for the government to respond to the House order to provide the unredacted documents to the law clerk and the RCMP. It is time for the Liberal government to end its cover-up and provide the ordered documents to the police so that Parliament can get back to work and Canadians can have the accountability they rightfully deserve. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802694"> Let me go on to read what else the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> said: “you made clear that I no longer credibly enjoy that confidence and possess the authority that comes with it.” I would argue that she never had it in the first place, because the fake feminist <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and carbon tax Carney are in the background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802695"> Carbon tax Carney made his Canadian comeback just to fire the furious <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation>. That was his role. They used her, and they wanted to blame her for the finances of the country going over the cliff, only to disregard her afterward. This is all being done by the backroom boys of the fake feminist <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and carbon tax Carney.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802696">The <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> goes on to say, “you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada." She also says, “keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war. That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford and which make Canadians doubt that we recognize the gravity of the moment.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802697"> I could not agree more. These are political gimmicks. The Liberals just introduced a two-month temporary GST tax trick, which was a vote-buying scheme that businesses all across hated, that was going to be costly to them and that is not really going to bring in much more revenue. The Liberals brought it in at the busiest time of the year, just so the Liberal-NDP government could buy votes from Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802698"> However, Canadians are experiencing much more pain than that. While Liberals want to take pennies off peanuts or nickels off Nutty Bars, common-sense Conservatives want to axe the tax on everything, for everyone, for good. Enough of these cheap political gimmicks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802699">This carbon tax scam is more than a gimmick; it is pain. It is no environmental gain with all financial pain for Canadians, to the point where we see seniors who need to choose whether they heat their homes or buy a little more at the grocery store. They are getting through by putting blankets on. This is the reality of nine years of the corrupt, inept and weak Liberal-NDP government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802700">Instead of standing with Canadians and standing up for Canadian values, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> chose to start a war with the Americans. This is the same <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation>, obviously with the guidance of the weak <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who said, “Why don't you go ahead with your digital services tax? Why don't we join other countries doing it?” Can members believe we are in the same pod as countries like Pakistan, which has introduced this? We are not with our partners on this at all. Liberals knew it would be something that would impact Canadian businesses and could possibly get our tariffs raised by the U.S., but they still moved forward with it. They pissed everyone off. They pissed off the Americans. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802701">This is how incompetent the Liberal-NDP government is. It has no game plan. Once again, these cheap political gimmicks have Canadians footing the bill. At the end of the day, Canadians are having to suffer for these really incompetent political policies that have impacted them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802702">The <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> goes on to say, “our time in government will come to an end.” Yes, it will. We should put the tired, corrupt government out of its misery and call a carbon tax election now. We should give people control back, give Canadians back control of their lives, which is something they have lost. When Canadians see crime on the rise, hate crimes on the rise, and that the cost of everything is out of control, it is because they have a government that has worked against them. They have a <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader in the NDP</Affiliation> who has propped up the corrupt Liberal government for nine years, and now he is doing it just out of spite, just to get his $2.2-million pension. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802703">Canadians will remember this. Canadians will remember this at the next election. It is time for the government's time to come to an end. We have to give that power back to the people, where it belongs. There is only one leader in the entire House of Commons who will bring the power back to the people. That is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation>, the member for Carleton. </ParaText>

Again, there is only one leader in the House of Commons with that, and that is the member for <Affiliation DbId="278241" Type="2">Carleton</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802705">Once we have a common-sense Conservative government, we are going to axe the tax for good. We are going to get rid of the carbon tax to bring the cost of gas, groceries and home heating down. We are going to unleash the power of our natural resources, the world-renowned natural resources sector we have in Canada that the Liberal-NDP government has tried to kill with its oil and gas cap and all these other ridiculous policies like the carbon tax scam. We are going to axe the tax for good to bring home our natural resources and give them to the world in order to bring down emissions across the world. </ParaText>

There will be no more photo op funds and no more giving municipalities and mayors millions and billions of dollars just to create more bureaucracy. We are going to build the homes, not more bureaucracy. We are going to bring home a GST tax cut for homes that are a million dollars and under, which will generate up to 30,000 new homes and save up to $50,000 on those homes, which is going to lower the cost of mortgages. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802707">While I am on the topic of mortgages, after nine years of the Liberal-NDP government, housing costs have doubled. Whether one is renting or a mortgage holder, the costs have doubled. Why have they doubled? The Liberal-NDP government has fed into the bureaucracies at the municipal level, which have only increased their permitting fees. On top of that, it is the population control that they admit themselves is “out of control”. The Liberals did this; their incompetence did this. The Bank of Canada also confirmed that it is their out-of-control population growth that made costs to renters double. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802708">In order to not give Canadians 40-year highs in inflation like the Liberal-NDP government did, we are going to balance the budget, something the Liberal-NDP government has no idea of how to do. This is the same <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who said that budgets balanced themselves and that he does not think about monetary policy. Then he said to let the bankers worry about the economy. He loves the bankers. Those are his Bay Street buddies, the same ones that Canadians have to send money to, with more in debt-interest charges than what goes to provinces for health care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802709">After the incompetent <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> doubled the national debt, that is exactly what happened. Interest rates went up. Inflation went up. Of course, for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his rich buddies, their assets got inflated, while everyday Canadians had to pay for that incompetence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802710">We are going to balance the budget and bring in a dollar-for-dollar law. We are going to make sure that any dollar spent in any department has to be matched with a dollar of savings. Canadians and businesses have had to do that under this government. The government should do the same and respect the money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802711">There is no doubt that we are going to cut the Liberal waste. The waste that went to Liberal insiders, such as the friends of the Liberals who got so much money for arrive scam and for the consultants, the McKinsey consultants. Now we just found out from the Auditor General about the CEBA loans that went to fraudulent corporations and companies. This is just another rerun of the last nine years of this government. First it was CERB, and now it is CEBA. This is what incompetence looks like. Who has to pay for it? Canadians always end up having to pay for this incompetence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802712"> It is time for a common-sense Conservative government that will balance the budget, get rid of that Liberal waste and, of course, stop the crime. Canadians do not leave their houses now and sometimes live in their houses in absolute fear, because criminals have never had it so good. Under the Liberal-NDP government that brought in Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document> and <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, criminals have it way too easy. They commit crimes repeatedly and without any fear. They know they are going to get bail. They commit crimes over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802713"> However, just to virtue signal and to show that it is the most woke government, the Liberals created a bail system that is just too easy for criminals to get. That is why there is no more fear left within criminals. There is no fear in Canada. The only fear is from everyday Canadians who are just working to make it, to get by, to put food on their families' tables.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802714">However, now carjackings are up, violent crime is up and gun crime is up. Every day there are new videos coming out, and it is a result of this incompetent, woke government that lets criminals have zero consequences for what they do. We are going to stop the crime and bring in common-sense Conservative policies once again that will keep repeat offenders in jail and not grant them bail like this woke government has done over the last nine years. </ParaText>

Since federal regulations do not prohibit the release of asbestos fibres during renovations, workers in these environments can use the mapping tool to take action and demand compliance with occupational health and safety requirements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802743">I am proud to have supported this initiative, and I encourage public service managers to locate their asbestos-containing facilities and take steps to ensure that renovations to those structures do not cause work-related illness.</ParaText>

Recently, Parastoo Ahmadi, a courageous singer, was arrested for performing solo and without the forced hijab at a caravanserai in Kavir National Park defying those oppressive Islamic laws. Her courage echoes that of others like Armita Geravand and Jina Amini murdered by the regime or Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi, who continue to fight for justice. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8802772"> Mr. Speaker, Canada's settlement sector is the foundation for social cohesion, nation building and newcomer integration. Over 800 agencies are funded by IRCC to deliver a range of services, such as language classes with child care support, employment and career training, trauma-informed programs, family centres, and so much more. Last year, over 700,000 unique newcomers, primarily made racialized women across Canada outside of Quebec, were served by the sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802773"> Despite the sector's success, the Liberals are charting a course to massively cut these services. Many organizations have been told that their five-year contracts are not being renewed. Others face a cut of up to 70%. On top of that, a further deficit reduction plan is being levelled at the sector, and terms such as “refocus” are being used to cover up pending cuts to IRCC staffing. This would decimate service delivery and negatively impact the economy. The fallout would be felt for years to come. The NDP is calling on the Liberals to stop blaming newcomers for their failures and to immediately reverse these cuts.</ParaText>

That is why they voted against the Canada child benefit. That is why they refused to support the dental plan for Canadians, which benefits many Quebeckers. They voted against the guaranteed income supplement. They consistently vote against many measures that will help Quebeckers.

              <ParaText id="8802961">Mr. Speaker, the online harms bill is the product of four years of consultation. It is comprehensive legislation that would remove child sex abuse material from the Internet. By blocking that very act, the Conservatives have made a clear choice: that they will not prioritize the safety of our kids. They do not stand with parents. Amanda Todd's mother, Carol, said she has been waiting 12 years for this type of change. We need to pass this legislation to do right by Carol and every other parent of every other child who has suffered abuse online. The question for Canadians and for that party is this: Will will they stand with us and keep kids safe?</ParaText>

We heard a lot of testimony from police that the government's soft-on-crime measures have increased auto thefts in this country. We need tougher bail measures. We need tougher Criminal Code sentencing penalties for those responsible for auto theft. Conservatives have brought forward repeated measures to do so, which were voted down by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8802978">It is very clear, and we have reflected this in our dissenting report, that the only way we are going to get fewer auto thefts in this country is if a Conservative majority government comes into power and brings in those Criminal Code changes to toughen up our measures and ensure that the people responsible for stealing cars are put behind bars. That is what is going to happen if a Conservative government comes into power. We have reflected this in our dissenting report and I am very proud to contribute that to the public safety report on auto thefts.</ParaText>

NDAs are increasingly used to force workers into silence, preventing them from seeking help or speaking out about mistreatment and misconduct in the workplace.

To summarize, the residents state that due to bureaucratic impediments to passport issuance and unavailable consular services to many Ukrainians, Ukrainians under CUAET cannot apply for their open work permit extension, as many temporary resident statuses are linked to passport validity. As Ukrainians cannot return to Ukraine due to the war, without a passport and without a valid work permit they become undocumented residents without a legal authorization to work or study in Canada. </ParaText>

This is something that is commonly invoked when domestic violence is reported on the part of a custodial parent. It is an unfounded and dangerous theory, and it sometimes causes courts to lose sight of the best interests of the child and make decisions focused on parental rights, and to trivialize domestic violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803021">The United Nations has spoken out on this through a special rapporteur. The special rapporteur on violence against women and girls has urged governments to prohibit family courts from using parental alienation pseudo-theory.

              <ParaText id="8803050">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), since 2018, Sport Canada has worked in consultation with experts and athletes to promote safe, welcoming and inclusive environments for all sport participants, bolstered by investments in budgets 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803051">The Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner, OSIC, was launched by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada, SDRCC, in June 2022 as part of the abuse-free sport program. The OSIC manages complaints related to violations of the universal code of conduct to prevent and address maltreatment in sport, UCCMS, and undertakes sport environment assessments. The abuse-free sport program also offers education, prevention tools and resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803052">Given that the abuse-free sport program, including the OSIC, was established in 2022, Sport Canada did not provide funding for the program prior to the 2021-22 fiscal year. However, since 2021-22, Sport Canada has provided the following funding to support the abuse-free sport program, including the OSIC: $2,067,500 in 2021-22, including $272,500 to establish the OSIC; $4,000,000 in 2022-23, including $1,862,200 to implement the OSIC; $6,000,000 in 2023-24, including $3,380,000 to maintain and enhance the OSIC; and $4,000,000 in 2024-2025, including $2,685,000 to maintain the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803053">With regard to part (b), given that the abuse-free sport program, including the OSIC, was established in 2022, the following information pertains to 2022 onward. In 2022-23, the OSIC had six full-time staff members and one part-time staff member. In 2023-24, the OSIC had seven full-time staff members, one part-time staff member and one temporary staff member. As of 2024-25, the OSIC has 10 full-time staff members, one part-time staff member and three temporary staff members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803054">These figures only include the OSIC’s employees and contractors. The entire abuse-free sport program includes more employees who are not part of the OSIC, such as those employed to work on safe sport education, athlete/survivor outreach, research, legal aid, mental health support, accounting and communications, as well as safeguarding tribunal staff. The director of sanctions and its deputy director are not included in these figures as they do not report to the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803055">With regard to (c)(i), the following information was gathered through the SDRCC’s regular reporting, which is publicly available.  Between June 20, 2022, when the OSIC was launched, and March 31, 2023, a total of 96 complaints were received, 32 of which were admissible to the OSIC. In 2023-24, a total of 299 complaints were received, 134 of which were admissible to the OSIC. In the first period of 2024-25, a total of 187 complaints were received, 77 of which were admissible to the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803056">With regard to (c)(ii), in 2022-23, 64 of the 96 complaints received were deemed inadmissible to the OSIC. In 2023-24, 165 of the 299 complaints received were deemed inadmissible to the OSIC. In the first period of 2024-25, 110 of the 187 complaints received were deemed inadmissible to the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803057">With regard to (c)(iii), in 2022-23, provisional measures were imposed by the office of the director of sanctions, DSO, in eight cases. In 2023-24, provisional measures were imposed by the office of the DSO in 34 cases. In the first semester of 2024-25, provisional measures were imposed by the office of the DSO in 32 cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803058">Further information can be found on the OSIC’s website, annual reports from 2022-23 and 2023-34 and periodical reports from June 20–September 19, 2022, September 20–December 31, 2022, January 1–March 31, 2023, April 1–June 30, 2023, July 1–October 31, 2023, November 1–March 31, 2024, and April 1–September 30, 2024. For more information, please contact the OSIC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803059">With regard to (d)(i) and (ii), clear data on the total number of complaints deemed inadmissible due to the respondent not being under the authority of a program signatory or being involved at the provincial, territorial or club level is not available for fiscal year 2022-23. As of April 1, 2023, the Government of Canada required federally funded sport organizations to participate in the abuse-free sport program to be eligible for federal funding. During this transition, some cases initially deemed inadmissible were reactivated when relevant sport organizations joined the abuse-free sport program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803060">The following information was gathered through the SDRCC’s regular reporting, which is publicly available. In 2023-24, complaints were deemed inadmissible for the following reasons: the organization listed is a program signatory of abuse-free sport, but the respondent is not a participant under the authority of a signatory, e.g., involved at the club level only – 63%; the matter is unrelated to the UCCMS – 26%; or the complaint/report contained inadequate information to proceed, e.g., no respondent identified, and no method of contacting the reporter to obtain necessary information was provided – 8.2%; the organization is not a signatory – 1.4%; other reasons – 1.4%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803061">The total number of inadmissible complaints is not available, as some complaints were deemed inadmissible for multiple reasons and are counted in more than one of the above categories.</ParaText>

            <ResponseContent>
              <ParaText id="8803064">Mr. Speaker, with regard to part (a), as Canada’s federal pesticide regulator, Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency, PMRA, published the information note, “Vertical farming and pest control products” on May 1, 2024, in order to ensure the health and safety of Canadians and the environment. Due to rising confusion within the user industry surrounding whether they could use pesticides labelled for greenhouses in vertical farming, and to help provincial partners address this, the PMRA felt the publication of this information note would aid in clearing up any potential confusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803065">In Canada, pesticides are federally regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, PCPA, which is administered by Health Canada’s PMRA. As stipulated under the PCPA, a pesticide may only be permitted to be used or sold in Canada after it has undergone a rigorous scientific assessment process that provides reasonable certainty that no harm to human health and the environment will occur, and that products have value, when used according to label directions. Under the Pest Control Products Regulations, pesticide label directions must include any use limitations, including the intended site for the use of a pesticide, e.g., greenhouses, and procedures to reduce risks associated with that use must be included on the product label.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803066">There is currently not sufficient data for Health Canada to assess the hazards and risks associated with vertical farming, such as occupational and dietary exposure risks and how the pesticide breaks down in the work environment after application under vertical farming conditions. This lack of availability of the required scientific data is a result of this method of crop protection being relatively new. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of those involved in current vertical farming practices in Canada, PMRA issued an information note to inform all parties of the requirement for this registered use on pesticide products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803067">With regard to part (b), it is important to note that each intended site for the use of a pesticide, i.e., use site category, USC, has mandatory and specific data requirements that must be submitted with an application to register a pesticide for sale or use in Canada. This information is listed on the PMRA webpage Use Site Category (DACO Tables).</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803068">Vertical farming differs from greenhouse growing in various aspects including air circulation, lighting and plant density. These differences can affect how much pesticide a worker is exposed to, how long the pesticide remains on the treated plants, how much may be transferred to skin and clothing, etc. The PMRA is in the process of investigating how these differences may affect potential risks of pesticide use in vertical farming, and what, if any, amendments to data requirements would be needed to register pesticides for this use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803069">With regard to part (c), there have been no dedicated exchanges or correspondence between Health Canada’s PMRA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, USEPA, on this topic. However, the PMRA outlined its efforts to learn more about this new technology in October 2022 and November 2023, at the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, CUSMA, meetings of the North American Trilateral Technical Working Group on Pesticides. Regulatory officials from the USEPA were present at both meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803070">With regard to part (d), to date, Health Canada’s PMRA has not received any applications for the specific use of pesticides in vertical farming. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803072">Mr. Speaker, the CRA can neither confirm nor deny the assertion contained in the preamble to the above-noted question regarding the named entity. The confidentiality provisions of the acts administered by the CRA prohibit the CRA from commenting on specific taxpayer information. This also includes information that may have been obtained from third parties, for example, tax preparers, as information collected through the electronic filing of returns, EFILE, is protected under the Income Tax Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803073">With regard to parts (a) to (f), for reasons noted in the preamble to this response, the CRA is unable to speak to any specific cases. Generally speaking, when the CRA becomes aware of suspected identity theft cases, it undertakes an analysis and investigates the situation. Furthermore, until such an analysis or investigation is complete, the CRA would not comment as the information may be incomplete or could lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803105"> Mr. Speaker, I have been in this place now for over 20 years. I have never seen a situation like this before. Today is the day the government waited until to table the fall economic update where it would publish the true deficit numbers that Canadians will be on the hook for.</ParaText>

Things are unclear; there are some media reports indicating that there may be a replacement now, but at the time of the writing of her letter, it was not even clear who the finance minister was.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803107">All this is at a time when Canadians are facing an emergency situation. They are facing the fastest rate of inflation in over a generation with food inflation; food prices are rising 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States. They are facing a housing crisis that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> caused by doubling housing costs with mortgage and rent payments. Two million Canadians are lining up at food banks. There is crime and chaos on our streets, and now the government is in shambles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803108">By waiting until the second-last day of the December sitting, the government was hoping to table the fall economic update and then run and hide for six weeks in the snow, depriving parliamentarians of holding the government to account, the very thing Parliament exists for: to oversee government spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803109">Because of the situation, we find ourselves in an unprecedented case where some new person is going to table the fall economic update, we believe. It is still unclear, according to media reports. It is unclear how the economic update will be presented, and it is unclear whether or not any parliamentarians will be able to participate in any kind of questioning of whichever minister ends up delivering it or tabling it, if one actually does. Then the House will rise at the end of the day tomorrow for six weeks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803110">Because of this unprecedented and emergency situation, I believe that the best thing you, Mr. Speaker, can do to uphold the integrity of Parliament as an institution that exists to oversee, scrutinize and approve government taxation and spending is to grant an emergency debate. That is what my letter to you outlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803111">When we look at the situation facing Canada, including threats from abroad; 25% tariffs; staring down the barrel of a gun pointed at us by a U.S. President-elect with a strong and fresh new mandate, who can smell weakness from a mile away; and a cabinet in chaos, with one-fifth of the government caucus demanding that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> resign, we believe that it is now time for you, Mr. Speaker, to grant the House at least the opportunity to question the government for a few hours this evening on what should be its fall economic presentation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803112"> The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">former finance minister</Affiliation> herself said that going past the $40-billion guardrail would plunge the country into another round of nightmarish inflation and interest rate hikes. Media reports are speculating as to how high the deficit will go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803113">I know that there are precedents and guidelines you, Mr. Speaker, might look to as to whether you should approve an emergency debate. However, given the fact that there is really no other opportunity for parliamentarians to debate the issues, to scrutinize the economic update that is scheduled to happen this afternoon, I believe it is incumbent upon you now, Mr. Speaker to consider the rights of individual MPs and the House as a collective to be the representatives of Canadian taxpayers and to hold the government to account for its economic update later on today.</ParaText>

Parliamentarians should not be deprived of the information as to what the fiscal situation is here in Canada. Canadians are facing an unprecedented crisis on housing, inflation, debt and deficits. The Liberal government has a statutory obligation to table these documents by the end of the year. This is the second last sitting day, and you have just denied a request for an emergency debate on this very same issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803167"> There is no other opportunity for parliamentarians to find out just how bad the books are.

It is a problem for Canadians, but it is not a problem caused by Canadians, and they have a right to know exactly what is happening with their tax dollars. For the government to come in at literally the last minute and pull the carpet out from under an economic update is unbelievable.

              <ParaText id="8803176">Mr. Speaker, the motion adopted on December 11 states that “the Speaker shall interrupt the proceedings”. It does not say that the Speaker may interrupt the proceedings. We believe that you have an obligation to interrupt the orders of the day. The Liberals have nothing to say, even though the in camera status has been lifted. There are journalists outside the House right now disclosing the content of the economic update, while we are being told, in all seriousness, that we do not deserve to know what is in the update and that we will not have an opportunity to respond to it or to ask any questions on behalf of our constituents. Some pretty unparliamentary language comes to mind, quite frankly, and I will not resort to using it, but this makes no sense whatsoever. This government has no idea what it is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803177">This is a serious breach of parliamentary privilege. Members of the House deserve to have access to that content. If the government does not have the courage to stand up and present it, then it should table the document. I have colleagues who were at the in camera meeting who could respond to the content of the statement. We demand the right to respond and to uphold the rights of our constituents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803180">Mr. Speaker, I will try to add to what has already been said. Obviously, not only certain parliamentarians have had access already, when most of us do not, but also journalists have had access to it already. That will leak. There is a precedent. In the mid-to-late 1980s, then-finance minister Michael Wilson's printed budget leaked. There is a printed budget that is available to be tabled now, a fall economic statement. They can table those documents now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803181">When it was leaked, the then minister of finance had to go to the press gallery, because the House was not sitting in the evening, and he actually had to deliver the full budget so that parliamentarians could get access. This is a similar situation in that we now have select people, some of whom are not parliamentarians, who have access to those documents. I personally believe that it is a breach of my privilege that a journalist has access to those documents and that I do not, when the government can simply table the budget, the fall economic statement documents, in the House now, without giving the speech.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803246">Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I am shocked to be rising in the House of Commons to announce this government's deficit. Usually, the Liberals would be the ones to announce the deficit in their economic update. However, they came to the House of Commons to table an economic update without even wanting to give a speech about it. They do not even have a finance minister who is brave enough to talk about it. He is hiding at Rideau Hall rather than doing his job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803247">There were three finance ministers today. The former <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">minister of finance and deputy prime minister </Affiliation> stepped down. Right after that, the <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> automatically became the finance minister under cabinet's system of delegation. He immediately announced that he, too, was resigning because he did not want to take responsibility for the country's finances given what he had just learned about them. The <Affiliation DbId="300017" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, who was responsible for securing our broken borders in light of the U.S. president-elect's tariff threats, has now become the Minister of Finance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803248">However, he is nowhere to be found. His whereabouts are a great mystery. What is no longer a mystery, however, is the staggering size of the deficit. We were promised that the federal deficit would not surpass the $40-billion guardrail. The reality is that the deficit has reached $62 billion. That is 55% higher than promised eight months ago. It is out of control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803249">I will give the former finance minister credit for seeing, a few months ago, just how dangerous this government's deficit was. It was threatening to increase inflation, slowing interest rate cuts, jeopardizing our social programs and slowing our economic growth. That is why she said there would be a red line to prevent the deficit from going beyond $40 billion. It was a guardrail. Guardrails prevent buses from falling off cliffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803250">Then the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took the wheel. He pulled to the left. He hit the guardrail. The bus is now falling off the cliff and is at the bottom of the ravine in a big pile of debt that threatens the future of Canadians. That is why, today, we are announcing that we are going to vote against this plan. We are calling on the NDP do its job, for once, and vote in favour of a non-confidence motion on this out-of-control, corrupt and costly government. We need an election. That is what we need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803251">Here is an astonishing fact. My grandfather came to Canada from Ireland. Why? Because Ireland was poor. Today, Ireland is twice as rich as Canada.

Although they have no oil or natural resources and lack the huge advantage of living next to the United States, which has the largest economy in the world, the Irish are now twice as rich as we are because they made good decisions. I was told that there are only two kinds of people in the world: Irish people and people who want to be Irish. From an economic perspective, that is true.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803252">Ireland reduced taxes, cut the red tape to speed up big projects, and opened its economy to give entrepreneurs economic freedom and to reduce the size of government. The Government of Ireland costs 23% of the country's economy. Here, it costs more than 40%. When the Irish government was cut in half, the wealth of its citizens doubled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803253">We know what to do. We need to break down all the barriers that governments have put in place. We need to cut back on bureaucracy, consultants and corporate nonsense, which is a big waste of money. We need to reduce deficits and taxes, eliminate red tape, and allow freedom of competition and open-mindedness. This will let us generate bigger paycheques that people will bring home to invest in their communities. That will let us lower inflation and taxes and have a dollar that keeps its value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803254">That is what we are going to do to fight the threat that future President Trump and his tariffs pose.

Now we need to get back to the principle of common sense, the basic principle.

              <ParaText id="8803256">I rise today, flabbergasted by the news that has just been made public. The government has finally revealed its true deficit number. Let us remember, the finance minister, this outgoing and now <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> told the world that she was putting in place guardrails to limit the damage that her deficits could do. Her deficit plan was $40 billion, a mind-bogglingly large number, that was already contributing to rekindling inflation, again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803257">This $40 billion was too big. It was out of control, as it was. However, at least to her credit, she said, “No more than that.” She decided she would have a guardrail. We know a guardrail is meant to stop vehicles from flying off cliffs. She was trying throughout the year to avoid going off the cliff.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803258"> There were two people on the bus who had other ideas, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and carbon tax Carney. The two of them went to the front of the bus, they grabbed the wheel, they pulled it sharply to the left, smashing into that guardrail, and she tried to resist. They pulled even further to the left, and they stepped on the gas. The bus flew off the cliff, and now Canadians are at the bottom of the ravine in a big pile of debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803259">However, instead of taking responsibility, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told her that she should take all the blame. That when the ambulances, the police cruisers and the fire department arrived, she should take the blame for running the bus off the cliff, and that carbon tax Carney and the Prime Minister could innocently sit back. The Prime Minister could then put carbon tax Carney in charge of driving the next bus. The good old boys in the back room would protect themselves and make the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">then-finance minister</Affiliation> take all the blame. </ParaText>

Indeed, some feminist he is, throwing the bus off the cliff and throwing women under the bus. That is his real record. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803261">His real record on finance is yet another $62-billion deficit. For context, outside the current government, no government in the history of Canada has ever run a $62-billion deficit. Not even in the nineties, when The Wall Street Journal said we were a third world basket case, and not even during the massive global economic crisis did the deficit come anywhere close to that, yet here we are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803262">With the global economy growing, with the American economy booming in stable times, this deficit is 100% at the feet of the irresponsible <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his personal economic adviser, carbon tax Carney. Now Carney says he does not even want the job of finance minister. He does not even want to try to drive the crashed-out bus after he helped run it off the cliff. The Liberals could not find anyone all day. In fact, no one will appear today to defend this incredible disaster of a budget.</ParaText>

Unemployment is rising and, according to the budget, expected to exceed 7% by the end of next calendar year. The gap between per capita GDP in Canada and the U.S. is now 30,000 Canadian dollars, although it was equal 10 years ago. This is the worst gap since at least the Second World War, and some say it is the worst gap in a century. </ParaText>

Today, the government was supposed to table the economic update and present it to the House. One does not need a PhD to know that the government has to make a speech when it tables such a document and that the opposition must have the right to reply. However, the government has muzzled MPs. I watched all of this play out. The Liberals are as confused as a chameleon in a bag of Skittles. They are completely lost. We are all wondering whether we are going to have a right of reply. We found a way to reply, and we are very happy about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803308">We were on pins and needles as we waited for the economic update. We thought that it might contain something extraordinary, but there was nothing there except one very important thing. The only essential information is this. In April, the former <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> promised, hand on heart, that the deficit would not exceed $40 billion. I am certain she was sincere. However, since then, all we have seen is problem after problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803309">In October, the Parliamentary Budget Officer forecast a deficit of $46.8 billion. That was worrying. Then the election goodies started, with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> handing them out left and right. People had to calm him down a bit, but the Prime Minister was not done yet. He is a bit over the top when it comes to spending. We now find ourselves staring down a $48.3‑billion deficit, and that is not the end of it either. There are three and a half months to go before the end of the fiscal year. It is worrying. That is what the economic update offered. My colleague will talk about that in more detail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803310">In reading this document, it is clear that there is nothing exceptional about it, except for one thing: the Minister of Finance resigned. The person who was supposed to table this document stepped down. She chose not to table it because she has principles. Perhaps the Prime Minister can learn something from his former finance minister. She had promised not to exceed $40 billion, but she did not agree with the Prime Minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803311">At one point, the Prime Minister had Mr. Morneau resign because he was not spending enough. Some people are saying that the Prime Minister provoked the finance minister's resignation because he did not think she was spending enough. That is disturbing. It is always easy to spend other people's money, and the Prime Minister knows a thing or two about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803312">Today, the Deputy Prime Minister resigned. This is like if Spock, from <I>Star Trek</I>, threw himself out a porthole to escape the <I>Enterprise</I> after losing all trust in Captain Kirk. It is unheard of. People are saying that the Deputy Prime Minister resigned, but keep in mind that she was the second-in-command of the government. She took a few swipes at the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on her way out the door, too. Obviously, I mean figurative swipes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803313">We had a government that was not working well. Everything it touched turned to mud. It had the opposite of the Midas touch. As soon as something that was working well landed on the Prime Minister's desk, it turned to mud, with lots of smoke pouring out from everywhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803314">There were 20 Liberal mutineers who were popular this summer. Then that number climbed to 40. It was not clear what was going on. Finally, the mutineers calmed down. Now there are eight ministers who are not running in the next election, but it does not end there. There are eight ministers that we know of who are saying they are not interested in running in the next election. They did not exactly put it that way. They came up with excuses. They see the polls and they have to turn the poll upside down to see if they are in first place. At some point, they looked at the polls and realized that things were not going their way. They started talking amongst themselves. It seems like the Prime Minister is the only one who thinks he still has a chance, but he has never been good with numbers. That might explain some things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803315">The Liberal Deputy Prime Minister has decided to jump ship. I feel for those folks. I saw their faces during question period. They are going through a tough time. I look at the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and wonder whether the guy still has the confidence of his members. I think not.

If he was trying to show leadership on the international stage, it is fair to say that he missed the mark, so there is that, too.</ParaText>

The House has been paralyzed for the past three months because the government is refusing to hand over documents. We have been talking to the government and asking it why it does not free up Parliament. The government says that it is because it does not want to hand over the documents, even though it has been ordered by the House to do so. The government does not want to hand over the documents, and Parliament is paralyzed. However, that does not bother the government because it no longer has any vision or ideas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803319">The only idea that the government had was the GST holiday. I think the government can let that go, calm down, take a shower and have a cup of tea. That is the only decision that the government has made, and it has been condemned by economists, Quebeckers and business owners. Everyone was against that idea. The government spent $1.6 billion on a ridiculous GST holiday. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803320">I could tell all kinds of stories about that. It is completely ridiculous, and nobody can figure out how it works. For example, the GST exemption applies to soft dolls. A woman had a soft doll with a rigid head, so the question was what to do about that and whether the doll was exempt. It took 12 people to talk about it and figure it out. What is that all about? That is what things have come to. This is a government that does not deserve Canadians' confidence and that does not have Canadians' confidence.

What we would like is for this Prime Minister to act like a statesman, like de Gaulle. He should stand up in the House and roll up his sleeves. If he is convinced he is right, he should call an election. It is the only option he has left.</ParaText>

We will be back in the House with a lot more MPs.</ParaText>

It was an election platform issue for the Conservative Party. It had made a commitment, but instead of two months, it was only going to be for one month. Even the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> talked very positively about that in his tweet. Then the Conservatives changed their minds.

People do not like that, and businesses are tearing their hair out over this two-month measure. Taxes are going to be taken off some products, but we are still not entirely sure which products the measure covers. Two months later, the government is going to reapply the tax. I think it cost the public treasury $1.6 billion. They say that people will benefit from this measure, but we need to know who is going to benefit. Who is going to benefit the most from these one-time exemptions? It will not be the people in greatest need, the people who need more help from the government.

              <ParaText id="8803344">Madam Speaker, today in the House, the government tabled the 2024 fall economic statement. Whose economic statement is it, exactly? Did the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation>, who announced her resignation this morning, draft it? I am not sure, because she chose to resign rather than endorse it. Is it the economic statement of the new finance minister, who was probably just sworn in moments ago and was the Minister of Public Safety? Has he even read it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803345">It was the <Affiliation DbId="310760" Type="4">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> who came to table the document in the House, without making a speech or delivering the speech that was probably already prepared. Does the government House leader endorse this economic statement, given that she decided to table it but did bother getting up to defend it? In a few minutes, will the now Minister of Finance, who was the Minister of Public Safety, come in and defend this document? Does he know how many pages it has? Does he know what is on the cover? Has he held it in his hands? We do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803346">This statement is obviously very disappointing, even if we do not know who wrote it. Perhaps it was the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, but we do not know. One thing is certain, this statement does not tell us much. This government has run out of steam and has little direction. It is a bit like a rudderless ship with a torn sail, and its only hope is to rely on a lucky star to get it where it needs to go. That is what it feels like, reading this document. We do not know whose responsibility it is at the moment, because no one is defending it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803347">There are two interesting numbers in this document. There is the deficit for the current year, but, most importantly, the fall statement—which is more like a sad Christmas statement, the Christmas of a grinch government, we might say—includes the amount of last year's deficit. We finally have the figure for last year's deficit. We can read that amount in this document. To reassure the economic class in English Canada and the economic interests of Canada, the former finance minister said she would put in a fiscal anchor. She said it was true that they kept exceeding the deficit since 2015, that they kept spending too much, that they would set an anchor at $40 billion and that we had her word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803348">Last year's deficit is $61.9 billion. We found that out just before leaving for the holidays in a document tabled at the last minute and defended by who knows who. Why? Because the government still has not tabled the public accounts. They are usually tabled in September, but I think we are not going to get them before the end of this year. It will surely be in the first sitting days of next year. If not, there is still tomorrow. We are talking about a $61.9-billion deficit for last year. The former finance minister, however, hand on her heart, said it would be $40 billion, that it was time to stop spending money left and right, and that we had her word.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803349">Now, she has stepped down and we are seeing that last year's deficit was $61.9 billion. What will it be this year? The year is not over yet. As the <Affiliation DbId="278793" Type="7">House leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> was saying a few moments ago, there are still three and half months left in the year and the government has already exceeded the $40-billion mark, despite a solemn promise to the contrary. The deficit is now just over $48 billion. I am anxious to see what it will be at the end of March. When will we find out? Will it be next Christmas or after the election? That is how lax the current government is. That is what we have been seeing. This is truly ridiculous. It makes no sense. This economic statement is going to go down in history for all the wrong reasons. The former finance minister chose to step down rather than endorse this economic statement, which discredits everything the government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803350">The government made a commitment. Apart from the appalling figures, that is about all we saw. We were told that a border plan would be presented. That did not happen in this document. It is not a plan, it is a number. It says $1.3 billion for the borders over the next six years. Why $1.3 billion? Because, converted into U.S. dollars, that is $1 billion. President-elect Trump will be happy; $1 billion is good. We tried to grill officials a bit by asking what the money will be used for. Will it be for drones, guards, helicopters?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803351">There is no plan. Officials said that they would put a number on it and that, eventually, there would be a plan. The former <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation> wrote that, but she resigned so she would not have to endorse it, and the new Minister of Finance has no idea what is in the document. It is really embarrassing. Why did the minister resign? It is because she had promised not to exceed $40 billion, but her government keeps resorting to vote-buying measures, like the $1.64 billion for the GST break. That is in there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803352">The government is going further into debt to give people gifts in hopes of boosting its standing in the polls, but it is not working. Meanwhile, all the business owners are having to adjust to this, for just two months. It makes no sense. People think it is not significant enough to make them change their spending choices. When we look at the items that are zero-rated, there are some good ones, such as diapers and children's clothing, but the focus seems to be on restaurants, alcohol and junk food. Is that responsible? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that he wanted to send $250 cheques to everyone earning up to $150,000 net income, which amounts to $270,000 gross income per year, but not to people who really need it. He thought this would give him a boost in the polls. In the end, he is all alone. I do not think there is a single line in that statement about the infamous cheques. The measure has simply been forgotten and will never be mentioned again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803353">Another thing missing from the economic statement is capital gains. Members will recall that the government said in its last budget that it would be implementing this measure to try to balance the books. That was supposed to happen in June 2024. There was a notice of ways and means, but ultimately it was no good. No bill ever followed. Then we were told about another notice of ways and means, but ultimately, it also failed and was never introduced. I was really looking forward to going in camera to read this document and find out the details. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803354">When are we going to get to see the details? There is not a single line about that either. We know that it amounts to $7 billion this year. If this measure is not implemented, it means another $7 billion will be added to the deficit. That is not to mention all the businesses and individuals who made decisions based on this measure. Frankly, none of it makes any sense. This government is a ship drifting off course with no rudder and no sail. I think that, out of respect, as the former finance minister said in her letter to the Prime Minister, we must work for the public first, ahead of party and personal interests. In the interests of the common good, an election must be called, because right now we see nothing but an endless parade of debacles, ineptitude and infighting. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803355">There are a few measures in the economic statement, but nothing really new or meaningful. It is mostly about extending programs. The bulk of the spending it sets out is for 2028, 2029 and 2030, at the end of the next term in office or after that. The minister must have thought that the Liberals would win a majority government because it seems the Liberals were already planning what they will do in the final years of that majority term. As the <Affiliation DbId="278793" Type="7">House leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> was saying earlier, St. Jude is the patron saint of hopeless causes. I think that, at this point, the government should go light some candles to ask for help from St. Jude, although even St. Jude no longer has confidence in this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803356">In the meantime, the needs are there. What is more, some needs, such as supply management, would not cost the government anything. The supply management bill is still stuck in the Senate. Are we ever going to see it pass? Is the government doing its job? No, it is not. The religious exemption for hate speech would not cost a penny. It is urgently needed, considering what we are seeing in the streets, considering what is happening, yet the government is not doing anything to eliminate it. The help we wanted for seniors aged 65 to 74 would have cost half as much as the election goodies that the government is proposing, and it would have been a game-changer. We can say the same thing about social housing, where there are still significant needs. None of that was addressed. We expected a plan for protecting the border, but there was nothing. Then there are all the challenges with Canada-U.S. relations and EI reform. The government completely neglected all of those concerns.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8803373">Madam Speaker, on the occasion of the 2024 fall economic statement, it is clear that Canada is at a crossroads. Many Canadians are struggling and uncertain about their and their families' futures. We are facing multiple, overlapping crises that require immediate and decisive action from the federal government, yet we are watching a Liberal government in complete disarray, out of ideas, flailing with gimmickry and unable to implement a coherent, effective plan to address these challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803374">We are also seeing a Conservative opposition that has reduced these complex issues to nursery rhymes, able to only muster bumper-sticker slogans to the most challenging problems facing Canadians. They are proposing outdated policies that not only will not work but caused many of the structural problems we are seeing today in the first place. They will cut the services Canadians need, reward their corporate backers and create untold damage to working and middle-class Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803375">Let us review the major crises facing Canadians as a result of successive Conservative and Liberal governments. The cost of living crisis continues to escalate, with millions of people struggling to make ends meet. The cost of essentials such as rent and food have increased by over 20% and 21% over the last three years. Fully half of all Canadians are living paycheque to paycheque, and one in four parents have cut back on their own food consumption to ensure their children have enough to eat. The rising costs of staples such as home heating, telecommunications and transportation are straining household budgets, making it virtually impossible for families to save for the future or handle unexpected expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803376">Eighty per cent of Canadians now believe that owning a home in Canada is only for the rich. Among those who do not own a home, over 70% have given up on ever owning one. In major cities across Canada, tenants are regularly paying over 50% of their income on shelter, which is a crippling and unsustainable burden.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803377">Income inequality in Canada has hit the highest level ever recorded. The top 20% of Canadians hold more than two-thirds of the country's wealth, averaging $3.4 million per household. By comparison, the bottom 40% of Canadians own only 2.8% of our country's wealth. At the same time, the top 5% of income earners paid a lower overall tax rate in 2022 than the bottom 95%, with the top 1% paying an even lower rate. Welcome to Conservative and Liberal tax policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803378">After decades of federal underfunding, Canada's health care system is under serious strain with long wait times, inadequate access to essential services and high levels of burnout among health care workers. Millions of Canadians do not have a family doctor, which is critical to accessing our health care system. I remember campaigning with Jack Layton in 2008 when he pointed out that five million Canadians had no family doctor. We then saw, for the next seven years, a Conservative government under Stephen Harper, and here we are, nine years after that, under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and there are more Canadians today who do not have a family doctor after those decades of Conservative and Liberal government in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803379">Thousands of Canadians continue to be harmed by the toxic drug crisis without timely access to publicly funded treatment facilities and other life-saving services. Canada is facing a serious mental health care shortage, with wait times for mental health services especially long for children and youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803380">The urgency of climate action cannot be overstated. By 2025, the previous 10 years of climate change will have reduced Canada's GDP by an estimated $25 billion. Without concerted action, by 2030 GDP will be an estimated $35 billion lower than it would have been otherwise, and by 2055 it will be an estimated $100 billion lower. When the Conservatives come talking about the price of the carbon tax, we should ask them what the cost of inaction in dealing with the climate crisis is. It is multiple billions more than the action to deal with it.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803381"> Moreover, when governments are forced to cover the costs of climate change by rebuilding damaged infrastructure, paying for increased health care costs and fixing damages from weather-related disasters, including compensating farmers for lost agricultural products, capital is diverted from activities that would drive additional growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803382"> Youth unemployment in Canada hit 14.5% in August. That is the highest level since 2012, outside the COVID-19 pandemic. Some one million Canadians under 29 are without jobs or training today, as we speak. That is an issue of intergenerational inequity that Deloitte estimates will cost our economy $18.5 billion over the next decade, never mind the cost in broken dreams and shattered lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803383"> Enhancing productivity is vital for economic growth and competitiveness. However, spending on machinery and equipment by businesses, and on research, development, innovation and training, has been falling as a share of Canada's GDP for decades. Actually, it has been since 2000, and this is despite the large corporate tax cuts introduced at the turn of the century and promoted by both Conservative and Liberal governments. With rapid job creation and population growth, business capital investment has not kept up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803384">Despite its commitments, the federal government is failing to achieve reconciliation with indigenous peoples. Indigenous housing, water and infrastructure are in perilous conditions. The lack of progress on nation-to-nation governance and the stripping of wealth from indigenous territories have resulted in poverty rates and incarceration levels among indigenous people that are nothing short of shameful. The government has failed to fully implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls for action and the calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803385">New Democrats believe that these crises and other priorities demand urgent and comprehensive action to ensure a prosperous, fair and sustainable future for all Canadians. However, this fall's economic statement has demonstrated once again that the Liberals are out of touch and unable to respond to the realities that Canadians are experiencing. What they have offered today is totally unresponsive to the crises facing our country. They are simply too weak, too self-interested, too full of infighting and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803386"> On the other hand, the Conservatives offer no solutions, only a discredited agenda of cuts to the services people rely on, and tax breaks for their friends and the ultrawealthy. They are happy to reinforce disingenuous and insulting characterizations of our country from foreign leaders like Donald Trump, while ignoring the real needs and challenges faced by Canadians. The Conservative approach undermines our values and fails to provide the support and investment required to build a fairer, more prosperous society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803387"> When he was senator, Joe Biden famously said, “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what you value.” Liberal and Conservative values are very clear to Canadians who have been paying attention to the federal government for the last 25 years. They continually, consistently prioritize the interests of the wealthy and corporate sector over the interests of working and middle-class Canadians. New Democrats say that is wrong, and there is a better way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803388"> For our part, New Democrats are proposing a robust set of policies designed to tackle these challenges head-on. Let us review some of the key NDP proposals that ought to have been included in the fall economic statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803389">With millions of Canadians struggling to make ends meet, the NDP pledged to permanently remove the GST from daily essentials and monthly bills, such as all grocery store items; Internet, home phone and cellphone bills; home heating; and diapers and children's clothing. We believe that Canadians deserve a tax cut that will bring immediate and permanent relief.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803390"> The GST is a structurally regressive tax that puts a burden on many Canadian households, particularly those who do not receive any rebate. By making it permanent, the NDP knows that Canadians can count on a predictable reduction in costs of 5% on the bills they face every month and cannot avoid, with a measure that businesses can easily administer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803391">Unfortunately, last week, both the Conservatives and the Liberals voted no to the NDP's motion to permanently scrap the GST on daily essentials and monthly bills. Axe the tax indeed. It seems the only tax the Conservatives want to axe is when it is given to the corporate sector, but when there is a tax cut proposed by the NDP for working and middle-class Canadians, they vote no. That is a shame. This is a prime illustration of what Senator Biden, now President Biden, meant and of where Liberal and Conservative priorities really lie and where their values really are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803392">New Democrats believe that a youth climate corps would help address both the climate emergency and Canada's youth employment crisis by providing young people with the skills and job experience they need. The NDP's youth climate corps would provide participants with a decent wage and practical training while they engage in work across three critical areas: first, emergency response in the face of extreme weather events such as wildfires, flooding and heat domes; second, strengthening community and environmental resilience to climate change by enhancing natural ecosystems, improving local infrastructure and strengthening community supports in anticipation of climate disruptions; and third, building infrastructure that drives down greenhouse gas emissions. This measure will be of particular assistance in Canada's rural and remote areas, places that especially need our support and development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803393"> New Democrats believe that the federal government should accelerate and expand the Canada public transit fund to enhance public transportation infrastructure across the country. We also have proposed the establishment of a Crown corporation to enhance and make sure that people in rural and remote areas have regular intercity bus service between their communities and major urban centres, because they deserve public transportation as well. By investing in public transit, we can reduce traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions and provide Canadians with reliable and affordable transportation options.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803394"> After decades of neglect, the federal government must support the construction of non-market housing of all types, including community, non-profit and co-operative housing, at the scale and speed needed to meaningfully address the housing crisis. I am shocked to not see profound investment in this area in the fall economic statement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803395">New Democrats believe we should begin by doubling the percentage of Canada's non-market housing stock to meet the OECD average, which, shockingly, we fall significantly below. By increasing the availability of affordable housing, we can alleviate the burden on low- and middle-income families, reduce homelessness and ensure that all Canadians have access to safe and stable housing. By substantially increasing the amount of non-market housing stock, we can also reduce demand in the market supply, which will reduce market prices and make home ownership available to more Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803396">The federal government must also take immediate steps to end the financialization of housing, such as by ending the tax exemption for real estate investment trusts. This measure will help curb speculative investments in the housing market, ensuring that homes are treated as places to live, rather than commodities to make money from. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803397">It is trite to say that a healthy population is essential for economic success. The federal government must take strong action to protect our public health care system by enhancing patient care, reversing privatization and addressing the health human resources crisis. Federal funding transfers must be tied to the public delivery of health care services, and the Canada Health Act must be robustly enforced in the face of attacks from Conservative premiers who want to gut public services and privatize delivery, both of which will make health care more expensive and less available to all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803398"> The federal government should also fulfill its commitment to establish a dedicated mental health transfer and provide targeted funding to expand desperately needed mental health services across the country. Mental health is as vital as is physical health. It is also essential to expand access to public addictions treatment and other life-saving services, addressing the urgent needs of those affected by the toxic drug crisis and other substance-use disorders.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803399"> On the revenue side, New Democrats believe fair taxation is essential to providing revenue for the services Canadians depend on and to ensuring a sustainable fiscal framework. We note that the <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">former finance minister</Affiliation> blew through two of her three so-called financial guardrails, both last year and this year, and likely next year as well. This is because Liberals refuse to address fair taxation in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803400">A key component of this is an excess profits tax on large corporations that have abused their monopoly positions in the marketplace and taken advantage of Canadians. Since 2021, increased corporate profit margins have significantly contributed to high levels of inflation and growing income inequality across the country. Despite the normalization of supply chains and easing of shortages today, Canadian corporations have maintained stratospheric profit levels and sky-high prices on everything from food to energy and rent. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803401">To add insult to injury, inflated profits have not translated into increased investment in the Canadian economy. Instead, they have largely been used for share repurchases and dividends, without contributing to wage growth or productive investment. Despite large corporate tax cuts and other corporate-friendly policies, Canadian businesses have demonstrably failed to invest in the machinery, equipment, innovation and training that are so needed to set the basis for increased Canadian productivity. New Democrats believe it is time we tied all corporate incentivization programs to clear commitments to invest in the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803402">Advancing indigenous reconciliation is both a moral and economic imperative. According to a recent report from the Assembly of First Nations and Indigenous Services Canada, it will cost $349 billion to close the indigenous infrastructure gap by 2030. However, the report also found that closing that infrastructure gap could generate $635 billion in economic output over the next seven years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803403">Increased funding for education, health care, housing, infrastructure and clean water in indigenous communities, supporting indigenous land rights and self-governance and implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls' calls for justice will help us unlock the potential that exists in Canada's indigenous communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803404">Recent developments in the United States make it clear that Canada needs a comprehensive green industrial policy and a resilient trade strategy to secure our long-term economic prosperity and sustainability. This shift will not only help Canada meet its climate goals but also create high-quality jobs and stimulate economic growth. A renewed trade policy would protect Canadian industries from the volatility of international shock and external pressures, making Canada more self-reliant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803405">As the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted, Canada currently lacks the capacity to produce essential items during a time of crisis, such as masks, ventilators and vaccines, underscoring the need for greater self-sufficiency to critical sectors. The recent comments from the president-elect south of the border provided us with a historic opportunity to diversify our trade markets, including in Europe and Asia-Pacific, taking better advantage of CETA and trade agreements that include Asian tigers like Japan and South Korea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803406">They also should compel us to embark on a serious made-in-Canada policy, using government procurement measures and incentives geared to national self-sufficiency in key areas. If the United States can have a buy America program, so should Canada have a buy Canadian program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803407">The crises we face are daunting, but they are not insurmountable. With bold, progressive and forward-thinking policies, we can build a stronger, fairer economy that benefits all Canadians. New Democrats believe in a Canada where everyone can thrive, where science and compassion are at the heart of our policies and where we invest in our future to build an equitable, sustainable society. </ParaText>

We have always called for an effective price on pollution and supported effective policies, whether that is a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade system, regulation of industries or, frankly, incentivizing the production of renewable energy in this country. Our record, in terms of dealing seriously and responsibly with the climate crisis, is second to none. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803426">The NDP had an opportunity to help people who really needed it by continuing to support us on Bill <Document DbId="12261855" Type="4">C‑319</Document> to increase pensions. Instead, the New Democrats have continued to support this spendthrift government with measures that do not really help people. Our leader even said that, at some point, someone would get tired of this marriage. Clearly, the former <Affiliation DbId="278503" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation> started to find this marriage with the NDP a little too onerous, because of its demands. As a result, we are stuck and we cannot help people. For example, we could continue to talk about the bill to help seniors. It was a much cheaper measure. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278278" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> talked about it in his speech. The New Democrats like to brag about the dental care program when, just last Friday, people came to my office to complain about it.</ParaText>

Our <Affiliation DbId="278714" Type="2">leader</Affiliation> called for that very thing today. The New Democratic Party has 25 MPs in the House.

Again, as of today, three million Canadians have signed up for and are receiving dental care in this country because of the efforts of the NDP. Agreements with British Columbia, Manitoba and, I understand, almost every other province are well under way to ensure people can walk into a pharmacy and walk out with contraception and diabetes medications that they need. That is what the NDP did. We worked to obtain a billion dollars to help kids across this country get access to a nutritious school meal every day. That makes a difference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803431">After we withdrew from our confidence and supply agreement, the Bloc Québécois attempted to make a deal with the government, which failed. The Bloc Québécois has achieved nothing in this Parliament for anybody. I would stack the New Democrats' record of accomplishment and achievement in the House, in this Parliament, against anybody's. We have helped millions of Canadians in a practical and pragmatic way, including millions of people in Quebec.</ParaText>

It is clear that he and the NDP are serious when it comes to addressing the housing crisis. He talked about the need to double social housing across the country. He likely knows that one of the reasons the government has been unable to do so is that the CMHC has a definition of housing that is not actually being used in the various programs it operates. In fact, in today's fall economic statement, there are accelerated funds for a program of which only 3% delivers anything that helps those who are in core housing need.</ParaText>

This has developed over decades of successive Conservative and Liberal governments, beginning in the early 1990s when the Liberals and Conservatives cut CMHC's investments in social housing in this country. That was the start of the long slide. That is why Canada today is so far below the OECD's averages of the percentage of our housing that is social housing. We can blame CMHC, but to me, the buck stops with the government. The policies of the government are the ones that should be driving the CMHC.</ParaText>

It is what makes their ability to work and access schools and connect with community possible. When people do not have access to a secure, affordable, decent house, their rights as a citizen are seriously abridged. Only New Democrats are capable of making sure the CMHC—</ParaText>

She was a journalist and was based in Moscow and she did not write flattering puff pieces about Mr. Putin. She told the truth and, as a result, she risked her life and certainly did not earn any bonus points. Mr. Putin decided to name her specifically as someone not welcome in Russia. I have had that honour since that time. Since Russia invaded Ukraine and since Greens have stood up with the rest of this Parliament in defending Ukraine and in urging that we do everything we can to stop the brutality of the Russian invasion, I eventually got listed as one of those not welcome in Russia, but I am a johnny-come-lately to the honour.

              <ParaText id="8803457">The document has very little in it, despite its bulk, and there is almost nothing new. There is a pittance on housing and less than a pittance on climate.

There is a suggestion that the government is going to work with the insurance industry, there is an idea, to try to get flood insurance for Canadians in flood plains and to keep them out of “harm's way”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803460">While the fall economic statement in its substance was extremely disappointing, the way in which it was dropped on us, with the lack of accountability for fiscal promises made and broken, is a low ebb for the Government of Canada.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8803478"> Madam Speaker, I will start by saying that I want to recognize, as my friend from <Affiliation DbId="278722" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> did on the point of relevance, that I will be focusing my speech on the fall economic statement. This is as opposed to what we really should be doing if we were to follow the orders of the day exactly, which is focusing on the amendment. I recognize that it has been about three months of talking about this particular motion. In fact, I have shared a few times about how we have had a number of speakers on this. The number of Conservative speakers alone is 223 or so. I have spoken quite a bit to this motion already. To make it clear, Green supported the precedent to the motion back in June. That continues to be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803479">My second apology is that things have been so last minute and disjointed today. I would usually even send notes for such a speech to translators. My apologies to them; I have not actually done that tonight either. However, it is important to take every opportunity I can to speak out for the concerns and the priorities of folks in my community. This is an important moment to do so because, of course, as many in this place and across the country are, I am troubled by the events of today. More so, I am troubled by the statement we were provided just this afternoon: the fall economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803480">The reality is that folks in my community are in a time of crisis. Forty per cent of those living in poverty are folks with disabilities. This should not be the case in a country as wealthy as ours. I have spoken quite a bit about the number of people in my community who have been living unsheltered in recent years, at a time when rents have doubled. The number of people living unsheltered tripled from 2018 to 2021, from just over 300 to over a thousand. In the most recent point-and-count study, it nearly tripled again, to over 2,300.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803481">Meanwhile, we continue to be the only country in the G7 with emissions that have risen since 1990. We are in a closing window of opportunity to act on the climate crisis. It is because of the significant crises that folks in my community and across the country are facing that Greens proposed a number of constructive solutions, which could have been in the fall economic statement. I will go over a few of those now with the time I have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803482">First, we could start with fixing the Canada disability benefit and following through on the promise the government made to lift hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities out of poverty. This was another moment missed for the government to follow through on doing so. This is also a moment at which it could have addressed the housing crisis we are in. Greens have been calling for the government to get towards a plan to double social housing across the country. If it did so, we would go from the bottom to just the middle of the pack in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803483">One way we have proposed to do this is in a new motion I have put forward to require the CMHC to have two income-based definitions of affordable housing. This would ensure that, when it talks about such funds as the affordable housing fund, the money is actually going to build affordable housing. This housing would support people who are in core housing need. The proposal relies on research by housing experts, such as Dr. Carolyn Whitzman and others across the country. We have been calling on it to address the loopholes for large corporate landlords that are buying up housing in my community, raising rents and profiteering off the homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803484">With those funds, we could turn and address a gap in HST that was exempted for for-profit developers of rental housing to ensure that non-profit builders of affordable home ownership, such as Habitat for Humanity, are HST exempt. We can pay for it, as I mentioned, by taxing real estate investment trusts as we do other corporations, for example. These are the kinds of housing solutions we would put forward to be in the fall economic statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803485">We have also been calling for the government to get serious about funds to support harm reduction and other programs to support people who are using drugs, who are dying from poisoned drugs. I have not looked at numbers today in my community, but when I last checked, at least 72 people had died in Waterloo region from poisoned drugs. There is a federal funding mechanism called the substance use and addictions program. Greens had been calling for that program to be better funded so that communities such as Waterloo region would get their fair share of funding.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803486"> To date, we have received zero dollars in Waterloo region from this critical program to support organizations such as Sanguen and Community Healthcaring to provide supports that keep people alive because, while treatment is important, a person who is dead cannot get treatment. We need to provide a suite of supports that includes mental health, housing, treatment and harm reduction, along with safe supply. That is part of what Greens had been calling for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803487"> Greens had also been talking about revenue tools to fund solutions. One of those revenue tools is a windfall profit tax. While there is a lot of talk in this place about the carbon tax going up two cents a litre in 2022 and in the years since 2022, the profits of the oil and gas industry went from some 26¢ a litre to around 44¢ or so, which is an increase of 18¢ a litre, all of which went to their profits. It ended up being around $66 billion or so for the top five oil and gas companies operating in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803488">It is clear those companies are gouging Canadians while their emissions go up. They are responsible for the largest share of emissions while we are in a climate crisis. The government put in place a windfall profit tax and called it the Canada recovery dividend. It was applied on banks and life insurance companies in the midst of the pandemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803489"> As Greens, we have been saying, now do oil and gas. I put forward a motion to propose doing so. The PBO has costed it. With a windfall profit tax on profits above a billion, even just a 15% tax on profits above a billion, the government could generate $4.2 billion a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803490">Those are the funds that could be used to invest in public transit, for example. Rather than seeing local councils, such as that of the Region of Waterloo, talking about cutting public transit routes or increasing fares, the federal government could be showing up with the dollars to help them make sure that high school students, for example, could get lower or no fares. We could also see the federal government step up for the permanent public transit fund to be put in place sooner than 2026, after the next election, to provide not only infrastructure, but also maintenance, for example, money for mechanics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803491"> This is what we had called for. That windfall profit tax could be used for that, along with retrofit funding to help Canadians who want to look at installing retrofits in their homes. It would reduce their emissions and save them money. That program expired in February of this year. We had put forward for them to renew that program in a significant way, to look at $50,000 for Canadians who want to look at retrofitting their homes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803492">We had been calling for the government to invest in closing the infrastructure gap. At Six Nations of the Grand River, for example, it continues to be the case that 70% of those living on reserve do not have access to clean drinking water, and their infrastructure gap is around $1.6 billion. This was an opportunity to close that infrastructure gap.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803493">We have also been calling for more equity in federal arts funding because, in communities like mine and many others across the country, while the Canada Council for the Arts has lost about $140 million in funding since the pandemic, communities like mine have continued to be historically underfunded. We get about three dollars per person, whereas places like Montreal, Vancouver and Winnipeg average around $18 dollars or so a person. The Greens had been calling for this fall economic statement to provide a new mechanism to ensure funding is more equitable across the country and for those funds to be restored to previous levels.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803494"> What do we get instead, after all these calls had been made? Well, when it comes to home retrofits, rather than actually delivering funds, the government talks about interest-free loans. Apparently, all the money was gone, the tens of billions they are sending to carbon capture. It is so much that I cannot even keep track. Environmental Defence has been doing their best to do so. They know it is about $18 billion or so in fossil fuel subsidies. It is certainly not always the case that they get loans, but when it comes to Canadians who want to retrofit their homes, I guess loans are going to have to continue to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803495"> On housing, the government is talking about accelerating more funds into the apartment construction loan program. This is a program for which only 3% of the funds are actually going to those in core housing need. Again, if the government does not actually address the underlying definitions of these funds, accelerating more dollars to them is not going to help address the housing crisis in a substantial way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803496"> When it comes to the Canada disability benefit, rather than actually addressing the core issue, the government is talking about ensuring that it is tax-free. For many, the assumption was that would always be the case.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8803497"> What we need is to see the government recognize that, for so many across the country, like folks in my community, the promise of what Canada could be is being lost. The Liberals need to step up to restore hope so that we can get back to that sense of what is possible for young Canadians and others across the country.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8803499">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak again on a very important topic: carbon tax and the policies that affect agriculture. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803500">The carbon tax is a huge one. The capital gains tax was supposedly for some kind of elite businesses, but it really does affect businesses such as family farms. The capital gains tax is another one that is a very significant challenge. It goes along with the GST tax break, which the Liberals found is not getting them any bump because it is not one that works either. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803501">However, there is some information on the carbon tax. The average 5,000-acre farm in Canada is paying about $150,000 every single year in carbon taxes. For an irrigation company, that multiplies at least to another $100,000. I know that my colleague will suggest other forms of energy, but natural gas and propane, and natural gas in particular, create power, and this is what is used in our part of the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803502">For greenhouses, and I have significant ones in my riding for tomatoes, green peppers, lettuce and strawberries, they are facing huge costs, at $22 million a year in carbon taxes. By 2030, it will be $82 million to $100 million, which is a huge cost on greenhouse produce in our country. We have 44% of fresh fruit and vegetable growers already telling us that they are selling at a loss, and their statements show it. We have 77% who cannot cover their production costs, and we have 77% of produce growers in Canada close to going under. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803503">Alberta farmers paid $17 million in carbon tax last year just on natural gas and propane to dry their grain and to heat and cool their barns. Bill <Document DbId="11538831" Type="4">C-234</Document> would have eliminated the carbon tax on natural gas and propane, saving farmers that billion a year, but the senators gutted that bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803504">However, we have ways that we can work on this. Some people do not get that we have institutions. This is from the president of the University of Alberta. He said:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803508">However, there are some other costs that are really interesting. At the ag committee recently, CN Rail representatives were there and they were asked about the carbon tax. For Saskatchewan, CN said that the carbon tax bill was $36 million just for transporting produce out of Saskatchewan, and then we can multiply that by Alberta and Manitoba. They were asked whether CN pays the carbon tax, and they said, of course not; we just download it to the farmers. This is the problem, which is that the carbon tax will be downloaded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803509">These are not rebate operations. There is no rebate for these large farm operations. They are the ones who do a great job of producing great food, food security produced in Canada, but they are being taxed severely. This is the challenge with the carbon tax, and it needs to be stopped. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803510">Madam Speaker, it is nice to be here in adjournment debate with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278414" Type="2">Bow River</Affiliation>. Unfortunately, once again tonight, my colleague over there is spreading misinformation about carbon pricing to discredit the system, and that is misleading Canadians. Just recently, the Agriculture Producers Association of Saskatchewan estimated that a large, 5,000-acre farm spends around $10,000 a year on carbon pricing, but the member just said it is $150,000. APAS goes on to suggest that these costs can be mitigated with changes to some of the fuels used. As APAS knows, the vast majority, about 90% of on-farm fuels, are exempt from carbon pricing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803511">I come from a family of apple farmers. Obviously, there is no grain drying involved in apple farming, but I am a member of Parliament for a semi-rural riding. There are poultry farms, two mushroom farms, very large egg operations, beef farms and cattle, equine facilities and a huge horse community. Actually, just 25 years ago, Milton had more horses than humans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803512">The raw data the member shared is in stark contrast to what the Agriculture Producers Association of Saskatchewan said. In fact, the number that he used was more than 15 times greater than these farmers stated the costs were. Those farmers also very clearly said that every farmer's goal, no matter their political stripe or commodity, is to leave the land we all have in a better condition for the next generation. They also added that they are not anti-carbon tax by any means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803513">We have a collective responsibility and obligation to ensure that food is affordable in Canada, and every time Conservatives stand up in the House and blame carbon pricing for elevated food costs, they are straight-up lying to Canadians. The evidence is very clear. Time after time, we see the facts come out that if we were to eliminate carbon pricing entirely in Canada, we would see less money in the pockets of lower- and middle-income Canadians, and we might see a grocery cart valued at $100 come down in cost by 50 cents. It is not the cause of the affordability crisis that Canadians are experiencing. In fact, the number one cause that scientists, economists and farmers have collectively identified as the cause for elevated food prices is climate change itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803514">The impacts of climate change and extreme weather through floods, wildfires, drought and all of the challenges we are facing as we continue to burn more and more fossil fuels and emit more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere are causing extreme weather. The hottest year on record is 2024. The record it broke was from 2023. The record 2023 broke was from 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803515">Wheat yields in Canada went down last year and the number one cause was climate change, not carbon pricing. The member makes it very clear that he is proud of our energy sector; he wears his “I love Canadian oil and gas” tie in the House on a frequent basis. We ought to be proud of our energy sector and support it and the workers within it. It has enhanced the wealth of our country, and that is a very important thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803516">At the same time, we need to make sure that our oil and gas sector and our energy workers are innovating and providing solutions to lower their emissions so that we are not contributing to climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803517">I would ask once again that the member opposite cut with the misinformation. The number one cause of food inflation in the world is climate change, not carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is one of the best solutions for it.</ParaText>

I tell her we have lively debates into the wee hours sometimes, but I do genuinely appreciate the opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803520">I also appreciate the opportunity to say merry Christmas to my friend and to everybody in Calgary and around the Bow River area, of course. I would also like to wish everybody in Canada a merry Christmas at this time. I know that times can be tough, but we have solutions in Canada, and the member from Bow River and I can agree to disagree, but we are still friends. As we gather around tables and have meals and celebrate together, let us put our differences aside, enjoy one another's company and realize that we are better together than we are apart.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803521"> Madam Speaker, for 54 days the then minister of public safety and current <Affiliation DbId="300003" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> slow-walked a CSIS warrant. The subject of the warrant was none other than a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister and top organizer and fundraiser for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in the GTA. This same former Liberal cabinet minister has also been someone long suspected of being involved in Beijing's interference activities on Canadian soil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803522">At the public inquiry, national security officials testified that warrants of this kind are typically signed off by the minister in four to 10 days. Consistent with that, during the same time as this warrant, the minister signed off on two other warrants within four to eight days, but when it came to a warrant involving a former Liberal cabinet minister, top organizer and fundraiser for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, it took 54 long days. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803523">We know, based on the evidence at the inquiry, that this was no accident. It is not as though the warrant application fell through the cracks on the minister's desk, which in and of itself would raise serious questions about the minister's competence. What happened was much more serious. There was a concerted effort within the government to slow-walk the warrant for a Liberal kingpin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803524">Here are the facts. The minister's chief of staff was given notice by CSIS that it intended to bring forward the warrant application in respect to the former Ontario Liberal minister. Two weeks after the warrant sat on the minister's desk, CSIS followed up with the minister's chief of staff. The warrant continued to languish on the minister's desk for 30 more days. Indeed, not until the director of CSIS personally intervened did the minister finally sign off on the warrant. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803525">The question is why. What took so long? When I raised this question in the House during question period, I received a non-answer from the minister. The minister and his chief of staff testified at the public inquiry, where they provided no credible explanation for the delay. Canadians deserve answers about why it took 54 days, during which national security may have been compromised, so I put it to the government: What is the explanation?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803526"> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak about the important issue of combatting foreign interference in our democratic institutions. It is a little ironic for my colleague to talk about political interests in matters of national security when his <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> still will not get his security clearance to learn more about foreign interference taking place in his party. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803527">Since coming to office, our government has taken a range of measures to address the threats of foreign interference, such as amending the Canada Elections Act in 2018; creating both the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency and the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians; standing up a range of initiatives to strengthen our electoral system against cyber and other threats through the plan to protect Canada's democracy in advance of the 2019 election; and building upon and further strengthening that plan in the advance of the 2021 election. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8803528">Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document> would ensure key protections against foreign interference are not limited to the election period; ban intentionally false and misleading statements about election activities or the voting process to disrupt an election or its results; prohibit contributions through money orders, prepaid gift cards or cryptoassets, the source of which can be difficult to trace; and introduce new third party contribution rules to increase transparency and mitigate the so-called dark or foreign funds from entering the system. If passed, these amendments would continue the cycle of continuous improvements to Canada's electoral process. Members will have a chance to study the amendments proposed in Bill <Document DbId="12954447" Type="3">C-65</Document> and we look forward to the discussions that will follow. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8803530"> I simply asked for an explanation. Why did it happen? Is it not because it was about protecting a Liberal kingpin?
