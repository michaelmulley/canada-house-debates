          <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Motion</ProceduralText>
          <Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Gourde" id="13007625">
            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="278177" Type="2">Mr. Jacques Gourde (Lévis—Lotbinière, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8722568">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to continue this debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722569">The reason I went into politics was, of course, the desire to make the world a better place but, above all, I wanted to bring to an end to the previous Liberal government, which deceived Canadians with the sponsorship scandal. Everyone back home was outraged.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722570">After that, Canada picked itself up, tightened its belt and balanced the budget. However, today, in the devastating aftermath of a Liberal government, the situation is once again critical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722571">By trying to play nice, the Bloc Québécois made us miss the chance to have an election this fall, when the NDP finally had the courage of its convictions and tore up the agreement that had served it well and kept this illegitimate government in office to the detriment of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722572">Just when we thought we had seen it all, here we are, holding the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s nose to the grindstone to get to the bottom of what happened with the green slush fund. This government will do anything to get around the rules of ethics. It even found a way to use the environment to fool Canadians. That is proof that nothing will ever stop this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722573">As usual, when caught with their hands in the cookie jar, this government and its Prime Minister give us as little information as possible. What bothers me the most is that they never suffer any consequences. Canadians are the ones paying the price, with their hard-earned money and at the expense of their safety and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722574">Despite everything, I am convinced that with hope and action, we can recover from the disaster the Liberals have left behind after nine years in power. Young people are our greatest hope. I am confident that young people have learned something from all the Liberal dirty dealings and that they will vote to bring home common sense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722575">Speaking of young people, I was pleased to learn this week that my riding, Lévis—Lotbinière, has the lowest child poverty rate in the country. We ranked first in Canada, according to the Campaign 2000 report, with a child poverty rate of 5.1%. That is something to be proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722576">Our young people have good values and the courage of their convictions, and our next Conservative government is going to make sure that their trust is never broken. Under our <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>, Canadians can rest assured that the days of cronyism and back-scratching in return for cheques, special treatment or undeserved positions are over. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722577">The pendulum is swinging back for the benefit of the people of Lévis—Lotbinière, Canadians, and the future of my seven grandchildren. That makes me very happy. We always believed it would happen, and here we are, on the threshold of a future government with integrity, a government that values transparency and is not about to hide things from Canadians. As an eternal optimist, I believe that the green fund scandal will give undecided voters the push they need to make the only obvious choice. At long last, we are going to elect a Conservative government that has the interests of Canadians at heart. Canadians can rest assured that no one in our government is going to pull a fast one on them. A Conservative government is not going to talk of division. Instead, it is going to work to bring Canadians closer together again, one day at a time, because the challenge will be difficult. We will have to clean up the disastrous Liberal mess, build housing, make our streets safer, and get the machinery of government working the way it should again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722578">Again, I invite my colleagues across the way to hand over the unredacted documents to the police. It is very simple. It is not complicated. It is an order of the House. This is not about referring the matter to committee, but about submitting the documents to the House; nothing could be simpler. It is called transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722579">I sincerely hope that I will never have to address this topic in the House again and that the Liberals will see the light and obey the Speaker's order, as they should have done a long time ago. It is absolutely mind-boggling to see how indifferent the Liberals are about the shenanigans at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Despite the long hours of debate, the government keeps ignoring the legitimate concerns of the House and is just brushing off the substance of the scandal. The police should have everything they need to get to the bottom of things. For the police to have both hands on the wheel, they need to have the unredacted documents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722580">Canadians' trust is at stake because this scandal involves the mismanagement of the taxes Canadians have paid. When their taxes are squandered and handed out to cronies, as was the case with the green fund, they feel less inclined to pay them. Only a Conservative government will manage public funds responsibly and be accountable for its spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722581">Some people today are afraid of a recession. Others argue that we are already there but that demographic growth is masking this reality. Unemployment is rising at a rate not seen since the 1970s, indicating that the economic situation is not as rosy as other numbers might suggest. While GDP is rising, GDP per capita has fallen over the past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722582">This phenomenon demonstrates the failures of the Liberal government's economic policies, as it struggles to provide services and a solid economy, despite all its uncontrolled spending at the expense of future generations. This is economic vandalism. To make a comparison, it is distressing to see that Canada's GDP growth rate has not kept pace with that of our neighbours to the south for the past nine years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722583">Along with the economic slump comes thinly veiled corruption. The indifference to their situation is causing young people across the country to turn their backs on the Liberals and the Bloc Québécois. These ideology-focused parties, with their lack of vision, are preventing young adults from envisaging a normal future ahead. The Liberals have turned this country into a testing lab for all kinds of experiments without giving a second thought to their potentially devastating effects. I am referring to the legalization of drugs, the carbon tax, the tax distortion resulting from the tax on capital gains, and out-of-control immigration. The list is long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722584">“Hard to the left”, say the Liberals, swept along by the NDP. However, by constantly turning in the same direction, they end up turning in circles. The carbon tax puts Canadian businesses at a disadvantage by penalizing hard-working entrepreneurs at every step of the production chain. Then it penalizes Canadian consumers, especially the ones struggling to make ends meet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722585">As if that were not enough, while the entire industry is at a disadvantage compared to our neighbours to the south. The Americans have been reaping the benefits of all the growth we have been losing since 2015. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada is the best job creation minister that an American president could hope for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722586">Canadian businesses are grappling with arbitrary discrimination, as evidenced by the green fund scandal. In other words, under the Liberals, everyone has been penalized except Liberal cronies, who are entitled to receive grants even if their companies do not meet the proper criteria. Liberal patronage is throwing money out the window. It is also a waste of money to fund programs like the housing accelerator fund, which has cost Canadians $4 billion without a single housing unit to show for it in a year and a half.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722587">In Halifax, housing starts dropped by 75%, compared to October 2023, whereas in Kelowna they dropped by 87%. The same thing is happening in Ottawa, Quebec City and Toronto, where housing starts dropped by 42%, 37% and 33% respectively. This is a far cry from the Conservatives' common-sense proposals to eliminate the GST on the construction of housing, which would stimulate the construction of 30,000 additional housing units per year in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722588">By combining this with other measures, we will encourage the creation of housing, not bureaucracy, like the Liberal programs do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722589">Today 70% of Canadians recognize that it has become impossible to be a homeowner. An entire generation is losing hope to achieve something that used to be the norm. Statistics show that 59% of Canadians and 75% of renters have to sacrifice essential needs such as food, clothing and education to be able to pay their rent or their mortgage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722590">More and more, Canadians are being forced to stretch their basic necessities budget so they can afford a roof over their heads when they go to sleep. While everything costs more and there is an unprecedented housing shortage, the Liberals manage to run record deficits. This is where we see that they are not short on money but on competence. The lack of seriousness of this government is so blatant we could not make it up. That is why Canadians are begging us to trigger an election as soon as possible. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8722591">However, the Liberals are still obstructing the work of the House by refusing to hand over the documents to the police. While the Liberal game of hide-and-seek continues, crime is skyrocketing across the country, particularly in the big cities, but also in the regions. I myself had the misfortune of learning that street gangs are preying on high school students in Lévis, in my riding. This situation has become all too common in Liberal Canada, where judicial laxness reigns and impunity is growing, compromising the health of our children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722592">The good news is that things were not always like this in Canada, and things will no longer be like this when the Conservatives are back on the other side of the House axing the tax, building the homes, fixing the budget and stopping the crime.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8722593">Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of sitting on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. My colleague seems to think that the police need the House to hand over certain documents. I wonder whether he is familiar with the term “search warrant”. I will read the definition for him so he understands. “A search warrant is a written order from a judge or justice of the peace. This order gives the police the right to search your home and take certain items that they find.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722594">The police do not need the House to hand over documents. The police will do their job. Let us let the police do their job. The commissioner wrote a letter to our committee on July 25, and the official opposition party is well aware of that. The Conservatives are misusing the House. They are filibustering so that we cannot introduce new legislation. That is what today is all about. This has nothing to do with SDTC.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8722597">Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech. I agree in part with many of his statements. I definitely agree that the Liberal Party is inherently corrupt, secretive and wasteful with public funds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722598">However, I would like him to explain some things about his party, since he can answer for his party's actions. He was a member here when one of his cabinet colleagues, Tony Clement, diverted $50 million in public funds in his own riding. That is some serious misconduct, and it was condemned by the Auditor General at the time. What is more, Tony Clement was not just any minister. He was the president of the Treasury Board, which is responsible for managing and overseeing the administration of all federal public spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722599">I would like my colleague to explain to me in concrete terms why Quebeckers should trust a Conservative Party that displayed no transparency and mismanaged public funds when it was in power.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8722600">Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to talk about Canada's economic action plan, which was created by the previous Conservative government following the 2008 economic crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722601"> We decided to invest in the work of Canadians and in projects that made a big difference for communities. Rather than giving money directly to Canadians, to avoid high unemployment, we gave money to initiatives intended to get Canadians working, which enabled our country to fare better than all the other G20 countries. Canada was number one. Just a few months after Canada's economic action plan was implemented, the Canadian dollar was at $1.10 relative to the U.S. dollar. We were doing better than our neighbours to the south. Now, we are lagging behind. We are last in both the G7 and the G20. The Canadian dollar is barely worth 70¢. That is the difference between investing to get Canadians working and giving people money to mitigate inflation.</ParaText>

We just heard the member's response explaining what the Conservative government did to deliver concrete results rather than smoke and mirrors. In his experience, since he has been in the House since 2006, making him the longest-serving Quebec Conservative MP in Canadian history—I hope he will correct me if I am off by a few days—can he tell us if he has ever seen a government refuse to obey an order of the House?</ParaText>

When we look at the details, we see that nearly $6 billion is being added to Canada's national debt. The surplus that the government promised in 2015 is nowhere to be seen.

Every day I come to this place eager to work and create solutions and programs that will help my constituents. That is what they expect from me. Each person in London—Fanshawe depends on me to be honest, to act with integrity to the best of my ability, to improve this country, to expand upon the social programs and services upon which they depend, to help them and to address the issues they are struggling with. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722624">Many of my constituents are worried about the cost of living, about feeding, clothing and housing their families, about their jobs, about their quality of life, about their health care and about their pensions. They worry about their families and friends down the street. Many worry about friends and families all around the world who want to come to Canada to share in the idea of what Canada is. Many of my constituents are terrified for their loved ones around the world, in Ukraine, in Sudan, in Gaza and in Lebanon. People in my area, in my community, are terrified. As a G7 country, they look to our government, expecting us to show leadership on the world stage to fight for a more just world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722625"> I have spoken in this place often about how proud I am of the supports that New Democrats have gotten for Londoners and Canadians. The provision of dental care is actively helping so many in London—Fanshawe. Seniors have told me that they are relieved, because after having spent years of living in pain, they have the ability to get their teeth fixed. Also, with pharmacare, the provision of free diabetes medications and devices and free contraceptives will save millions of people millions of dollars. I am proud that I can be part of those supports, and many other New Democrats have negotiated them with the government for the people. New Democrats did that. We used our time here not to promote ourselves but for others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722626"> I am frustrated beyond belief, because despite my being elected to help navigate these issues with my constituents, I am here today having to talk about the greed and corruption of the government. In the last month or so, I have been disappointed every day, because we keep coming back to a Conservative filibuster and a Liberal cover-up, and we continue to listen to Liberals and Conservatives compete over how bad they are. Every day in this place, Conservatives talk about how bad and how scandalous the Liberals are, and the Liberals in return talk about how bad and how scandalous the Conservatives are. Guess what. Both are terrible; they are both scandal-ridden. Here is a news flash: Each party, whether it is the Liberals or the Conservatives, has not used the power they have been given by their constituents for all of their constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722627">What so many members in this place do not seem to understand is that this place, Parliament, this access to power, is not about them. I am not here for them; I am here for the people who do not directly sit in this chamber and who do not represent billion-dollar interests or individuals who hoard the wealth and power of this nation for themselves. For the majority of their time in power since Confederation, these two parties have worked to undermine working people. They have worked to ensure that this system only benefits them and their closest friends, friends who already hold a great deal of power but are determined to never lose it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722628">Up until this point, I did not want to enter this debate, but after weeks of listening to Conservative after Conservative and the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, I could not take it anymore. We are debating this issue of integrity again, or lack thereof, and I have entered the fray.

The government was held in contempt for lying about the F-35 fighter jet program. The Conservative defence minister took a military Cormorant search and rescue helicopter for a joyride. Those helicopters are used for necessary rescue missions of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722637">Finally, the Conservative government refused to produce documents underpinning its so-called tough-on-crime legislation after a motion passed by a majority vote in Parliament, which is ironic. That is the same situation we are in today, in which the government did not respect the authority of Parliament, and that was because it knew what those documents would show, which was that Conservatives wanted to throw the book at youth or our fellow Canadians trapped in the cycle of poverty and petty crime while covering up for their white-collar crimes and corruption during their time in Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722638">Canadians finally got sick of watching Conservatives cut our community services to fill their pockets. They threw them to the curb and elected Liberals, but the Liberal government has been no better. When SNC-Lavalin was caught bribing the Libyan government, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tried interfering to save his powerful buddies. When Canadians were making sacrifices to make it through the COVID-19 pandemic, the Liberals tried ramming through their convoluted program to refuse students relief while lining the pockets of the PM's friends, the Kielburgers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722639">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> set up cash for access fundraisers in which the wealthiest and most powerful in Canada could pay the maximum amount legally allowed to have off-the-record face time with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister promised to be Canada's first environmentalist government and then bought a pipeline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722640">The Liberal government is once again accused of corruption, scandal and misspending. In this case, this time, it concerns the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund, which was established in 2001. It was afforded over $1 billion in 2021 to be delivered over a five-year period. Through an Auditor General report and a spot audit of this fund, 90 cases of conflicts of interest were identified, totalling about $80 million of taxpayers' money. The question was raised of whether the people who were making decisions to allocate those funds, who were all appointed by the Liberal government, were actually giving it to companies that they themselves controlled or that were connected to them in some way. This would seem to be a significant conflict of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722641">According to the Auditor General, the projects that were approved and did receive millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds overstated the environmental benefits that actually came to pass. In fact, over the past six years, SDTC approved over 225 projects, worth about $836 million. Although the Auditor General did only a spot audit on a sampling of this, she found consistent, pervasive and repeated conflicts of interest, misspending and wasteful spending. The Auditor General put the blame squarely on the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for this fund and said there was a lack of oversight. I am shocked that a fund worth almost a billion dollars was running with such a significant lack of oversight by the Liberal minister, who was supposed to make sure that those funds were spent in accordance with the authorization of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722642">The Ethics Commissioner is now investigating the former chair of SDTC, who approved two grants greater than $200,000 to a private firm that she herself directed. She did not recuse herself. She participated in the decision of SDTC to approve the grant. That case is being investigated as we speak. This is important. I agree with all my NDP colleagues and all parliamentarians that this is horrible and that we have to condemn this kind of wasteful spending and scandalous corruption. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722643">The official opposition has put forward a motion demanding documents from the government so we can get to the bottom of it, as is Parliament's right. The New Democrats joined with the official opposition, supported that request and demanded production of documents to the House so that Parliament can exercise its constitutional duty to scrutinize spending of government and hold it accountable. The Liberals, at first, did not want to deliver those documents, but the will of Parliament is supreme. Certainly, New Democrats demand that transparency and accountability occur. The government was prepared to produce the documents to the House, but it wanted to redact them to some degree.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8722644"> Sometimes, the redaction of documents is legitimate, such as for national security reasons or to protect sensitive information. However, in this case, it is hard to know the reasoning for the redactions without further context. I worry that the government sometimes wants to redact information that it should not, but Parliament has yet to receive the documents, redacted or not. The official opposition members then decided they wanted all the unredacted documents to go to the RCMP. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722645">This is where it gets a little confusing. The government has refused to do that, saying that although Parliament has the right to these documents, it is unprecedented to demand the production of documents to a third party. There is also an issue of whether the police forces, in this case the RCMP, might have its investigation compromised by having documents produced to it in that way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722646">I believe I am a reasonable person, although others might disagree. A reasonable person who has their constituents' best interests at heart and who respects Parliament and our democratic institutions would say it is fair enough that there is some doubt about referring these documents to a third party. In that case, let us have the documents come before Parliament, as is its right, to ensure that the Speaker's ruling is followed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722647">After six weeks, here we are still in a filibuster. Instead of responsibly doing what the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> directed and sending these documents to the procedure and House affairs committee, of which I am a member, so we can do our job and investigate this motion, we are instead sitting through a Conservative filibuster and a Liberal cover-up again. On top of everything else that most Canadians would shake their heads about, this filibuster is costing taxpayers millions of dollars. We are not doing the work we were sent here to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722648">In London—Fanshawe last week, people were forcibly evicted from their homes because a greedy corporate landlord renovicted them. People were torn from their homes and from their community. We are not talking about that. </ParaText>

They told me how difficult it is because they are not making a livable wage. Even though they love the work they do and the people they serve, they cannot make ends meet. They are worried that the federal and provincial governments do not value them or their clients. We are not debating that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722651">These are the issues of the people in my riding; they need to be debated in this place and need to be solved. They sent me here to deal with them. They want to know how we can make sure everyone has a secure, affordable and decent place to live. They want to be able to feed their families and build vibrant communities. People are struggling, and what are we doing? We are being filibustered about scandals and greed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722652">I will say it again: Both the Liberals and the Conservatives are terrible. Both have terrible records and terrible histories. Both have worked to ensure only that the rich and powerful are made more rich and powerful. Both are mired in histories of scandal, greed, lack of accountability and lack of transparency. They stand in the House and proclaim they are here to defend Canadians; the reality is that they are here because they are desperate either to hold on to power or regain the power they have lost. What they do not understand is that it is not their power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722653">The Conservatives stand in this place every day and call for an election, and they do it because they simply want that power back. They have a shiny new <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>; this time, unlike in 2019 and 2021, they think they can actually win. They have spent a lot of money on advertising. They have rebranded their leader and given him a makeover. They have spent millions of dollars marketing their slogans and catchphrases, selling a leader and a party that will do the same thing Conservatives did last time they were in government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8722666">Yesterday, the NDP and the government announced measures that will cost $6 billion. The government is going to send a cheque for $250 to people who earn up to $150,000 a year, which seems completely unhinged to me. Combined with the GST measure, all this is going to cost $6 billion. The Bloc Québécois asked the government to increase old age security for seniors aged 65 to 74, which would have cost $3 billion. Now the government is throwing $6 billion around.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8722668">Mr. Speaker, it is a fallacy that there is not enough money for the things that people need. There is enough money for seniors. There is enough money to build social housing. There is enough money to ensure that we are expanding and strengthening our health care system. There is enough money to provide people with the dental care and pharmacare that they need. That money exists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722669">However, money, as I said in my speech, is being hoarded by a very small group of people. It used to be that government would insist that that money was to be redistributed and that that power was to be redistributed. The government does not do that now. It used to be that people would demand that. New Democrats demand that. New Democrats see it as a solution to this, but the government has not taken up our ideas entirely. One of these ideas is to cut the GST to provide moderate support to help people, which would be a support for my constituents and people across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722670">What we want to do is to ensure that we raise an excess profit tax to cover those expenditures. That is how we would find balance.

It has certainly not been brought forward by the Conservatives since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722674">We are missing 30 years of a federal government building affordable housing. The Ontario government has not done it either. We need to focus on building more co-operatives and building more affordable housing at all stages, whether it is rent geared to income, social housing or whatever. We also need to eliminate the REITs. We need to ensure that the greedy corporations that are buying up all of those affordable housing units cannot do it anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722675"> In London, we are making some strides on that, a bit, at the municipal level, but neither the federal government nor the provincial government has taken any sort of leadership in that regard. I have stood many times, desperate to put forward real solutions for funds that could be created to give to not-for-profit organizations to buy up those affordable units to keep them affordable.

              <ParaText id="8722680">We just heard from an hon. colleague from the NDP, which has been propping up the Liberals. Its members talk a big game that they are going to force that evidence over to the RCMP. We will see if they stay true to their word, because we have seen it, time and again, when the NDP gets in a pickle. Do members know what its number one priority is? It is not Canadians; it is the <Affiliation DbId="291215" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>'s pension. We know we are not going to have an election until after February of next year if the NDP and the Liberals get their way. A part of that is to shut down debate and motions, such as the one we are debating today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722681">Let us recount what happened. There was a tech fund set up, the green slush fund, that functioned, before the Liberals arrived on the scene, quite properly. We had an independent board that did not have conflicts of interest. We had professional bureaucrats who administered the fund. We need to be thankful for those professional staff because it was through them that we found out how greasy the Liberals have become. We found out from whistle-blowers how badly this fund was mismanaged for the benefit of board members and the chair. We learned that over almost $400 million was doled out improperly in 186 examples of conflicts of interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722682">I am old enough to remember when a $16 glass of orange juice, which was mistakenly expensed, was the headline news, from cover to cover, for weeks on end. If we fast-forward to today, it is not a $16 glass of orange juice we are debating, but $400 million of Canadian tax dollars that went to Liberal insiders, and projects that did not even qualify for the green slush fund got that money. If Canadians are upset, they should be, because the Liberals have been robbing them blind and are doing this now with the help of the NDP. </ParaText>

We heard these big enunciations that he had ripped up the agreement. Just in the last 24 hours, we heard how the New Democrats are going to side with the Liberals just a little, only temporarily. That is the problem. There is no temporary divorce within the Liberal-NDP coalition. It has always been there. It is always there. It wants big government, a big taxing government, that spends money on everything and does not worry about who is picking up the tab. </ParaText>

More and more Canadians are finding out about this. They think it is a travesty.

For anything that moves in Canada, they want to make sure it is taxed. If it is still moving, they make sure they are regulating it. If it is not dead, well, there is MAID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722694">This is a little bit of what we are facing here in Ottawa. The Liberals are hell-bent on enriching their friends. That is what we are here debating, the green slush fund. We know that the chairwoman of that fund gave money to the company she owned. It is not just the Liberal insiders; the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment</Affiliation> gave Cycle Capital, his company, millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722695">How are Canadians accepting this? Really they are not. That is why we are here today, for the countless people who have written in and emailed me, encouraging me to find the answers about where their money went. It is Canadians' money; it is their $400 million. Canadians are waiting in line at food banks right now to get food to provide for their families. Where could that meal have come from? It could have come from some of the $400 million that went to Liberal insiders. It had nothing to do with the program parameters that were set up. Real, Canadian tax dollars were being wasted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722696">Meanwhile, one in four Canadians is foregoing meals because of the cost of living crisis caused by the Liberals. The Liberals have spent money in ways that the green slush fund was not meant to, which is to enrich their friends and Liberals themselves, people from the governing party, which is wrong. That is why, in the second half of my speech, after question period, I am going to go through some of what the whistle-blowers have reported to us that transpired in this fund.

They have asked the government to find ways to make it easier for them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722705">That is why I am so excited that relief is on the way. We are going to be providing a holiday from GST and HST for two months during the holiday season on the most essential things, like groceries, children's clothing and toys, restaurant meals, beer and wine. All these things are important for us to enjoy our lives and to be able to enjoy the holiday season.</ParaText>

Financial abuse occurs in 99% of all domestic violence cases in which the abuser controls the finances, causing many victims to feel trapped and unable to leave the abuser due to lack of resources. The serious impacts of economic abuse can follow survivors long after they leave a relationship, affecting not only the survivor's mental health and well-being but also that of their children.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8722755">My constituents are clear. They want a carbon tax election. They can choose between the costly NDP-Liberal coalition that taxes their food and doubles their housing costs or the common-sense Conservatives who will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. We will take the GST off new homes, saving Canadians up to $50,000 and building 30,000 more homes every year. </ParaText>

While the organization has been finally listed as the terrorist group that it is, the job is not finished. The petition specifically notes that under paragraph 83.05(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, it is illegal to knowingly act on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with a listed terrorist group. On October 15, the United States also designated Khaled Barakat a leadership member of the PFLP, a listed terrorist group, but the federal government continues to allow Khaled Barakat to remain in Canada. It is time for the federal government to finish the job and kick out of Canada the terrorist leader and all who support terrorism.</ParaText>

Mr. Murphy, appointed by the Governor in Council, is subject to post-directorship obligations as part of the Conflict of Interest Act, as well as WDBA policy. The Conflict of Interest Act prohibits Mr. Murphy from acting for or on behalf of any person or organization in connection with any specific proceeding, transaction, negotiation or case to which the WDBA is a party and with respect to which the director had acted for, or provided advice to, the WDBA; and providing advice to clients, business associates or employers using information that was acquired in the course of his official duties and that is not available to the public. The process set forth in the Conflict of Interest Act would apply should Mr. Murphy contravene the act, which may include an examination by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8722962">Mr. Speaker, “call in the cops”. That is the stage we are at in this most recent Liberal scandal. Why are we here? There is evidence that the Liberals have on the SDTC green slush fund. They are refusing an order from Parliament. There is no higher power than the 338 men and women who get sent here to represent the 40 million Canadians. With how our Constitution is written, there is no higher power than the majority will of this space. This space has voted that the Liberals have to turn over the evidence to the RCMP. They are refusing. That is why we are here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722963"> If anyone is tuning in for the first time and wondering what this SDTC is all about, it is about Liberal insiders getting rich. We are now at the point where they are getting caught, because the evidence is out there. We know that there is a stink around this fund. We know that the chairperson of the fund was caught funnelling money to her own company. We know that the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> has funnelled money to the company that he owns as well, which stinks, but it does not shock anybody.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722964">Anyone who has been watching this place knows that, in the end, the Liberals got caught funnelling money to Liberal insiders. When the Liberals got elected, they got rid of the board and appointed members they support, or, more importantly, members who support the Liberals. Then the money flowed. We are talking hundreds of millions of dollars. On the scale of all the scandals that the Liberals have been involved in, the $40-million sponsorship scandal, all the other scandals that the government has been known for, this one takes the cake because of the whistle-blowers. This is where, I think, the Liberals are the most concerned about evidence going to the RCMP. We know some of the evidence that has been released, which has been pretty bad. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722965">For the people who are tuning in, we know how corrupt the Liberals are. Some of the people they put in place, obviously, are put there to influence and to enrich fellow Liberals. We then have the bureaucrats out here who are trying their best to minister to the will of the government. It does not matter who is in government. Their job is to minister to the will of whoever is in government or whatever majority decisions come out of here from members. These people have been around. They have been around scandals before. They have been around the town. They have been around Liberals before. It should not shock us but we would not believe what some of these whistle-blowers have been saying about these Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722966">We have one whistle-blower who said, “Just as I was always confident that the Auditor General would confirm the financial mismanagement at SDTC, I remain equally confident that the RCMP will substantiate the criminal activities that occurred within the organization.” When we have whistle-blowers making a statement that the RCMP will find acts of criminal misbehaviour, it is telling. This whistle-blower also said that “if you bring in the RCMP and they do their investigation...they [will] find something”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722967">That is it. That is what the Liberals have shut this place down over. They cannot hand over any more evidence to the RCMP. That set off alarm bells throughout the Liberal government and party. They were concerned about which of their relatives got rich in this scandal or which minister, while sitting at the cabinet table making decisions on where to spend Canadian taxpayers' dollars, decided to spend it on his own company. How criminally, morally and ethically bankrupt are these Liberals?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8722968"> Let us hear another quote from people who work closely with the Liberals:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722969">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think the Auditor General's investigation was more of a cursory review. I don't think the goal and mandate of the Auditor General's office is to actually look into criminality, so I'm not surprised by the fact that they haven't found anything criminal. They're not looking at intent. If their investigation was focused on intent, of course they would find the criminality.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722970"> We have long-serving servants of government of all stripes in Canada ringing alarm bells on what happened here. This is a pattern where Liberals get themselves into a pickle; they find a solution for their troubles, not for what troubles Canadians; and they utilize their power of position to sweep it under the rug. We have seen this before on foreign influence. We have seen this on other scandals. We are bringing this up because the scandal is $400 million, but it is just the latest of the new scandals. I think of some of the times we have caught these Liberals in questionable activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722971"> I think of the Liberal WE scandal, where they gave half a billion dollars to a children's charity that turned around and gave half a million dollars to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s mom. This is at the top. This is where Liberals get their lessons on morals and ethics. It is from the Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who has been caught breaking the law on conflicts of interest. We all know of his famous trip down to the islands to party it up on the taxpayers' dime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722972"> The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a man who spends his whole day preaching to Canadians on how we have to change our lives for our carbon emissions and we have to change our footprint. Meanwhile, he jet-sets all over the world, exposing his hypocrisy on the emissions of his plane out the rear end of it. It is so hypocritical of him to lecture regular-day Canadians: “How dare you turn the heat up in the middle of winter? How dare you even think you need to feed your family before you pay your carbon tax?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722973">This is the ridiculousness of what has transpired in Canada over the last nine years. We are a farce of the country that we used to be. There are real problems in our country and our society. I go back to the motion at hand: all this criminality and theft from SDTC. I go back to the purpose of this fund. It was to help with projects around Canada that would bring more sustainable, environmental and technological solutions. I have met with dozens of organizations and projects that would qualify for this, fabulous projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722974"> I am just going to update the House on a couple of them. Their response from the green slush fund was, “No, you cannot have support for your initiative.” I think of the Calgary Co-op and Leaf. The company Leaf brought to market a consumer bag that has no plastic. It is decomposable just in one's garden. The company brought it to Ottawa. The bureaucrats said, “We cannot have this. It looks wrong. It does not look right for what we are trying to do.” It is not the science, but looks. It is always about looks with these guys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722975">What did that corporation do? It thought, “Why do we not bring a consumer bag to the market that is biodegradable, that people can use however many times they want, but when it gets wet and thrown in the compost bag, it decomposes?” That is a way that we think we should be tackling some of our challenges in the environment. It is through technology, not taxes. Now, we had a technology fund, SDTC, that should have been funding just that. It should have been funding technology so we got those answers, and instead, it was funding Liberal insiders, who were getting rich. This is what happened in Canada over the last nine years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8722976"> I know my time is almost up. I believe I have five more minutes. That is fabulous because we have some more scandals to go over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722977"> Another one was the arrive scam. Why this is important is that these are real taxpayers dollars. Think of the people waiting at a food bank, maybe right now. Maybe right now they do not have the means to provide for their families. We know there are lots out there. Over two million Canadians are relying on a food bank because the Liberals have made the cost of living so expensive in Canada. It did not have to be this way. There are tens of millions, if not billions, of dollars of waste in Ottawa that could be refocused into helping Canadians get through this terrible time we are suffering as a country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722978">One classic scandal had to do with the $54 million wasted on the arrive scam. That was an app that could have been built in a weekend with under $50,000. That is what the private sector would have done. Do colleagues know what these Liberals did? They had to make sure their Liberal insiders got paid. In that scandal, numerous tech companies did zero work but billed for tens of millions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722979">That was just the tip of the iceberg of things we have kind of wasted money on. This goes right to the ministers of the Crown. It has been highlighted how the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> secretly funnelled money into his company. We have the <Affiliation DbId="300023" Type="4">international trade minister</Affiliation>, who gave over a $16,000 contract, sole-sourced, to a friend, just a friend. “You know what, we will just make that $16,000 payment go to whomever we would like.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722980">Nickels and dimes make dollars. It all adds up. We talked about $10 million here, $54 million for ArriveCAN and $400 million for the green slush fund. The waste goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722981"> At committee, we have been studying some of the waste in post-secondary education. We have some silly studies we have funded as Canadian taxpayers. If someone is struggling right now in Canada, they should know their tax dollars went to UBC to study gender politics and Peruvian rock music. That was $20,000. If someone is one of the working poor, barely getting by and wondering why they have to pay all this federal income tax, it is because someone has to study gender politics and Peruvian rock music. Another study is “Reframing Gender and Race in Music Theory and Its Pedagogy”. It is unbelievable that we are spending this kind of money out there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722982">There is a new study entitled “Suitably Dressed: Finding Social Justice through Distinctions in Modest Fashion for Men, Women and Transgender People”; that is $35,000. If someone is struggling today and wanting to know what is their government is doing, this is some of the stuff it is spending money on. Another one is about large-scale archaeological video analysis, out of the U of C, for $280,000. Here is another one, kind of timely: “Narco-Animalia: Human-Animal Relations in Mexico's Narco-Culture”. That was $9,266.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8722983">I see my time has wrapped up. I thank everyone for paying attention and look forward to questions and comments.</ParaText>

Guess what; they are. They are massively overblowing their targets. The temporary two-month tax trick is going to cost billions of dollars, which is going to drive up inflationary pressures on Canadians when they can least afford it. Bah, humbug.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723014">Mr. Speaker, we are debating an issue that goes to the core of our country and our democracy, which are built on the foundational pillars of transparency and accountability. I have been listening to this debate, and the Liberal responses have often been to deflect or to attack the messenger. We only go personal when we cannot defend something based on its merits, when we cannot defend the indefensible. Unfortunately, this seems to apply to multiple issues raised with the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723015">Recently, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a question related to Chinese foreign interference. Again, we heard a personal attack. Instead of focusing on the very important matter of foreign interference, he attacked me, and it was so blatantly and sadly transparent. In the latest example, we heard yet another pathetic personal attack from the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> during question period earlier today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723016">I do not care about what he called me because I have been called worse by better, but I do take offence to the personal attacks that he has levied against my staff. My Toronto constituency office is proud to serve not only my constituents but also other Torontonians who have been failed by the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation>'s Toronto Liberal colleagues. I could not be more proud of my team for stepping up where the government has failed. All four of my team members in Toronto are former immigrants, and one is a former refugee. Unlike the immigration minister, we actually care about immigrants, who are the people who choose to make Canada their home, who want to work or study here, or who want to visit, often because their families call Canada home and they want to reunite with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723017">Far too many people have been failed by IRCC, the department under the immigration minister's watch. People have been caught in some sort of weird purgatory, which has been inhumane while they are separated from their family or missing funerals to say their final goodbye to loved ones. I do not know if it is because of incompetence, ignorance or something else that is driving the immigration minister.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723018">Unlike the <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">immigration minister</Affiliation>, those in my office actually care about the integrity of Canada's legal and immigration systems and would never abuse our power to make a mockery of Canada's courts and the professional immigration staff by overruling a deportation order issued by our own department and upheld by the federal court to save a five-time criminally convicted foreign national who boasted of foreign financing to blockade Canadian roads and infrastructure, such as building pipelines. No wonder the government does not take the issue of foreign interference seriously when it is actively abetting it and saving those who are proudly boasting of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723019">How can we have a country where there is transparency, responsibility and accountability when we are protecting foreign nationals who are boasting of foreign interference? Under the <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">immigration minister</Affiliation>'s watch, and that of his predecessors, it is letting in ISIS terrorists, who are in videos dismembering the bodies of the victims they have murdered, and granting them citizenship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723020">I take the issue of immigration seriously because my parents were refugees who were welcomed to Canada at a time when other countries were closing their borders to people in need. I knew of no better way to honour that incredible act of compassion by Canada then, 40 years ago, than to serve. I volunteered to join the Navy nine and a half years ago because there is no better way than to give back and serve the very country that gave my family everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723021">Last year, during my honeymoon, my wife very kindly allowed us to take a detour to South Africa so I could meet with Canada's High Commissioner in Pretoria, because there also is racism there. Racism is perpetuated by locally employed staff hired by the department of immigration. People are perpetuating the injustices of apartheid in Canada's name, and it continues under the watch of the <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">immigration minister</Affiliation>. Nothing is being done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723022">There are Black doctors and nurses from South Africa who want to come here and help heal Canadians to relieve the backlog of patients and surgeries, which are so bad in British Columbia that they have to send Canadian patients to the U.S. What a shame and what a sham. They are being discriminated against, and that continues under this <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">immigration minister</Affiliation>'s watch.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723023"> This is why I have been so adamant in ensuring that we uphold the highest standards of Canada's legal and immigration systems. Again, this goes back to the heart of the issue that we have been debating in regards to SDTC because it is clear that, when we turn a blind eye to corruption, when we turn a blind eye to perhaps, at best, incompetence, we see what happens. We see how it permeates different departments in this country, and it is failing Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723024">I will use my last few moments to simply address a matter that was also raised with the <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">immigration minister</Affiliation>, which was when he attacked the competence of my staff. He said that my office never sent his department anything. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723025">Well, <Affiliation DbId="278244" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> should go back to his office to ask his team about the case that was escalated on September 14, 2024. He should ask his office about another case that was escalated to him on October 23, 2024. He should also ask his office about a more recent one, sent just last week, on November 13, 2024, about the Australian doctor I referenced during question period. This Australian doctor of Iranian heritage left the evil regime because she did not want to live under the gender apartheid regime. She went to Australia, got trained and wanted to come to Canada to help heal, but now she is stuck in IRCC purgatory. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723026">When the minister attacks the integrity and competence of my team, and he is pointing at us, he seems to forget that there are also fingers pointing back at him. He should ask his team: Did they intentionally keep it from him, or did they miss it? </ParaText>

The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has added more debt than all previous prime ministers before him, which threatens the sustainability of social programs and government services for future generations. We have seen it in the way the government has continually hiked taxes on Canadians and driven up inflation, to the point where people are struggling to fill their gas tanks, heat their homes or put food on the table. Of course, we also see it with the green slush fund scandal. The government has shown no regard for the massive amount of taxpayer money that was given out inappropriately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723063">Instead, the government has worked very hard to try to cover up its scandal and has refused to hand over the documents we mentioned, violating the collective privilege that we as parliamentarians have to order documents to be revealed. This privilege is a crucial function for ensuring that the legislative branch of government can meet one of its main objectives, which is holding the government accountable. I spoke about that just a couple weeks ago. With this privilege comes extraordinary powers to ensure the government cannot interfere with us meeting that objective, and it means the House can order all documents it deems necessary to carry out its duties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723064">As I noted previously, and will again for the benefit of government members, there is not a similar privilege afforded to the government to refuse an order for the production of documents. We are here debating this motion because the government seems to believe that it has such a privilege.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723065">I will re-emphasize to the government that in the Speaker's ruling, he noted:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The procedural precedents and authorities are abundantly clear. The House has the undoubted right to order the production of any and all documents from any entity or individual it deems necessary to carry out its duties.

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723067"> That was from the Speaker's ruling directly, just for clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723068">The Speaker also went on to quote page 985 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, third edition, which I will quote for the benefit of Liberal members of the House: “No statute or practice diminishes the fullness of that power rooted in House privileges unless there is an explicit legal provision to that effect, or unless the House adopts a specific resolution limiting the power.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723069">The House has never set a limit on its power to order the production of papers. I believe that is an important aspect. It is clear that the government is violating one of the collective privileges we have as members of the chamber. We are all sent here by residents in our own ridings from all corners of the country to make sure their voices are heard. The government is continuing to completely disregard that authority we have as members of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723070">We are also here because the government failed to protect the Canadian taxpayer. According to the Auditor General's report released on June 4, the government turned SDTC, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. She found that SDTC had awarded funding to projects that were ineligible and where conflicts of interest existed. In total, 123 million dollars' worth of contracts were found to have been given inappropriately, with $59 million being given to projects that should never have been awarded any money at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723071">I mentioned that the government seems so careless with money. Two million people in a single month are lined up at food banks. People are struggling just to afford basic necessities because of the inflationary policies caused by the government, yet $59 million has been given out to projects that should never have been awarded any money at all. I think that is staggering, and it shows that the government has no regard for the taxpayer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723072">I go back home to my riding and travel around northwestern Ontario, and nobody likes taxes; I think that is pretty clear. Maybe the Liberals and the NDP like taxes, but most people do not really appreciate paying taxes. When I talk to my constituents, they say that they have no problem chipping in their fair share if they know where it is going, and if it is going to go somewhere to help benefit their community and their country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723073">That is the big issue with the government; Liberals are raising taxes, and what are they doing with the money? They are funnelling it to Liberal insiders. They are taxing Canadians more, and Canadians are getting less as a result. It is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723074"> I want to get back to the Auditor General, because she discovered that conflicts of interest were connected to approval decisions. As a consequence, at the green slush fund, nearly $76 million of funding was awarded to projects where there was a connection to the Liberals' friends appointed to roles within Sustainable Development Technology Canada, while $12 million of funding was given to projects that were both ineligible and had conflicts of interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723075">In fact the Auditor General discovered that long-established conflict of interest policies were not followed in 90 cases. In one instance, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s hand-picked chair siphoned off $217,000 to her own company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723076">I believe that the Auditor General has made it very clear that the blame for the scandal lies directly at the feet of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s industry minister, who “did not sufficiently monitor” the contracts that were being awarded to Liberal insiders. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">industry minister</Affiliation> utterly failed in his duty to protect the Canadian taxpayer, but what else is new with the Liberal government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723077">There is much more, and I do not want to repeat too much of what members have already covered, but I do want to note for the record that if the government had managed taxpayer dollars responsibly, we would not be discussing a privilege motion here today. Of course if the government had handed over the documents, we would not be here debating the privilege motion. We could be discussing one of the many other issues that are impacting Canadians in their everyday lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723078">It is very important to note that only the government has the power to end the gridlock. If it complies with the House order to hand over all the documents related to the green slush fund, we can then get back to normal programming. Instead, the government is trying to protect itself and withhold what I would imagine is very damaging information. It must be very damaging information if the Liberals are willing to put their entire legislative agenda on hold.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723079">As I mentioned, we could be talking about everyday Canadians and the fact that we have a plan to axe the carbon tax to bring down the cost of living and make life more affordable for people who are struggling. We could be talking about our plan to remove the GST on new home builds or our plan to make housing more affordable and get young Canadians out of their parents' basements and realize the dream of home ownership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723080">We could be talking about our plan to stop the crime by bringing in jail, not bail for repeat violent offenders, fixing the broken bail system the government has created and ensuring that we can restore safe streets across the country. We could be talking about many issues impacting first nation communities and about reconciliation across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723081">All of these issues are tremendously important and require our attention, but the government would rather drag out the debate to prevent the documents from being released. I think that speaks for itself. It speaks to the fact that the government clearly has something to hide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723082"> It is also unfortunate that the incident is not an isolated one. Many members have mentioned this. It is a culture, a pattern, with the government. There has been scandal after scandal. Whenever one scandal is in the rear-view mirror, another one comes to light. We have talked about SNC-Lavalin of course, the WE Charity and the Bahamas vacation the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took. The list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723083">One scandal in particular that has come to light recently is the one involving the former minister of employment, workforce development and official languages, who is still sitting as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> but is no longer in cabinet. This is a very interesting one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723084">It has been reported that the member is tied to a lobbyist who received a staggering $110 million in federal contracts. He was the director of the company that received a further $8 million of government contracts. He is engulfed in allegations of fraud and wire fraud. He also tried to hide that he was getting payments from the lobbying firm while he was lobbying his own government and even sometimes his own ministry. However, he was caught by Global News, which reported this, thankfully, to highlight the issue for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723085">It does not stop there. As if that were not bad enough, earlier this month we found out that there were more text messages in addition to the ones obtained earlier, that showed a Randy, perhaps another Randy as the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> maintained. This Randy was in regular contact with his co-owner while he was the minister. It turns out that there is only one Randy, and we all know who it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723086">On top of all this, because again it does not stop there, the member made false claims about his own ancestry, pretending to be indigenous in order to advance his own business interests, hoping to use that as an opportunity to access government funding for his business. It is absolutely despicable for anyone, let alone a member of the government and a minister of the Crown, to do such a thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723087">Any one of those issues would have been serious enough for the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> to be fired from cabinet, but for some reason the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continued to show support right up until the point the former minister resigned in disgrace. It really makes one wonder what it takes for an unethical Liberal minister to be removed from cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723088">I guess the problem is there are too many ethical scandals on the other side. The Liberals would have to get rid of almost the entire cabinet at this rate, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Again, I highlight the issue because although it is not directly related to the SDTC green slush fund scandal, it is important to note that there is a repeated pattern with the government.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723089">Coming back to the last issue, as the member for Kenora, I represent 42 first nations. I also represent part of the Métis homeland in northwestern Ontario. The scandal that I just highlighted with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> particularly hits home for residents in my riding. Roughly half of my riding is indigenous. We know that first nations and indigenous people across the country experience a number of challenges and that a number of well-intentioned programs have been created to help rectify some of the past wrongs. To have a minister of the Crown use that to his advantage, to fake indigenous ancestry, is something that is especially concerning and disgraceful. That is what I have heard in my riding from residents, both indigenous and non-indigenous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723090">I have lots of questions about the priorities of the government. We have seen in the case of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has continued to stand up for him, to have his back. However, if we look at past Liberal ministers, taking Jody Wilson-Raybould as an example, she is an indigenous woman who spoke the truth and was punished. She was removed from cabinet and kicked right out of caucus. The question I know a lot of people have is why the government is so quick to remove an indigenous woman from its benches when she speaks the truth and also so quick to support a non-indigenous man pretending to be indigenous and trying to advance his own interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723091"> It is perplexing to me that no members on that side seem to be asking that question. I would think they would also want to know. Maybe they do not care. I would like to think that they do, that they would take issue with this, but it does not seem that they do. These are very serious allegations. It is incredible to me that it has become normalized on that side of the House that one would use a ministerial position to advance one's own interests and even go as far as doing what Jody Wilson-Raybould described as “play[ing] ancestry wheel of fortune.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723092">There is much more I could go on about, but it is very important to note that this green slush fund scandal really is just one domino in a series of events of ethically challenged Liberal governance. It is very important to know that we could get back to debating the issues everyday Canadians are facing if the government were to comply with the House order, if it was able to show some transparency. It is supposed to be transparent by default, but that really has not worked out. The government must hand over the documents instead of trying to cover this up. It is unacceptable that it has paralyzed the House for two months instead of doing what was ordered and that it is preventing us from addressing the many issues this country is facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723093">I want Canadians across the country who may be watching at home to know that this really is not how a government should be run. A government should not be caught up in scandal after scandal, improperly spending taxpayer dollars, trying to cover it up or rewarding insiders. That is why Conservatives will keep fighting to get to the bottom of this scandal. Canadians deserve to know what is in those documents, and those who broke the law should be prosecuted. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723094">Above all, it is clear that the government is not worth the cost or the corruption, and only Conservatives will take action to clean up this mess. It is time for a carbon tax election so that Canadians can elect a common-sense Conservative government that will end the corruption, axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime and get things back on track for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>

In fact, he has fundraised with residential school denialists, the Frontier Centre, that ran campaigns in Saskatchewan denying residential schools. I have also had to call points of order on other Conservative members who likened indigenous backgrounds to criminality, something they changed in the Hansard over.

              <ParaText id="8723118"> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about this SDTC scandal and nearly $400 million of taxpayer funds corruptly directed to companies and the board members, all appointed by the Liberal minister at the time, profited directly. These were companies they controlled or were actively participating in. We are talking about $290 million. It is an incredible amount of money. We could have axed the carbon tax for a lot of residents in Alberta for that price, or in Ontario, in his riding of Kenora, for years. They would have netted out more money. We could have built some homes by reducing the GST on new builds under a million bucks. We could have fixed more of the budget by reducing the deficit. We could have stopped some crime, including the crime of obtaining a brand-new passport after being ordered by a court not to have one. These Liberals allowed a known convicted human trafficker to get a brand-new passport from passport Canada despite the fact that a court had ordered he not have one.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723120">Mr. Speaker, we can take our pick. Of course, as I mentioned in my remarks, the debate itself is about the government handing over the documents, but it could have prevented all of that in the first place by just managing taxpayer funds effectively. When I go door to door, when I speak to residents across northwestern Ontario and beyond, we hear time and time again that people are looking for change. They are looking for a plan to bring down the cost of living by axing the tax, a plan to build more homes, as the member for Calgary Shepard mentioned, by reducing the GST on new home builds and helping speed up building permits. We have a number of common-sense proposals Canadians are excited about, and they want us to be here debating those issues. Unfortunately, the Liberals will not let us, because they are too busy trying to cover up their own corruption.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723125">My colleague before me lamented the fact that he had to speak twice on this. I will add to the lament, as this is my third time rising, because the government is not listening to ordinary Canadians as they are represented in this chamber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723126">Before I get into the substance of my speech, I want to take a moment to recognize the efforts of 40 extraordinary Canadians, for that is truly what ordinary Canadians are, for bringing the peace train to Ottawa two nights ago. MPs from a cross-section of this chamber, representing a cross-section of philosophical paths to peace, from our military veterans and peacekeepers to our peaceniks, all agreed on the message represented by the peace train participants: that Canada should do more for peace in our world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723133">In other words, the government does not have to report back to the House if it actually complies with the ruling of the Speaker's office. At issue, of course, is the Auditor General's finding that the Liberal appointees gave 400 million tax dollars to their own companies, involving 186 conflicts of interest. This is about 400 million wasted taxpayer dollars while Canadians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723134">The NDP-Liberals must end the cover-up and make the unredacted documents available, as ordered by the Speaker, so Parliament can get back to working for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723135">Let us review a few of the facts. The Speaker ruled that the NDP-Liberals violated a House order to turn over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation of the latest Liberal $400-million scandal, but why the cover-up? Why would they allow Parliament to be incapacitated rather than address the issues that Canadians really and truly care about, like the doubling of housing costs, food inflation, crime and chaos?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723136">On the crime front, the government has made a mockery of our justice system. Terri-Lynne McClintic, who abducted, and then assisted her boyfriend in the sexually motivated killing of, eight-year-old Tori Stafford in 2009 was allowed to be in the presence of children through a mother-child program at a women's federal penitentiary. It is hard to even fathom. Where is the accountability? I spoke so much about accountability in my previous two interventions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723137"> Time after time, the government has revictimized victims, just as it did when it allowed Paul Bernardo to be moved out of a maximum-security facility. The government created the problem by passing Bill <Document DbId="10078426" Type="3">C-83</Document>, which ensures that even the worst of the worst, like Paul Bernardo, Luka Magnotta and Terri-Lynne McClintic, must be incarcerated in the least restrictive environment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723138">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has unleashed a wave of crime across the country with disastrous policies like Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which took away mandatory jail for violent crime and allowed sex offenders to serve their sentences in the same home as their victims, under house arrest. Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> also made it easier for repeat violent offenders to be given bail. While the Liberals are concerned about heinous criminals being given a less restrictive environment, Canadians suffer the consequences of unrestricted crime and chaos. Again, the victims of crime are revictimized.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723139"> The government must be held to account for its failures. It has allowed Parliament to be paralyzed by its refusal to be transparent about the SDTC documents. Its own self-interest supersedes all other issues in their minds. Refusing to hand over the documents is an affront to Parliament. What is so bad that the government would go to such lengths to hide it?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723140">Why would the government not instead focus on the food inflation it has caused? Food bank use has doubled. Wholesale food prices in Canada have risen 36% faster than wholesale food prices in the U.S., a gap that has opened up since the introduction of the carbon tax. Sadly, now there are two million people lined up to feed themselves and their families at food banks. Our economy is teetering on the brink, but the worst is yet to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723141">The coalition government voted for and legislated the quadrupling of the carbon tax to 61¢ a litre. In Ontario alone, Feed Ontario revealed last September, a record one million people visited a food bank in 2024. This is a dramatic increase of the 25% from the previous year, with Feed Ontario's CEO telling the media, “I never thought I would see this day”. She went on to say that she had been with the organization for almost 15 years and never thought it would see this level of demand. She cannot believe it has reached a point where the numbers are so dramatically high. However, the Liberals seem oblivious to the suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723142">In a parliamentary democracy, Parliament is supreme. If a citizen finds a certain law repugnant, their only option is to mobilize a change in Parliament, for example by campaigning in favour of a certain issue, by joining a political party or by standing for office, such that Parliament changes that law. Citizens who disagree with the law of this land and believe that their rights have been violated can push for political change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723143">The rule of law is crucial in a democracy because it ensures that everyone, including government officials, is subject to the law. Key points about the rule of law in a democracy include equality before the law regardless of social status, checks on power, and holding the government accountable, which is a fundamental point in the rule of law. Other key points are the protection of rights; social sustainability, where citizens trust the law will be applied fairly; and economic development. A strong rule of law fosters a predictable business environment, encouraging investment and economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723144">It is evident that the government believes that it is above the law and above the sovereignty of the chamber. Holding leaders accountable for serious wrongdoings is a hallmark of democracy. That is why we are here today. Again I ask, where are the documents? What is in them that is making the Liberals so afraid of the Canadian public's finding out?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723145"> To the matter at hand, let us talk for a moment about what the Sustainable Development Technology Canada fund could have done with respect to research and innovation, and in particular, for a moment, with the energy sector. If colleagues would please indulge me, I will come back to the direct issue of the corruption at hand in a moment. I have often talked about this next sequence in round tables at town halls that I host.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723146"> If we think back to the creation, development and increase of wealth in our western world, it has largely mirrored the increase and the densification of our energy. When we came out of the caves, we kept ourselves warm and heated our food with wood. Over time we moved to charcoal and coal and on to fossil fuels. Today we have nuclear energy. Potentially tomorrow we will have hydrogen. Each one of these sources of energy has come with its own set of environmental consequences. As we have moved to a new path to that densification of energy, we have found ways of reducing and eventually removing, hopefully, environmental consequences.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723147"> There is a question I often ask when I am hosting round tables. We often hear the opposition speak of fossil fuels, their use and a hope for the day of peak oil. Here is my question: When did the world achieve peak coal? I do not mean the metallurgical coal we need for steelmaking. When did the world hit peak use of thermal coal?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723148">I often ask this question at home, and I get responses from my constituents. Some say it was probably during the 1870s, during the Industrial Revolution. Maybe it was in the roaring twenties in the lead-up to the great crash, or more recently, after the green revolution of the 1970s. However, our world hit peak coal, the record use of fossil fuels in the form of coal, in 2023, and we are going to break that record this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723149">Why is that important? Coal has twice the greenhouse gas emissions of liquefied natural gas. If Canada truly wanted to address greenhouse gas emissions that had a material effect on the world, we would be championing the sale and use of our clean and ethically produced liquid natural gas. We had 15 projects on the books 10 years ago. That is not what the government has done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723150">We have had the world come asking for that energy. Instead, the government has introduced a carbon tax, and while it might make someone feel good by patting themselves on the back that they are doing something, Canada produces 1.5% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723151">Weather and climate are a worldwide phenomenon. If we wanted to impact greenhouse gas emissions on a worldwide scale, we could. A carbon tax is not going to do it. We could, not as an end goal a century out but as an interim step, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from a material perspective and fund our own wealth as we transition our economy over to even more environmentally benign technologies. That is what we could be doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723152">There was a fund set up to direct energy, investment and innovation in that direction. The Auditor General took a look at it back in 2017 and that fund was working well then. However, here we are today. I will end in a few minutes after already speaking for an hour to the corruption that has come from the government, but I will note that if we wanted to do something, that is where the fund could truly be making a difference. Instead, we are here talking about corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723153">I have spoken at great length in the House about the lack of accountability and about the endemic corruption of the government. There was a lack of accountability by the former employment minister. After months of Conservative prosecution, he finally resigned. There have been allegations of fraud, of being involved in a private business while sitting at the cabinet table and of fake indigenous claims, and they were not enough to remove him from cabinet for months. Why is this behaviour seemingly endemic in the government?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723154">Earlier this week, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> defended the former minister and claimed, “I'm happy that he is continuing to lead on issues around jobs and employment and represent Alberta in our government.” It is now clear that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew about the crime and corruption the other Randy was engaged in the entire time. That was not enough to remove him. He knew about the double identity but chose to look the other way. The Prime Minister knew that the member for <Affiliation DbId="278761" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> was operating his own business while sitting at the cabinet table.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723155">Members may remember that the former minister had the nerve to testify that the Randy referenced in texts was not him but another Randy who just happened to work at the company he has a 50% ownership stake in. His business partner has refuted these claims, stating now that he was the only Randy who worked at that company. I guess he thought if the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was backing him, he could get away with it. After all, the Liberals have gotten away with a litany of scandals over their rocky nine-year tenure in government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723156">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knew he was falsely claiming to be indigenous to steal money from indigenous people. After firing a legitimate indigenous justice minister for upholding the rule of law in Canada against his wishes, the Prime Minister decided to protect a corrupt, fake indigenous minister. There is a double standard when it comes to the Liberals: They expect the rest of us to be responsible for our actions, but they are not accountable for theirs. Everything from Frank Baylis and the $273-million scandal to the former minister Navdeep Bains getting an executive position at Rogers after the government green-lit the Rogers-Shaw merger.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723157">It is unconscionable. Every member of the House of Commons swears an oath to uphold the democratic institution of Parliament. Parliament is the foundation our nation was founded upon; it is a firm and solid base. As we come here to work every day, we are witnessing the rebuilding of Centre Block. The government is spending between $4.5 billion and $5 billion in part to provide a firm and solid foundation under that national treasure.</ParaText>

Our security in a democracy is the firm foundation that our country was built upon. It provides the stability upon which we stand. When a democratic government rules as if it were a dictatorship, the supremacy and the stability of Parliament is lost. Freedom is not free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723161">Over 118,000 Canadians have died in military service for our country to keep this “land glorious and free”, a predominant line in our national anthem. It is time the government adhere to the principle of the rule of law in Canada. The fundamental principle of the rule of law means that everyone is subject to the same laws and no one is above the law. The rule of law is based on the idea that laws should be applied fairly and equally to all people, regardless of their power, wealth or societal position. It is time to restore accountability and democratic freedom in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723162">Conservatives will continue to hold this government accountable and demand that the documents be released in an unredacted form.

I see that as an opportunity to cut spending. That money could be used to build social housing.</ParaText>

Now, this would not be forever. That is actually a practical, common-sense approach that would enrich Canada rather than bankrupting it while being able to fund the transition to even greener fuels. Instead we have a tax. That is the plan, and that is the plan the Conservatives say no to; we will axe the tax, and we will fund sustainable technologies in the future.</ParaText>

At this time of year, with the weather just above the freezing point, snow does not last very long as snow. It is quickly turned into slush. As Wikipedia tells us, “Slush, also called slush ice, is a slurry mixture of small ice crystals...and liquid water. In the natural environment, slush forms when ice or snow melts or during mixed precipitation. This often mixes with dirt and other pollutants on the surface, resulting in a gray or muddy brown color.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723204">Strangely, Wikipedia makes no mention of green slush, though I suppose we could make green slush by adding a little food colouring. If we did, it would still be slush, which “often goes through multiple freeze/thaw cycles before being able to completely drain and disappear.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723205"> The Liberals are desperately hoping someone or something will make their green slush fund drain and disappear. For that to happen, though, they have to be willing to accede to the will of this House and produce the documents that were requested in unredacted form. I understand they do not want to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723206">The Auditor General uncovered many instances of apparent corruption. Releasing the documents would allow us to determine whether there were more. One would think a government that was honest would want to do that. Failing to release the documents makes it look like the Liberals have something to hide. Maybe it is the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. Maybe it is one or more of the ministers. Where there is the smell of corruption, it seems safe to say there is corruption somewhere. We have the smell. What is making the stink? What might the corruption look like?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723207">One of the supposedly shining lights in the Liberal plan to fight climate change was Sustainable Development Technology Canada, or SDTC, a foundation the Liberals created to fund new clean technologies. Their desire was to tackle climate change through Canadian innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723208">It was a good goal and well intentioned. It looked like a good idea. Who could argue against this concept? We all understand the need to fight climate change, and Canadians should be world leaders in developing new technology. We have the know-how, but those with the brain power sometimes need help bringing their ideas to fruition. However, what this great turned into, apparently, was a Liberal slush fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723209">Merriam-Webster provides us with three definitions for what constitutes a slush fund. It can be, “a fund raised from the sale of refuse to obtain small luxuries or pleasures for a warship's crew”. Certainly, when the Liberals are involved, there is a lot of refuse. However, I doubt if anyone would be willing to pay for their excrement, so we should turn to the other definitions. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8723210"> A slush fund can also be “a fund for bribing public officials or carrying on corruptive propaganda”. I think this hits closer to the mark, though the public officials appear to be unelected party insiders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723211"> One could say it was used for corruptive propaganda, though. The Liberals talked about climate change and the great things that would be done by SDTC. It turns out the Liberals' plan to fight climate change was anchored in the idea of giving money to their friends. No wonder they do not want to release the documents that will show the full extent of their corruption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723212"> Merriam-Webster's final definition of a slush fund also seems appropriate: “an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes”. Certainly, no member opposite could really believe it is right to reward Liberal insiders with million-dollar contracts without public scrutiny. Do they believe the public is being served by this conflict of interest? Are they so self-righteous that they believe the means justify the ends as long as they are Liberal ends? Apparently they do or they would stop this sham and release the documents. They would rather tie up the House than do the right thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723213">I was raised in a country that believes in honour. I have always known the importance of doing the right thing, the honourable thing. A person is judged by their actions, by whether they do the right thing, and not just when it is convenient. To act incorrectly and be less than honourable brings shame on a person, their family, their friends and their nation. A person would rather die than act shamefully. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723214">Apparently, this is not true in Canada anymore, as we see from the government. When I look across the aisle and see the faces of the Liberal members, I have to ask whether their sense of honour is gone. Each and every one of them, I am sure, came to this House wanting to do the right thing for the good of the country. Somehow, they have lost their sense of honour and are taking part in shameful acts. They are complicit in a cover-up. They are aiding and abetting possible criminal activity. They are disrespecting the will of the House of Commons and the order of the Speaker. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723215">They sit there and do not even feel shame. If they did, they would come into the chamber with paper bags over their heads to conceal their faces from the people of Canada, whose trust they have betrayed. It saddens me to see them, those people who once had the ideal of serving the country, and see how far they have fallen. They have lost their honour and shamed not only themselves and their families but the constituents they were elected to serve. The longer they continue this cover-up, the more shameful their actions become. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723216">There is a way out of this, of course. The Liberals can regain their lost honour. They can tell the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the ministers to stop the cover-up, do the right thing and release the documents. Somehow, though it saddens me to say it, I do not see the members opposite having the courage to do that, which is why we have to debate the motion before us today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723217">It is important the people of Canada know that the government is trying to conceal wrongdoing. The $400 million may seem insignificant to the Liberal government that has, in nine years, more than doubled Canada's national debt and is handing out such sums to the Liberal insiders. Violating the rules is apparently business as usual for the Liberals. It is not business as usual for the Canadian people who are being carbon-taxed to death. It is not business as usual for the record number of people visiting Canada's food banks each month. With that money, how many people could we feed? Canadians are appalled that money that was supposed to fight climate change was instead used to line Liberal pockets. The Liberals cannot deny it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723218">The corruption was so bad they had to shut down their green slush fund. I do not think any member there will deny what I am saying. Earlier this year, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> explained the Liberals' new climate strategy. Canadians who are worried about feeding their children are being short-sighted, he says. Apparently, he thinks it is morally selfish to be concerned about feeding their children, better they should starve to death for the good of the planet. It is easy to take the moral high road when he was born into privilege and the only food bank he has ever seen was as a visiting politician. That is not the real world most Canadians experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723219">It is more important that we in the House show Canadians there is still honour in this land, and that graft, greed and corruption will not be rewarded. Politicians at any level of government should not be allowed to hide corruption and wasteful spending. It seems to me that for those who are inviting mob rules, the day will come when the people will say they have had enough with politicians who do not understand that their role is to serve, not to reward their friends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723220">The member for <Affiliation DbId="278460" Type="2">Calgary Rocky Ridge</Affiliation> has proposed what I see as a reasonable subamendment to the amendment to the amended motion. It takes into account the possibility, however remote it may seem, that the government fully complies with the order from the Speaker of June 10. If the Liberals were to do this, if they were to show respect for the Speaker and the House, there would be no need to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Adopting this subamendment could save the committee time in the unlikely event the Liberals decide to do the right thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723221">When will the Liberals realize they have no right to overrule the Speaker and the will of the House? The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has expressed his admiration for the way dictatorships can get things done, so it is understandable that he wishes to ignore those who do not see things his way. Someone needs to tell him that no matter how much he wishes it was, Canada is not a dictatorship. He and his party are supposed to respect the rule of the law, even if they do not like it. Maybe, given his famous math skills about balancing budgets and small deficits, and his unwillingness to think about fiscal policy, the Prime Minister has become confused.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8723223">However, it was not one or two; it was 186 incidents of corruption. That is not a mistake, someone forgetting to recuse themself once or twice, not realizing that there was a conflict. It is a systematic failure, one that has cost taxpayers $400 million so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723224">Only if the documents are released as ordered can we find out whether the problem is bigger than that and the corruption runs deeper. If there is no wrongdoing, what are the Liberals afraid of? The only reason not to comply with the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s order is that they know the real numbers are much worse and the corruption is much more widespread than they have already admitted. No wonder they do not want the police involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723225">In not complying with the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s order, the Liberals are paralyzing Parliament, preventing it from doing other important work, not that they are willing to admit it. “It is not our fault” is what we hear. They tell anyone who will listen that it is the fault of the evil opposition that will not allow them to get away with covering up the corruption. They do not know why it has to be so mean to them. We hear that all the time, every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723226">Canadians deserve to know the details about who profited from the $400-million scandal. The money did not come out of the pockets of members on the other side. Liberal donors did not offer it as donations. The money came from taxpayers, from people wondering whether they can afford to heat their house this winter and put groceries on the table. For Canadians, $400 is a big deal, but $400 million is beyond their imagination. It is no wonder the Liberals think they can get away with it. They think people will not believe how corrupt they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723227">After nine years of the Liberal government, the scandals are too many to list. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> leads by example with his multiple ethics violations. It is no wonder so many of his ministers have difficulties determining right from wrong, something we have seen again and again in the past week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723228">Canadians are sick and tired of the arrogance and the paternalism the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal government have shown. Apparently, the Liberals know best about everything, and anyone who disagrees with them is just too ignorant to understand. That would explain why the Prime Minister would suggest that Canadian parents should let their children go hungry in the name of serving the planet, even if there is no proof that any of his policies will have any appreciable effect on climate change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8723229">Those of us who live in the real world know it is time for the government to do the right thing. The people living in Liberal fantasyland will continue their efforts to paralyze the House and perpetuate the cover-up. I for one do not believe that participating in a cover-up of the mismanagement of public funds is the honourable thing. I would be ashamed to be part of it.</ParaText>

Today, the Canadian consumer confidence index is at a 30-month high. Inflation, from its peak in June 2022, has come down to 2%, which is at the lower end of the Bank of Canada's preferred target range.
